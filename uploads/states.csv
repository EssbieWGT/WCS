Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerAfter nearly 15 years working in the food industry, Deven Bora, owner of Early Bird Catering in Colchester, has been handed an unexpected opportunity: filming a pilot episode for Eat This TV, an online network featuring culinary content. The chef has now launched a GoFundMe hoping to bring the project to life. The 30-year-old started his journey in the food industry at age 16, working in a fast-food restaurant. At first, he was just trying to earn some money, but as he continued working at sandwich and bagel shops, restaurants like Applebee’s and Buffalo Wild Wings, and catering events, he became more interested in the industry.“I got to either decide to finish college, or I got to go in a different direction, which was take the experience that I did have, working in the food industry and try and make something of that. So that’s the path I went down,” he said.That’s when Bora started the Community Kitchen Academy, a nine-week course to learn culinary skills, including fundamentals of food safety and sanitation, labeling and repurposing food to avoid waste.Community Kitchen Academy tries to gather produce from grocery stores, farms and food service companies to prevent waste, and after students have used the ingredients to prepare meals, the academy distributes them to shelters and meal sites.A study conducted by the University of Vermont in 2022 showed that 2 in 5 Vermonters experienced food insecurity. “It was kind of nice that I was able to have that opportunity but also give back to the community,” Bora said.In March 2022, Bora decided to start a catering business. He began by catering for small events, like bachelorette parties and family dinners, while working at Goodwater Brewery. Then he was subcontracted to provide meals for local army bases, allowing him to focus on his business full time and open a physical location in Colchester.Chef Deven Bora of Early Bird Catering in Colchester on Friday, June 6, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerEarly Bird Catering specializes in various cuisines, including Italian, Greek, American and Mexican dishes. Bora also uses seasonal produce from local farms whenever possible.“We’ve started featuring a fall seasonal menu for weddings this year,” he said. “For the months of August through October, we have specifically catered menus that are highlighting the best of available products and produce for those months in Vermont.”When he received a call from Eat This TV asking him to participate in a pilot episode for the show, Bora said he was surprised. “I didn’t sign up for anything, so I didn’t know if it was just like a spam call kind of thing,” he said. But after learning more about the network and the pilot opportunity, he got excited.While the network will cover production costs, Bora is financially responsible for the renting the test kitchen, the ingredients for his dishes, and travel and lodging costs during the episode’s filming in New York. “I felt that the GoFundMe was the easiest way to help raise some of this money,” Bora said. “I really want to make the opportunity happen.” If the pilot receives good ratings, Bora said, the network might ask him to develop a 12-episode series.Bora has until the beginning of July to raise enough money and confirm his participation in the program. In the meantime, he is already thinking about the recipes he wants to use in the 30-minute pilot. He is certain that he wants the dishes to showcase some Vermont ingredients and products. “I thought if I got the opportunity, it would be a great way to just kind of tie where I’m from into it and make it a little more special,” Bora said. “That way, in the pilot episode, I can kind of pay a little homage to Vermont.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont chef launches fundraiser to bring local flavors to online food show.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/deven-bora-1-20250606-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-06-08 07:00:41.277523

As the creator of the comic “Dykes to Watch Out For” and memoir-turned-Broadway-musical “Fun Home,” Alison Bechdel understands why readers of her new graphic novel, “Spent,” may think it’s autobiographical.The main character is a cartoonist named Alison who sketches works such as “Lesbian PETA Members to Watch Out For” when she isn’t wrestling with the same questions dogging the artist drawing her.“How is she supposed to sit here writing a book when the world hangs by a thread?” asks an opening panel of the novel.But within the 272 pages of fiction is one fact: Both the real and make-believe Alison love the state they’re in.“Vermont plays a big role in this book,” Bechdel told a crowd in Norwich this past week at the start of a regional publicity tour. “It’s almost like a character that, in so many ways, has made my life and work possible.”Bechdel, 64, has journeyed from underground press to mainstream success since moving to what she calls the “cerulean blue” Green Mountains at 30. She sparked the term “Bechdel test” in 1985 to see whether a creative work has at least two women talking about something other than a man. She won a $625,000 MacArthur “genius” grant in 2014, and saw “Fun Home” win the Tony Award for best musical in 2015.Bechdel and her wife, artist Holly Rae Taylor, were cooped up in their Bolton home during the pandemic when the cartoonist began brainstorming her latest book.Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDigger“It felt like money was really at the root of all of the really serious problems facing us — the climate, technology, homelessness, addiction, polarization — so I thought maybe I could solve them all by writing a scathingly self-critical memoir about capitalism,” she said.Bechdel piled up texts such as Karl Marx’s three-volume opus on economic theory.“I suddenly realized it would be much more fun to write a book about a cartoonist named Alison who’s trying to write a memoir about capitalism,” she said.“Spent” opens with the protagonist roaming around Burlington. At the Onion River Co-op, she scans shelves of oat milk, goat milk and stoat milk. Near the airport, she shutters at the “VROOSH!” sound of a Vermont National Guard F-35 fighter jet as a tourism poster for flaming fall foliage promises “No Need for LSD.”Moving on to Montpelier, characters from Bechdel’s “Dykes to Watch Out For” are pictured cleaning up from the past two summers of record rainfall.“This is the second ‘hundred-year’ flood since I was a kid,” a college student tells a friend amid signs for downtown’s Charlie-O’s bar and Bear Pond Books.Later in St. Johnsbury, the pair stage a climate protest at the Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium. “Two were arrested for throwing ginger black currant kombucha,” a radio station announces shortly after.Back at the main character’s home, author and activist Bill McKibben makes a cartoon cameo on roller skis. Finally at a nearby farmers market, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and U.S. Rep. Becca Balint browse booths for “Vermont maple CBD beard oil” and “free range, pasture-raised, certified humane, non-GMO, local, AI-free” eggs.All that said, the self-billed “comic novel” isn’t kid stuff.“There’s sex in the book, gratuitous nudity, pickleball, polyamory,” Bechdel cautioned her audience.That didn’t stop 200 people from filling every seat at the Norwich event and similar programs selling out this month in Burlington, Hardwick and Montpelier.Reviews are equally enthusiastic.“If these characters are sad and bewildered by the state of the world, their frustration feels like a reassurance to readers who share it, and perhaps a gentle reminder that it’s easy to confuse being socially conscious with being self-serious,” the New York Times wrote.The Washington Post praised the book’s “charming, funny, sincere portrait of a Vermont community.”“The veneer of fiction gives Bechdel that much more permission to go broad as she takes aim at the proclivities of lefty Vermonters, herself included, who long to reclaim their old activist passions but can’t quite escape the comforts of Burlington and its environs,” the Post wrote.In a story titled “What Is Alison Bechdel’s Secret?” The Atlantic noted that “the cartoonist has spent a lifetime worrying. In a new graphic novel, she finds something like solace.”Bechdel cautiously agrees.“By the end of the book, Alison is finally able to actually be in the moment,” the author said. “She starts to notice little details — little newts, little fiddleheads — until her watch alarm goes off.”Bechdel pointed to her drawing of its ironic, interrupting digital message: “Reduce stress by taking time to reflect.”“Despite all of my serious worries about the state of the world right now, I also feel weirdly hopeful,” Bechdel said. “Maybe this onslaught we’re experiencing is what it takes for us to finally achieve enough solidarity to turn things around.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Alison Bechdel’s new graphic novel illustrates the comic side of Vermont.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/VTD-Alison-Bechdel-1-1024x786.jpg,,,2025-06-08 07:00:41.277523

According to Devin Colman, the director of the historic preservation program at the University of Vermont, bells on farms served a similar purpose to those we might find in a church belfry or a schoolhouse: communication.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Hinesburg house really rings a bell.","Howdy Russell outside his bell-topped Hinesburg home, where he also maintains the beautiful gardens. Photo by Briana Brady/The CitizenThis story by Briana Brady was first published in The Citizen on June 5.Howard Russell — Howdy, to his family — hasn’t rung the bell at the top of his Hinesburg house in years. The rope rotted at some point in the last decade, but Russell said that, soon, someone is coming to trim the maple tree beside the house, and they’re going to replace the rope.The bell may ring again.Russell, 71, and his six siblings grew up in the house, which, as of this year, is 200 years old and sits on Route 116 directly across the street from the town hall. It has been in his family, he estimated, for seven or eight generations.Although he hasn’t rung it for a while, he remembers the bell — perched at the apex of the roof, right next to the chimney — ringing all the time when he was a kid.“When you heard that bell ring, you came home. That was the rule, that no matter where you are. If you’re on the hill, if you’re down the street playing with your friends, you hear the bell, you come home,” Russell said. “It was what made my parents confident that we could go away and that when they needed us back, we would come back.”That may not be too far off from its original intention. Russell’s family hasn’t just owned the house since the 19th century, they’ve also been farming the land behind it. While for much of that time, it was dairy farm, most recently, it’s been known as Trillium Hill Farm, an organic vegetable farm owned by Russell’s nephew and his wife, James and Sara Donegan.According to Devin Colman, the director of the historic preservation program at the University of Vermont, bells on farms served a similar purpose to those we might find in a church belfry or a schoolhouse: communication.“It’s this mechanism of letting people know the time when people didn’t have wrist watches and smartphones and all of our modern conveniences,” Colman said.The bell, the house, the farm — Colman, who previously worked as Vermont’s State Architectural Historian for 18 years, said that these objects and spaces that we associate with Vermont’s farming history are often inextricable from family history.“There is a lot of pride of ownership and multi-generational occupancy of the homestead or the land or in the community,” he said.For Russell, multi-generational occupancy hasn’t just meant holding on to the house and the farm through the years, it’s also meant bringing together different generations of the family under one roof.Russell’s grandmother lived upstairs when he was growing up. Then, when he bought the home from his mother decades ago, he renovated the upstairs, making it more of a separate apartment. Now, he and his partner, Paul, live upstairs, while the Donegans, whom Russell has since sold the house to, live downstairs with their daughter.“It’s always been an upstairs-downstairs house, you know? And when she was really little, her parents knew that if they had to go somewhere, they would just check with us,” Russell said. “It was just easy and natural. It was delightful for me. I don’t have any grandkids, so having a grandniece was like having a grandkid.”Many of the longstanding family farms in Vermont, like Trillium Hill, are still operational, and people still live in the houses. Because of that, historic preservation often looks a little different than preserving a building or an object for a museum.“There’s always this sort of push and pull of honoring the history, but also updating for 21st-century life, which is inherent to any historic property, not just farmsteads. And usually, it’s just a matter of thinking carefully about it and finding the right balance,” Colman said.In renovating the house, Russell said maintaining historic elements of the interior was not front of mind — the floors weren’t in great shape and the walls needed to be insulated. However, upstairs, he uncovered the wooden beams holding up the house. They had been hidden behind plaster and, when revealed, provided a glimpse of the past in an updated, livable space.“You can see more of the bones of the house now than you could before we started,” he saidWhen it comes to maintaining the land, Russell said his entire family has been intentional. His mother, before she died, gave the land to him and his siblings, and they’ve conserved most of it with Vermont Land Trust. Some of it also went to the next generation — Russell said it depended on who was interested in stewarding the land. The Donegans bought the part they’ve been farming.“We all love this land. We know every part of it, and the next generation in our family knows every part of it. They know the nooks and crannies,” Russell said. “The bottom line is, it’s more important to us that this land stay open and in agricultural use than whether the next generation gets equal, divvied up amounts.”There are other things they’ve maintained, less tangible things like community. Russell said that, during maple sugaring season, the family still gets together to collect sap traditionally, with a horse drawn cart and tin buckets. He said there are people in town who aren’t related who still come to help with the sugaring every year.It’s not so different from the way he depicts the house as a hub for kids in town during his childhood. He describes his parents as having had an open-door policy — everybody used to come and hang out at the house. Nobody knocked. And like the Russell kids, they knew that when they heard the bell, they needed to head home too.Coleman said, for him, uncovering these family histories and the stories of the land often starts with observing the world around and asking why. Why, for example, is there a bell on the top of that house in the middle of town?Read the story on VTDigger here:  Hinesburg house really rings a bell.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/hinesburg-house.jpg,,,2025-06-08 07:00:41.277523

O. Williams Hall on the campus of the Southern University Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Baton Rouge. (Photo courtesy Southern University)Outgoing LSU President William Tate, the first Black president of any SEC school, is calling for more investment in Southern University in a new paper analyzing the financial disparities between Louisiana’s two land-grant universities. 
The analysis was written by Tate and Keena Arbuthnot, dean of LSU’s Graduate School, who is also Black, and published in the William & Mary Law Review. 
“Our financial risk analysis suggests that Southern University’s financial situation warrants monitoring and more importantly, investment,” the authors write.
Tate and Arbuthnot’s article builds on a 2023 letter from former President Joe Biden’s administration to 16 states with both predominantly white and historically Black land-grant universities, informing the states they have not lived up to their federal funding requirements and asking them to find ways to ease the disparity. 
The letter to then Gov. John Bel Edwards alleged Louisiana had shortchanged Southern University $1.2 billion over 30 years. 
Land grant universities were established in the 19th century by states that received federal property to create schools with a focus on teaching agriculture, science, engineering and military science. The first round of land grant universities, including LSU, were created in 1862. 
States that would not admit Black students to their land grant universities were required in 1890 to set up separate schools, which in theory should have been funded at an equal level. Louisiana did not want to integrate LSU, so Southern University was designated as a land grant institution. The schools receive additional federal benefits, but states must match certain funds with state dollars — a requirement that has not always been met. 
LSU’s endowment at the end of the 2020-21 school year was over $700 million, while Southern’s was around $12 million, a difference of more than $20,000 per student. LSU’s total research expenditures in 2020-21 were around $230 million, while Southern’s were just over $7 million. 
Between 2018-21, six of the 19 historically Black land-grant universities have received state matching money for federal dollars, as required by federal law. One of these schools was Southern. No predominantly white land-grant university had a problem getting the matching state funds they were owed.
Tate and Arbuthnot’s analysis take into account not just the requirements put to the states under the Morrill Acts, which created the land grant university system, but also the defunding of higher education during former Gov. Bobby Jindal’s administration. From 2008-18, Louisiana’s per student spending for higher education dropped 38%, with only Arizona having a more extreme funding reduction during that period. 
“The disinvestment in higher education impacted LSU’s financial health over the time horizon of our analysis, and the university experienced increased financial risk,” the two wrote. “The financial risk status of both universities is inconsistent with the expansive opportunity agenda associated with the Morrill Acts and the hopes aligned with Brown-related litigation,” referencing the landmark Brown v. Board of Education U.S. Supreme Court decision, which desegregated public schools. 
The analysis commends legislation from U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields, D-Baton Rouge, who as a state senator sponsored legislation to create an economic development district for Southern University. The authors also praised state Rep. Chris Turner, R-Ruston, who created a dedicated fund for deferred maintenance that is allowing Southern and other Louisiana schools to address their infrastructure needs. 
“It is the current generation of leaders’ moment to commit to a robust opportunity compact in support of 1890 institutions,” Tate and Arbuthnot conclude.

I told her I needed to leave her to go downtown for the protest on that damp, windy spring day. She understood.
The turnout was okay. My reporter’s eye would have put the crowd at around a thousand. I usually attend protests in Raleigh, and the one a couple weeks previously hit around five thousand, though I’m told the protest I missed while I was in Cleveland was somewhat smaller. A little more recently I went to another protest, and that hit a nice crowd of maybe 500 or more in downtown Durham on a Thursday afternoon. Then I was going to join the one in Raleigh on the same day but a friend said don’t bother, it’s ending and had only a few hundred people. 
So, I have a single question, a question for the folks of Cleveland and Raleigh and North Carolina and everywhere else:
Where the hell are you people? 
What are you waiting for? Illegal deportations? Check. Anonymous secret police grabbing people up and disappearing them regardless of rights or status? Done. Wholesale refusal to respect the Constitution, whether that means abiding by judicial rulings and the emoluments clause or simply respecting citizens’ first, fourth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendment rights? Already there.
Nothing is lacking; all the signs and actions are there. The current regimes — both in North Carolina and Washington DC — do not respect the courts, the ballot box, the people, or the rule of law.
And here came nationwide protests and you — you personally! You! — where the hell were you? What, did you have errands to run? Yoga? The lawn looked like a mess? You had the sniffles? “I was GOING to stand up to fascism,” we will say in the future, “but I had an orthodontist appointment.” We laughed scornfully about Trump’s refusal to honor World War I dead in France because of rain. Well, where the hell are we and what’s keeping us away?
You guys: we don’t have time for this bull. I mean we don’t have time for all the protests, sure; that’s part of the plan. If we’re exhausted and poor and worn out, we’re less likely to protest. But just like you never have time for a doctor’s appointment until what the doctor could have quickly solved puts you in the hospital or the grave? We either protest now like our lives depend on it — spoiler alert — or we let them do as they please with our lives. Those are the only options. Nobody is coming to help us; those who can, like corporations (with the usual few noble exceptions: Penzeys, Ben & Jerry’s, Costco) or political leadership, won’t. Those who wish they could (the entire rest of what we once called the free world) can’t.
It’s us or nobody. And just the way more than a third of our population looked at a choice between trying to solve our problems on the one hand and electing a vast new and terrifying parcel of much worse problems on the other, said “So sorry, busy, can’t be bothered,” you — You! You personally! — are going about your business.
Dude. Your business is saving your life. You may love the game you’re playing on your phone, and you should play it and enjoy it — but if you fall into the sea while you’re playing it, don’t keep playing: swim for your life. You may need to work out for your health, but if someone tries to kidnap you while you’re jogging by, you don’t get to say, “I’d love to fight back, but, you know: leg day.” You have to inconvenience yourself.
A meme went around during the first Trump administration that said, “I don’t know how to explain to you that you should care about other people.” It was a wonderful symbol of the great divide among us. Now we’re in the same place, only I’m talking to my fellow non-Fascist Americans. I don’t know how to tell you that when someone is trying to enslave you, you fight: you fight and you do not stop fighting, because it’s now or never. I’m told that if we get 3.5 percent of the people in the streets, we’re going to win. What are we telling them if we don’t?
My wife tells me she has been taught that if someone has her in their control and plans to rape her, the calculations are complex. If I choose to go along, will that let me live through it? Should I run? Can I keep him talking? Will fighting make things worse? It’s unimaginable but correct: whatever keeps you alive, do that, and live to work through the horrible consequences. But if in that situation your captor tries to pull you into a vehicle? Fight for your life: you won’t come back out. Once he gets you in that car? You’re as good as dead. Fight. 
You guys, they’ve got us, and they’re trying to pull us into the car. I personally am fighting for our lives. What do you plan to do? June 14th there’s another nationwide protest, scheduled for the same day as the idiot birthday parade. 
You guys, it’s now or never. Fight or die.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3211106-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-08 06:05:07.921237

When each of her grandchildren were born or adopted, Marlene Saydah stitched them a quilt — colorful creations with hearts, stars or owls. The back of one bears the baby’s footprints and the words “Quilted with love by Grandma.”
When she was diagnosed with leukemia, the first thing she asked for was her sewing kit. She rushed to try to finish her last couple of projects, including a quilt and a cross-stitched angel tucking a child into bed, but she died three weeks after the diagnosis in 2019. A grandson was born two years later. He was the only child without something handmade by his Grammy. 
But soon, he’ll have the finished angel hanging in his room with the help of a nonprofit called Loose Ends that pairs people who have unfinished projects with people who have the skills to complete the projects. 
“It’s so much a part of my mom, all of this stuff she was just always making for everyone,” said Lauren Saydah, Marlene’s daughter. “She left a beautiful mark on everyone with her love of quilting.”

Lauren Saydah, an Easton resident, found out about Loose Ends through a Facebook post. Up until then, her mom’s unfinished projects had been in storage. Loose Ends paired her with Katia Noll, a Milford resident, and the two talked about the project.
Now, Noll works on the project whenever she gets the chance, meticulously stitching the angel, stars and a sleeping child into existence.
“We bonded and clicked very easily, because I had lost my dad a couple years ago, and we just both were sharing about how our respective parents that we had lost were so important to us and a major part of our lives,” Noll said. “It felt like a kinship, like a shared experience. It just made me that much more excited to work on it for her.”
Loose Ends started in 2022 and became an official nonprofit in 2023. Co-founder Masey Kaplan, of Maine, started it with her friend, Jennifer Simonic, of Seattle, after finishing a project for someone whose mother had died. The two are knitters who live on opposite coasts. When they would get together at group events, they’d often find themselves wandering off to a yarn shop or somewhere quiet to knit.
At first, they weren’t sure how much interest there would be. They put up flyers, posted on Facebook and spread the word through their local libraries. Soon, they had more than 100 volunteers.
The project started to draw attention from news media, and over the past two years more than 33,000 people have signed up as project finishers. About 300 more sign up each week. 
“It speaks to how much people want to help with their crafting. And I think also how relatable loss is, or the experience of grief is to everyone,” Kaplan said.
The number of project finishers for Loose Ends far outweighs the number of people who sign up to get projects finished. The ratio is about 1 to 10, Kaplan said. Volunteers have finished or are working on more than 3,500 projects.

Sometimes, it can take months or years for a finisher to get a project. Kristin Bletich, a Wethersfield resident, got her first project a few months ago. It’s a red sweater with cables twisting down the front.
She’s been knitting for years, and her parents’ home is scattered with projects she’s made — a blanket she crocheted in her college dorm, sweaters and cardigans.
“It’s just nice, because otherwise, these things sit in bags and closets for 20 years where maybe I only need a few hours of work or a few days of work, and then people can actually wear them,” Bletich said, her silver knitting needles clicking as she worked her way up the neck of the sweater.

Loose Ends started with a focus on knitting, but has grown to include more than a dozen types of fiber arts including Tunisian crochet, punch needling, weaving and spinning, among others. Joann, the craft store chain that recently went out of business, was one of the project’s major sponsors.
People can sign up to be finishers and indicate which crafts they’re comfortable with. When people submit projects, they are typically paired with people who live close to them.

That’s how Saydah met Noll. It could be a while before the embroidered angel is finished. The project Saydah’s mother started is a large design, and the pattern has several colors. It also uses metallic thread, which is less flexible and difficult to use.
Noll’s aunt taught her to crochet when she was a teenager, and her hobbies have grown since then. She and a friend used to get together to work on crafts and vent. During those sessions, her friend taught Noll how to cross stitch, and it’s since become one of her favorite hobbies.
Her home is decorated with miniature versions of famous paintings such as “Starry Night,” that she stitched and framed. She says working on these types of projects gives her a “brain break.”
Sue Edelstein, a Litchfield County resident, had her mom’s unfinished tablecloth sitting in storage when she learned about Loose Ends. Her mom had made several of the squares, but they hadn’t been pieced together. It’s a delicate type of crochet work using thin yarn.
There wasn’t quite enough yarn to complete the tablecloth, so instead the project finisher is making four pillows, which Edelstein will share with her sister and cousins. Her mom, Marie Hagemeister, made her children their Christmas stockings and sweaters. Toward the end of her life, she lost her vision and wasn’t able to keep working on her crafts.
Nearly two years after she submitted it, the project is almost completed, and Edelstein recently visited the finisher’s house to see the squares laid out together.
“When I saw it, I got teary about it, because I thought, ‘Oh, my mom will be so happy to see this,’” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0509_SR_Knitting078-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-08 05:01:30.978315

Kansas. In her recent memoir, Mirriam-Goldberg writes of the effort to preserve their 130 acres near Lawrence. (Ken Lassman)It’s a rainy June evening and I’m on the phone with Caryn Mirriam-Goldberg to talk about her new book. On my end in Emporia I can hear the steady drum of rain. Caryn is at the door of her home south of Lawrence, about 80 highway miles from me, and she’s looking out at the land that is largely the setting for her true and personal tale of survival.
I ask her to describe what she sees.
“What I can see right now is this incredible lush, green upon green upon green,” she says. “You know, I’ve been looking at the colors a lot in different ways. I’ve started drawing and painting. And there’s probably half a dozen shades of green, some very close to each other. We have very large cedar trees just off, kind of on the edge of our yard. We have a, let’s see, Ken, is that a dying elm tree?”
She asks her husband, Ken Lassman, who is nearby but not on the phone, to identify the tree. After a moment, Caryn reports.
“The tree that’s dying is an ash,” she says.
I think of Yggdrasill, the sacred ash of Norse mythology.
Death in the midst of life. Life amid life.
Caryn is legally blind in her right eye. She sees the world blurred as if in watercolor, the result of an ocular melanoma, a rare and particularly aggressive form of cancer. Diagnosed in 2019, just in time for the pandemic, and after having survived breast cancer years before, the eye cancer might have killed her. But she received treatment and surgery and now counts herself among the lucky. She took notes through it all, and the result was a book not just about the ordeal her body and mind went through, but about Ken and their children and good friends and that 130 acres of land.

 
“The Magic Eye: A Story of Saving a Life and a Place in the Age of Anxiety” will be released in July by Mammoth Publications, a small California press. Caryn is a former poet laureate of Kansas who has published a couple of dozen books, both fiction and poetry, but “Magic Eye” is unlike anything she’s written before — memoir, yes, but also a kind of found poem in the dust bin of the universe.
Caryn is a survivor but don’t call the book a survivor’s story, because it’s really about the interconnectedness of people and places. She is philosophical that death is not so much to be beaten but something we must all come to terms with, whether soon or late.
In a chapter titled “I Don’t Want to Die,” Caryn leads with the following:
What do you do with old fear, the kind that sets up a cot in the basement of your psyche, somewhere between boxes of essays you wrote in college and a giant pressure cooker you’ll never use?
Just how lucky she is, at least statistically, Caryn doesn’t dwell on because she avoids searching online for the cancer and the survival rates. But according to the Ocular Melanoma Foundation, in about half of cases the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, and is often fatal. Ocular melanoma occurs in about one in 100,000 individuals and typically is diagnosed in persons between 55 and 60. Caryn was 59 when diagnosed. There is no cure, according to the foundation, but there are treatments.
Among the treatments Caryn underwent was ocular brachytherapy, in which radioactive gold seeds are surgically attached to the eye to reduce the tumor. The patient remains hospitalized in radioactive isolation during the treatment, which was successful.
When I ask if people have told her she was brave, she takes time to compose her reply.
“It’s easy to appear brave when you are surround by loving friends, including my husband and family,” she said. “Plus, when it comes to serious illness, people often equate bravery to doing the next step and the next because you want to live. When I think of bravery, I think of a close friend who lost his wife and still, missing her terribly while having to re-do almost everything in his life, gets out of bed in the morning and works in the garden.”
There is much more she could say about bravery, she said, in this time of anxiety. Relationships are inherently brave, she said, and when she feels the most terrified is when she’s dealing with other people. It’s terrifying to be deeply intimate, she said, to be honest, to put yourself out there, to be vulnerable.
And that’s not even taking into account the times in which we live.
“There’s so many emergencies right now,” she said. “I think it’s a peculiar balance point with what you open your eyes to take in, your relationship to it, and how do you keep from going out of your mind?”
Part of what has helped, she said, is working with therapists and acknowledging the spiritual part of the journey. She also said she was lucky to have married somebody who had a “pure, clear relationship” with the land.
Mammoth, publisher of “Magic Eye,” is owned by another former Kansas poet laureate, Denise Low. The house specializes in the work of indigenous and regional authors.
“My health is good,” she said. “You know, I’m legally blind in that eye but it’s not like blind blind, it’s just a different way of seeing. It is certainly not precise out of my right eye. And I continue to do follow ups. Each time I get a clear report, I’m very relieved, and the further out I get, the better. But then again, none of us exactly know what’s coming down the road.”
The specter of uncertainty is woven through the book, linking COVID and tornadoes and the vagaries of fate. Caryn grew up in Brooklyn and found herself staring often at whatever sliver of sky she could find as a child. She describes a household where her grandmothers cried out in Yiddish at the death of an infant brother and where she carried her bruises from an abusive father to high school.
“I turned to poetry as my saving grace,” she writes. “But what my poetry was always about, is still about, is the earth and sky.”
She came to Kansas for college, originally studying journalism.
She met Ken in 1982 at the first Kansas Area Watershed Council, a “deep ecology” group. She was 22, he was 27. A fling turned, three years later, into a marriage, where a quote from environmental writer Wendell Berry was part of the ceremony. In marrying Ken, a fifth-generation Kansan and now an occupational therapist and nature essayist, she also married the land. They vowed to protect all of his family’s original acreage, which was tied up in a complicated inheritance worthy of Shakespeare.
It took 35 years to untangle, she said.
During our talk, I betray a bit of land envy. I say something — or I perhaps mumbled it — about my family never having land beyond the footprint of whatever house we lived in. I’m also thinking about how private land is a religion in Kansas and how the state ranks dead last in public land. But then I realize the kind of ownership Caryn writes about is not so much acquisition as a kind of transcendence.
How are we made? Caryn asks in the book. From stardust and dirt, s*** and bones, climate and climate change, toxins and medicines, the damage and the cure. Healing is part of us and the earth, made of ordinary and rare time, weather, and place. Replant what was once a native tallgrass prairie and let the rotation of the earth for 12,000 years do the rest, whether or not humans are here to witness it.
The land and the sky belong to everyone, she says.

But not last Thursday evening (June 5), the hottest day of the year (so far), when the overhead catenary power lines were dragged down near Westport.  No power means no trains.


What caused the problem won’t be known for a while.  Given the heat it might be “wire sag.”  Or maybe it was a worn out pantograph carbon shoe (the thing on top of the train that touches the catenary power line).  Whatever the cause, the results were fast and long-lasting.
Scores of trains were delayed throughout the Northeast Corridor, both on Metro-North and Amtrak. But two were stranded between stations with no power… and no air conditioning.  One, an Amtrak train carrying 400 people, got very hot.  Because the windows don’t open, people started to get upset according to media reports.
Metro-North trains have long carried emergency water supplies for such incidents, but not Amtrak trains.
Eventually diesel trains came to the rescue (along with local fire fighters), but the delays were far from over… lingering into Friday’s service the next day.
How did passengers on the delayed and rerouted trains make out?  Based on interviews, pretty well given the circumstances and Metro-North’s quick response.
Substitute buses are usually the answer, but at the peak of rush hour (when the incident occurred) most buses were already on their regular runs.  It’s not like there’s a fleet of spare buses on standby.  And remember… a full Metro-North train can carry 1,000 passengers.  A bus, maybe 60 (including standees).
A reporter friend of mine who lives in eastern Connecticut grabbed the 5:22 p.m. train from Grand Central to New Haven and, within minutes of departure the hundreds of passengers onboard were warned of problems:  the train would terminate at South Norwalk.
There he caught a bus, only to be dumped somewhere in East Norwalk when the driver pulled to a stop and said “I’m done working, everybody off.  There’s another bus coming.” 
“None of us knew where we were,” said my friend, eventually paying $120 for a cab to West Haven where he’d parked his car.  He eventually got home about 11:45 p.m.
“Everybody was pretty ‘chill’ and patient,” he said, impressed that Metro-North staffers wearing distinctive vests were at the stations directing the throngs.  “I’m just glad that Metro-North was doing something,” he said.  “The whole experience taught us just how vulnerable we are when things go wrong.”
Another colleague, Paul Murnane from WINS, caught an 8 p.m. train from Grand Central Terminal getting no further than Greens Farms where the platform was jammed with tired travelers.  Sure enough, vested railroad staffers directed the throngs down a hill to three waiting buses which immediately filled up and departed.  More buses were promised and quickly arrived. Murnane’s bus even got a State Police escort, arriving in Fairfield at 11:30 p.m.
Again, he says the crowds were patient and well behaved.  “It’s hard to have a riot in Vineyard Vines,” he said, commenting on the riders’ summer attire.  A 40-year rider of these rails, he too was impressed with the railroad’s response.
Stuff happens on a railroad depending on aging infrastructure.  So if you’re taking a train, always have a “plan B.”  And BYO water.
And kudos to Metro-North for their handling of this situation, especially for keeping passengers informed.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SoNo-1-e1749254647237.jpg,,,2025-06-08 05:01:30.978315

BRIDGEPORT — The skies over Seaside Park were gray and heavy on Sunday, but the energy radiating from the field cut right through the clouds.
Dozens of girls from across Bridgeport and neighboring cities had their jerseys on and  cleats laced as they ran drills, laughed, huddled, and high-fived all day at the inaugural 2025 Girls Flag Football Jamboree. For most, it was their first time playing flag football. 
The free event was the first of its kind in the city and, in many ways, the state.
Hosted by Bridgeport Public Schools, in partnership with the New York Giants and Northeast Flag Football League, the jamboree welcomed girls ages 13 to 18 for a day of flag football, team-building, and empowerment at Bridgeport’s Seaside Park. Uniforms were handed out, volunteers stood on the sidelines cheering, and proud families lined up with phones out, capturing every throw and sprint.
“It’s a big opportunity,” said Dr. Royce Avery, acting superintendent of Bridgeport Public Schools. “You think football is all about the boys, but the girls are hungry for it.”

On the sidelines, Alexia Thompson, a freshman at Central High School, adjusted her belt and smiled when asked what it meant to be there.
“This is a very big achievement of mine,” she said. “Back home in Jamaica, soccer is the main sport, especially for girls. So it means a lot for me to come out and play flag football here. I feel proud.”
Next to her, teammate Kimora Simpson, also a freshman, echoed the emotion.
“It’s highlighting female empowerment,” she said. “It’s really nice we got the opportunity to play. We don’t always get that.”
In Bridgeport, sports opportunities for girls have often felt limited. Football, like in many American cities, has long been dominated by boys.
“Female athletes in this city don’t get a lot of outlets,” said Artay Corbett, head coach at Warren Harding High School, who’s working with the girls’ team. “So giving them another sport, something new to be a part of, is a really big deal. This is a major deal for Bridgeport.”
Bridgeport, Connecticut’s largest city and home to over 140,000 residents, was chosen for more than just its shoreline and views.
“This is a transformational moment,” said Avery. “We’re showing our girls they can lead, grow, and thrive. Not just in the classroom, but on the field.”
The idea started with a connection between Dee Fludd, director of the Northeast Flag Football League, and New York Giants owner John Mara. Mara had grandchildren in Fludd’s program. That relationship, along with the rising momentum of girls flag football nationwide, helped launch something bigger.
“This, hopefully, is a way to kick off the sort of interest that girls have in playing flag football,” said Fludd, who has been working for years to expand access to the sport.
In Bridgeport, this partnership was personal for leaders like Don Wilson, founder of the Bridgeport Youth Lacrosse Program. Wilson played a vital role in organizing the event and voicing the need for it, working alongside community organizers and school officials to help bring it to life.
“It’s been unique,” said Paul Catuccio, athletic director for Bridgeport Public Schools. “But it’s all about opportunity. We’re trying to provide more of them, especially for our girls. And they’re really excited.”

For Catuccio, the deeper impact is in collaboration. “Building those relationships, that’s the foundation. Don’s connections in the community, Dee’s knowledge of the sport, and our kids is what made this special,” he said.
This first event, officials and community members hope will be the start of something bigger.
The New York Giants’ sponsorship helped make it all possible and, although the team did not send anyone to the actual event on Sunday, the impact was immediate. Matching uniforms, experienced coaches, community involvement — it gave girls a sense of pride that this wasn’t just a “trial.” It was the real thing.
“We’re not just hosting a tournament,” said Catuccio. “We’re setting a new standard.”
As the NFL continues its push to expand girls flag football by including it during the Pro Bowl and advocating for it as an Olympic sport, places like Bridgeport are emerging as ground zero for real change.
Leaders from the event said this isn’t a one-off.
They expect this jamboree to lead to a formal girls flag football league in Bridgeport. 
“We want more for our girls,” said Avery. “More space, more access, more visibility.”
For girls like Alexia and Kimora, that future starts now.
As the clouds over Seaside Park started to clear that afternoon, the scoreboard didn’t matter, just the sound of cleats on grass, laughter from the sidelines and one unmistakable truth.
This was their game, too.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_6054-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-07 21:01:16.743938

(Nadav Soroker/Searchlight New Mexico)

Twice last year, in the spring and fall, water burst from the Rio Santa Cruz and poured into the tiny northern New Mexico community of Santa Cruz, between Española and Chimayó. It cracked concrete ditch liners and spilled into houses and a trailer park.

Irrigators along the streams are frustrated and worried about the time and money that beavers could cost them. The memory of the 2024 floods looms — a flood or a block can cost tens of thousands of dollars and leave farmers without reliable access to water in a season when they need it most. With drought intensifying, they’re under increasing pressure to share a limited resource and don’t want to navigate another area of stress.

Investigating the first flood, acequia commissioners and mayordomos — the elected leaders of New Mexico irrigators who’ve used the water from hand-dug ditches for centuries — discovered an abandoned beaver dam. It had been there a while: the wood had softened and whitened, and willows had grown up around it. It had trapped more than seven feet of wet silt.

This article first appeared on Searchlight New Mexico and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.

The spring flood, which occurred after a heavy rain, spread so much silt that it was impossible to remove the dam. Come October, the river swelled again during another storm and carried branches, basketballs, stumps, shoes, brush and bottles downstream. The willows around the dam caught the debris and the water rose up against the heap and rushed over the banks.

Dredging the channel and raising the banks required use of a bulldozer, a backhoe and a trackhoe. More than once, the equipment sank into the silt. In all, the surrounding ditch organizations had to spend around $35,000 to repair the damaged waterways.
Acequia organizations typically have very little money. After they spend what they raise from member dues on maintenance and repairs, they’re usually left with a couple of thousand dollars in their annual budgets, at most. That year, the acequia spent whatever extra money they had on flood repair, getting assistance from Rio Arriba County (around $18,000) and the East Rio Arriba Soil and Water Conservation District (around $5,000). The flooded area was in Santa Fe County, but, acequia leaders say, they couldn’t get assistance from Santa Fe officials. Because Rio Arriba constituents were affected by the flooding, the two Rio Arriba entities agreed to help.
In the past few years, citing evidence that beavers can make a place more drought-resilient, Santa Fe County and a prominent national conservation nonprofit, Defenders of Wildlife, have encouraged the presence of the big, paddle-tailed rodents in a stream system that includes the Rio Quemado and the Rio Santa Cruz.
https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ryh4c/embed.js
Stemming from those rivers is a dense network of dozens of acequias, which, with gravity and gates, make it possible to divert water to farmers’ fields.  People in the communities around Española and Chimayó depend on it to irrigate their chile, corn, melons, berries, stone fruits, greens, carrots, flowers, alfalfa and other crops.
Irrigators along the streams are frustrated and worried about the time and money that beavers could cost them. The memory of the floods in Santa Cruz looms — a flood or a block can cost tens of thousands of dollars and leave farmers without reliable access to water in a season when they need it most. With drought intensifying, they’re under increasing pressure to share a limited resource and don’t want to navigate another area of stress.



“Now we have to worry about beavers?” says Brian Martinez, a parciante (water recipient) on the Acequia de la Puebla in the community of La Puebla who grew up digging ditches in Chimayó. “I don’t know of any acequia that would be doing somersaults to do that.”
Several acequias leaders contend that they’ve received inadequate communication about planning by the county and Defenders of Wildlife — some find the communication they have received to be disrespectful and condescending — and many view the two organizations as outside entities that shouldn’t be able to impose their ideas about local waterways without significantly more community input.
The issue is especially fraught, given the history of Santa Fe-based environmentalists in northern New Mexico, who have, more than once, argued that they know better than Chicano residents how to take care of the natural world, and who have sometimes blocked them from practicing traditional agriculture.
“They need to come and see what our issues are,” Ross Garcia, commissioner on the Acequia de los Ortegas in San Pedro, says. “We’ve been irrigating for generations.”
The benefits beavers can bring
In recent years, environmentalists around the world have been singing the praises of beavers, pointing to them as a natural solution to the climate crisis. The dams they build alter the flow of water, slowing and spreading it. Their storage tactics allow the ground to soak in water, which, during dry stretches, can seep back out.

Streams throughout the western U.S. that once ran year-round started running dry during droughts; when beavers took up residence again, the streams began to flow year-round once more. The wetter an area is, the less likely it is to ignite in a wildfire. And studies indicate that beavers’ aquatic engineering revitalizes biodiversity and mitigates dangerous bacteria.
Beavers are native to the mountains and valleys of northern New Mexico. Hoping to establish the positive trends the creatures can bring about, Santa Fe County and Defenders of Wildlife have implemented projects that involve welcoming the animals — who move in on their own and are not released — into wet areas around Chimayó. Various laws make it illegal to remove beaver dams and kill beavers, and conservationists argue that learning to live alongside them is well worth it.
Peggy Darr, a wildlife biologist who worked with Santa Fe County during the creation of a controversial wetland and now advocates for beaver conservation with Defenders of Wildlife, is planning to install beaver dam analogs (BDAs), which mimic beaver habitats, on the Rio Santa Cruz and the Rio Quemado. BDAs can attract beavers to take up residence.
“One of the goals of BDAs is to have beavers take over and improve upon our restoration work, as there are not enough resources, financial or otherwise, to do the critical work beavers do for free,” Darr wrote in an email.
Santa Fe County also encouraged beavers to move into a Chimayó wetland, called Los Potreros, which the county has worked to conserve over the past few years. Historically a wetland and then a grazing pasture, the area was put up for sale and slated for development in the 1990s. In response to community concern and advocacy, Santa Fe County eventually purchased the area in the name of “cultural preservation and conservation of traditional agriculture and natural habitat,” according to county communications coordinator Olivia Romo.
In 2021, with a grant from the New Mexico Environment Department, the county contracted with Ecotone, a Santa Fe-based landscape planning firm, to restore the wetland. Ecotone built structures that emulated beaver engineering, and beavers moved in and built dams.
The results have been striking. Water has spread across the pasture, turning the grasses emerald. Ducks erupt out of the marsh, and redwing blackbirds trill from the tops of cattails. Meanwhile, the beavers, who tend to come and go, have moved on to other areas in the stream system.
A lack of community input
Several community members say they were excluded from the planning processes for these projects. About four years ago, someone reportedly destroyed a beaver dam at Los Potreros  — other dams were breached with a shovel  — which prompted Santa Fe County to put up signs saying that the area is under surveillance camera and that “It is illegal to vandalize beaver dams, molest beavers or kill beavers on Santa Fe County Open Space Property.” Some residents found the sign and the camera insulting and viewed it as an instance of the county defending animals instead of the rights of people. (No one, as of now, appears to be planning to molest or kill beavers.)

Acequia leaders are worried about how much water is being diverted from the Rio Quemado into the field. The few meetings the county hosted to discuss its plans left residents feeling confused and unheard.
“It was done pretty quickly, without much input from the community,” says Michael Diaz, a flower farmer in Chimayó and the mayordomo of the Acequia de los Martinez Arriba, which historically irrigated the former pasture.

Diaz has seen the benefits beavers can bring to mountain wetlands. “I’m totally down for that,” he says. “But not if it’s just for Santa Fe County to look cute.”
He’s watched the wetland soak up huge quantities of water. He wants to know how much of that water evaporates and whether the absorption limits downstream use. He’s also worried that beavers will reproduce and fill the waterways with dams and burrows, which he doesn’t have the time or money to clear. The water has spread so far across the pasture that parts of the acequia are difficult, if not impossible, to access for repair. He’s not sure how irrigators could get equipment to those areas if there is a breach.
Into a bank of the acequia close to the wetland, about a third of the way down the ditch,  a creature has been digging tunnels. Diaz and a couple others patched the holes with sandbags and plastic from an old greenhouse. He believes beavers are the culprit. (Jan-Willem Jansens, the owner of Ecotone, says it’s more likely a muskrat, a claim that others fiercely dispute. Either way, Diaz has found more tunnels since the wetland expanded.)
Darr agrees that beavers don’t belong in acequias and says she wants to prioritize helping farmers survey and remove dams from the channels. She worked to implement various beaver-human coexistence measures at the wetland — pond levelers to prevent flooding; wire caging around trees that community members didn’t want beavers to chew on; and similar caging around acequia headgates to prevent them from getting clogged.
Defenders of Wildlife has funding to send farmers to training sessions about beaver coexistence, Darr says. She’s offering to enact a cost-share program to help pay for the challenges irrigators experience.
But some of the mitigation tactics seem ineffective to residents: as the landscape of the wetland has shifted, beavers have chewed down supposedly protected trees. And the idea of having to take on more expenses and tasks to coexist with beavers strikes several commissioners, mayordomos and farmers who are working around the clock, often for free, as impractical.
“It doesn’t seem fair to the acequias, because they’re already financially strapped, and they’re strapped for labor,” says Brian Martinez. “To expect an acequia to cost share whatever amount of money it might be isn’t tenable.”
Defenders of Wildlife has also hired a farmer, Emilio Borrego, to talk to community members about how they might make use of the advantages beavers offer. Borrego is the chairman of the Acequia de la Otra Vanda in the community of Córdova, upstream from Chimayó.
“I get that it’s not so black-and-white, and it’s an issue that takes time,” he says. But he believes he’s benefited from the presence of beavers. He says that upstream dams have acted as speed bumps for the water during heavy storms, and they’ve played a crucial role in protecting Córdova from severe flooding. Borrego also accesses regular waterflow for the crops that he grows.
Córdova’s environment is different from the communities between Chimayó and Española. It sits at 7,146 feet in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristos, about 1,000 feet higher than Chimayó,  with a higher stream that feeds it. But it’s still a dense community reliant on acequia water, and Borrego believes beavers will make the entire watershed more resilient to climate change.
He also notes that beavers move in on their own and “are extremely hard to work against.” Taking apart a dam can cause a bigger mess than leaving one in place, he says. “They’re really tenacious little creatures. They work super-fast. There already is a beaver presence all along the whole watershed.”
“Where’s the community?”
Currently, people don’t know how many beavers live in the rivers, nor do they know whether the wetland is storing more water than it loses to evaporation. The dearth of information is amplifying acequia users’ frustrations about communication.
Steve Finch, a hydrogeologist who has worked with all 64 acequias in the stream system, hasn’t seen data indicating how much water is being stored. He notes that beavers can be beneficial in higher reaches of the watershed, but he’s concerned about the extra labor that the presence of beavers would require from acequia users lower down.
“It’s already too much effort to maintain the acequias without beavers,” he says. Acequia users “are out there every day, managing, maintaining, operating, and the last thing they want are beavers in or around the acequias.”
Community members want more data, something they emphasized at a meeting that the county and Defenders of Wildlife held in Chimayó on the evening of May 29.

The gathering was designed to show that both organizations hope to prioritize conversation with the parciantes, commissioners and mayordomos. But word about the meeting reached very few people. Less than ten residents of the surrounding area were there; some found out about it only after others already there texted them.
Coursing through the conversation was deep anger that people who don’t actively depend on acequias are making decisions that seriously affect the flow of water.
“It seems like we have a majority of people working on this project than people that live in this community,” Diaz said.
Although a couple of the county employees and a contractor with Defenders of Wildlife are acequia users from northern New Mexico, the divide between community members and meeting organizers was palpable. People frequently cut each other off and talked over each other. A beaver proponent grew visibly upset as acequia leaders expressed their anger.
“You guys just want to just protect a certain little area here where you guys can collect your money and have your little group meetings,” said Isaac Martinez, president of the commission of the Acequia de los Martinez Arriba. “Where’s the community?”

There was also a generational divide. Borrego, who’s in his 30s, argued the value of working with the beavers; several of the commissioners and mayordomos in attendance who don’t want the beavers in the water ways belong to older generations.
“I’m going to be doing this for a long time, and I know that the climate’s changing a lot, and that’s the thing,” Borrego said. “If we don’t have a healthier water system, or if we take away these things that are actually helping there be more water in the water system itself, we’re going to be screwed. It’s going to be way different by the time I’m your guys’ age.”
Attendees said that going forward, they need more information that will take into account the harms beavers can enact in their particular community.
Shelley Winship, an administrator and former supervisor of the Santa Fe-Pojoaque Soil and Water Conservation District, asked that the county perform a cost-benefit analysis for the valley around the Rio Santa Cruz. “You talked about the services and benefits beavers provided, but you haven’t quantified the cost to the ecosystem that beavers are causing in an acequia community,” she said. She noted that acequias, too, provide benefits to the ecosystem, also slowing water and delivering it to plants, and that negative impacts to acequias would result in the loss of those benefits.
“If you don’t understand the particular ecosystem that you’re looking at, you’re going to make recommendations that are going to cause problems,” she said.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) ANKENY — Iowa Farmers Union members met Saturday with U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya and explained how consolidation in the agriculture industry has crippled their farming operations and rural communities. 
Bedoya, who visited with Iowa farmers three years prior, said it was important to come back to the places where “the scope of the problems that people are facing just hits you in the face.”
“The key question is: what is the undone work,” Bedoya said to the group gathered in a barn at Griffieon Farms outside of Ankeny.
Bedoya is visiting with groups around the country while he is involved in a lawsuit against the Trump administration, which fired him from the FTC in March.
During his time at FTC, Bedoya and his team sued over the business merger between grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons, sued pesticide companies for alleged anticompetitive practices and sued John Deere for the right to repair equipment.
After listening to farmers share their stories, Bedoya said “the scope of the problem” and the “just how many issues” are facing Iowa farmers is what stood out to him.

Sean Dengler, a former farmer in Tama County, said the “monopolization” across the machinery and agricultural sector led him to give it up and end five generations of Dengler farming tradition. 
Last harvest season, an error code on his combine led to a several-days harvest delay waiting for a licensed technician to come out to the farm, diagnose and come back to repair the rig. 
“Giving farmers the ability to fix the equipment they bought is their right,” Dengler said.
Part of the problem, for repairs and for nearly every aspect related to farming, is that repair shops, dealers, grain elevators, meat lockers and other commodities are fewer and further between. Farmers gave countless examples Saturday of how this spread has hurt not just their ag operations, but their rural communities as well. 
Josh Manske, an IFU board member and farmer, said farmers no longer shop around for the best fertilizer price, instead they shop “for transportation.” 
“The price is the same no matter where you go,” Manske said, noting the problems with a lack of competition.
LaVon Griffieon said she sees the same issue spread to grocery stores across the state. Living where she does just outside of Ankeny, Griffieon said she has access to multiple stores within a 5-10 minute drive, but friends of hers in rural counties must drive in excess of 20 minutes to the closest grocery store, and close to an hour to find a store with organic products. 
“It seems like feast or famine,” Griffieon said. 
Griffieon said the consolidation in the grocery industry makes the margins for an independent grocer are “even worse than farming.”
Jerry Rosman, a farmer and truck driver, said he sees the same issue in the field, but also on the highway. 
“The dynamics of what it is might be a little different, but it’s just — as things get tighter at the top, at the bottom they just start disappearing,” Rosman said. “Pull through a little town and you can just see the decline.”
Mike Carberry, a board member for Iowa Farmers Union, said agriculture needs the FTC’s work “breaking up the monopolies” of the industry that, he said, have turned Iowa into an “extractive state.” 
Bedoya, who listened intently to the farmers, said while he’s committed to bringing this type of legal action forward, stopping a merger, as the FTC did with the Kroger and Albertsons case, takes a massive amount of time, people and money. 
“The amount of time it takes to stop a merger that has not yet happened is massive,” Bedoya said. “To undo a merger that has already happened is gargantuan — it is something that kind of happens once in a legal generation.” 
Bedoya said a similar issue of vertical integration in the pharmaceutical industry has been blocked by legislative efforts in several states. Lawmakers in Iowa passed a bill that would put restrictions on pharmacy benefit managers to prevent them from using specific pharmacies to fill prescriptions. The bill has yet to be signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds. 
Bedoya, speaking on similar legislation passed in Arkansas, said it “opened up” an avenue for going after vertical integration, that could be an option to intervene in some of the consolidation issues in agriculture. 
“This is going to require both parties, and it’s going to require every level of government or every branch, not just, federal prosecutors, but state prosecutors, state legislators, and also federal legislators if they get their act together and pass some bills,” Bedoya said. 
Bedoya’s fight 
Bedoya and the other Democratic commissioner, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, at the FTC were fired by President Donald Trump, but Bedoya alleges the firing was illegal and is fighting in court to stay at FTC.
Bedoya said while he might be locked out of the FTC system and without access to his files, he’s still doing the work of a commissioner and speaking with rideshare workers, pharmacists, farmers and more to learn about the issues they are facing. 
“But no matter what, I will continue doing this work, whether it’s at FTC or in a nonprofit,” Bedoya said. 
In his view, the FTC has started to take up cases that trend more towards political battles, than protecting American consumers. 
“The FTC is not for fighting your political fights,” Bedoya said. “It’s for suing the John Deeres of the world. It’s for suing the Cortevas and Syngentas of the world that are screwing over farmers and that are making people’s lives harder. It’s not for political warfare.”

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA, Kan. — Immigrants being held inside a federal prison in northeast Kansas and their attorneys reported an unsanitary, inequitable and unhealthy environment that has left people, even those who have won their immigration cases, deprived of basic needs.
Based on interviews with people inside the prison and attorneys representing those people, immigrants face unsanitary and crowded living quarters, extended lockdowns, delayed and costly medical treatment, restricted contact with their families and no access to religious services.
In some cases, these conditions have led to suicide attempts.
“These aren’t criminals,” said Michael Sharma-Crawford, a local immigration attorney and chair of the Kansas and Missouri chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “In theory, none of these people deserves to be in jail.”
A pair of letters — one sent to the warden of the Leavenworth Federal Correctional Institution complaining of a rat infestation and another sent to the warden, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Prisons — detail conditions that are “well below” what is required of the federal agencies.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Attorneys and advocates claim in the letters, sent May 5 and May 29, that a “significant number” of people remain imprisoned at Leavenworth despite having won their immigration cases, which often fall under civil law, not criminal. Some cannot return to their countries of origin because, upon return, they could face torture or violence.
While the possibility of securing release for people facing deportation is low, Sharma-Crawford said ensuring they are held within legal standards could be done.
Leavenworth, formerly the Fort Leavenworth Military Prison, is one of two facilities in the state currently used to detain immigrants.
In February, ICE and the Bureau of Prisons agreed to hold immigrants at Leavenworth. A separate facility in Leavenworth, a shuttered prison owned by private company CoreCivic, was planned to reopen and detain immigrants as well, but a judge blocked the company from doing so Wednesday based on local zoning rules.
Sharma-Crawford said he has heard anecdotes about ICE officials in and around Chicago driving across the region, including to Kansas and Missouri, frantically trying to find a place to hold people.
More than 1,300 men are typically held in the medium-security prison, and about 220 are held in a minimum security “satellite camp.” At least 80 immigrants are being held at Leavenworth, according to the letter.
Randilee Giamusso, a spokeswoman for the prison bureau, declined to comment on the letter’s claims but confirmed the bureau received the letter.
“The Federal Bureau of Prisons is committed to ensuring the safety and security of all inmates in our population, our staff, and the public. We have received the letter,” Giamusso wrote in an email. “However, we do not comment on matters related to pending litigation,  legal proceedings, or investigations.”
Media officials at ICE did not respond to requests seeking a comment.
Life without sunlight
“Several immigrants” at Leavenworth experienced such a depression from extended lockdown periods, which sometimes lasted 20 hours at a time for three days straight, that they attempted suicide, said the May 29 letter signed by a collection of eight civil rights organizations and attorney groups.
After their suicide attempts, they were reportedly put in solitary confinement.
“One detainee who witnessed a suicide attempt has felt depressed and fearful during subsequent lockdowns,” the letter said, “but has been afraid to report his mental health symptoms to staff for fear that he, too, will be removed from the unit and will be placed in solitary confinement.”
Another representative of the prison bureau declined to confirm or deny the letter’s claims about suicide attempts in Leavenworth.
Karla Juarez, executive director of Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation, said in a news release that the conditions at Leavenworth are horrifying.
Wrongly deported Maryland man Abrego Garcia returned to U.S.

“What’s happening at FCI Leavenworth is not only a violation of ICE’s own policies — it’s a violation of our shared humanity,” she said.“These are people who have already won their immigration cases and who should be free with their families, not locked in overcrowded cells without access to medical care or even sunlight.”
People serving sentences from criminal convictions at Leavenworth are able to use the prison’s outdoor yard for recreation and exercise. Those in ICE’s custody are not, despite that being a condition of the two agencies’ collaboration.
The agreement between the federal agencies said: “ICE detainees will have access to education and psychology materials, leisure and law libraries, and indoor and outdoor recreation.”
Reports from inside the prison have found that people being held for immigration reasons have access to none of these things.
Plus, a pervasive language barrier has created a hurdle for immigrants in the prison who say their basic needs aren’t being met, the letter said.
Those imprisoned for crimes and in immigration cases both report that they usually do not encounter prison staff who speak Spanish, the letter said. One person who only speaks Spanish said he wasn’t offered a translator when given medical care. Another, who only speaks Russian, said his requests for medical assistance have gone unanswered for months.
Access to prescribed medications, dental care, mental health care and medical care has been delayed, the letter said, and “when they are seen by staff for treatment, they are not provided with proper care and are instructed to pay for medication, which is in violation of ICE policy.”
The letter concludes with a list of 14 recommendations. The foremost suggestion demands the release of all detained immigrants who have won their immigration cases. Others included providing free and timely medical care, interpretation services, free and private confidential calls with attorneys, access to a chaplain, free printing from the prison law library, recreational services, and outdoor time.
The letter was backed by Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation; the American Civil Liberties Union; the ACLU of Kansas; the American Immigration Lawyers Association; the Missouri and Kansas chapter of the immigration lawyers association; the Federal Public Defenders for the District of Kansas; the National Immigrant Justice Center; and the Office of Justice, Peace and Integrity of Creation through the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth.
The ‘rodent letter’
In early May, the Kansas Federal Public Defenders wrote to Crystal Carter, the prison warden, and Nathan Atkinson, a general attorney for the prison bureau, about a months-long rat infestation in Leavenworth that showed “no signs of abating.”
“Rats have infested the housing area,” said the letter, obtained by Kansas Reflector, “Clients report rats stealing commissary and finding rat feces in their food, as well as finding dead rats in the common areas.”
The federal defenders saw and heard rats during visits with their clients. The letter outlined the health and safety hazards associated with such infestations, arguing that allowing the rodents to remain could degrade conditions so much so that it amounts to a constitutional violation.
Often, in-person visits are the attorneys’ only options, they said in the letter. They called video visits “problematic” because clients are frequently brought into video visitation rooms late, or the wrong person is brought in, or all the rooms are full, so visits have to be done in a common area.
Carter, the warden, stated in a May 13 response obtained by Kansas Reflector that the prison had cleaned infested areas and implemented pest control measures, including regular inspections, baiting, and setting traps.
A person who was detained in Leavenworth earlier this year described the prison to civil rights groups and attorneys as “very dirty.”
“We didn’t have any cleaning supplies. Food was the hardest part because it wasn’t a pleasant meal. There was no way to wash clothes. We only had one uniform, and that was it,” said the man, who was unnamed in a press release from the ACLU of Kansas. “Honestly, the time we were locked up in the cell was the worst. We had no communication with our families, and they didn’t comply with the necessary resources.”
While both letters make claims that the federal agencies are breaking the law, attorneys and advocates have not filed a lawsuit or an official complaint. If proper conditions for immigrants cannot be ensured, that’s when they could go to court, said Sharma-Crawford, the immigration attorney.
At one point, immigration officials and courts would allow leniency for immigrants with open cases who were in good standing, Sharma-Crawford said
“That grace is gone,” he said. “That humanity is gone.”
Eunice Cho, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, said the Trump administration should cease the use of federal prisons to detain immigrants.
“Holding people in extended lockdown, and denying them access to adequate medical care, legal counsel, and even sunlight isn’t just inhumane,” Cho said. “It’s illegal.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has accepted responsibility for mishandled line-item vetoes to the state’s next two-year budget while reiterating that many of the suggested cuts will be reconsidered in 2026.
Pillen, speaking with the Nebraska Examiner after the Legislature adjourned for the year, said the veto process includes “human beings” in his office, the Clerk of the Legislature’s Office and the Secretary of State’s Office. On May 21, his office delivered Legislative Bill 261 and LB 264 with line-item vetoes to the Secretary of State’s Office, which is the right place for the bills to go when the Legislature is out of session, but not to the Clerk of the Legislature’s Office on the other side of the Capitol, which is where bills must be returned when senators are in session.
The Governor’s Office says LB 261 was line-item vetoed at 1:08 p.m. on May 21 and LB 264 at 1:10 p.m. A spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s Office said the bills were delivered to that office around 5 p.m. the same day.

The Legislature did receive a separate letter from Pillen the night of May 21 detailing the line-item vetoes, as well as a copy of the bills with the inscribed vetoes, but lawmakers contended the next day that a line-item veto is constitutional only with the inscribed vetoes on the actual bills. Those bills remained at the Secretary of State’s Office until morning.
The Nebraska Constitution requires vetoes to be returned within five days of being presented to the governor, excluding Sundays. The bills passed May 15 and went to Pillen’s office at 1:12 p.m., so the deadline was by the end-of-day May 21.
‘The glass of milk was spilled’
Pillen said the mistake on the night of May 21 was “a miscommunication on where it was supposed to go.” Pillen was in Washington, D.C., the following day, for a “Make America Healthy Again” event at the White House.
“Bottom line: We made a mistake. I’d have thought, because we all work together, that a flag would have been thrown and said, ‘Hey, let’s do X,’ but there wasn’t, and then the glass of milk was spilled the next morning,” Pillen told the Examiner.
The intended vetoes targeted $14.5 million to the state’s general fund and $18 million in repurposed cash funds for improvements at Lake McConaughy. He sought to save $14.5 million that the Legislature’s budget aimed to use from the state’s “rainy day” cash reserve by trimming spending — $152 million from the rainy day fund went to help balance the budget.

The Nebraska Supreme Court, which faced about $12 million of Pillen’s proposed general fund reductions (83%), has said the loss of those funds could close vital court services.
This was Pillen’s second two-year budget — he vetoed $38.5 million in general fund spending in 2023 for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 fiscal years. Lawmakers restored about $850,000 of the trims.
Pillen, Secretary of State Bob Evnen and Speaker of the Legislature John Arch have pledged to clarify the line-item veto process for the budget ahead of 2026, and they’ve agreed that the suggested reductions should be considered when the budget is adjusted next year.
Arch has said that to his knowledge, nothing like this had happened before.
Pillen, whose office now insists the matter is resolved, said, “As I told our team, we look in the mirror, we accept responsibilities. I’ve not met a human that doesn’t make a mistake yet.”
Missing timeline of events
Pillen and his staff have declined to detail exactly what happened the night of May 21.
Rani Taborek-Potter, a spokesperson for Evnen, said no one from the Secretary of State’s Office delivered the actual LB 261 and LB 264 with the line-item vetoes to the Clerk of the Legislature’s Office, “nor is it our office’s responsibility to do so.”
“When bills are vetoed by the Governor, the vetoed bills are delivered directly to the Clerk of the Legislature’s Office by the Governor’s office, as was the case for LB 319 and LB 287 to the best of our knowledge,” Taborek-Potter told the Examiner, referring to the two other bills vetoed this session related to expanding SNAP benefit eligibility and fighting bedbugs in Omaha.

Taborek-Potter confirmed the Governor’s Office delivered the budget bills to the administrative assistant in the Secretary of State’s Office just before 5 p.m. on May 21.
The Examiner on May 23 requested all records and communications regarding the line-item vetoes from when the budget bills passed May 15 to the date of the records request. The request sought texts, emails and digital messages. It also asked for communications within the executive branch and between Pillen’s office and the legislative branch, including staff and state senators.
Documents provided in response indicated that Pillen’s veto letter detailing his objections was ready by 6:05 p.m., when the state budget administrator, Neil Sullivan, sent it to Pillen’s staff.
Around 6:27 p.m., Kenny Zoeller, director of the governor’s Policy Research Office, the main research and lobbying arm for Pillen, confirmed the letter among gubernatorial staff.
“We are handing this off back to the Legislature POST adjournment,” Zoeller wrote of next steps. “I will text when it’s handed off.”
Laura Strimple, the governor’s primary spokesperson, sent a draft news release regarding the vetoes at 8:21 p.m. to Sullivan. It was sent to reporters around 11:23 p.m.
The Legislature adjourned at 9:20 p.m., and a reporter could see legislative staff discussing the veto letter.
The next day
Through much of the day on May 22, legislative leadership met off the floor, including Arch. Several emerged just before adjournment at 2:37 p.m. when Arch announced the vetoes could not be accepted and that the Legislature had concluded they were constitutionally improper. Some members of the Appropriations Committee hugged, threw fists in the air and smiled after.

Pillen’s spokesperson, Strimple, sent a statement to reporters at 4:48 p.m. stating it was the governor’s position that Pillen “clearly took the legally required steps to exercise his veto authority by surrendering physical possession and the power to approve or reject the bills.” 
She said the Governor’s Office would consult with the Attorney General’s Office and other counsel.
The Policy Research Office, executive branch budget staff and other members of the governor’s staff met around 5 p.m. on May 22. Strimple sent her statement on the governor’s position to all members of the governor’s staff at 5:23 p.m., then to lawmakers at 5:53 p.m.
On May 27, the next legislative day, Pillen, Arch and Evnen released their joint statement around 2:54 p.m., ending the possible constitutional dispute and returning to their respective corners, with no one taking blame for the situation until Pillen spoke with reporters this week.
Pillen’s office asserts that it searched texts and digital messages as part of the public records request but found no responsive records, including from Zoeller, who had pledged to text after delivering the veto letter in one of the emails. The Governor’s Office provided no records reflecting communications with the legislative branch.
None of the records indicate what happened to the bills after being delivered to Evnen’s office.

‘The matter is concluded’
Evnen, speaking with the Examiner on Friday, reiterated that the Secretary of State’s Office’s role with legislation is to file it, and “when it’s brought to our office and we’re asked to file it, that’s what we do.”
“There’s a certain amount of confusion, really between the legislative branch and the Governor’s Office, about those line-item vetoes, and I think that what we will do is sit down and talk through together how that will be handled. That’s a really good thing to do,” he said.
Multiple lawmakers beyond Arch have quietly teased the suggestion with the Examiner, asking how much clearer the process can be.
Asked if there was a reason the original bills in the Secretary of State’s Office by about 5 p.m. could not be delivered by midnight on May 21, Evnen said: “You would have to ask the Governor’s Office.”
Strimple, asked about the remaining timeline on May 21 and May 22, said that with the Arch-Evnen-Pillen joint statement, “The matter is concluded.”



Nebraska Supreme Court funding challenges
One of the top targets of Gov. Jim Pillen’s intended line-item vetoes to the state’s budget bills was about $12 million in spending earmarked for the Nebraska Supreme Court.
Corey Steel, state court administrator for Nebraska, told lawmakers that the line-item vetoes to the courts could eliminate various services, including three problem-solving courts in Lancaster and Sarpy Counties, a drug court in Gov. Jim Pillen’s home of Platte County, transition living reimbursements for certain adults and non-statutory services for juveniles on probation.
Pillen told the Examiner that while he has the “utmost respect” for the separation of powers between Nebraska’s branches of government, he believes each one must look at government differently. 
He said the courts have significantly increased spending and have money sitting around.
Steel, as well as Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke, have said that position isn’t accurate and that increased spending has been in part due to legislation that came without new funds. The judicial branch leaders have said that the “money” held in various funds is now exhausted.
However, Pillen said he’s not backing down and that the reductions will be considered in 2026.
“We have to be fiscally responsible,” Pillen said, “and that’s all we’re asking.”

Health care systems including SSM Health, Aurora Health, UW Health and, most recently, Ascension have removed from their websites language related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).


The changes have come in the months since President Donald Trump has signed executive orders abolishing federal DEI programs.


UW Health publicly announced changes such as the removal of anti-racism modules titled “Being a leader in anti-racism” and “anti-racism funding” and replacement with modules called “Being a social impact leader” and “Community giving.”


Republished from Wisconsin Watch. 
Multiple Wisconsin health care systems have removed diversity, equity and inclusion language or resources from their websites in the wake of President Donald Trump’s federal ban on funding for DEI programming.
The systems include SSM Health, Aurora Health, UW Health and, most recently, Ascension. Froedtert ThedaCare Health has maintained its DEI webpage, though it removed a link to its equal employment opportunity policy in recent months.
Aurora Health, Ascension, Froedtert and SSM Health made the changes quietly, without directly alerting the public. UW Health, however, released an op-ed in Madison 365 April 8 explaining the changes.
“As we enter the next phase of this important work, we are further aligning with our organizational mission under the name of Social Impact and Belonging,” the op-ed said. “This reflects both the evolved nature of the work and our desire that these mission-focused priorities endure despite the current tumultuous political environment.”
The changes occurred in the weeks after President Donald Trump’s executive order abolishing DEI programs from all federally funded institutions and programs.
The executive order, issued Jan. 20, states the “Biden Administration forced illegal and immoral discrimination programs, going by the name ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI), into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government, in areas ranging from airline safety to the military.”
In response to attacks on DEI programs by the federal government, some organizations have pushed back, arguing Trump’s actions are a threat to a multiracial democracy. Some institutions are also suing the federal government for its actions, such as threatening to withhold federal grants and funding.
Harvard University has filed a lawsuit, citing First Amendment principles to protect “academic freedom” and “private actors’ speech.”
But while some federally funded institutions are pushing back, others are not.
Different approaches to DEI purge
In the past couple of months, SSM Health removed the word “diversity” from its website, including changing a page titled “Our Commitment to Diversity” to “Our Commitment to Culture & Inclusion.”
SSM has hospitals located throughout Wisconsin including Ripon, Fond du Lac, Waupun, Baraboo, Janesville, Madison and Monroe.
In changing the webpage, SSM Health also removed an entire section regarding its commitment to fostering a diverse workplace and health care center, including a section that read, “​​SSM Health makes it a point to work with diverse organizations broadening our reach into the communities we serve to support and promote a more inclusive society.”

The first image is the SSM Health website, as seen on March 4, 2025. The title of the page reads: “Our Commitment to Diversity.” The second image is the SSM Health website, as seen on April 1, 2025. The title of the page reads: “Our Commitment to Healthy Culture.” 
SSM Health also notably replaced the section discussing diversity with comment on SSM Health’s mission as a Catholic ministry. On the updated page, the system discusses its commitment to follow in the footsteps of its founders to ensure “all people have access to the high-quality, compassionate care they need.”
In removing the word “diversity,” SSM replaced the statement “At SSM Health, diversity is an integral part of who we are and a reflection of our mission and values” with “At SSM Health, inclusion is an integral part of who we are and a reflection of our Mission, Vision and Values.”
”Today, our belief that every person was created in the image of God with inherent dignity and value calls us to foster a healthy culture, inviting each person to be the best version of themselves,” SSM Health communications consultant Shari Wrezinski said when asked for comment.
Wrezinski said the organization’s mission has remained the same, and its communications, policies, programs and practices reflect the organization’s mission.
“This has not and will not change,” Wrezinski said. “As such, our website and other communications materials are continually updated as we strive to clearly convey our commitment to a welcoming environment where everyone feels valued and respected.”
Despite removing the section on diversity, SSM Health has maintained its equal opportunity section.
Froedtert did the opposite, by maintaining its webpages on diversity, equity and inclusion, but removing its equal opportunity policy document from the pages.

The first image is the Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin “Diversity and Inclusion” webpage, as seen on March 18, 2025. It shows a link to its “Equal Employment Opportunity” page. 
The second image is Froedtert’s “Diversity and Inclusion” webpage, as seen on March 25, 2025. It is missing the previously included link to its “Equal Employment Opportunity” page.
 Red circles added by Wisconsin Watch for emphasis.
The equal opportunity document, which can still be found online but was removed from the DEI website, specifically outlines Froedtert’s commitment and policy to maintain equitable and nondiscriminatory recruitment, hiring and human resources practices.
The document outlines two policies specifically: “FH is committed to its affirmative action policies and practices in employment programs to achieve a balanced workforce” and “FH will provide equal opportunity to all individuals, regardless of their race, creed, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability, military and veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status or any other characteristics protected by state or federal law.”
Froedtert did not respond to requests for comment.
The Froedtert system serves patients primarily in the Milwaukee area. Froedtert recently merged with ThedaCare, serving Wisconsin residents in the Fox Valley and Green Bay. In 2020, the system reported receiving tens of millions in federal funding through the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
While removing a link to an equal opportunity document may be a simple change, the Rev. Marilyn Miller, a partner in Leading for Racial Equity LLC, said every small change pushes society further back in achieving full access and equity.
“So it might be a small tweak now, but what does that open the door to later? So, yeah, it’s impactful because any change that’s stepping back from full equity is a problem,” Miller said. “There’s populations that don’t feel any security anymore.”
Aurora Health Care also has removed DEI language in the past couple of months since the executive order.
In 2018, Aurora merged with Advocate Health, a system with more than 26 hospitals throughout the Midwest. Advocate Aurora Health later merged with Atrium Health in 2022, creating the third largest nonprofit in the nation.
Earlier this year, Aurora removed an entire page on diversity, equity and inclusion. The page now redirects to Advocate’s page titled “Access & Opportunity.”
That change cut statements such as: “Our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy is anchored by our purpose to help people live well and to deliver safe, consistent, and equitable health outcomes and experiences for the patients and communities we serve.”
A spokesperson for Aurora Health Care said the organization will continue to “deliver compassionate, high-quality, consistent care for all those we serve.”
“As our newly combined purpose and commitments state, we lift everyone up by ensuring access and opportunity for all,” the spokesperson said. “To provide our patients and communities clear and consistent information that explains our programs, policies and services, we are making various changes to our websites.”
Ascension, one of the largest nonprofit hospital systems in the nation, took down the entire page on diversity, equity and inclusion. The health care system currently operates at over 165 locations in Milwaukee, Racine, Appleton and Fox Valley.  The system still has modules on “Identifying & Addressing Barriers to Health” and “Ensuring Health Equity.” Ascension did not respond to a request for a comment.
Making a statement
UW Health removed its page on diversity, equity and inclusion, replacing it with a page titled “social impact in belonging.” In doing so, UW Health removed “anti-racism” from its entire website. It used to be one of the main themes.
UW Health removed the anti-racism modules titled “Being a leader in anti-racism” and “anti-racism funding,” and now in their place are modules called “Being a social impact leader” and “Community giving.”

The first image is the UW Health website as seen on Feb. 11, 2025. The site reads “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion,” which was later changed to “Social Impact and Belonging.”
The second image is the UW Health website as seen on April 15, 2025. The site reads “Social Impact and Belonging,” which was changed from  “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.”
Chief Social Impact Officer Shiva Bidar-Sielaff and CEO Alan Kaplan addressed the changes in a video, stating social impact and belonging align with their mission, values and strategies as a health care organization.
“At UW Health, social impact refers to the effects health care policies, practices and interventions have on the well-being of individuals and communities, improving health outcomes, access to care and quality of life,” Bidar-Sielaff said. “Belonging is the understanding that you are valued and respected for who you are as an individual.”
UW Health reported receiving $315 million in federal funding, totaling over half of the $622 million in grant funds — federal and non-federal — awarded to the School of Medicine and Public Health. That total is 37% of all grant funding awarded to UW-Madison.
Despite claims by health care centers that missions remain the same, advocacy groups in Wisconsin are raising concerns regarding the impact these changes could have on communities in Wisconsin.
Chris Allen, president and CEO of Diverse & Resilient — an advocacy group focused on health inequities for LGBTQ+ people in Wisconsin — said these quiet language shifts are significant.
“They send a message that commitments to addressing disparities may be weakening, even if that’s not the stated intention,” Allen said.
William Parke Sutherland, government affairs director at Kids Forward, a statewide policy center that advocates for low-income and minority families, said many health care partners feel pressured to preserve funding sources.
In Wisconsin, maternal mortality rates are 2.5 times higher for Black women than white women. Maternal morbidities — or serious birth complications — were the highest among Black women and people enrolled in BadgerCare, the state’s largest Medicaid program. From 2020 to 2022 there were 7.8 stillbirth deaths per 1,000 births among Black babies, compared with 4.5 among white babies.
Disparities in maternal and infant mortality rates could be attributed to stress caused by poverty, lack of access to quality care, or systemic racism, according to health care researchers. If a mother is stressed over a long period of time, that can cause elevated levels of stress hormones, which could increase premature births or low birth weights for infants.
For Black women, midwives have been found to reduce the disparities they otherwise may experience during pregnancy, reducing the risk of maternal mortality or morbidity. Access to midwives is currently covered by Medicaid, so losing federal funding could harm these services.
Regardless of language, “Wisconsin’s racial disparities in health access and outcomes aren’t going away on their own,” Sutherland said in an email.
Removing language that acknowledges DEI efforts will not reduce the health care disparities felt by Wisconsin residents, Sutherland said. Federal funding cuts could also hurt rural families in Wisconsin, specifically those who rely on Medicaid for their health care needs.
“We cannot begin to address these challenges if we’re not willing to acknowledge them,” Sutherland said. “A colorblind approach has not helped in the past.”

(Photo by Kathryn Houghton for KFF Health News). HAMILTON — Scientists are often careful to take off their work badges when they leave the campus of one of the nation’s top research facilities, here in southwestern Montana’s Bitterroot Valley.
It’s a reflection of the long-standing tension caused by Rocky Mountain Laboratories’ improbable location in this conservative, blue-collar town of 5,000 that was built on logging.
Many residents are proud of the internationally recognized research unfolding at the National Institutes of Health facility and acknowledge that Rocky Mountain Labs has become an economic driver for Hamilton. But a few locals resent what they consider the elitist scientists at the facility, which has employed about 500 people in recent years. Or they fear the contagious pathogens studied there could escape the labs’ well-protected walls.
That split widened with the COVID-19 pandemic and the divisions that emerged from mask mandates and vaccine development. In 2023, Matt Rosendale, a Republican who was then a U.S. representative from Montana, falsely tied the lab to the origins of covid in an attempt to cut its funding. Now, Hamilton is a prime example of how the Trump administration’s mass federal layoffs and cancellation of research grants are having ripple effects in communities far from Washington, D.C.
On an April afternoon, hundreds of people filled the sidewalks at an intersection of Hamilton’s usually quiet downtown, waving signs that read “Hands Off Federal Workers” and “Stop Strangling Science.” Some driving by honked in support, rolled their windows down, and cheered. Others flipped off the rallygoers and cast insults at them. A passing bicyclist taunted protesters with chants of “DOGE” — short for the Department of Government Efficiency, the federal initiative led by billionaire Elon Musk to cut costs that has driven mass layoffs and slashed programs.
 
Kim Hasenkrug, a former Rocky Mountain Labs researcher of 31 years, who retired in 2022, joined the crowd. He slammed President Donald Trump’s promise to let Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “go wild” on health issues.
“We’re beginning to see what ‘going wild’ looks like,” Hasenkrug said. “These cuts will not streamline research. They will throttle it.”
As of early May, 41 Rocky Mountain Labs workers had been let go or told their contracts would end this summer, and nine more had retired early, according to researchers employed by the facility. KFF Health News spoke with 10 current or former Rocky Mountain Labs workers who requested anonymity to speak about information that has not been publicly released. The federal government has also slashed billions of dollars for research, including at least $29 million in grants to Montana recipients, ranging from university scientists to the state health department. That’s according to HHS data confirmed by KFF Health News.
Scientists who remain in Hamilton said research has slowed. They’ve struggled to buy basic gear amid federal directives that changed how orders are placed. Now, more cuts are planned for workers who buy and deliver critical, niche supplies, such as antibodies, according to researchers at the labs.
The Department of Health and Human Services didn’t respond to repeated requests for more information on the government’s cuts to research, including questions about the changes in Hamilton. Deputy press secretary Emily Hilliard said the department is committed to the “continuity of essential research.”
Some within the lab feel as if they’ve become public enemies or outcasts, unable to defend themselves without risking their jobs. Postdoctoral scientists just starting their careers are seeing options dwindle. Some workers whose employment contracts expire within days or weeks have been in the dark about whether they’ll be renewed. At least one Rocky Mountain Labs scientist moved to another country to research infectious disease, citing “current turmoil,” according to an email sent from the scientist to co-workers that was reviewed by KFF Health News.
“The remaining staff has been discredited, disrespected, and discouraged from remaining in public service,” Hasenkrug said.
The National Institutes of Health is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world. It has 27 institutes and centers focused on understanding illness and disabilities and improving health. The agency’s research has helped lead to vaccines against major diseases — from smallpox to COVID — and has been behind the majority of medicines approved for the U.S. market. That research also generated more than $94.5 billion in new economic activity nationwide, according to United for Medical Research, a coalition of research groups and advocates.
The Trump administration aims to eliminate roughly 1,200 jobs at the NIH and shrink its budget by 40%. The administration’s budget proposal to cut NIH funding calls the agency’s spending “wasteful,” deems its research “risky,” and accuses it of promoting “dangerous ideologies.”
It’s a dramatic political turnabout for the NIH, which for decades enjoyed bipartisan support in Washington. From 2015 to 2023, its annual budget grew by more than $17 billion.
As of 2023, Rocky Mountain Labs was one of only 51 facilities in the world with the highest level of biosafety precautions, according to the Global BioLabs mapping project. In April, HHS indefinitely stalled work at another of those labs, the Integrated Research Facility in Frederick, Maryland, Wired reported.
Kennedy has said the nation should pause funding infectious disease research, and the White House has said it plans to intensify scrutiny of gain-of-function research, which involves altering a pathogen to study its spread.
Hamilton, in Ravalli County, is a place of scientists, ranchers, and outdoor recreationists. Here, 1 in 8 people live below the federal poverty line. Nearly 70% of county residents who participated in the 2024 presidential election voted for Trump, and Trump signs still dot U.S. Highway 93 leading to town. In the thick of the COVID pandemic, the sheriff and county commissioners refused to enforce a statewide mandate to mask in public spaces while Rocky Mountain Labs researchers worked to understand the virus.
The lab’s work dates to 1900, and even early on it was controversial. Rocky Mountain spotted fever was killing people in the valley. Researchers found the cause — ticks — and worked to eradicate the disease-carrying bugs by requiring ranchers to treat their cattle.
That created resentment among locals who “already harbored a healthy distrust of government-imposed programs,” according to an NIH account. The tension came to a head in 1913 when a “dipping vat” used to chemically treat cattle was blown up with dynamite and another damaged with sledgehammers.
Now, some residents and local leaders are worried about the economic consequences of an exodus of federal workers and their salaries. Most of the county is government-managed public land, and the first wave of federal cuts hit U.S. Forest Service workers who do everything from clear trails to fight wildfires.
Rocky Mountain Labs generates hundreds of millions of dollars for the local economy by creating more work for industries including construction and bringing more people into the city’s shops, a 2023 University of Montana study found. The rural community is also a base for international vaccine developer GSK due to the lab’s presence. Kathleen Quinn, a vice president of communications for the company, said GSK’s business with government agencies “continues as usual” for now amid federal changes and that it’s “too early to say what any longer-term impact could be.”
“Our community is impacted more than most,” said City Councilor Darwin Ernst. He spoke during an overflowing March town hall to discuss the federal government cuts. Hundreds of people turned out on the weeknight asking city councilors to do something.
Ernst, a former researcher at the lab who now works as a real estate broker and appraiser, said in an interview he’s starting to see more homes enter the market, which he attributed to the atmosphere of uncertainty and former federal workers’ having to find jobs elsewhere.
“Someone recently left with her entire family. Because of the layoffs, they can’t afford to live here,” he said. “Some people retire here but that’s not everyone.”
Jane Shigley said she’s been a Hamilton resident for more than 30 years and initially thought the government would find “some inefficiencies, no big deal.” But now she’s worried about her hometown’s future.
“Something’s going on that we can’t control,” Shigley said. “And the people that it’s happening to aren’t allowed to talk to us about it.”
The City Council sent a letter to federal officials in April asking for formal consultation prior to any significant changes, given Hamilton’s “interdependence” with Rocky Mountain Labs and the federally controlled lands surrounding Hamilton. As of May, city leaders hadn’t received a response.
People in town are split on how badly the federal cuts will affect Hamilton.
Julie Foster, executive director of the Ravalli County Economic Development Authority, said the community survived the decline of logging, and she thinks Rocky Mountain Labs will survive, too.
“It will be here. There may be bumps in the road, but this is a resilient place,” Foster said.
Even amid the cuts, Rocky Mountain Labs is in the process of a building expansion that, so far, hasn’t stopped. And researchers’ work continues. This spring, scientists there helped make the first identification in Montana of a species of tick known to carry Lyme disease.

Canadian wildfire smoke that blew into the Great Lakes region is expected to clear from northern Michigan this weekend — at least for now.
The Michigan Air Quality Division said Thursday morning that the heavy smoke across the Upper Peninsula was already clearing out. Earlier in the week, there were unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter in the air across parts of the Upper Peninsula and northern Michigan, with smoke settling here for days before moving further south.
While division forecasters expect Friday to be the last day for advisories from this round of smoke, they said it was too early to put out a firm forecast much beyond that: “There is still a considerable amount of smoke in Canada and the models are indicating a late weekend frontal system could draw down more smoke, next week.”
The state has been issuing air quality alerts for much of the region. As of Thursday, there were still advisories across the Lower Peninsula for sensitive groups, including people with health issues like asthma.
People can take measures to protect their health, such as limiting outdoor activities, closing windows, and running air conditioners with high-quality filters.
This is the latest in a series of intense wildfire seasons fueled by dry conditions in Canada, resulting in smoky springs and summers in the Midwest.
“For the last few years, you’ve combined what has been somewhat persistent wildfire problems in Canada with an air flow that is moving some of that air from Canada down into the United States,” said Jim Keysor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gaylord.
It can be difficult to predict how far-away wildfires will affect air quality in different regions, since smoke is influenced by factors like wind, pressure systems, weather fronts and geography.
“Wherever the wind blows, the smoke is going to go,” said Alec Kownacki, a meteorologist with Michigan’s Air Quality Division. “And at different levels of the atmosphere you can have differing wind directions.”
Over the past week, low pressure systems funneled smoke from fires in the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba toward the upper Midwest.
“Along with that wind shift, a cold front came through. And what happens on the back end of a cold front — you have a lot of air sinking,” Kownacki said.
Local weather patterns also have an influence. While rain can help improve air quality, the rain that swept across parts of the region earlier this week actually pushed smoke down toward the earth, Keysor said, making exposure more likely.

“It’s actually helping to bring down some of that smoke that’s higher up into the atmosphere, which normally would have been way up there,” he said. “That wouldn’t have bothered us a whole lot.”
One positive, Keysor added, was that modeling for smoke forecasts has become more accessible in the National Weather Service offices in recent years. Their smoke forecasts are informed by state data.
“The programmers that were putting some of those models together began to look at that [smoke] parameter a little bit more and to make it a product that we could view more readily,” he said. The weather models they use are improving. “We’re able to see more of it than we used to.”
The heavy smoke that was hanging across the Upper Peninsula and northern Michigan has now moved further south, including around Lansing.
“It’s wreaking havoc for us down here right now,” said Kownacki, who is based there.
Conditions are expected to improve across much of the state over the next few days, but there may be more smoke from the fires in the near future.

“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.

The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
Universities try 3-year degrees to save students time, money

A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.

Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
 ‘Can’t wait for Washington’

Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
More public colleges admit high schoolers even before they’ve applied

Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
 Repayment

Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
Transparency bills seek to reveal the true costs of college

“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
 ‘Incentive to hike prices’

Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

Peter Crosby, a Black sheriff, was shot in the head in the wake of the Vicksburg Massacre in which armed White Leagues overthrew the Reconstruction government in Mississippi, killing as many as 300 Black Americans they regarded as a threat, including some of Crosby’s deputies. 
President Ulysses S. Grant had sent troops to quell the violence and enable the sheriff’s safe return. After Crosby returned, a white deputy shot him in the head. Although the sheriff survived, he never recovered, and the deputy who shot him was never prosecuted. 
The event became part of the Mississippi Plan —violence, terror and corruption to restore white supremacy.

A few hundred supporters packed into the gym of Everett High School in Lansing as U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly), U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) and Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel detailed how the Trump administration’s policies would impact everyone, particularly individuals with limited income.
The Michigan Democratic Party has hosted several similar events in Republican districts throughout the state, Hertel said, noting House Republicans had been instructed to avoid town halls with their constituents. 
“The most basic thing for a public servant is to be able to sit and answer questions. … The least someone can do is sit down with people and explain their votes” Hertel said. 
  U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) speaks at a June 6, 2025 town hall in Lansing. | Kyle Davidson
And the 7th Congressional District’s current representative, Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) has a lot of explaining to do, Hertel said, slamming Barrett for supporting Republican’s spending plan, and arguing the representative failed to stand up to the President and make himself available to his constituents
A Barrett spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. 
Prior to taking questions, McDonald Rivet slammed the Republican spending effort, telling audience members that it would take away healthcare and raise the cost of medicine, education and energy in order to deliver a tax break to the wealthy. 
“Oh, and by the way, it’s going to increase the deficit by several trillion dollars,” She said. 
Slotkin looked back on the president’s first term, when Trump was looking to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which expanded access to Medicaid and barred insurance providers from denying people coverage or charging them due to preexisting health conditions.
“It was the first thing he talked about when he got sworn in, he even had the House of Representatives vote to repeal Obamacare. And now we not only still have it, we expanded it, and how? Because we educated people,” Slotkin said. 
However, rather than cutting people’s healthcare outright, Slotkin argued Trump is aiming to hide those cuts by requiring individuals to reregister for Medicaid every six months, making it harder to qualify and more difficult to sign up.
While the current proposal would implement work requirements for Medicaid recipients, Slotkin noted it also raises the age limit for those requirements to 64. 
According to KFF, an independent health policy organization, 92% of medicaid recipients under 65 are already working full or part time. 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that Republican’s budget plan would result in 10.9 million additional people being uninsured in 2034, with 7.8 million fewer individuals on Medicaid due to the policy’s proposed work requirements. 
Even individuals who are not on Medicaid will feel the impacts of cuts to the program, Slotkin said, noting that nursing homes, hospitals and mental health facilities all rely on Medicaid funding.
“I would just say this bill is designed to really be a perfect storm for poor people. If you are living at or below the poverty line, you’re getting hit in every direction. Medicaid, your health care; SNAP your food; a bunch of programs, right, that you depend on. … They are paying for those tax benefits for the most wealthy by really the perfect storm of cuts for  the poorest among us,” Slotkin said. 
On top of cutting SNAP benefits by $300 billion, the Department of Government Efficiency had canceled $1 billion in funding to programs supporting school meals and food banks, McDonald Rivet said. 
“So you’re that hungry kid and you have lost access to a food bank. You have lost access to food at school, and now you don’t have SNAP benefits. This is the America that this bill creates,” McDonald Rivet said.

Alongside questions on cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, audience members asked the lawmakers about the legal challenges levied against the Trump administration, and Democrats’ plans to counter Republicans heading into the 2026 mid-term election. 
On Friday, the Trump Administration backed down in its resistance of a Supreme Court order demanding that the administration facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador three months ago. 
However, the fight goes beyond Abrego Gracia, into whether the executive branch needs to obey orders from the Supreme Court, Slotkin said. 
“Now, we haven’t had to deal with this issue in the years past because Democrats and Republicans have largely said, ‘Huh, if the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court issues a court order, we’re going to follow it.’ Trump is pushing the boundaries on all the democratic values and principles most of us grew up with,” Slotkin said. 
Should an individual defy a federal court order, U.S. marshals would eventually be sent to enforce that order, Slotkin said. However, the U.S. marshals are controlled by the United States attorney general. 
Should the U.S. marshals receive a request to enforce a Supreme Court order against the president, Slotkin raised the question on whether Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Trump loyalist, would approve it.

“We’ve needed to have this fight. We need to have it out. We need a court order that he needs to obey, and we need to precipitate this conversation on the U.S. marshals. But today was an important sign that they don’t want to get to that point. They don’t want to wait until the U.S. marshals are potentially getting an order to activate,” Slotkin said. 
In preparing to take on the Trump Administration, Slotkin said she’d gone back to her roots in national security and crafted a war plan in the form of a 17-page powerpoint, with plans to lay out her vision of the nation’s future under Democratic leadership. 
“It’s about facing our problems head on and saying the only way we do well as a country, the only way that we have a strong middle class going forward, the American Dream going forward, is if we face these issues and have a vision. And it’s economic, it’s about national security, and it’s about our democracy,” Slotkin said.

(Photo by Seth Wenig/The Associated Press)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.

When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states, including Rhode Island, plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.

The statewide average annual wage reached $95,160 last year, according to the Washington  Employment Security Department. That’s 6.8% higher than in 2023, when the average was $89,138. 
The increase was driven by a 0.7% boost in employment and a 7.5% hike in total wages and salaries, which grew by nearly $23.5 billion in 2024, the department reported.
Statewide, the average weekly wage rose from $1,714 in 2023 to $1,830 in 2024, according to figures in a department press release.
Preliminary data for each county will not be available until later this month. Those numbers will make clear how much King County’s higher-paid workforce pushes up the average.
In 2023, King County recorded an average salary of just over $120,000, followed by Snohomish County at nearly $79,000. Wahkiakum County had the lowest at roughly $43,000 with Okanogan County slightly higher. Overall, in 23 counties, the average yearly salary was under $60,000.
The 2024 figures are used by the Employment Security Department to calculate minimum and maximum unemployment benefits for new claims opened on or after July 6.
Starting that day, the minimum weekly benefit for new claims will increase by $24 to $366. The amount is 20% of the average weekly wage. The maximum weekly benefit will increase by $73 to $1,152. It is calculated as the greater of $496 or 63% of the average weekly wage.
No one can receive a weekly benefit amount that exceeds their average weekly wage.
The department also uses the average annual wage to calibrate maximum benefits for Paid Family and Medical Leave claims that are filed starting Jan. 1, 2026. Weekly payments will top out at $1,647 with the minimum amount remaining at $100.
Historically, Washington’s annual wage exceeds the national average. The state Office of Financial Management reported in 2022 that Washington had an $83,665 average salary compared to the national mark of $70,282.
In September, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Washington’s average weekly wage of $1,781 ranked higher than every other state. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/money-dollars.jpeg,,,2025-06-07 07:00:12.554364

Legislators to pursue bills to raise non-motorized-trail-building money through lottery funds, state park fees.
The post People want more Wyoming trails. Lawmakers ponder ways to pay for them.  appeared first on WyoFile .","A growing body of hikers, mountain bikers, cross-country skiers and backpackers clearly want more non-motorized trails built in Wyoming, Deputy Director of Wyoming State Parks and Cultural Resources Chris Floyd told lawmakers Thursday. What is not so clear is how to pay for them. 
“We have more requests for non-motorized trails — summer or winter, warm weather, cold weather trails — than any other types of requests that we received through the Office of Outdoor Recreation,” Floyd told the Legislature’s Joint Travel, Recreation, Wildlife & Cultural Resources Committee meeting in Dubois. “That has been true for quite a few years.”
As outdoor recreation continues to grow as a core economic pillar in Wyoming and innovations like ebikes get more varied users outside, Floyd said, the state should strategize for how it can pay for those trails. He suggested Wyoming take a page from its motorized trails systems — designated for snowmobiles, side-by-sides and other vehicles with motors — and implement a pay-to-play fee. 
“We have a motorized program that’s great for motorized trails, and what you might look at is using that model for non-motorized trails as well,” Floyd said. 
Motorized users pay a fuel tax that helps fund projects through Recreation Trails Program grants. Snowmobilers pay a permit fee for a decal they affix to their machine. With that decal, they can ride a huge variety of groomed and ungroomed terrain across the state. Wyoming recently increased its decal fee for the first time since 2014 — a move supported by snowmobilers. Those fees help pay for the establishment and maintenance of trails, including grooming. 
Applying that model directly to non-motorized trail users, however, could be tricky in light of federal public lands jurisdiction and other factors, lawmakers said. 
Rather than pursue a straight-ahead user fee, the travel committee opted to draft bills that could help raise trail-building money through lottery funds and state park fees.
How we got here 
Outdoor recreation has been growing in popularity in Wyoming for decades, and the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated that trend as it spurred more Americans to spend time outdoors. 
That uptick brought record visitation to national and state parks in Wyoming and generated significant revenue. In 2023, the outdoor recreation industry contributed $2.2 billion to Wyoming’s economy, according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.

In response to the increasing crowds, Wyoming created a trust fund specifically to pay for outdoor recreation infrastructure. Those too have constituted an economic boon, according to a new report from the University of Wyoming’s Jay Kemmerer WORTH Institute. 
However, the trust fund will take some time to mature, Floyd said Thursday, which will limit the amount of money that can be spent in the near term on the expensive endeavor of trail building. 
Wyoming’s Office of Outdoor Recreation has received $47 million in requests for non-motorized trails in the last five years, Floyd said. Federal American Rescue Plan Act money enabled Wyoming to fund $24 million of that, but those were one-time expenditures that won’t be refreshed. The federal Recreation Trails Program does provide for reliable funding for non-motorized trails, he added, but it only amounts to about $400,000 annually. 
“And I have to tell you, for a state our size, that does not go very far,” Floyd said. That’s where user fees could come in, he said. 
A Wyoming mountain-bike specific user fee was floated in 2022, but failed to gain traction. But outdoor recreation’s growth, Floyd said, hasn’t slowed down. Wyoming is already lagging behind neighboring states in the mileage of non-motorized trails it provides, he said. 
“So we’re going to just see more population, more people out there on the ground,” he said. “And we’ve got to figure out where we’re going to put them and how we’re going to manage all this. And a lot of those users, of course, are going to be non-motorized users. So we need all the tools that we can at our disposal to handle that kind of growth.”
If the state isn’t proactive, he said, it will lead to user-created trails and other detriment to the landscape. 
Policy mechanisms
Committee members weren’t wild about a straight-ahead user fee, however. There are questions about how to enforce the fee, track it and whether it’s workable across federal agencies like the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service, which manage the majority of Wyoming’s public lands.

Floyd furnished the committee with a list of if and how other states generate funds for non-motorized recreation. At least 10 other states have user fees in place. They range from winter recreation parking fees in Washington to horse and off-road cycling permits in Indiana. Colorado doesn’t have a user fee, but instead pulls lottery revenue through a program known as Great Outdoors Colorado. That program generated $69 million in 2024.
Sen. Larry Hicks, R-Baggs, urged the committee to be pragmatic. In 2026, the Wyoming Legislature will convene for a budget session, he noted, which requires bills to have more support to even get introduced. 
“I believe in user fees, but I think that’s a long shot,” Hicks said. “What I’d like to do, if we can, is focus on what we can do” with measures such as allowing existing revenues like lodging taxes to be used on trail building. 
Hicks proposed a bill that would divert money from Wyoming’s lottery proceeds to fund an outdoor recreation program. The committee passed the motion and will consider that bill draft during its next meeting. 
Sen. Brian Boner, R-Douglas, proposed a bill that authorizes Wyoming State Parks to charge extra fees on top of what it currently does. The committee also passed that motion for future consideration at its next meeting. 
Wyoming Pathways’ Executive Director Mike Kusiek supports the user fee for non-motorized trail users. A technical problem prevented him from testifying over Zoom on Thursday, but Kusiek emailed comments of support to the committee. 
“Great demand exists, and we all win when users pay into the development of the system from which they are using,” Kusiek told WyoFile on Friday. “The trails are built professionally and responsibly, quality of life improves, economies grow and land managers can fulfill their missions.”

When Thomas Fugate graduated from college last year with a degree in politics, he celebrated in a social media post about the exciting opportunities that lay beyond campus life in Texas. “Onward and upward!” he wrote, with an emoji of a rocket shooting into space.
His career blastoff came quickly. A year after graduation, the 22-year-old with no apparent national security expertise is now a Department of Homeland Security official overseeing the government’s main hub for terrorism prevention, including an $18 million grant program intended to help communities combat violent extremism.
The White House appointed Fugate, a former Trump campaign worker who interned at the hard-right Heritage Foundation, to a Homeland Security role that was expanded to include the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships. Known as CP3, the office has led nationwide efforts to prevent hate-fueled attacks, school shootings and other forms of targeted violence.
Fugate’s appointment is the latest shock for an office that has been decimated since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and began remaking national security to give it a laser focus on immigration.
News of the appointment has trickled out in recent weeks, raising alarm among counterterrorism researchers and nonprofit groups funded by CP3. Several said they turned to LinkedIn for intel on Fugate — an unknown in their field — and were stunned to see a photo of “a college kid” with a flag pin on his lapel posing with a sharply arched eyebrow. No threat prevention experience is listed in his employment history.

Typically, people familiar with CP3 say, a candidate that green wouldn’t have gotten an interview for a junior position, much less be hired to run operations. According to LinkedIn, the bulk of Fugate’s leadership experience comes from having served as secretary general of a Model United Nations club.
“Maybe he’s a wunderkind. Maybe he’s Doogie Howser and has everything at 21 years old, or whatever he is, to lead the office. But that’s not likely the case,” said one counterterrorism researcher who has worked with CP3 officials for years. “It sounds like putting the intern in charge.”
In the past seven weeks, at least five high-profile targeted attacks have unfolded across the U.S., including a car bombing in California and the gunning down of two Israeli Embassy aides in Washington. Against this backdrop, current and former national security officials say, the Trump administration’s decision to shift counterterrorism resources to immigration and leave the violence-prevention portfolio to inexperienced appointees is “reckless.”
“We’re entering very dangerous territory,” one longtime U.S. counterterrorism official said.
The fate of CP3 is one example of the fallout from deep cuts that have eliminated public health and violence-prevention initiatives across federal agencies.
The once-bustling office of around 80 employees now has fewer than 20, former staffers say. Grant work stops, then restarts. One senior civil servant was reassigned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency via an email that arrived late on a Saturday.
The office’s mission has changed overnight, with a pivot away from focusing on domestic extremism, especially far-right movements. The “terrorism” category that framed the agency’s work for years was abruptly expanded to include drug cartels, part of what DHS staffers call an overarching message that border security is the only mission that matters. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has largely left terrorism prevention to the states.
ProPublica sent DHS a detailed list of questions about Fugate’s position, his lack of national security experience and the future of the department’s prevention work. A senior agency official replied with a statement saying only that Fugate’s CP3 duties were added to his role as an aide in an Immigration & Border Security office.
“Due to his success, he has been temporarily given additional leadership responsibilities in the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships office,” the official wrote in an email. “This is a credit to his work ethic and success on the job.”
ProPublica sought an interview with Fugate through DHS and the White House, but there was no response.
The Trump administration rejects claims of a retreat from terrorism prevention, noting partnerships with law enforcement agencies and swift investigations of recent attacks. “The notion that this single office is responsible for preventing terrorism is not only incorrect, it’s ignorant,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an email.
Through intermediaries, ProPublica sought to speak with CP3 employees but received no reply. Talking is risky; tales abound of Homeland Security personnel undergoing lie-detector tests in leak investigations, as Secretary Kristi Noem pledged in March.
Accounts of Fugate’s arrival and the dismantling of CP3 come from current and former Homeland Security personnel, grant recipients and terrorism-prevention advocates who work closely with the office and have at times been confidants for distraught staffers. All spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the Trump administration.
In these circles, two main theories have emerged to explain Fugate’s unusual ascent. One is that the Trump administration rewarded a Gen Z campaign worker with a resume-boosting title that comes with little real power because the office is in shambles.
The other is that the White House installed Fugate to oversee a pivot away from traditional counterterrorism lanes and to steer resources toward MAGA-friendly sheriffs and border security projects before eventually shuttering operations. In this scenario, Fugate was described as “a minder” and “a babysitter.”
DHS did not address a ProPublica question about this characterization.
Rising MAGA star
The CP3 homepage boasts about the office’s experts in disciplines including emergency management, counterterrorism, public health and social work.
Fugate brings a different qualification prized by the White House: loyalty to the president.
On Instagram, Fugate traced his political awakening to nine years ago, when as a 13-year-old “in a generation deprived of hope, opportunity, and happiness, I saw in one man the capacity for real and lasting change: Donald Trump.”
Fugate is a self-described “Trumplican” who interned for state lawmakers in Austin before graduating magna cum laude a year ago with a degree in politics and law from the University of Texas at San Antonio. Instagram photos and other public information from the past year chronicle his lightning-fast rise in Trump world.
Starting in May 2024, photos show a newly graduated Fugate at a Texas GOP gathering launching his first campaign, a bid for a delegate spot at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. He handed out gummy candy and a flier with a photo of him in a tuxedo at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. Fugate won an alternate slot.
The next month, he was in Florida celebrating Trump’s 78th birthday with the Club 47 fan group in West Palm Beach. “I truly wish I could say more about what I’m doing, but more to come soon!” he wrote in a caption, with a smiley emoji in sunglasses.
Posts in the run-up to the election show Fugate spending several weeks in Washington, a time he called “surreal and invigorating.” In July, he attended the Republican convention, sporting the Texas delegation’s signature cowboy hat in photos with MAGA luminaries such as former Cabinet Secretary Ben Carson and then-Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.
By late summer, Fugate was posting from the campaign trail as part of Trump’s advance team, pictured at one stop standing behind the candidate in a crowd of young supporters. When Trump won the election, Fugate marked the moment with an emotional post about believing in him “from the very start, even to the scorn and contempt of my peers.”
“Working alongside a dedicated, driven group of folks, we faced every challenge head-on and, together, celebrated a victorious outcome,” Fugate wrote on Instagram.
In February, the White House appointed Fugate as a “special assistant” assigned to an immigration office at Homeland Security. He assumed leadership of CP3 last month to fill a vacancy left by previous Director Bill Braniff, an Army veteran with more than two decades of national security experience who resigned in March when the administration began cutting his staff.
In his final weeks as director, Braniff had publicly defended the office’s achievements, noting the dispersal of nearly $90 million since 2020 to help communities combat extremist violence. According to the office’s 2024 report to Congress, in recent years CP3 grant money was used in more than 1,100 efforts to identify violent extremism at the community level and interrupt the radicalization process.
“CP3 is the inheritor of the primary and founding mission of DHS — to prevent terrorism,” Braniff wrote on LinkedIn when he announced his resignation.
In conversations with colleagues, CP3 staffers have expressed shock at how little Fugate knows about the basics of his role and likened meetings with him to “career counseling.” DHS did not address questions about his level of experience.
One grant recipient called Fugate’s appointment “an insult” to Braniff and a setback in the move toward evidence-based approaches to terrorism prevention, a field still reckoning with post-9/11 work that was unscientific and stigmatizing to Muslims.
“They really started to shift the conversation and shift the public thinking. It was starting to get to the root of the problem,” the grantee said. “Now that’s all gone.”
Critics of Fugate’s appointment stress that their anger isn’t directed at an aspiring politico enjoying a whirlwind entry to Washington. The problem, they say, is the administration’s seemingly cavalier treatment of an office that was funding work on urgent national security concerns.
“The big story here is the undermining of democratic institutions,” a former Homeland Security official said. “Who’s going to volunteer to be the next civil servant if they think their supervisor is an apparatchik?”
Season of attacks
Spring brought a burst of extremist violence, a trend analysts fear could extend into the summer given inflamed political tensions and the disarray of federal agencies tasked with monitoring threats.
In April, an arson attack targeted Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, who blamed the breach on “security failures.” Four days later, a mass shooter stormed onto the Florida State University campus, killing two and wounding six others. The alleged attacker had espoused white supremacist views and used Hitler as a profile picture for a gaming account.
Attacks continued in May with the apparent car bombing of a fertility clinic in California. The suspected assailant, the only fatality, left a screed detailing violent beliefs against life and procreation. A few days later, on May 21, a gunman allegedly radicalized by the war in Gaza killed two Israeli Embassy aides outside a Jewish museum in Washington.
June opened with a firebombing attack in Colorado that wounded 12, including a Holocaust survivor, at a gathering calling for the release of Israeli hostages. The suspect’s charges include a federal hate crime.
If attacks continue at that pace, warn current and former national security officials, cracks will begin to appear in the nation’s pared-down counterterrorism sector.
“If you cut the staff and there are major attacks that lead to a reconsideration, you can’t scale up staff once they’re fired,” said the U.S. counterterrorism official, who opposes the administration’s shift away from prevention.
Contradictory signals are coming out of Homeland Security about the future of CP3 work, especially the grant program. Staffers have told partners in the advocacy world that Fugate plans to roll out another funding cycle soon. The CP3 website still touts the program as the only federal grant “solely dedicated to helping local communities develop and strengthen their capabilities” against terrorism and targeted violence.
But Homeland Security’s budget proposal to Congress for the next fiscal year suggests a bleaker future. The department recommended eliminating the threat-prevention grant program, explaining that it “does not align with DHS priorities.”
The former Homeland Security official said the decision “means that the department founded to prevent terrorism in the United States no longer prioritizes preventing terrorism in the United States.”

The night before, Eisenhower had penciled a note, to be read publicly and placing the blame on himself in the event the invasion failed. (U.S. Army/Library of Congress)With the 81st anniversary of D-Day, my thoughts turn to the experiences of those Americans who fought in that final chapter of World War II — and one American in particular: my father, Donald Croston Smith, then a 19-year-old soldier in the U.S. Army. When his troop, the storied 82nd Airborne Division, liberated a concentration camp near the German village of Woebbelin, what they discovered there was beyond anything they had witnessed since landing in Normandy.
Not far from Hamburg, the Woebbelin camp imprisoned about 5,000 people in early 1945. By the time the 82nd arrived, only half were alive. The living conditions were so deplorable that the commanding general described the scene as more than a human being could stand. My father and his comrades ordered Germans in neighboring villages to walk past the burial sites. They claimed that they were not aware of the camp. They claimed they were not Nazis.
My father found those assertions absurd. He wondered how this could have been allowed to happen and why the rule of law did not prevail over the arbitrary whims of the Nazis.
After the war, he went to law school and practiced law in the state of Kansas for 30 years. He then served as a Kansas State District Court Judge for another ten years until 1989. He died in 2002. On several occasions, he told me about his incomprehension that a sophisticated society and country, which Germany certainly was in the 1930s, had become mesmerized with a leader and regime that completely bastardized the concept of rule of law. He was enormously troubled that a government’s leadership could use “the law,” as it defined it, to commit mass murder.
In the 1960s, we lived in a small western Kansas town, hardly an epicenter of the civil rights struggle. Nevertheless, my father spoke out repeatedly about the civil rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. He was part of a small group that provided housing for Black students attending the local community college. At one point, I asked whether he thought he might lose clients who disagreed with his stance. He stuck to his guns, insisting he had an obligation to act when he observed something wrong.
Whether and to what degree what he had witnessed in Germany — the direct result of the destruction of the “rule of law” — influenced his later life is difficult to say. Yet what is abundantly clear is that he had seen with his own eyes what a ruthlessly depraved society had done under the pretense of “the law.” One of the major reasons Hitler and his henchmen were able to do what they did was their replacement of the rule of law with the rule of power.
I wonder what my father would make of the unending attacks by the Trump administration against the rule of law and the judiciary. During this president’s first months in office, we have witnessed countless examples of lawless and reckless actions that undermine law and order, from firing dozens of experienced federal prosecutors to letting Elon Musk and DOGE access sensitive data about tens of millions of Americans, to confiscating millions of dollars in congressionally appropriated funds from numerous federal agencies.
These are all examples of a president disregarding the law and the Constitution.
Last month, I joined other sons and daughters of survivors attending the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp near the German village of Woebbelin. I did so out of remembrance for the prisoners and respect for my father and his fellow soldiers. I pondered how he would compare the destruction of the rule of law from 80 years ago to what we are seeing today.
My guess is that he would agree with former Federal Appellate Court Judge Michael Luttig, who recently wrote: “For the almost 250 years since the founding of this nation, America has been the beacon of freedom to the world because of its democracy and rule of law. … Until now, that is. America will never again be that same beacon to the world, because the president of the United States has subverted America’s democracy and corrupted its rule of law.”

State Rep. Derrick Jackson, a Tyrone Democrat, has become the latest candidate to launch a bid for governor, unveiling a campaign Friday that highlighted his military service, business experience and focus on advocating for Georgia residents’ civil rights. 
“When I see something that’s not right, that’s not fair, that’s unjust, I have a moral obligation as an elected official,” he said in an interview with the Georgia Recorder, citing a conversation he had with the late civil rights icon and long-time Georgia Congressman John Lewis that inspired him to run for governor. “I realized we are in a political season right now where I need to do more.”
He said he hopes to implement policies that would benefit working families in Georgia, including a $20 minimum wage and eliminating state taxes for teachers, nurses, military veterans and senior citizens.
“A lot of citizens are looking at this American dream, and they see it fading away because of some of the laws and policies that we put in place in Georgia,” he said. “And so as governor, I would be in the pivotal place to stop some of these harmful pieces of legislation that are negatively impacting families in urban, suburban, rural and underserved areas in Georgia.”
Jackson, a General Electric marketing executive, began his first term in the state House in 2017, but emphasized his 42 years of leadership experience throughout his time in the U.S. Navy, the Legislature and in his private sector work. He joins fellow legislator Sen. Jason Esteves of Atlanta and former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms on the Democratic ballot.
On the Republican side, Attorney General Chris Carr is the only announced candidate, but with Gov. Brian Kemp term-limited from running again, there will likely be a long list of GOP primary candidates. Lt. Gov. Burt Jones is widely expected to mount a run for governor.
This also isn’t Jackson’s first bid for higher office. In 2022 he ran for lieutenant governor, but finished sixth in the Democratic primary. He returned to the State Legislature in 2023 after winning a special election to replace Rep. Tish Naghise, a Fayetteville Democrat who died during her first term.
Most recently, he ran for House Minority Leader in 2024 but lost to Rep. Carolyn Hugley, a Columbus Democrat.
A crowded field
The gubernatorial race isn’t the only statewide contest that’s getting competitive. Among the candidates who launched campaigns this week are state Sen. Brian Strickland, a McDonough Republican who is entering the race for attorney general, and President Pro Tem John F. Kennedy, a Macon Republican hoping to become Georgia’s next lieutenant governor.

Democratic state Rep. Jasmine Clark of Lilburn also launched a bid for Congress this week, vying to unseat incumbent Rep. David Scott to represent Georgia’s 13th congressional district. 
Ahead of this year’s Aug. 26 special election, candidates are vying for a chance to replace outgoing state Sen. Brandon Beach, an Alpharetta Republican who President Donald Trump appointed to serve as U.S. Treasurer earlier this year. A total of seven candidates — six Republicans and one Democrat — are hoping to fill his shoes.
A familiar face resurfaces
Farooq Mughal, the former Democratic state representative from Dacula, is seeking reelection after losing his seat in one of Georgia’s narrowest state legislative races of the 2024 season.

Mughal made history as the first Pakistani-American in the Legislature when he was elected in 2022. However, after the 2023 redistricting cycle drew more conservative voters into his district, he became the target of a governor-backed effort to flip some of the most competitive House districts red, losing to Republican challenger Sandy Donatucci in 2024 by only 80 votes.
Now, he’s hoping to return to the legislature with an agenda focused on supporting public schools, securing tax relief for families and addressing gun violence.
“It was the honor of my life to serve the people of District 105,” Mughal said in a statement announcing his candidacy. “I’m running to return to the State House because there’s still critical work to be done for Gwinnett families.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Board of Higher Education approved the reallocation plans submitted by all public universities in the state, one of the first steps delineated by recently approved legislation requiring schools to cut 10% of their budgets for courses. 
Overall, the plans include layoffs and the elimination of programs with low enrollment and graduation rates in order to receive an eventual boost to budgets for programs related to engineering, artificial intelligence, nursing and behavioral health.
That’s in line with a legislative audit that advised lawmakers to look into cutting “inefficient” programs and expanding those with waitlists to keep universities relevant. Also, with a mandate triggered by HB265, a 2025 bill that codified the guidelines for that effort.

In total, universities have to cut $60 million, which will sit in a “strategic reinvestment account” until they implement the reallocation plans in three years. While the new law requires institutions to reallocate 30% of the full $60 million, on Friday they presented plans to the board that would surpass that and cut about 50% of the $60 million.
“We’re glad to be able to just finally have the opportunity for you, as a board, to see the culmination of what has been exceptionally difficult work on the part of the institutions, and the leadership of the institutions,” Geoffrey Landward, commissioner of higher education, told the board on Friday. “Faculty and staff and students are all impacted by this work.”
However, he described the process as “exceptionally important,” arguing that it would give higher education institutions the tools to the challenges they will face in the future. 
With tight deadline, Utah universities scramble to cut 10% of budget for courses

Overall, 43.6% of the cuts will come from the instructional budgets, 20% from academic support areas, 2.4% from student services, 31.6% from institutional support, 1.7% from research and 0.6% from public service, data from the Utah System of Higher Education shows. 
Over 60% will go to other instructional efforts after the three-year process, 20% to an instruction/research category, 8% to academic support, 5.3% to student services, 3.7% to institutional support and 2.4% to research 
The Friday presentations also offered a glimpse into plans previously kept under wraps — including those from Utah’s flagship university.
As the largest university in the state, the University of Utah had to cut the most from its budget — $19.5 million. The institution is planning to cut $7.5 million in 2026, $6.2 million more by 2027 and an additional $5.8 million by 2028 to reallocate to engineering, AI, clinical training for nursing students, biotechnology, civic engagement — with an emphasis on American federalism — and behavioral health, University of Utah President Taylor Randall told the board. 
The U. received a conditional approval, since its leaders asked for additional time to decide how some elements during the second and third year will play out in the school’s research space while Congress reviews its spending package. 
“We, on a daily basis, are staring at tens of millions of dollars of grants that are moving back and forth,” Randall said. “Those actually affect staffing decisions and faculty decisions, and so we are just grateful that you’ve allowed us some time to let some of those things settle down.”
Currently the plans are to make cuts in the school’s administration and staff, and 484 courses, including 81 in the College of Humanities, 62 in the College of Fine Arts, 62 in the College of Social and Behavioral Science, and 61 in the College of Health.
Some of them come from not revising the list too often, Randall said. “Over time, you don’t clean things up, and that’s clearly what we did. This tells you, by college, the courses that had been fallow for a little bit too long or had very, very low enrollment.” Some others overlapped too much with other courses that were already filling market needs. 



Let us know what you think...


 


Meanwhile, other schools showed different areas in which they intend to innovate in the process. 
Utah State University, for example, is allocating a good chunk of the funds retained from staff and course cuts for what their leaders call “technologies and careers for the future.” That includes a new school of computing, a new chemical engineering program, an AI Center for Excellence, and an expansion of its aviation program, along with new schools for design, construction and manufacturing, and technical education.
Southern Utah University is planning on a big push to place students in internships, while eliminating programs on languages, arts, ethnic studies, women and gender studies, and construction technology, among others.
Salt Lake Community College is eliminating or streamlining programs due to low enrollment and completion rates in the Provost’s Office, in the School of Arts, Communication and Digital Media, in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, and in its business school, among others. But the college is also pursuing expanding its hospitality and film programs, which are in high demand.
Snow College is proposing to expand its prison education programs, as well as other courses on automation technology, respiratory therapy, and strategic communications and public relations. But, at the same time, it is eliminating programs on languages and media studies, alongside The Snowdrift, its campus newspaper, and the school’s radio and television stations.

(Photo by Lisa Hupp/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)At the conclusion of the 2025 Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference much attention was given to profitability of fossil fuels, while far less was said about the meaning of  “sustainability” itself. In fact, both Alaskans and the principles of sustainability were notably absent from the conference’s central themes and many of its attendees. From the outset, the federal government’s priority appeared to be reassuring foreign interests of the United States’  continued ability to sell off Alaska piece by piece.
Conference organizers, led by Gov. Mike Dunleavy appeared eager as regulatory protections continue to be rolled back by the Trump administration. Federal officials, including U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, expressed strong support for the further weakening of environmental safeguards to unilaterally advance long-contested development projects across Alaska.
Many attendees represented corporate interests excited to profit from new extraction  opportunities or potential buyers, watching to see if the administration follows through on  promises to mine Alaska’s oil, gas, and critical minerals. These companies appeared enthusiastic to exploit the land with minimal oversight and a lack of local consent. The audience was left with a misleading impression of Alaskan support. 
At the center of ongoing and proposed projects, such as Red Dog mine, Graphite One, and Ambler Road, was the largest item for sale: a natural gas reservoir on the North Slope.  
The proposed Alaska liquid natural gas pipeline, currently led by the Alaska Gasoline Development Corp. and New York-based Glenfarne Group LLC, would extract natural gas from subsurface carbon and transport it 800 miles south to Nikiski for export. The estimated almost $40 billion project promises only temporary jobs and infrastructure.
Environmentally, natural gas poses risks similar to coal and oil. It is composed primarily of  methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Inevitable gas leaks during extraction and transportation can release up to 10% of methane before combustion, with the remainder ultimately emitted as carbon dioxide. These outcomes reflect outdated, combustion-based energy models.  
Regarding Alaska’s wildlife and people, cabinet members seemed to dismiss concerns after brief visits, suggesting the animals are happy and that communities would benefit from further resource development despite evidence to the contrary.
The “resource curse” is a paradox that explains the economic dynamics of regions rich in natural  resources, but limited in democratic representation. Extraction projects often introduce new  workers, housing, and other infrastructure at great cost to local communities. Despite generating  profits for corporate sponsors, these projects typically result in a net loss for the public. Workers  are imported from out of state, while profits are exported. Local towns are then responsible for  maintaining infrastructure without receiving corresponding benefits like revenue to support  housing, health care or affordable energy. As finite resources are exhausted, companies maintain  profit margins while community returns diminish. Once operations end, communities are often left with environmental damage and abandoned development, economically and socially worse off than before.  
Alaska’s economy remains heavily reliant on oil and gas. As existing operations decrease in yield, public education and health care routinely face budgetary cuts. The natural gas reserve  would only provide exports for a few decades, but its development would cause irreparable environmental damage, and leave Alaska facing another energy crisis within a generation. Why Gov. Dunleavy labeled this conference “sustainable” remains unclear.  
It is unrealistic to claim the pipeline would benefit any of the roughly 190 communities beyond the Railbelt. While the state invests in LNG exports, rural towns reliant on diesel will face rising costs and health issues, including cancer risks.  
Regardless of one’s stance on oil and gas, Chris Wright, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, himself stated: “Energy… it’s about people and math.” However, his equation solves for profit, while Alaska’s equation for energy must begin and end with the voices and needs of the people.  
Scientists attending the summit this week in an official capacity were restricted to framing oil and gas as the primary development priority. This narrowed the conversation and sidelined discussions around advances in technology such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal energy. Still, a handful of sustainability advocates attended as guests, business owners, protesters, and speakers. One speaker, Lesil McGuire, senior advisor with New Energy Alaska, an advocacy coalition that promotes renewable energy noted, “Solar arrays can be propped up in a number of weeks.” As of 2020 solar energy has become cheaper to install and maintain than fossil fuels. 
Alaska needs energy infrastructure tailored to its unique environment, focused on long-term self reliance through renewable sources. Current examples include solar installations in the Northwest Arctic Borough, microgrid cooperatives, and heat pump incentives in Southeast  Alaska. A cursory glance shows Alaska’s capacity for renewable energy that could be faster to build and more cost effective than the LNG pipeline. 
In reality the conference didn’t need to be held in Alaska, as Alaskans themselves played a  minimal role. Led by Gov. Dunleavy, the “Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference 2025” resembled government-backed promotion of the oil and gas industry and signaled extraction projects could move forward without oversight and regardless of local stakeholder’s needs or opposition. International representatives seemed to be promised fuel for import, and out-of-state corporations appeared to be invited to profit at the expense of Alaska’s environment.  
Renewable energy has been viable for decades and continues to become more efficient. Given a  voice and a seat at the table, many Alaskans and Americans would likely favor local, self-sufficient renewables for lower prices and long-term reliability. Natural gas in Alaska will run out in this lifetime, do nothing to reduce costs in the majority of Alaskan communities, and may cause permanent harm to the environment. The United States and Alaska are not in need of a  technological revolution in fossil fuels, but an information revolution in renewable energy. It is  vitally important that all Alaskan voices are heard. Alaska values pristine wilderness, supports  true sustainability, and is not for sale.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/natdiglib_30980_full-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 22:00:40.493059

(Pool photo by Rick Egan/The Salt Lake Tribune)A Utah judge says death row inmate Ralph Menzies is mentally competent enough to be executed by firing squad. 
In a ruling issued Friday evening, 3rd District Judge Matthew Bates wrote that Menzies does have dementia, but it’s not enough to prevent him from understanding why he’s being punished. 
Menzies’ attorneys say they plan to appeal the decision to the Utah Supreme Court. 
The ruling caps of a monthslong competency hearing that began in November, where attorneys for Menzies argued the 67-year-old’s brain is so damaged he can’t form a “rational understanding” of why the state is pursuing the death penalty. Attorneys for the state, meanwhile, argued that Menzies does show signs of cognitive decline but he’s still competent.  
Will Ralph Menzies’ dementia keep him from a firing squad? Attorneys make final argument

Menzies has spent nearly 40 years on death row, after being convicted of murdering Maurine Hunsaker in 1986. Menzies kidnapped Hunsaker, a 26-year-old gas station clerk, from her work and took her up Big Cottonwood Canyon, where she was later found tied to a tree with her throat slashed.
In recent years, Menzies’ health has deteriorated, his attorneys say. After falling several times in prison, he was diagnosed with vascular dementia, caused when the brain’s blood flow is disrupted, leading to memory loss and declining cognitive function. An MRI exam showed Menzies’ brain tissue is deteriorating, and his balance is fraught, causing him to fall several times each month.
In his ruling Friday, Bates acknowledged Menzies’ condition, but said it’s not enough to deem him incompetent.  
“Although Menzies has shown he has vascular dementia, he has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that his mental condition prevents him from reaching a rational understanding of his punishment or the State’s reasons for it. Therefore, he has not met his burden to show he is incompetent to be executed,” Bates wrote. 
In a statement, Matt Hunsaker, Maurine’s son, said he appreciated the court’s diligence for issuing the ruling so soon. During the final day of arguments in the competency hearing on May 7, Bates said he would issue a ruling in 60 days, giving himself a July 6 deadline. 
“It kind of comes as a shock to the family. We weren’t expecting it this soon,” Hunsaker said. “We definitely appreciate the fact that it’s moving forward, we are in hopes that the flow can continue and we can get an execution date and the death warrant signed immediately.” 
Hunsaker, in a text message, added, “my family is very happy to see that we might have some closure coming.”

Menzies’ attorney Lindsey Layer told Utah News Dispatch they disagree with the ruling, and plan on filing an appeal with the Utah Supreme Court. 
“Ralph Menzies is a severely brain-damaged, wheelchair-bound, 67-year-old man with dementia and significant memory problems,” Layer said. “He cannot understand the State’s reasons for his execution. His dementia is progressive and he is not going to get better. It is deeply troubling that Utah plans to remove Mr. Menzies from his wheelchair and oxygen tank to strap him into an execution chair and shoot him to death.” 
In Utah, death row inmates sentenced before May 2004 had a choice between lethal injection and firing squad. Menzies, when he was sentenced in 1988, chose the firing squad. For those sentenced after 2004, the default method of execution is lethal injection, unless the necessary drugs are not available.

Over an hour and a half, they took calls from listeners around the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, comparing notes on the safety of the ice at different points along the Kuskokwim River.
“Happy Thanksgiving to everyone out there,” said a caller from the village of Kalskag, his voice muffled over the phone. He said he’d recently flown over the river to the east and observed lots of holes in the ice. He wanted to warn listeners in other towns: “There is no trail right now. None of the open water is marked. So it’s advised not to be traveling back and forth from Aniak.”
KYUK is the only daily news source for this region, which is roughly the size of Oregon, and River Watch is a staple of its programming. In dozens of Southwest Alaska villages — including many Yup’ik, Athabaskan and Cup’ik communities — residents who live far from the U.S. highway system rely on boats and snow machines to get around. “The Kuskokwim River in this region is like our highway,” said KYUK news director Sage Smiley. During freeze-up and breakup each year, knowing the condition of the ice can be a matter of life and death. And in the Y-K Delta, where Internet access is often limited, public radio plays a crucial role.
But if the Trump administration gets its way, programs like River Watch could soon disappear.
Last month, the president signed an executive order aimed at preventing congressionally approved federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) from going to National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). CPB, NPR, PBS and a host of local stations have all filed lawsuits in response. Meanwhile, in its proposed budget, the administration outlined a plan to eliminate funding for CPB entirely — and this week, Trump asked Congress to take back more than a billion dollars that had already been set aside for public broadcasters. Lawmakers have 45 days to make a decision on the request, with a House vote expected as early as next week.
Defunding public media would hurt stations across the U.S., but for ones like KYUK, which relies on CPB for nearly 70% of its revenue, it would be “catastrophic,” Smiley said.
The data show that stations serving rural and Indigenous audiences in the West would be the hardest hit. Here’s why, by the numbers.
CPB is an independent nonprofit created by Congress nearly 60 years ago to distribute federal funds to noncommercial TV and radio stations across the U.S. Today, it funds more than 1,500 stations, many of which buy NPR and PBS content to distribute locally alongside local news, music shows and other programming.
Collectively, the stations in the public media network give 99% of the U.S. population access to public broadcasting. Nearly half of CPB grantees are rural, and together they employ close to 6,000 people.
As nonprofits, local public media stations rely on a variety of funding sources, including federal funding, state funding, listener donations, grants, and underwriting from local businesses. On average, federal funding accounts for 16% of a local public media station’s revenue. But for many stations, that percentage is much higher. Three factors unite the stations most reliant on federal funding: They are located in the West, they are rural, and they are tribal stations.
  Source: The list of most vulnerable stations and their percentage reliance on federal funding comes from this analysis by former NPR product manager Alex Curley. Stations designated as in the West are located within that U.S. census region. CPB defines rural stations as those whose coverage areas have a population density of 40 or fewer residents per square kilometer; the stations above are on CPB’s most updated list of rural station grantees. Tribal stations are defined as stations that are “tribally owned, managed or staffed by tribal members,” according to this map and station websites. (Chart design by Luna Anna Archey/High Country News)

Among stations in the 50 states, those in the Western U.S. are by far the most dependent on federal funding, according to a recent analysis of station financial reports for fiscal year 2023, carried out by former NPR product manager Alex Curley. (Limited data is available for American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but according to Curley, the few stations there rely even more heavily on federal funding.)
  Source: Alex Curley’s analysis of fiscal year 2023 station financial statements in Semipublic. (Chart design by Luna Anna Archey/High Country News)

On average, Curley found, Western stations depend on federal money for just over 20% of their revenue — compared with just under 15% for the next highest region, the Midwest.
The states with the highest average dependency, in order, are West Virginia, Alaska, New Mexico and Montana. In Alaska, the most dependent Western state, public media stations rely on federal funding for an average of 36% of their revenue. If all the stations with a dependence of at least 20% were forced to close, Alaska would lose 15 stations — half of its total, Curley said.
More than 50 stations around the country belong to the Native Public Media network, and they are also particularly vulnerable to funding cuts. All but one of the Native Public Media stations with available data relied on federal funding for at least 20% of their revenue, and the average reliance was more than 50%.

Source: CPB defines rural stations as those whose coverage areas have a population density of 40 or fewer residents per square kilometer. The stations defined as rural on this map come from CPB’s FY 2024 list of rural station grantees. The funding percentages come from a list of the most vulnerable public radio stations compiled using CPB data from FY 2023, the most recent available. Tribal stations are defined as stations that are “tribally owned, managed or staffed by tribal members,” according to this map and station websites. (Map design by Luna Anna Archey/High Country News)
According to CPB data shared with HCN, 79 radio stations in the U.S. relied on CPB for 30% or more of their funding in FY 2023. More than half of those stations (42) are located in the West. Of the vulnerable Western stations, all but two are rural — and 20 are also tribal stations.
Not only would these stations be drastically impacted by losing federal funding, they would also find that money especially hard to replace. Urban stations have large audiences to turn to for help, but rural stations by definition serve sparsely populated areas and often lower-income communities.
According to CPB, 40% of the average non-rural station’s revenue comes from listener donations, compared with just 28% of the average rural stations. Meanwhile, the average rural station relies on CPB funding nearly twice as much as a non-rural station does.
This past fiscal year, KYUK raised just under $20,000 from a total of 413 members, comprising 2% of the radio station’s revenue.
“We live in a subsistence region,” Smiley said. “The way people survive and thrive here does not necessarily follow the traditional Western economic model.”
To her, this is part of the beauty of public media: Stations like KYUK allow people to get thoughtful, nuanced coverage of the place they live, whether or not they can afford to pay for it. In Bethel, that includes public safety alerts and emergency coverage on shows like River Watch — but also, local news accessible to everyone in the region. The oldest Indigenous-owned and operated bilingual radio station in the U.S., KYUK broadcasts local news in both English and Yugtun, the Yup’ik language, three times a day. The station also airs several other Yup’ik public affairs and culture shows throughout the week, sharing traditional knowledge and conversations between elders.

Villages in the Y-K Delta — like many rural and Indigenous communities — tend to receive a flattened portrayal in the national media, when they’re covered at all. Outside reporters often miss the good news: The Bethel student robotics team bringing Yup’ik dance to an international stage, say, or a Cup’ik artist using traditional carving techniques to tell the evolving story of hunting and fishing in his community. Celebrations of berry picking and high school graduation — the everyday activities and special events that make headlines at a local publication run by the same people who coach youth sports and act in community plays.
These are stories at stake in the fight over federal funding, Smiley said: “This idea that a region that has been historically underserved by the state and by the country could lose a public media organization that is focused on providing what people here need, which is public safety information and a reflection of a life that is multifaceted and beautiful — that really, really tears my heart out.”

(Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities photo)In an extraordinary order, a Ketchikan Superior Court judge has dismissed murder charges against a Metlakatla man, citing a lengthy series of errors, lies and evidence concealed from defense attorneys by the Metlakatla Police Department.
The errors, Judge Daniel Doty said last week in an order, were so severe that defendant Isaac Henderson cannot be guaranteed a fair trial. The order dismisses the charges against Henderson with prejudice, meaning that they cannot be brought again.
The dismissal was first reported by the Ketchikan Daily News.
“The record in this case established a unique and egregious pattern of discovery violations and misrepresentations about discovery,” Doty wrote.
“No remedy short of dismissal with prejudice would remedy the prejudice to Mr. Henderson or deter similar violations in the future,” he said. 
Prosecutors with the Alaska Department of Law have filed a motion asking the judge to reconsider his dismissal.
Meanwhile, Angie Kemp, director of the department’s criminal division since 2022, said on Friday that her division has suspended all work with the Metlakatla Police Department until the department undergoes reforms.
That extreme — possibly unprecedented — act means state attorneys will not prosecute criminal cases coming from Metlakatla’s police department unless they involve particularly serious crimes.
“It’s an extreme remedy, but one that’s necessary,” Kemp said by phone on Friday.
Interim police chief says department is rebuilding
Metlakatla is located at the tip of southern Southeast Alaska, on the Annette Island Reserve, Alaska’s only Indian reservation.
Bruce Janes, a member of the local police department for 31 years and chief for eight, is no longer working there, Kemp said. 
She’s since spoken with Desmond King, chief of Metlakatla’s fire department and now its interim police chief, requesting changes to police department procedures.
“And I’ve explained to him that until those steps are taken, the Department of Law can’t continue to prosecute cases, absent extreme circumstances, out of Metlakatla where those cases involve Metlakatla Police Department officers,” Kemp said.
Metlakatla Mayor Albert Smith was out of the office and unavailable to talk by phone, town staff said on Friday. A message left on his cellphone was not returned.
King, speaking by phone, said that in addition to acting as fire chief and interim police chief, he’s also the town’s deputy police commissioner.
“I actually carry a few hats right now, while we’re in the rebuilding stage. … We’re in a very stressful situation,” he said.
Asked about Kemp’s decision to temporarily stop work with Metlakatla’s police, he said he was familiar with it. 
“I totally understand that,” King said. “That’s what I would expect them to do, because it was some internal issues that we have to fix, and we’re really going to be at Ground Zero. It’s all about building everything as fast as we can, but as responsible as we can.”
Smith declined extensive comment, citing the mayor’s unavailability on Friday, but said that officials in Metlakatla are aware of the department’s problems and the need to fix them.
“It’s going to be a long, long-term project, but there’s a lot of of the infrastructure and smaller things that we can take care of immediately and be very proactive in re-establishing all the relationships we have with the DA’s office, working with the Alaska Police Standards Council, (Bureau of Indian Affairs) Justice System, they’re involved now. We have a lot of support. We definitely don’t feel alone,” he said.
Court hearings revealed new information
The turmoil surrounding the Metlakatla Police Department stems from the 2021 shooting death of Tyler Henderson. After an investigation by local police and Alaska State Troopers, the Department of Law charged Henderson’s brother, Isaac, with his murder. 
The case was frequently delayed, and Isaac Henderson’s defense was repeatedly reassigned to five different public defenders who apparently took little action on the issue as it lingered in court.
Four years on, it remains unclear whether the shooting was accidental, an act of self-defense — as Isaac Henderson claimed — or murder.
As Henderson’s trial approached, his attorneys — John Phillips and Julia Graves — began challenging some of the evidence that prosecutors planned to present.
Neither attorney answered phone calls Friday seeking comment.
During a series of evidentiary hearings in April, former Metlakatla police officer Austin McKeehan said that he falsified evidence reports. 
Former police chief Janes, under questioning, said he had made false statements to the grand jury that indicted Henderson, falsely claiming that he submitted a piece of evidence to the state crime lab.
At the hearing, Janes admitted that the investigation was “very sloppy” and “probably the worst I’ve ever done.”
In another hearing, Janes testified that the department routinely destroys evidence logs every year, making it impossible to guarantee that evidence is properly stored and not tampered with.
On May 5, at a hearing the judge called “shocking,” Janes revealed previously undisclosed witness interviews to both prosecutors and defense.
During a trial’s “discovery” process, prosecutors are required to share possible evidence with defense attorneys. Janes, at this point in the case, produced several pieces of hard-copy evidence from within the case file that had not been shared with either prosecutors or the defense.
“If the prosecutor did review the file, the prosecutor saw a number of items that he had not seen
before but failed to disclose those documents or identify them during the discovery
hearing. If the prosecutor did not review the file, the failure to do so is inexplicable,” Doty wrote in his order.
Before another hearing, Janes provided several hard drives to the prosecutor. Those contained possible evidence. The state contends that there was no time to share them with the defense before the hearing; the defense argued that withholding them until the hearing was part of a continued pattern.
Under normal circumstances, it would be appropriate for a judge to postpone the case until everyone is certain that all evidence has been fairly shared.
In this case, Doty said, he doesn’t have confidence that will ever occur.
“Police officers knowingly completed inaccurate chain of custody logs, destroyed chain of custody logs, made contradictory and irreconcilable statements under oath about what physical evidence had been collected or tested, and stated — repeatedly and falsely — that they had provided all the available evidence in the case,” Doty wrote in his order. 
“More importantly, though, the evidence here raised serious and substantial questions about whether the state has committed additional discovery violations that have not yet come to light,” he said, using “state” to refer to both police and prosecutors.
Given that doubt, he said, it is appropriate to dismiss the case.
“In short, the police misrepresented or forgot so many facts about discovery that it is impossible to determine, and will likely not be possible to ever determine, whether the state complied with its discovery obligations in this case.”
In court, the Hendersons’ mother, Naomi Leask, said she and other members of her family moved from Metlakatla to Ketchikan in order to stay with Isaac Henderson and secure his bail.
Speaking to Doty, she said that regardless of how the case is resolved, they do not expect to ever return to Metlakatla.
In town, said King, the interim police chief, there’s work to be done.
“The temperature of our community, it feels a little off, the anguish and stuff that people feel,” he said. “But you know, it’s improving from this day, moving forward. We have to make sure we do it right and do it right by our people.”

But the second Trump administration is likely to put those protections to the test.","Transgender Marylanders and advocates sitting in the Governor's Reception Room for Transgender Day of Visibility on March 31, 2025. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).For more than a decade, state lawmakers passed laws to protect and uplift Maryland’s LGBTQ+ community – from marriage equality for same-sex couples to boosting health care access for transgender individuals. The second Trump administration is likely to put those protections to the test.
President Donald Trump (R) has signaled from day one of his administration that it was going to be an adversary to transgender people, signing an executive order on the first day of his second term that prohibited gender ideology in federal policy, defined sex according to biological factors at conception and rescinded 15 federal policies and guidelines on transgender equality.
In the days and weeks that followed, Trump signed orders banning transgender individuals from girl’s and women’s sports and from military service, prohibiting federal funding or support for gender-affirming care for youth, and more. Congress is also looking to prohibit federal dollars going towards transgender health care.
As they begin Pride month, a time when the LGBTQ+ community comes together to celebrate progress and reflect on setbacks for the gay and transgender community, some Maryland transgender advocates fear current state protections may not be enough to counter federal efforts.
“Maryland is in a better position than most,” said Ruth Carlock with Trans Rights Advocacy Coalition. “Now that we’re in the Trump administration, a lot of those things might not be as strong as we’d hope, and we might need more legislation in the future.
“One thing I’ve been saying a lot over the past six months,” Carlock said, “I’m feeling very proud to be a Marylander, while feeling less proud of being an American in this current state of politics.”
Lee Blinder, a nonbinary official who chairs the Maryland Commission on LGBTQIA+ Affairs in the Governor’s Office and works with advocacy group Trans Maryland, has mixed feelings about the state’s progress this year.

“We really are in an excellent place compared to so many of our sibling in other states like Florida and Texas,” they said. “However, we have not seen the kind of movement that we would want to see from Maryland that we’ve been able to accomplish previously.”
Blinder is particularly disappointed that the Birth Certificate Modernization Act, did not pass. The bill would have made it easier for transgender people to make changes to their birth certificates, among other measures, relieving administrative headaches that can occur when gender markers do not align on various documents. Transgender advocates have been pushing that bill for the last few years.
Blinder feels transgender people were not prioritized this past session, and publicly brought those concerns to Gov. Wes Moore (D) during an event at the State House recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility. Blinder criticized what they called the administration’s lack of support to protect the community amid federal measures to diminish the presence of transgender people in day-to-day life.
“We know who you, Governor Moore, can be for us, and I am here begging you to do it,” Blinder said, while standing next to Moore.
“It will not get easier to support trans people. It will not get easier to commit to this community, it will only get harder in the days that come,” Blinder said at the time.
They hold those concerns to this day.
“We’re facing a state of emergency for the trans community — the same message I had before on Trans Day of Visibility. That still applies,” Blinder said in a recent interview.
There were some successes for gay and transgender people this legislative session. In May, Moore signed House Bill 1045 into law, which tweaks the state’s shield laws on legally protected health care that prohibits physicians from turning over patient information regarding “sensitive health services.” In Maryland, that includes gender-affirming care as well as abortions.
Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick), who chairs the Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus, noted some other wins for the LGBTQ+ community. House Bill 39 and Senate Bill 356 were signed into law, removing a criminal penalty for intentionally transferring HIV to another person, which advocates say was antiquated and discriminatory.
But Fair noted that the state budget was a major hurdle to progress across issues this session, as the state grappled with a $3 billion deficit, resulting in widespread program cuts and limited dollars available for new initiatives in general.
  Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick) said budget woes this session made it difficult for many bills to move, including some on transgender issues. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
“We had an overarching deficit budget that we were dealing with, that was unavoidable and sucked all of the oxygen out of the room,” Fair said. “Every conversation was buried under this question of the budget.”
Despite the slowed progress this session, Fair believes that Maryland is “light years ahead” of other states when it comes to LGBTQ+ protections.
“It is the incredible wisdom of the legislature over the last 13 years that has truly saved us, starting with the Maryland (Marriage) Equality vote in 2012 and moving forward from there,” he said.
During his term, Moore has approved a handful of bills creating transgender protections that advocates say will be crucial in the coming years.
One of those is the Trans Health Equity Act signed in 2023, which requires Maryland Medicaid to cover medically-necessary gender-affirming care.
Congress is debating whether to prohibit federal Medicaid dollars from funding gender-affirming care. If that prohibition becomes law, the state may have to backfill any federal matching dollars currently supporting gender-affirming care under Maryland Medicaid to align with the Trans Health Equity Act, if funds are available.
Advocates are also thankful that the state’s shield law for legally protected health care was expanded in 2024 to include gender-affirming care. The intent is to protect the medical information of persons who seek gender-affirming care in Maryland from being shared across state lines, and potentially into the hands of law enforcement in states that are more hostile to transgender people.
“The Moore-Miller Administration will continue to protect the civil rights and livelihoods of LGBTQIA+ Marylanders by working with the state legislature, local leaders, and community advocates to deliver results for this community uniquely targeted by the Trump Administration,” a Moore spokesperson said in a written statement.
Due to these and other policies, Maryland is largely recognized a “safe haven” for gay and transgender people. The Movement Advancement Project, which assesses states based on laws that protect or harm transgender residents, ranks Maryland as seventh in protections on gender identity, and sixth for LGBTQ+ protections overall.










“One thing I’ve been saying a lot over the past six months ... I’m feeling very proud to be a Marylander, while feeling less proud of being an American in this current state of politics.”


– Ruth Carlock, Trans Rights Advocacy Coalition


Blinder and Carlock say that Pride month is important, now more than ever, for building community supports to take care of one another even if state protections don’t stand up to anti-transgender federal policies.
“It’s so easy for the practical needs that are so urgent to take over and to overshadow the very real need for us to be able to find joy and to celebrate,” Blinder said. “Because it’s not possible to survive these kinds of attacks without experiencing joy and experiencing the community connections and bonds that we have with one another.”
Carlock said that some advocates have even been more active in the community since Trump took office.
“That’s been one of the nice things about the last few months is this sense of community that has slowly been – you know, it’s always there, but it’s nice seeing that expand in the face of danger,” she said. “But also recognizing that that positive turn is coming from an existential threat and big fear of legislation to come.”

(File photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters.)State officials Friday announced a series of budget cuts they said could reduce spending by nearly $400 million in coming years.
Included in the reductions are $50 million in cuts that are part of the fiscal 2026 budget. The bulk of the savings — $326 million — would come over as many as 25 years as part of an effort to shift employees out of state-owned buildings and into commercial office space.
“While the federal government recklessly slashes budgets and lays off public servants, we are using data to save taxpayers money and modernize government in a targeted way,” Gov. Wes Moore Moore (D) said in a statement. “This announcement is only the beginning of our efforts. Together, we will continue to prioritize fiscal discipline and ensure we deliver essential services to all Marylanders, efficiently and effectively.”
Moore, in announcing his proposed 2026 budget in January, promised to find $50 million in savings. The effort was a small part of attacking what was then a projected $3.3 billion structural budget deficit.
Moore set up a work group to look for savings within state agencies. The group was tasked with looking for efficiencies in procurement, real estate and fleet management.
Officials who briefed reporters Friday said they hit their target.
The largest portion of the savings — about $30 million — for the fiscal year that starts July 1 will come from changes in state technology. Officials said underutilized mobile and land phone lines will be eliminated. The state will also standardize laptop purchases and keep equipment longer before buying replacements.
Ferguson: Maryland would lose $430 million in Trump ‘skinny budget’ proposal

Another $14 million of the proposed savings will come from standardizing shipping and delivery options. Officials said the savings will come from ensuring state employees are aware of and use contracts that offer the best rates.
The final $6 million comes from consolidation of the state’s vehicle fleet. Departments will purchase fewer vehicles and spend less on fuel and maintenance.
All that is in addition to $16 million the state Department of Information Technology had planned on saving from centralizing the programs it uses for employee access to computer systems as well as cybersecurity tools.
“Our data-driven approach to modernizing state government operations is saving taxpayer dollars,” Chief Performance Officer Asma Mirza said in a statement.
The bulk of the savings — $326 million — is expected to come from moving state employees out of nine buildings in Baltimore City that are owned and maintained by the state. Those employees will move to commercial space in the city’s central business district.
The total amount of savings would come over a 20- to 25-year period, officials said.
One state official told reporters that the state hopes to take advantage of the large amount of available commercial office space and negotiate “very aggressive lease rates.”
The state was already moving out of the decaying State Center property.
At one point, the plan was to partner with the private sector to redevelop the 25-acre state office complex, which sits on a Metro stop and is adjacent to the light rail.

	The plan, which was approved in 2009, fell apart, and then-Gov. Larry Hogan (R) filed a lawsuit to terminate the $1.5 billion project. The developer countersued. The Board of Public Works, led by Moore, voted unanimously in November to settle with developer State Center LLC for $58.5 million.
At the time of that settlement, there were fewer than 5,000 employees from seven state agencies at the center. The state plans to move all remaining employees to other locations by the end of 2026.
A final plan for the property has yet to be determined. It is unclear if the property will be taken over by the city or sold to a developer.
The state also plans on moving employees out of two other buildings — the William Donald Schaefer Tower on St. Paul Street and the Nancy Grasmick building at 200 W. Baltimore Street.
Officials told reporters that relocating those employees could take up to three years. The goal, they said, was to open the properties up for redevelopment and put them back on city tax rolls.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_dec3_statecenter6_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 21:02:22.386209

Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) touring University of Pennsylvania’s Marshak Dairy barn in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania on June 6, 2025. (John Cole/Capital-Star)KENNETT SQUARE — Following his tour of Pennsylvania’s only veterinary school, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) spoke to the Capital-Star about the U.S. House narrowly passing the “Big Beautiful Bill” and U.S. Steel’s impending merger. 
But he also had praise for Democratic Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker’s efforts to combat addiction in the state’s largest city.
“I was very impressed with what the mayor is doing,” McCormick said about Parker’s initiative to address addiction, following his tour of the University of Pennsylvania’s Marshak Dairy barn in Chester County on the outermost fringes of the Philly suburbs.
McCormick said he met earlier Friday with Parker to tour Riverview Wellness Village, a substance abuse recovery center in northeast Philadelphia that aims to help people in the final stages of recovery.
According to Billy Penn, the facility, which opened in January, has 336 beds and will provide housing, healthcare, job counseling and other services to people who have completed an initial drug treatment program and have moved to the next stage of their recovery and may live there for up to one year. They already have over 100 patients there, McCormick said. 
He described the campus of the recovery center, which is built in renovated city-owned buildings, and spans approximately 19 acres along the Delaware River, as “incredible.”
“This is a facility that gives people dignity, respect and helps them to the next phase,” McCormick said. “It’s a big project for the mayor.”
He said he discussed with Parker ways he may be able to support the center and credited her and Philadelphia Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel’s approach to addiction in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia.
Kensington has been at the forefront of the opioid crisis, garnering international attention for its open-air drug market in recent years.
“You need to crack down on the law and lawlessness and disorder in Kensington,” McCormick said. “The mayor has done that.”
During Parker’s successful bid to become Philadelphia’s 100th mayor in 2023, a key focus of her campaign was addressing the issue of drug abuse and quality of life in the Kensington neighborhood. Parker said she would end the open-air drug market for good and stabilize the neighborhood throughout her bid for office, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
“I think she’s off to a great start on this,” he added. “But you can’t just treat … this problem narrowly. You have to have addiction recovery, which is what this program is meant to support.”
McCormick calls “Big, Beautiful Bill” a good start
The U.S. House narrowly passed a budget reconciliation package on May 22, which President Donald Trump dubbed the “Big, Beautiful Bill.” The 1,116-page omnibus, combining 11 bills and many of Trump’s policy goals, is now being reworked in the U.S. Senate.
McCormick, an ally of Trump, described it as a “good start,” but said he believes the spending package needs more work.
Among the things the bill gets right, McCormick listed the permanent renewal of Trump’s first term tax cuts and eliminating tax on tips, Social Security and overtime. He applauded the bill’s increased funding of border security, border patrol, and national defense.
McCormick also highlighted the efforts in the package to “bend the curve on costs.”
“Some of these programs are spiraling out of control,” McCormick said. “Medicaid is the one that has all the controversy.”
“It doesn’t cut Medicaid spending. It slows the growth from 5% a year to 3% a year,” he said. “And it does that by taking people out of the program, particularly working age men without dependents, takes them out of the program, [which] was never designed for them.”
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the House version of the bill would lead to 10.9 million more people being uninsured in 2034, with 7.8 million of those due to the bill’s Medicaid changes and the rest due to changes in the Affordable Care Act, according to FactCheck.org.
McCormick said the government needs to reduce spending, saying the current spending rate is “not sustainable.”
Some adjustments he’d like to see included a phasing out of a number of subsidies and tax credits, instead of an immediate ending.
“I think those should be phased out in a way that’s not too disruptive to some of the investment in projects that’s already been made,” McCormick said.
He also made the case the Senate should add a proposal that would add $10 billion towards school vouchers. 
McCormick “very optimistic” in U.S. Steel and Nippon reaching deal by deadline
Trump broke the news last month that a $14 billion merger deal between Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel and Japan’s Nippon Steel was nearing a conclusion after 18 months in limbo.
Details of the tie-up remain secret and company officials have declined comment. Bloomberg News on Thursday cited sources close to the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because they’re confidential who said the deal is on track to meet a June 18 deadline.
McCormick said he’s “very optimistic” that the deal, for which Trump took credit, will ultimately benefit western Pennsylvania’s Monongahela Valley, where U.S. Steel operates three plants.
“It’s $14 billion of investment in the domestic steel industry, $2.4 billion in the Mon Valley,” McCormick said on Friday. “It guarantees and protects 10,000 jobs in the Mon Valley, but it also promises a new arc furnace, which is going to create 14,000 new jobs building that furnace.”
McCormick also touted that in addition to remaining Pittsburgh-based, U.S. Steel will have a CEO and majority board from the United States, while the government would have control over the appointments of “a couple key board members.” McCormick argues that this will “protect U.S. interest.”
McCormick also acknowledged that Trump previously “had some real reservations” about the deal before the latest adjustments were made, but said the current deal “supports working people” in that region.
“My first encounter with these steel workers was in Latrobe at a rally for the president, and they’re out there. They wanted the deal because it protects their livelihoods,” McCormick said.
USW International President David McCall said last week that the union still had concerns about the effects the proposed merger would have on national security, its members and the communities where they work.
However, McCormick said he doesn’t share those concerns.
“I’m focused on the steel workers in Pennsylvania — 4,000 of them in the Mon Valley. They’re all in,” McCormick said. “You watch that rally when President Trump came. Those are all steel workers going crazy.”
“This is great for Pennsylvania. It’s great for the Mon Valley,” he added. “It’s great for domestic steel production. It’s great for national security. I feel very confident in that.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/0-7-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-06 21:02:22.386209

Surveys show Marylanders want housing near jobs, but state policy doesn't always make that easy. (Photo by Dave Dildine/WTOP)Maryland is well-known for innovative state policies and reforms, including smart growth, but the state missed key opportunities this year to build on that legacy. While approving a half-billion-dollar package to close a major transportation funding gap, the legislature (primarily the Senate) failed to adopt bills that would ensure the funds shift the state in a new direction toward abundant and affordable housing and transportation choices.
Maryland’s land use, high housing costs, transportation challenges and economic doldrums are interconnected. They require new approaches, not just patching budget holes to fix.
Limited housing choices near jobs = expensive transportation
Homes are expensive in part because Maryland communities allow too little housing near transit, services and jobs. This contributes to sprawling, car-dependent development, further fueled by too much public spending on oversized roads and highways. The result is long commutes, more driving to reach stores and services, and higher transportation costs for families. The average new car in the U.S. costs almost $50,000, and last year 17% of American drivers said they had to take on a second job to help pay for their car.
Instead of funding more of this status quo, Maryland needs to help families stay here, with affordable access to opportunity. Fostering walkable, vibrant activity centers with good transit and a range of housing types and prices near jobs will help current residents and also attract the next generation of skilled workers and industries.

The House of Delegates passed several valuable smart growth bills:

Transit-oriented development (House Bill 80) to remove obstacles to building housing and mixed-use development near rail stations;
Transportation and Climate Alignment Act (House Bill 84), ensuring the state’s transportation investments support its climate change goals while giving residents more travel options;
Metro Funding Modification Act (House Bill 467), fixing dedicated state capital funding for the D.C.-area Metro system to account for inflation; and
Gov. Wes Moore’s Housing for Jobs Act (House Bill 503), which would have required the state’s job centers to address housing needs, although it was watered down into largely a study bill.

Unfortunately, the Maryland Senate did not advance any of these bills to a vote.
The Senate, to its credit, did pass:

Split-rate property tax enabling legislation (Senate Bill 472) that would allow local governments to create tax structures that capture the value of land near assets like rail stations while incentivizing new development, though the House did not pass it; and
Accessory dwelling unit bill (House Bill 1466) that will require local governments to allow construction of a smaller independent home on a lot with a single-family detached house. The House concurred with the final bill and the governor signed it.

We know that legislators had a lot on their plates, with a sizable budget gap and chaotic federal backdrop. However, most of the smart-growth bills that didn’t pass would have cost little or nothing to government coffers – and would actually save the state money over time through reduced infrastructure and service costs.
Win-wins for Marylanders
Realizing this vision provides interconnected benefits. For example:

Smart growth has been key to attracting and retaining Fortune 500 firms like Marriott and Choice Hotels in transit-oriented locations.
Maryland families on average would save over $3,000 per year in transportation costs if the state provided more opportunities for transit, walking, biking and accessible living.
State-owned transit-oriented development sites could support 5,000 new housing units in the Baltimore region and 2,600 new housing units along the MARC Penn Line. These Penn Line sites could generate $800 million in new state and local revenue.
Marylanders want these opportunities; 76% support more homes in job-rich areas.

Looking ahead
Before the next General Assembly session, the Moore administration can make progress:

The Maryland Department of Transportation can adopt changes to its Chapter 30 project prioritization process to better maintain existing infrastructure, recognize good land use planning as a transportation solution, and ensure affordable and sustainable travel choices for residents.
The Department of Housing and Community Development can provide further analysis on the state’s housing shortage and the benefits of new homes in accessible locations. It could also work with local governments to improve land use review to reduce time and complexity, allowing more new homes to be built faster in transit-accessible locations.

During the 2026 session, the General Assembly will have the opportunity to pass legacy-making legislation ahead of the elections. Gov. Moore, with the support of state senators and delegates, can help Marylanders address the everyday needs of housing and transportation in lasting ways, which also help the state’s finances, climate resilience, and economic opportunity.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Beltway_I-495_Dildine_2-1-1024x676-1.jpg,,,2025-06-06 21:02:22.386209

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator).The Louisiana Board of Ethics expressed alarm Friday that the Louisiana Legislature is just one vote away from eliminating confidentiality for people who provide tips about government misconduct. 

“This is all just abusive. It’s just trying to dissuade someone from filing a complaint,” said retired attorney William Grimley, a Louisiana Senate appointee to the ethics board since 2022, about House Bill 160 sponsored by Rep. Kellee Hennessy Dickerson, R-Denham Springs. 
Other members of the 15-person board nodded in agreement with Grimley. As a last-minute effort to stop the legislation, they instructed their staff to send a letter from the board expressing their concerns about the bill. 
The board members also said they intended to personally contact their own senators and Gov. Jeff Landry’s office to warn about the legislation. 
“I think it will have a drastic chilling effect on the number of complaints you receive,” Ethics Administrator David Bordelon told board members. “We often receive complaints that are asking not to be disclosed because there’s some sort of relationship or some sort of fear of retaliation.”

Under the bill, investigations into ethics law violations would still be kept private and shielded from the public unless the board votes to bring charges. But the name of a person who provides a tip about alleged wrongdoing would be revealed to whoever they accused of misconduct. Currently, the identity of someone providing a tip to the ethics board is never shared with the target of an investigation. 
Dickerson said she is bringing the bill to protect government officials from political retaliation similar to what she experienced personally. 

In 2023, the ethics board voted to fine Dickerson $1,500 when she was a member of the Livingston Parish School Board and running for state representative. The members concluded she had broken state ethics laws by inappropriately helping a public school teacher get paid for doing construction work at the high school where the teacher was employed. State law doesn’t allow public employees to perform contract work for their employers.

“I believe this is a fight for truth and justice and to give you the knowledge to know who is fighting against you,” Dickerson said of her legislation. 
Her bill would likely encourage “witness tampering and documents not being provided,” Bordelon said. The tipster might experience harassment and intimidation from the subject of the investigation even before the probe gets underway, he added.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

Dickerson said she has guarded against intimidation in her bill by allowing any tipsters to sue the accused for damages if they experience harassment. Critics of the legislation said those lawsuits would be expensive and not financially feasible for many members of the public. 
The ethics administrator also reiterated that the board – not the person providing the tip – decides whether to charge someone with ethical misconduct. Even if the person who submitted the complaint to the board is politically motivated, the board is not. 

“It’s the board that is the accuser,” Bordelon told members. “You make your decision based on the facts and the evidence that we present to you as staff.”
Dickerson included another barrier to ethics investigations the board found troubling. It requires people submitting tips to the board to either have them signed by a notary, which costs money, or to deliver them personally to state ethics administration headquarters in downtown Baton Rouge. Currently, the public can submit tips via mail and sometimes electronically. 
“Imagine somebody in Grand Isle complaining about their local councilman. They would have to either pay a notary to notarize a statement … or drive to Baton Rouge and file it with us in person here,” Bordelon said. 
Dickerson also wants to limit materials the ethics board can use to launch an investigation to just tips from the public and reports from state officials. The board has no existing limits on the sources it can use to launch an investigation. 
For example, it undertook 18 investigations from 2020-23 based on news reports that resulted in a discovery of wrongdoing. Under the bill from Dickerson, a former broadcast journalist, they would no longer be able to use a news story as the basis for an inquiry. 
This year, Landry and legislative leaders have gotten behind a few bills that would dramatically curb the ethics board’s authority to pursue investigations. Lawmakers said the effort is a response to overzealous enforcement by the ethics board that crossed the line into harassment. 

Still, it’s not clear whether Landry supports Dickerson’s legislation. His staff hasn’t endorsed it during public hearings like they have other ethics  bills. 
Recent ethics board appointees from Landry and lawmakers are also among those worried about Dickerson’s bill. 
“I would love for 100% compliance and to put us out of business. But you know, that’s not happening,” said Jason Amato, a former St. James Parish Council member who Landry picked to lead the ethics board earlier this year.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

“I’d love to be able to cancel our monthly meeting because we didn’t have any items on the agenda. But I’m only six months in, and that isn’t happening anytime soon,” he added. 

Lawmakers have until Thursday to decide whether to send Dickerson’s proposal to Gov. Jeff Landry’s desk to be signed into law. The House voted 88-7 for the bill last month, and it is scheduled for Senate debate Sunday.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_2604-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 21:02:22.386209

Photo by Tiffany Tan/VTDiggerBennington College has finalized its collective bargaining agreements with the three groups that make up the college’s union, according to a June 5 press release.The agreements come after a unionization process that began in 2023, after 150 faculty, staff and campus safety workers formed Bennington College United. The union — which is backed by AFT Vermont, an umbrella labor union for higher education and health care workers — cited concerns about high staff turnover, a lack of policy surrounding raises and a lack of transparency about the college’s finances. The agreements, sent to VTDigger by AFT Vermont, detail improved working conditions for union members, including increased wages and bonuses, guaranteed tuition exchange and benefits for family of staff and transparency on the finances of bargaining unit employees.The Bennington College United bargaining team wrote in a statement that they were proud of the improvements they gained in negotiations, and that their next step was to “fight for a better retirement contribution,” on July 1, 2026.READ MORE
“This agreement reflects what is possible when institutions and labor come together with mutual respect and a commitment to mission,” Bennington College President Laura Walker said in a press release. “I am grateful to the members of BCU for their dedication to Bennington, and to the College’s negotiating teams for their tireless and thoughtful work.”“We’re stronger together, always have been and always will be,” Bennington faculty and union member David Bond told VTDigger in a written statement. “With DC missives attacking the public purpose of higher education and many university administrators bending to the bully, it is more important than ever to secure faculty and staff a seat at the table.”Bennington College United originally planned to negotiate as a collective whole but after discussions with the administration, organizers agreed to split into three different bargaining units. In exchange, the university voluntarily acknowledged the union. Although this is Bennington College’s first official union, the school’s dining hall workers are already unionized under the Service Employees International Union, and a “faculty forum” once served as an informal union for faculty members, according to Bennington’s student newspaper, the Bennington Lens.The collective bargaining agreements come amid a wave of unionization in higher education.

On May 30, NorthWestern Energy said it planned an increase of $9.04 on a typical residential electric bill as part of a quarterly adjustment on electric supply.
Earlier last month, the monopoly utility announced it was pushing up rates 17% without regulatory approval, effective May 23. The earlier increase amounts to $17.07 a month on top of a typical residential bill of $101.14, according to NorthWestern Energy.
If the Montana Public Service Commission signs off on the most recent increase, the average residential customer will be paying $127.16 in July, according to information from the agency.
Altogether, that would be a more than 25% increase from May 1 to July of this year.
NorthWestern Energy spokesperson Jo Dee Black said the latest change reflects dollars for electric supply costs generally passed through to customers and adjusted quarterly since 2023.
“This approach helps avoid large, once-a-year adjustments,” Black said in an email.
However, an engineer for the Montana Environmental Information Center said the increase shows NorthWestern’s argument the large gas plant it built in Laurel isn’t offsetting bills as the company promised.
Nick Fitzmaurice, energy transition engineer for the energy watchdog, also said customers will be paying 39.4% more a month this July than they did in August 2022.
“NorthWestern’ subversive tactics unfairly hide the truth from Montanans, who are now paying the price with skyrocketing electric bills,” Fitzmaurice said in an email.
PSC spokesperson Alana Lake said the agency routinely examines a utility’s accounting to ensure accuracy, and the Commission had questions about this recent increase, so it has yet to sign off on it.
However, Lake also said the increase will be implemented unless the PSC finds an error in NorthWestern’s calculations.
“It is important to note that these rates will only be in effect until September 2025,” Lake said, if they are approved. “At that point, (NorthWestern) must file an application with justification for final approval of these adjustments, which will need to be reviewed and approved by the Commission.”
The 17% hike is separate, already in effect, and part of an upcoming hearing on an application for rate increases NorthWestern Energy filed with the PSC in July 2024.
NorthWestern earlier defended the increase it implemented prior to approval by the Montana Public Service Commission — and the PSC confirmed the utility acted legally.
The monopoly energy company said regulators didn’t act on its application for a rate increase in a timely fashion, so it used a law that allows it to implement one on its own in the meantime, after nine months have passed.
However, PSC President Brad Molnar earlier said NorthWestern is responsible for delays in the case, and its customers are going to feel pain as a result of the increase, which he characterized as “crushing.”
A hearing on the rate case will take place starting Monday, June 9, and run possibly through June 20.
If the PSC decides NorthWestern erred in the increase, the company will return the extra money to customers, plus 10%.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/electricity-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 20:07:34.932182

(Provided by the Flathead Lake Biological Station of the University of Montana)Flathead Lake is not expected to reach its full pool this summer and may end up more than a foot lower than normal within a month, due to abnormally hot and dry conditions in the region. 
That’s according to Energy Keepers Inc., the corporation operating the Se̓liš Ksanka Qĺispe̓ (SKQ) Dam on behalf of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. 
“Unseasonably warm and dry conditions have significantly decreased water supply in the Flathead River Basin, and spring runoff is quickly receding, bringing river flows to extremely low levels,” according to an Energy Keepers press release.
Current forecasts show the lake will reach a maximum of around 2,892.3 feet by June 19, and then begin to slowly recede. Full pool for the lake is 2,893 feet. 
With expectations of a potentially low water year, SKQ dam operators worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers this spring to raise the maximum water level required for flood control in order to capture as much spring runoff in the lake as possible. But despite the change, “the melted snow remaining will not get Flathead Lake to full pool.” 
“Our goal was to coordinate actions to increase the chance of refill as early as possible while balancing needs for flood risk management; however, it’s also important to understand how much weather influences refill Pacific Northwest Lakes and reservoirs,” said Leah Hamilton, Northwestern Division Reservoir Control Center water regulator with the U.S. Army Corps. “Every water year is different, and there is a lot of uncertainty in trying to accurately predict runoff several months into the future.”  
Dam operators have maintained the minimum flows allowed in the dam’s Federal Energy Regulatory Commission operating license since May 26.
According to a water supply forecast for Montana published this week by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resource Conservation Science, warmer than normal temperatures throughout May “spurred rapid snowmelt across the state,” a drastic shift from what forecasters were predicting earlier this year.
“Fast snowmelt and earlier than normal runoff in the month of May rapidly decreased snowpack statewide. This potentially corresponds to less available water later in the summer,” said Florence Miller, a hydrologist with NRCS. “Water supply forecasts decreased from 70%-110% of normal streamflow forecasted for most of the state on May 1, to 50%-100% of streamflow forecasted on June 1.” 
In the Flathead River Basin, snow water equivalent — the measure of how much water is contained in a snowpack — is just 59% of average for the beginning of June, compared to 83% at this time last year. The Kootenai River Basin is at 49%, the Upper Clark Fork at 65%, the Jefferson at 66% and the Upper Yellowstone at 63%. 
The Bitterroot Basin is at just 27% of normal, also due to a rapidly melting snowpack. 
“While much of our winter’s snowpack has rapidly melted, a transition to cooler weather could help prolong the remaining snowpack and improve summer streamflow later in the season. Alternatively, a continuation of the hot, dry weather would continue the rapid runoff of this season’s snowpack and further reduce summer streamflow outlooks,” the report states. 
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, conditions have worsened across much of the state over the last month. Compared to 2024, when 56% of the state was classified as experiencing drought, this year 82% of the state is experiencing drought conditions.
“Above normal precipitation during June is needed across the entire state,” the report states. 
Brian Lipscomb, CEO of Energy Keepers, said the forecasted drought conditions for the remainder of the year, combined with several years of hot and dry weather, will bring cumulative impacts to Flathead Lake and those reliant on it — including Energy Keepers. 
“These unprecedented dry conditions are not only taxing on resources, they are also extremely impactful to generation of energy from the SKQ facility,” said Lipscomb in a press release. “Electricity generation from the SKQ facility will be 10 percent below normal for this year, add that to the two years that we have just experienced, and this will put us at 393 GWh of electricity generation below normal.”
That is enough electricity to power a city the size of Missoula for a year, according to Lipscomb. 
Low water conditions are expected throughout the region. 
Lake Koocanusa, formed by the Libby Dam on the Kootenai River, is currently forecast to have a water supply around 72% of average this summer, while Hungry Horse Reservoir, south of Glacier National Park, is forecasting a water supply around 75% of normal. 
“It’s a larger system, it’s not just us,” said Rob McDonald, spokesperson for Energy Keepers and the CSKT. “But (Flathead Lake) is what people care about, which we understand … The lake is the center of the community.”
  Data by USDA NRCS
Since severe drought conditions in 2023 led to record-low levels of Flathead Lake, Energy Keepers has worked to provide more frequent communications on weather and water forecasts and how they may impact dam operations and lake levels. 
“Our goal is to push out information as quickly as possible so people can respond accordingly and manage what they need to manage,” McDonald said. “But we are in year three of the warmest, driest three consecutive years on record. Let that sink in. Three driest, warmest years ever recorded.”
The 2023 drought led to conversations at the local, state and federal level about management of water resources in Montana. 
During the 2025 Legislature, Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, who represents a portion of the Flathead Valley, introduced a resolution supporting recreation on Flathead Lake, and encouraging decision makers to consider that aspect of use in management actions. 
Regier said hearing about drought conditions and the potential lower lake levels early in the year makes a difference. He said many people felt caught off guard in 2023, raising questions of whether mismanagement of the lake was part of the equation. 
An investigation by FERC found no problems with management of SKQ dam in 2023. 
“I get it, if water is scarce, I get that,” Regier told the Daily Montanan.  “If this is a year that’s more drought than usual, we have to talk about how do we balance tourism, economics, and recreation of Flathead Lake in the whole conversation.”
“When there’s just no water, snowpack’s down, it’s a drought year, I think more people can understand that,” he said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Flathead_Lake_boater-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-06 20:07:34.932182

Kelly Armstrong speaks during a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee on March 27, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Legal staff for North Dakota’s legislative branch concluded the “prudent remedy” to correct an error with Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s line-item veto would be for the governor to call a special session, according to a memo issued Friday.
But Attorney General Drew Wrigley, who is working on a separate opinion, maintains that Legislative Council has no role in determining the execution of the governor’s veto.
Armstrong announced May 22 a “markup error” with a line-item veto that crossed out $35 million for a state housing development fund. The red X over the funding did not match what Armstrong indicated in his veto message that explained his reasoning.
North Dakota governor unintentionally vetoes $35 million for housing programs

A Legislative Council memo distributed to lawmakers Friday concluded that legal precedent supports the marked-up bill as the official veto document. “Engaging in interpretive gymnastics” to disregard the markings on the bill could lead to unintended consequences in the future, Legislative Council concluded.
Emily Thompson, legal division director for Legislative Council, said the Legislature needs to have an objective document to clearly illustrate what was vetoed, such as the specific veto markings on the bill, so lawmakers can exercise their veto override authority effectively. 
Lawmakers have six days remaining in their 80-day limit and could call themselves back into session to address the veto. However, the memo cautions that the Legislature may need those days to reconvene to respond to federal funding issues or other unforeseen reasons. Legislative Council recommends the governor call a special session, which would not count against the 80-day limit. 
A special session of the Legislature costs about $65,000 per day, according to Legislative Council.

Armstrong is waiting for an attorney general’s opinion to determine the next steps, according to a statement from his office. He previously said he would call a special session if necessary.
Wrigley said Friday it’s up to his office to assess the situation and issue an opinion on the governor’s question. 
“The power in question is strictly the governor’s power and it has to be in compliance with the constitution and laws of North Dakota,” Wrigley said. “That’s the only assessment here. There’s no role for this in Legislative Council. They have no authority in this regard.”
Armstrong on May 19 issued two line-item vetoes in Senate Bill 2014, the budget for the state Industrial Commission. His veto message explained his reasons for objecting to a $150,000 one-time grant for a Native American-focused organization to fund a homelessness liaison position. But the marking also crossed out $25 million for housing projects and programs and $10 million to combat homelessness, which he later said he did not intend to veto.
Chris Joseph, general counsel for Armstrong, wrote in a request for an attorney general’s opinion that the markings served as a “color-coded visual aid,” and the veto message should control the extent of the veto. 
Wrigley said his office is working on the opinion and aware that resolution of the issue is time sensitive. 
Bills passed by the Legislature with appropriations attached to them, such as the Industrial Commission budget, go into effect July 1.
“I look forward to publishing my opinion on that at the earliest possible time,” he said.
The Legislative Council memo states, “It would not be appropriate to allow the governor and attorney general to resolve the ambiguity by agreement.”

In addition, Legislative Council concluded that if the governor’s veto message is to be considered the controlling document for vetoes in the future, more ambiguities would likely be “inevitable and frequent” and require resolution through the courts.
The memo cites a 2018 North Dakota Supreme Court opinion involving a case between the Legislature and then-Gov. Doug Burgum that ruled “a veto is complete and irrevocable upon return of the vetoed bill to the originating house,” and further stated the governor does not have the power to “withdraw a veto.”
“Setting a precedent of the attorney general issuing a letter saying we can just go ahead and interpret the governor’s veto message to mean what was, or was not, vetoed, that’s a really concerning precedent to set,” Thompson said in an interview. 
Wrigley said any issues resulting from the opinion could be addressed by the courts.
“I sincerely hope that they (Legislative Council) are not trying to somehow publicly advocate, or attempt to influence a process for which they have no role,” Wrigley said.

The order is “blatantly racist, and rooted in unfounded fear and political posturing,” said Molly Gray, executive director of the Afghan Alliance in Burlington, in a statement this week.

Seen on Feb. 20, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThe Trump administration late Wednesday announced a total ban on entry to the United States for citizens of 12 countries, including family members of refugees. The ban includes partial restrictions on seven other countries in a sweeping move that’s much more restrictive than the travel ban implemented on Muslim-majority countries during President Donald Trump’s first term.Expected to go into effect this coming Monday, the executive order targets mostly Muslim, African nations by fully suspending immigration and nonimmigrant visas for citizens of Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen who do not already have legal status in the U.S. The ban allows exceptions for permanent residents or green card holders and those with valid visas.The ban imposes further restrictions on residents of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela to protect U.S. citizens “from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes,” according to the order.Advocates said the ban is particularly cruel for more than 600 displaced Afghans who supported the U.S. in the war in Afghanistan and fled their home country in hopes of safe refuge in Vermont after the Taliban took control in August 2021. The majority of them have joined the workforce and contribute to society and the local economy in positive ways, advocates said.The order is “blatantly racist, and rooted in unfounded fear and political posturing,” Molly Gray, executive director of the Afghan Alliance in Burlington, said in a statement this week.“It is hard to put into words the absolute horror of this travel ban for Afghan refugees hoping for relocation to the United States from Pakistan pursuant to recent court orders,” she wrote. “It is hard to quantify the depravity, bigotry and short-sightedness of such a brazen abandonment of those individuals who risked their lives, over a 21 year period, for the United States in Afghanistan.”The Afghan Alliance recently announced a partnership with No One Left Behind, a Virginia-based nonprofit, to help expedite the evacuation and resettlement of vulnerable Afghan Special Immigrant Visa holders ahead of the anticipated travel ban.U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., last week joined his colleagues to demand answers from the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State on its “devastating” decision to terminate temporary protected status for Afghan nationals living in the U.S..“The grave conditions that forced Afghan nationals to flee and seek refuge in the U.S. following the return of the Taliban to power remain,” states the letter signed by 100 legislators. “Because of this harsh reality, forcing Afghan nationals in the U.S. to return to Afghanistan would be reckless and inhumane, and would threaten the safety and well-being of thousands of individuals and families, especially women and girls.”At least two new Afghans and several hundred asylum seekers from Cuba, Venezuela, Haiti and Ukraine who resettled in Vermont were set to lose their humanitarian parole protections due to recent federal orders. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a stay on the order, ending the Biden-era program.A previous order froze federal funding for refugee support affecting local relocation agency efforts. It further tried to deport Venezuelan migrants under the war-time Alien Enemies Act of 1798, an effort a federal judge last month struck down as unlawful.While many of the administration’s recent efforts remain tied up in court, they are a reflection of Trump’s campaign promise to potentially carry out “the largest deportation program in American history.”Advocates said these orders neither secure the future of the legal residents who passed the strongest checks nor improve the security, stabilization and sustainability of the nations targeted in Trump’s travel ban.READ MORE
The ban makes life “more problematic” for citizens of those countries in the U.S. and abroad, said Yvonne Lodico, executive director of the Grace Initiative Global, a nonprofit that provides services to several refugee groups including Haitians and Afghans living in Vermont. “Persons seeking asylum by international law are being refused entry to the U.S., or asylum status not granted. Families are kept apart. The inherent right of each human being to dignity and respect is being replaced by an atmosphere of threat and fear. Immigrant support groups are being eviscerated by funding cuts,”Lodico said. “Our hope remains in the warmth and humanity of individuals rallying to counter this bad news.”Grace Initiative Global is planning a program at the United Nations on June 20, World Refugee Day, to focus on the security and stabilization of Haiti, she said.Kristen Connors, a lawyer who has been working with clients in Vermont with pending asylum cases, said she continues to be shocked at how “flippant, cruel, and arbitrary” the restrictions are and called the language used in the latest order “racist and xenophobic.”“I’m saddened because I do not think that this proclamation will make us safer as a country, I think it will make us less safe, and less prosperous,” she said. “I hope this spurs more people in Vermont to learn about our current immigration laws, and about systems of global migration, and I hope this prompts people to step up and support real, humane, and meaningful immigration reform.” Two of her Afghan clients erroneously received federal letters telling them they had seven days to leave the United States and their work authorizations would be terminated. This happened despite them having employment authorization based on their humanitarian parole status, Connors said. Both were paroled in the spring of 2024 with the cases pending in court. They can lawfully remain in the country until their cases have been adjudicated, but the letters were nerve-wracking for them, she saidThe orders suspending long-standing refugee programs and funding have been hard to digest and adds to the uncertainty resettled groups already live with, said Nathan Virag, immigration lawyer for Association of Africans Living in Vermont, based in Burlington. He said the organization, which helps an average of 800 people annually across the state, has been fielding increased calls from Afghans, people from  African countries, India, Nepal, Venezuelans and Ecuadorians on how they can protect themselves, especially in interactions with immigration authorities.“There’s a lot of fear going around,” Virag said. “The unique thing is, even people who were lawfully admitted here — refugees, green card holders and people who have applied for asylum — they’re scared and wonder what’s going to happen to them.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trump’s most sweeping travel ban yet draws anxiety, criticism in Vermont.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/afghans-2-20240812-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-06-06 19:05:29.063780

These two deaths in infants, whose mothers were also not vaccinated against pertussis, are the first whooping cough deaths in Kentucky since 2018, the department said. 
Whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can be life threatening. It is most dangerous for babies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can, however, affect people of any age. 



Kentucky health officials emphasized the importance of maternal immunization during pregnancy and for all infants beginning promptly at 2 months of age.



“Anyone can get whooping cough, but infants are at greatest risk for life-threatening illness,” Dr. Steven Stack, the state’s public health commissioner, said in a statement. “Fortunately, when vaccinations are administered to pregnant women, it provides protection to both the mother and the baby.” 
The state’s public health department says there have been 247 cases of whooping cough so far in 2025. In 2024, there were 543 cases, the most since 2012. 
“Health officials anticipate that whooping cough will continue to increase during the summer and fall, based on historic trends,” the department said.
Vaccines are available to children as young as 2 months old and can help prevent it, the CDC says. The recommended vaccines are DTaP for children and Tdap for preteens. Concerned parents can call their primary care providers to ask about vaccines. 
Symptoms of whooping cough include, according to the Kentucky Department of Public Health: 

Runny or stuffy nose
Uncontrollable coughing
Vomiting from coughing 
Fever below 100.4 Fahrenheit

The new rules would have set increasing targets for sales of zero-emission products in the 4-county L.A. region over the next decade. Opponents say they would have limited consumers’ choices and driven up costs, while supporters say they are critical for healthy air.



After a contentious, five-hour hearing, Southern California air quality regulators rejected measures that would have phased out residential gas-powered water heaters and furnaces in the Los Angeles basin. 
The two rules, designed to clean up one of the biggest sources of the region’s severe smog, would have set increasing targets for sales of zero-emission products in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties over the next decade — beginning with 30% in 2027. The targets would not have been mandatory, although manufacturers would pay fees for each natural gas water heater or furnace they sell.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District board in a 7-5 vote rejected its boldest smog-fighting proposal in years. The decision, driven mostly by concerns about affordability, was a rare rebuke of measures proposed by the agency’s staff, which came after years of compromise and efforts to scale back what originally was a mandate phasing out the polluting heaters.
The board voted 7-4 to send the two proposed rules back to a committee, which means any new version likely won’t be considered until next year.  
An overflow crowd of several hundred people attended today’s hearing, with more than 200 people testifying. In addition, the agency received more than 30,000 written comments, fueled by an aggressive push of opposition from the gas and building industries. 
“Despite not being called a mandate, the rules would force on consumers electric units that are more expensive upfront to purchase, may require costly panel upgrades and are more costly to operate with rate increases being sought by providers,” Chino Mayor Pro Tem Chris Burton told the board, adding that the electric heat pumps also would add demand to an already stressed grid.
The Trump administration’s Justice Department warned the air district in a letter Thursday that it would sue to block the rules.
“California regulators are on notice: if you pass illegal bans or penalties on gas appliances, we’ll see you in court. The law is clear—feds set energy policy, not unelected climate bureaucrats,” U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli. a former California state Assemblymember, said on X.
Chis Chavez, deputy policy director with the environmental group Coalition for Clean Air, gave impassioned comments to the board after the vote. 
“Simply put, you have failed,” Chavez said, raising his voice to the board. “For this failure you are now inviting federal sanctions, limits on industry, limits on economic activity, and those are consequences you will have brought on yourself.”
Opponents criticized the measures as governmental overreach that will limit consumers’ choices and drive up costs for residents, businesses and landlords. 
The South Coast district’s 12-member governing board — made up largely of city and county elected officials — was heavily divided.
“What struck me today is a singular focus on housing costs and overall costs and the reality is in the state of California, health care costs are increasing at a greater rate than housing increases,” said board member Holly Mitchell, a Los Angeles County supervisor. “We do have to make tough decisions on behalf of the greater good every day. We have a responsibility…to get us on a path to cleaner air.”
Orange County, Inland Empire officials voted no
All  six representatives from Orange County and the Inland Empire voted against the measures, along with the board member representing western Los Angeles County cities. Members representing the state Senate, Assembly, city of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County eastern cities and Los Angeles County Supervisors voted in favor.
“I think this mandate hits really hard for disadvantaged and fixed income residents,” said board member Janet Nguyen, an Orange County supervisor, saying it could cost residents tens of thousands of dollars to buy the electric heaters and rewire their homes. “I think we also need to be diligent given the (Justice Department’s) formal warning.”
The measures wouldn’t have required people to get rid of old heaters and would not have banned new natural gas ones. Instead, they were designed to allow consumers to choose between electric heat pumps or natural gas appliances while penalizing manufacturers for selling ones that pollute the air.
“I think this mandate hits really hard for disadvantaged and fixed income residents…I think we also need to be diligent given the (Justice Department’s) formal warning.”AIR BOARD MEMBER JANET NGUYEN, AN ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR
Fernando Gaytan, an attorney with the environmental group Earthjustice, urged the board to approve the measures despite what he called the U.S. attorney general’s “grandstanding” in his letter to the board.  
“Failing to adopt this standard because of the Trump administration’s bullying will only encourage efforts to ignore the law,” Gaytan said. “It will only embolden oil and gas industry interests to ramp up the misinformation campaign to derail lifesaving regulations. Let’s be clear, this rule is not a ban. It’s not even a mandate.”
Under the rules’ sales targets, 30% of residential and commercial water heaters and furnaces sold in 2027 would be zero-emissions, ramping up to 50% in 2029, 75% in 2033 and 90% in 2036. Manufacturers would pay fees between $500 and $50 for each natural gas one sold in the region. The fees would be used to help low-income households purchase the zero emission appliances. 
Air board member and Los Angeles City Council Member Nithya Raman said the early targets would essentially match where the market already is in terms of selling zero-emission heat pumps.
“I know this is a period of uncertainty but there is time built into the structure of the rule. I think it would be a grave error not to move this forward with the commitment that we will always come back to it and review our work, ” she said.
Based on the lifetime of these appliances — 25 years for heating systems and 15 years for water heaters — about half a million would have been replaced annually in the region, according to the air district. The district expects 90% of all water heaters and furnaces in the region will be zero emissions by 2061. 
The cost of buying and installing an electric heat pump to replace natural gas appliances varies, depending on what people need: Replacing an entire HVAC system with a heat pump would cost consumers about the same or even less than a natural gas system, according to the South Coast district’s estimate. But installing a heat pump instead of a natural gas water heater would cost $2,000 more, and replacing just a furnace would cost $8,000 more.
Air quality officials say consumers would save money by switching to electric heaters. Between 2027 and 2061, residents in the four-county region would have collectively saved an annual average of between $191 million and $250 million on utility bill costs by switching from natural gas to electricity, according to the district’s estimate.
Residential heaters emit as much pollution as oil refineries and power plants
The region’s 10 million water heaters and furnaces are among the largest sources of smog-causing gases in the L.A. basin, emitting almost 7 tons a day of nitrogen oxides.
The measures would have eliminated 2.2 tons of nitrogen oxides a day by 2037 and 6 tons a day by 2061, according to the district’s data. In comparison, in 2037, oil refineries will emit 2 to 3 tons per day, utilities 4 tons per day and vehicles 7 tons per day, based on projections by the air district. Vehicles, oil facilities, power plants and other industrial sources have already been regulated for decades.
Nitrogen oxides react with other gases in the air and bake in the sun to form ozone, the main ingredient of smog, which causes asthma attacks and other health effects. The appliances also pollute indoor air, raising the risk of respiratory problems, and emit fine particles linked to heart attacks and other health effects.

The reduction in pollution would prevent about 2,500 premature deaths, 2,500 emergency room visits and 10,000 cases of asthma, and save $25 billion in health costs, according to the district’s data. 
“I’ve seen firsthand how families in my community are forced to live with the health consequences of dirty air. Our children grow up with asthma, our elders struggle with respiratory illness, and too many lives are cut short,” Lynwood City Councilmember Juan Muñoz-Guevara told the board today. “Gas appliances in our home are one of the largest sources of smog-forming pollution in the region. We cannot meet clean air goals without tackling this.”
“I’ve seen firsthand how families in my community are forced to live with the health consequences of dirty air. Our children grow up with asthma, our elders struggle with respiratory illness, and too many lives are cut short.”LYNWOOD CITY COUNCILMEMBER JUAN MUNOZ-GUEVARA
Luz Perez, a Fontana resident who attended the hearing holding her young daughter at her hip, said she supports the rules and hopes it will mean cleaner air for her family.
“I had air monitors installed in our mobile home and I was surprised to see how polluted the inside air was,” she told the board. “It took me a while to recognize it was because of the gas stove and that made me really nervous. I figured it was important for me to come talk about it because we need to be able to transition to safer air.”
Despite decades of efforts to clean the air, the L.A. basin still has the worst air quality in the country and has consistently failed to meet federal health standards for smog and soot.
Gas companies, businesses, developers and other groups aggressively campaigned against the regulations, arguing that it would effectively mandate manufacturers to sell zero-emission appliances and increase costs for consumers. 
“Over time, the public will be forced to pay hundreds of dollars more to replace their gas appliances,” wrote Kevin Barker, a senior manager for SoCal Gas’s energy and environmental policy, in a letter to the district. “It is not in the public interest, especially at a time when consumers are demanding affordable energy solutions, to raise upfront costs of the most affordable options.” 
Environmental groups criticized the rules as failing to be aggressive enough. The air district’s original plan would have mandated manufacturers to sell all zero emission appliances in 2031. 
The Bay Area already has similar rules, enacted in 2023, that mandate zero-emission water heaters in 2027, furnaces in 2029 and large commercial water heaters in 2031. However, they are being amended to allow more flexibility for manufacturers to comply.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/051925-Water-Heaters-Lowes-LV-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-06 19:05:29.063780

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Candidates and outside groups have spent more than $122.5 million on this year’s gubernatorial primary, a total greater than any other in state history and one that stands to rise in the race’s closing days, the New Jersey Election Law Commission said Friday.
The spending total includes $54.9 million from the candidates themselves and $67.7 million from outside groups. Between them, $14 million remained unspent, and that number could swell from late-arriving donations to independent expenditure groups, which face no contribution limits. Voting is underway and ends Tuesday.
Spending totals for this campaign have already more than doubled those in every gubernatorial primary since at least the turn of the millennium and have outpaced even the most expensive gubernatorial general election. That November 2005 race between Democrat Jon Corzine and Republican Doug Forrester cost about $98 million after adjustments to inflation, the commission said.
This year’s 11 gubernatorial candidates had about $6.7 million left in reserves on May 27, the last date covered by regular pre-election campaign finance disclosures.
The commission credited the number of candidacies and a larger gubernatorial fund match for the increase.
Candidates who meet fundraising and spending thresholds can receive up to $5.5 million in matching public dollars for the primary in exchange for observing an $8.7 million primary spending cap and participating in debates hosted by the commission.
Five of the eight candidates have maxed out or nearly maxed out their matching funds.
Of the $54.9 million spent by the candidates, Democrats Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop and Rep. Mikie Sherrill lead the pack, with Fulop spending nearly $8.7 million and Sherrill shelling out $8.5 million as of May 27. Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2017 and 2021, spent $8 million, followed by Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat, at $7.9 million. 
Spending by outside groups is dominated by Working New Jersey, a super PAC funded by an independent expenditure group linked to statewide teachers union the New Jersey Education Association. It is responsible for more than half of the outside spending in the race, with at least $37.5 million boosting Democrat Sean Spiller, the union’s president. Spiller’s own campaign has spent only $342,059.
Spiller’s Democratic rivals have seen less but still sizable support from independent expenditure groups. They have boosted Rep. Josh Gottheimer to the tune of $11.6 million; Fulop, $7.4 million; former state Sen. Steve Sweeney, $4.3 million; and Sherrill, $3.8 million. A group run in part by Trump ally Kellyanne Conway has spent $1.3 million supporting Ciattarelli’s campaign.
Gubernatorial totals far exceed fundraising and spending on this year’s Assembly races (all 80 seats in the chamber are on the ballot this year). Not counting independent expenditures, Assembly candidates have raised nearly $26.3 million and spent about $15.4 million, the commission said.
Most of that money, $20.8 million, has flowed to incumbents. Collectively, challengers have raised just under $5.5 million.
The ratio is similarly split along party lines. Democratic candidates account for $21.6 million of the funds raised, while only $4.7 million went to Republicans.

June 6, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen is seeking reelection as the state’s chief elections officer. 
In his campaign kick-off event Friday, the secretary of state touted the state’s elections as the nation’s most “secure or accurate.” But he said he wonders whether any non-citizens might have gotten on the voter rolls. 
Evnen appeared to be trying to balance defending the state’s elections his office administers and echoing the concerns of some Republicans and President Donald Trump over election integrity since the 2020 presidential election, national framing that some election experts have warned could undermine trust in elections. 
“There is more work to be done, and we must continue to focus on being proactive in the future,” Evnen said. “Threats to election security are not static.”

U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly joined Evnen’s reelection announcement, as well as a handful of Nebraska state senators. Evnen is running for his third term as secretary of state, but this race follows his closest contest to date, a 2022 GOP primary in which he faced two populist Republican challengers who combined to hold him under 50% of the vote. He won the general election without any major party opponent. His office, in addition to overseeing elections, also handles business registrations and international relations. 
Kelly emphasized that the country has seen “some very poorly orchestrated elections,” but “not in Nebraska.” 
“We’ve been so lucky to have Bob Evnen,” Kelly said. 
Kelly and other speakers praised Evnen for how he has represented Nebraska when speaking to other counties about trade opportunities with the state, and for his handling of elections. 
Nebraskans passed a state constitutional amendment in 2022 requiring the Legislature to implement voter ID in Nebraska. Nonpartisan poll watchers have praised Evnen’s office for its implementation of the law, and Fewer voters were turned away under the law than in other states with similar laws. 
Evnen, in talking about the voter rolls and what he described as the risks of non-citizens voting, said years of the U.S. having an “open border” left him questioning “whether some of those people ended up on voter rolls.” 
Election watchdogs have said that framing from some Republicans is based on the “myth” of widespread voting by non-citizens. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, analyzed election conduct from 2003 to 2024 and found 24 instances nationally of noncitizens voting out of millions of votes cast.
Evnen also reemphasized his support for Trump’s executive order overhauling the administration of U.S. elections. The secretary signed on to a joint letter with 19 other Republican secretaries of state this year that requested more access to federal immigration data to help verify voter registrations. 
Evnen told KETV earlier this year that he would like to investigate whether 46 Nebraskans who have voted over the past several elections are U.S. citizens. 
When the Nebraska Examiner asked the Secretary of State’s Office earlier this year how many non-citizens had been removed from voter rolls or voted in past elections, a spokesperson said the agency has not “removed anyone due to their status as a non-citizen, nor do we believe that there are many such people registered to vote.” 
Evnen’s office, in the regular course of business, removed 13,550 voters from the voter rolls after the November 2024 election – most due to death or relocation from the state. Such removals are routine and required by federal and state law. Evnen said Friday that his office is working with the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office to establish a process to confirm the citizenship of people registered to vote in Nebraska.
Current Federal law doesn’t require proof of citizenship to register — but it bans noncitizens from voting in elections. Other states, such as Wyoming and Louisiana, have passed state laws requiring anyone registering to vote to provide proof of citizenship. Those bills align with the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which the U.S. House passed in April. The SAVE Act would require proof of citizenship in federal elections.
If the SAVE Act passes the Senate and becomes law, it would codify parts of the Trump executive order that Evnen calls a “new and hopeful chapter.”
“The President’s executive order all but points to Nebraska as the model for how free and fair elections should be conducted,” Evnen said. 
Evnen has talked about potentially requesting more time from the Legislature to verify signatures on petition drives for ballot measures after questions were raised about the validity of some signatures gathered for recent petitions, including ones targeted in a lawsuit aimed at stopping medical marijuana. Legislation seeking to provide more time fell short this year.
Evnen also said Friday that he is “proudly pro-life and pro-Second Amendment” — topics beyond the scope of his office that could signal that the Secretary of State has bigger aspirations. 
He said he expected a challenger in 2026, whether from his right flank, a Democrat or both.
“If one is going to run for office, the only safe assumption to make is that one will have an opponent,” Evnen said.

(Obtained from AOGC filing)Arkansas oil and gas regulators are working to replug a century-old oil well in Ouachita County that began leaking in May, after the state Oil and Gas Commission approved an emergency request to pay for the work.
A commission inspector wrote in a May 12 report that the leak had affected large trees that “are browning and losing leaves.” Department of Energy and Environment spokesperson Melony Martinez wrote in an email that there was no risk of further environmental contamination.
“The leak is not near any private [water] wells of record or any municipal water systems. It is located in a remote area and is not near a town. … Once plugging is completed and weather conditions are conducive, surface abatement and cleanup measures will begin,” Martinez said. The department’s Division of Environmental Quality “is aware of the response but is not actively involved in plugging operations,” she said.
The commission has spent a little over $400,000 so far and expects to spend around $500,000, Martinez said. However, she emphasized it was difficult to estimate exact costs.
According to commission staff at a hearing last week, the state was notified of the leak in mid-May. Martinez said they estimated the well had been leaking for three to four days prior to the state becoming aware of it.

The well was still actively leaking as of June 3, but the leak is contained, Martinez said. Oil and Gas Commission records show the leaking fluid was diverted to a “pit.” Contractors “removed 9 loads” out of the pit on May 14. 
“The Commission expects the well will be plugged over the next few days, which would mean it is no longer leaking,” Martinez said.
While Martinez said there were no estimates for the amount of fluid that has leaked from the well, images included in the commission’s filings last week show large areas of pooled fluids around dying trees and vegetation.
The well was last operated by “The Texas Company,” and was likely plugged around 1940, commission staff said in their request for emergency spending authority to address the leak. Commission attorneys said last week that they were unable to track down “the original permit holder,” necessitating the commission to expend funds.
Commissioners voted unanimously to grant staff the authority to use money from the Arkansas Abandoned and Orphaned Well Plugging Fund to address the leak.
The number of active and producing oil and gas wells in Arkansas have been steadily decreasing. Thousands of wells have been abandoned, either plugged or unplugged, or orphaned in the century since Arkansas’ first oil boom.

Kim Reynolds signed more than 20 bills into law Friday, including funding for the state’s Opioid Settlement Fund and state-level Medicaid work requirements.
The governor has a little more than a week, until June 14, to sign the remaining bills passed during the 2025 legislative session into law. This week, the governor has held events signing multiple measures into law — including the reduction in Iowa’s unemployment insurance tax system. On Friday, she signed into law House File 969, a bill expanding the disability and death benefits for first responders like firefighters, emergency medical services responders and law enforcement officer to cover all forms of cancer.
This was not the only measure Reynolds signed into law Friday. She released a list of 24 new laws, which include some state spending provisions and other high-profile policies sent to her desk earlier this year.
Here are some of the bills signed into law:
Medicaid work requirements
As discussions — and conflicts — continue over the federal work requirement proposal for Medicaid coverage included in the GOP budget reconciliation bill, Reynolds signed Senate File 615, into law, a measure setting similar work requirements for the Iowa Medicaid program.
The requirements for at least 80 hours of work each month would apply to people receiving health coverage through the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan. IHAWP is the state’s expanded Medicaid program for low-income people between ages 19 to 64. There are exemptions to these work and reporting requirements for people with disabilities, serious illnesses or injuries, as well as those with children under age 6.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The law directs the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services to seek a waiver to implement these requirements from the federal government. Iowa HHS has already submitted a waiver with a slightly different work requirement plan for IHAWP — one that sets a 100-hour per month work requirement, or for a person to be earn the equivalent in wages to working 100 hours a month at $7.25 per hour, or be enrolled in education or job skills programs to retain coverage.
Reynolds said in a statement on the bill signing, “it is priority of mine to ensure our government programs reflect a culture of work.”
“If you are an able-bodied adult who can work, you should work,” the governor said. “We need to return Medicaid back to its intended purpose—to provide coverage to the people who truly need it.”
Democrats and others critics have said the legislation will cut off health care coverage for eligible Iowans due to additional red tape, leading to a financial hit for rural hospitals and other health care centers.
The measure also contains a component that could have lasting impacts for Iowa’s expanded Medicaid program: If the federal government allows Iowa to implement work requirements, then later revokes approval, HHS would be directed to end IHAWP. The move to discontinue the program would require federal approval, and if the decision is not approved, Iowa HHS would be asked to pursue implementing an “alternative plan” under federal Medicaid administration guidelines.
Opioid Settlement Fund
After several years of stalled action, Reynolds approved the Legislature’s agreement on how to spend money from opioid lawsuit settlements.
House File 1038 distributes $29 million from the fund, money obtained in settlements for lawsuits by states against opioid manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies for their roles in the opioid epidemic. For several years, lawmakers in the Senate and House have failed to reach an agreement on how to spend the funds, which are obligated to go to opioid addiction treatment and prevention. But in the final hours of the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers agreed to a system that provides funding for specific organizations and programs that focus on addition treatment, recovery and prevention in fiscal year 2026.
In future years, money in the settlement fund will go to Iowa HHS and the Attorney General’s office — entities that will then decide how to allocate the money to organizations in the state. HHS will receive 75% of the funding each year and the AG’s office will receive 25%. While some lawmakers said they were frustrated with the money going to these state entities instead of being distributed directly by the Legislature, the bill passed with broad bipartisan support as get the funding into Iowa communities.
The governor thanked the Legislature for sending the bill to her desk in 2025.
“The opioid crisis continues to impact Iowa families,” Reynolds said in a statement. “I’m thankful the legislature reached an opioid settlement fund agreement this session to immediately distribute $29 million to providers and appropriate ongoing available funds to support early intervention, prevention, treatment, and recovery.”
Open records, meetings
The governor also signed House File 706, the bill setting higher penalties for violations of open meetings laws and requiring public officials t9 receive training on open meetings and records laws.
The bill was brought forward this year after a similar measure was vetoed in 2024 after a last-minute amendment was added that public records advocates had said would lead to unintended consequences. But Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, said adding heightened penalties and more training was still an important measure to pass as a means of addressing violations of these laws in Davenport related to the collapse of a six-story apartment building and alleged violations of open meeting laws in 2023.
The bill was also amended in 2025 by the Iowa Senate to include language add two types of records to the state’s list of confidential records — security camera footage from the Iowa Capitol and information from state employee identification card access systems.
Fetal development videos in Iowa classrooms
Senate File 175, also signed into law Friday, is a measure modeled after “Meet Baby Olivia” laws passed in other states. Though Iowa’s law does not reference the “Meet Baby Olivia” video developed by the anti-abortion group Live Action by name, it requires students in 5th through 12th grade human growth and development classes be shown ultrasound video and computer-generated rendering or animations depicting “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization.”
The bill was amended by the House to include a provision banning materials in school classrooms on fetal development that come from an entity that performs or “promotes” abortion, or that contracts, affiliates, or makes referrals to organizations that perform or promote abortions.
Democratic lawmakers said this ban would mean material coming from reputable organizations and health care providers, like the Mayo Clinic or the University of Iowa Health System, could be excluded, as the ban would not exclude organizations that perform abortions in cases necessary to save the life of the mother.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers in both chambers of the Maine Legislature advanced legislation Thursday expanding access to needle exchange programs and funding proper disposal of syringe litter.
Syringe service programs are nonprofits or municipalities certified by the state to hand out clean syringes in exchange for used ones as a method of harm reduction for those impacted with substance use disorder. The two bills — LD 1078 and LD 1738 — would allow the programs to expand their locations within the county they are certified to operate in and create a biohazard waste disposal program within the Maine Department of Health and Human Services that would offer grants to community organizations that incentivize proper disposal of used syringes. 
Both passed the House of Representatives after some debate with critics questioning the need to expand these programs, which are often blamed for creating excessive syringe litter. 
“The potential for improperly discarded needles in parks, on sidewalks or in public bathrooms is not hypothetical. It is a reality in cities that have expanded similar programs without adequate controls,” said Rep. Kathy Javner (R-Chester).
Proponents of the bills pointed to support among medical providers and harm reduction experts, who have vouched for the programs’ effectiveness in preventing disease transmission. They also said the proposed grant program would incentivize safe needle disposal and allow communities to come up with their own solutions to syringe litter disposal, with partial funding from the state.
“We know that when people have access to safe disposal, we all benefit with the right tools, we can reduce the risk of disease transmission, protect public spaces and build trust across divides,” said Rep. Julie McCabe (D-Lewiston). “We do not need to choose between the health of our communities and the health of individuals. We can have both.”
Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor) pointed to Portland’s needle buyback program, which the city estimates has helped reduce syringe litter by 76% and resulted in a 58% increase in used syringe return. Participants can earn 10 cents per used needle they turn in, with a weekly cap of 200 syringes per person.
The Senate also passed both bills without discussion. The grant program would cost the state roughly $120,000 for the first two years for a new position to oversee the program, in addition to an annual allocation of $500 to establish the fund. 
The syringe service expansion is estimated to cost roughly $426,000 a year, which would go to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Though both bills won the support of the Legislature, funding may still prove to be an obstacle as the budget committee is wrestling with how to address a significant deficit.
Earlier this session, lawmakers on the health committee rejected a bill that would have severely limited the number of clean syringes that certified programs can hand out, backing the state’s current, more flexible policy. 
In 2022, Maine adopted new rules that allow participants to bring in just one used syringe to receive 100 clean ones. The state health department also allows participants to receive up to 100 syringes, even if they don’t bring any used ones in, at the discretion of the provider.

He is the first person to be convicted of criminal wage theft in Minnesota. (Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer) A painting contractor was sentenced on Friday to three years probation for stealing more than $37,000 in wages from five workers at an affordable housing development in Minneapolis.
Frederick Leon Newell was the first person ever to be convicted of felony wage theft in Minnesota in April, more than five years after state lawmakers enacted criminal penalties for wage theft. Newell was also convicted of felony theft by swindle.
Newell must also complete 200 hours of community service and pay more than $42,000 as part of the sentencing, and he may not bid on new public contracts.
“Mr. Newell was entrusted with public funds to pay his employees for their labor on a public works project. Instead, he siphoned the money they earned for himself,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in a statement. “I am proud of our prosecutors’ efforts in securing the first wage theft criminal conviction in Minnesota history; it is a major step toward greater protection for workers.”
Integrated Painting Solutions was hired for painting and cleaning work in 2020 on the Redwell, an affordable apartment complex in Minneapolis.
Newell’s company received more than $320,000 for the work on the development, which required that he pay a prevailing minimum wage of $36 per hour for painters and $36.41 per hour for general laborers plus benefits because it received public funding through tax increment financing.
Newell paid his workers far less than required — from $15 to $25 per hour — and submitted falsified payroll records to cover up the underpayments. All told, Newell stole more than $35,000 in wages from five workers, with one employee underpaid by nearly $14,000 over just three months in 2020, according to the criminal conviction.
The case came to light after the workers filed complaints with the city of Minneapolis’s Civil Rights Division, with the help of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades union.
The city investigated their claims and in June 2021 issued a violation letter to Integrated Painting Solutions. Newell signed a settlement agreement with the city to pay $43,166 in restitution but never did.
Greiner Construction, the general contractor for the Redwell, voluntarily made Newell’s workers whole beyond what they had already paid to Newell’s company.
In 2022, the previous Hennepin County attorney, Mike Freeman, filed charges against Newell after receiving a referral from the city of Minneapolis.
Last week, Moriarty announced felony wage theft and theft by swindle charges against Bishop Harding Smith, the head of the violence intervention nonprofit Minnesota Acts Now, for allegedly shorting workers $150,000 from a county contract.

Idaho has 31 children’s residential care facilities, including two that provide psychiatric care. (Getty Images)Idaho kids in residential treatment facilities are under less government oversight for abuse investigations than children in traditional foster homes, a new watchdog state government report finds. 
The Idaho Office of Performance Evaluations, a nonpartisan state agency, found that the state lacks several accountability measures in children residential treatment facilities.
Idaho investigators repeatedly found kids in danger. Treatment programs faced few consequences.

“Children’s residential care facilities serve some of Idaho’s most vulnerable children and youth,” who are “almost three times as likely to be diagnosed with mental health disorders, behavioral challenges, or other disabilities,” the report said.
A panel of Idaho lawmakers on Friday officially released the report to the public. The report was spurred by news reporting that uncovered abuse allegations at Idaho residential treatment facilities published by the news outlet InvestigateWest.
Presenting the report to the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Friday, Office of Performance Evaluations Director Ryan Langrill called the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s response — which noted ongoing progress to work toward child welfare shortcomings — promising. 
“The state lacks a formal process for investigating abuse in facilities, unlike the clear process that exists for investigating abuse in homes,” Langrill wrote in a letter summarizing the report. “When abuse of a child in a facility in foster care is reported, case workers are not required to respond as quickly as for other children in foster care.”

 What the OPE report found — and reforms it recommended

Residential care facilities house children with round-the-clock care. Some kids even go to school at the facilities. 
Some kids are placed in facilities by their parents, or by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare as part of the state’s foster care system.
Idaho has 31 children’s residential care facilities, including two that provide psychiatric care.

In children’s residential care facilities, Idaho doesn’t have an established process to investigate abuse, doesn’t require unannounced visits to facilities, and doesn’t have a formal process to register staff found to have committed abuse in a statewide registry, the report found. 
The state agency’s watchdog report recommended a range of reform efforts — including making an entity responsible to investigate abuse in facilities, requiring at least once a year unannounced visits, establishing a child’s bill of rights in facilities, tracking ideal placement settings for children, and developing a process to include abuse perpetrators in a statewide registry.
“We found that while the (Department of Health and Welfare) shared oversight responsibilities of children in facilities, it lacks protocol to define communication or issue escalation across division,” the report found. “As a result, safety-related information may be passed from one staff member to another without timely action or clear accountability.”
 How state officials, agency responded

In a letter responding to the report, Idaho Gov. Brad Little wrote Thursday that he was pleased with the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s progress — and that he and the agency want to improve more.
Idaho governor signs bill investing $23M in state’s foster care system

“We have more work to do, but these improvements and current momentum have us on the right track,” Little wrote. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare “team and I are committed to continuing this work and meeting the needs to best serve Idaho’s children and families.”
Soon after Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Alex Adams took over heading the agency in June 2024, he announced child welfare as a top priority for the agency. That was “largely due” to past watchdog work by the Office of Performance Evaluations into child welfare issues, Adams wrote in a May 21 letter responding to the report.
And he outlined over a dozen changes within the agency that were in response to the watchdog’s agency’s findings, including the agency’s licensing division started in May 2024 to visit facilities one time a year for an unannounced survey, expanded clinical reviews to find the best placement for kids, and visits every two months to kids in out-of-state facilities by case workers or clinicians.
“While these improvements have been occurring over the past year, we recognize that there is much work to do to improve child welfare in Idaho, and particularly to support Idaho youth living in residential care facilities,” Adams wrote. “… Ultimately, it takes strong public policy, cooperation from the courts, support of law enforcement, assistance of guardians ad litem, and collaboration with the Health and Social Services Ombudsman to ensure the safety of Idaho’s children.”
 Idaho state agencies to report back on progress

State Rep. Steve Berch, a Boise Democrat, pressed a state health official on whether the Department of Health and Welfare needs more staff to implement recommendations from the new report. 
It’s probably too early to tell, replied Idaho Deputy Director for Child, Youth & Family Services Monty Prow. 
He referenced a new investment from the Idaho Legislature this year. That new budget law approved 63 new staff for Health and Welfare targeted at preventing kids from entering the foster system — by providing resources to keep them safely with their biological families. 
“It’s probably too early to tell, because those 63 folks are going to be dedicated to prevention — to keep those kids in their homes. And then I don’t need any of this back-end support, because I’m pushing it all to the front-end to do more and more prevention to keep kids safe in their home,” Prow said.

Berch quickly replied, encouraging the department to ask for the funding it actually needs, rather than shorting the request based on political calculations. 
“The Legislature needs to know what the need is financially to deliver the kind of quality service …  not just now, but for the needs of a fast-growing state,” Berch said. “Before the Legislature decides to cut taxes, they need to understand what the needs are first. And people like you in your position and other departments need to make sure that information is available to the Legislature so they can make a fully informed decision.”
In the fall, the committee plans to hear from the Department and Health and Welfare and Idaho’s new Health and Social Services Ombudsman Trevor Sparrow about progress in responding to the report’s recommendations. 
That can give lawmakers a sense of what issues state agencies can address themselves, and whether legislation is needed, said state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, who requested the update.

But for some people present during the 3 a.m. June 1 raid at the Alamo, that simply was not the case. For Alejandra De La Vega, the venue located just outside the town of Summerville, right along the Charleston and Dorchester county line, was a place to dance with friends.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)
“I went to Alamo to enjoy the night, just like many others,” she told reporters Friday. “But instead of fun, it turned into fear and humiliation.”
De La Vega had just stepped out of the restroom when she said police stormed in, guns drawn. Patrons were running and screaming, she said, as more officers streamed in and ordered people to the ground.
“It was chaos,” she said at the news conference outside the Lonnie Hamilton Public Services Building in North Charleston.
County, state and federal law enforcement held and questioned the more than 200 people present at the club during the raid, dubbed “Operation Last Stand,” for two hours, De La Vega said.
The S.C. State Law Enforcement Division began investigating Alamo in November 2024 after receiving a tip about potential human trafficking at the venue, agency spokeswoman Renée Wunderlich told the SC Daily Gazette Friday.
The Department of Homeland Security also got involved in the investigation at that time, she said.
Later Friday, SLED announced criminal charges against two people, the club’s 59-year-old owner, Benjamin Reyna-Flores of Hanahan, and a 44-year-old security guard at the club, Terone Lavince Lawson of North Charleston.
Reyna-Flores faces multiple charges related to unlawful sale of alcohol. The club had no alcohol license.
Lawson faces illegal gun and drug possession charges. According to warrants from SLED, Lawson had 2 grams of meth, an eight ball of cocaine, and less than a gram of psychedelic mushrooms in his van. Police also found a pair of handguns in the van, which Lawson cannot legally possess due to past convictions for burglary in 2008 and assault in 2003.
Those arrested include two unidentified “high-level cartel members” associated with the Mexico-based Los Zetas cartel and the Venezuela-based Tren de Aragua gang and one person wanted by Interpol for murder in Honduras, said U.S. Department of Homeland Security agent Cardell Morant.
Ten juveniles as young as 13 — including one reported as missing — as well as an unidentified number of potential human trafficking victims were at the club at the time of the raid. Law enforcement also reported seizing guns, cocaine and cash.

In her retelling of events, De La Vega said police separated anyone with visible tattoos and photographed them.
De La Vega, a transgender Latina woman who has lived in the United States since 2001, said officers questioned the validity of her state-issued I.D. card, as well as that of the transgender woman she was there with.
De La Vega has legal residency status in the U.S. She was not arrested.
But 80% of those arrested Sunday did not have legal status to be in the country. The vast majority were arrested on civil immigration charges, not criminal violations.
Five people were arrested for criminal offenses, Morant said.
Homeland Security confirmed to The Post & Courier that Sergio Joel Galo-Baca is the Honduran man wanted for international homicide. Beyond SLED’s announcement Friday, no other names or list of charges have been released.
Homeland Security officials have not responded to emails sent by the SC Daily Gazette.
“The narrative that’s been put out by the sheriff, by the governor, by the attorney general, is that they are just trying to stop violent criminals, stop trafficking,” said Will McCorkle, a member of the Charleston Immigrant Coalition. “But what they quickly overlook are the many innocent people that were detained and are now in the process of deportation for no real purpose.”
Now, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina, several families do not know where their family members are.
They have searched their names online using Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s database that people can use to locate the state and center where detainees are being held. But their family members’ names have not shown up in the search, said Dulce Lopez, immigrant rights advocacy strategist for the ACLU.
They can only assume, based on news reports, that their family members are at an ICE holding facility in Folkston, Georgia.

“That made me realize, how easily everything can be taken away,” De La Vega said. “I keep thinking, what if I didn’t have a legal status? What if I were detained and ripped away from my family?”
“My mom is my hero,” De La Vega continued. “She came to this country and gave me and my siblings a better life. She raised us with love and sacrifice and with so much strength. We’re really close, and I don’t know what I would do if I was taken from her. No one should have lived with that fear.”
Charleston County Sheriff Carl Ritchie, during a news conference Monday, cited noise complaints at the club and reports of assaults in the parking lot.
Outside of Sunday’s raid, the sheriff’s department responded to the club 13 other times since 2020 for calls including “suspicious circumstances,” vandalism and one armed robbery, according to a call log provided by the department.
Area business owners said their biggest issue in the last several months had been club goers parking on the side of the highway and in their parking lots after the club’s lot filled up, leaving behind excessive trash and beer bottles after nearly every weekend.
The nightclub did not have a license to sell alcohol.
A group of faith and immigrant community leaders stressed that they do not condone criminal activity.
“But no one deserves to be treated as guilty by association,” said Lopez, of the ACLU.
People have reason to be afraid, McCorckle said, citing the recent case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported in March to a notorious prison in El Salvador. Living in Maryland, Garcia had been protected from deportation by a 2019 judge’s ruling that he likely faced gang persecution in his home country.
The Trump administration has insisted Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, which Garcia denied.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)The U.S. government this week set aside environmental protection laws in order to speed up border wall construction along approximately 20 miles of New Mexico’s border with Mexico.
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday signed a waiver of various federal laws to expedite border wall construction in southwestern New Mexico. She also signed two similar waivers for areas in neighboring Arizona on Tuesday and Thursday.
Taken together, the waivers allow the federal government to speed up construction of physical barriers and roads along approximately 36 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, the agency said in a news release on Thursday.
The waivers “ensure the expeditious construction of physical barriers and roads, by minimizing the risk of administrative delays,” DHS said.
The New Mexico waiver lifts the legal requirements of 24 separate federal statutes, including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, just to name a few.
“Trump is recklessly casting aside the foundational laws that protect endangered species and clean air and water to build a wildlife-killing wall through pristine wilderness,” Laiken Jordahl, Southwest conservation advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity, told Source NM on Friday.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told Source NM on Friday in a statement that she has serious concerns about the waivers, saying they bypass protections for endangered species, cultural heritage sites and Native American artifacts.
“New Mexico’s archaeological resources and sensitive ecosystems could face permanent damage without proper environmental review,” Lujan Grisham said. “While we understand border security concerns, the federal government should engage with state officials before waiving decades of established environmental protections.”
The New Mexico waiver designates an area in southwestern New Mexico as “an area of high illegal entry,” divided into three sections.
The DHS news release states that the sections of the border where the laws have been waived total approximately 8.5 miles, but that figure is inaccurate, according to Jordahl, who has traveled to every part of the U.S.-Mexico border as part of his work.
“It is extremely frustrating how difficult they make these waivers to track,” he said. “Instead of using simple [latitude and longitude] coordinates, they pick landmarks that are almost impossible for the public to map. I believe they may have made an error in their locations in the waiver.”
One section starts at a point on the border just south of Antelope Wells in Hidalgo County and extends one-tenth of a mile east, according to International Boundary and Water Commission data. Jordahl told Source NM he found the same measurements using his own map of the border. This section is already walled off, and so DHS is likely adding another layer of wall, he said.
Another section begins at a point on the border just south of Wamels Draw, a valley in Luna County, and extends approximately 7.5 miles east. This section of the border already has vehicle barriers, but is not walled off yet, Jordahl said.
Building a border wall along this particular stretch would be the most environmentally damaging by far, Jordahl said, because it would threaten the movement and migration of Mexican gray wolves.
“We’ve seen Mexican gray wolves in this area; we’ve seen them cross the border,” he said. “We’ve also seen them push up against the border wall in New Mexico, wander along it for days and then ultimately have to turn around, being unable to cross.”
Jordahl said his organization’s focus lies on Arizona’s two waivers and potential wall construction, which would also threaten wildlife.
“Throwing taxpayer money away to wall off the Santa Cruz River and San Rafael Valley would be a death sentence for jaguars, ocelots and other wildlife in the Arizona-Sonora borderlands,” he said. “This is happening while border crossings are at the lowest level in decades. We’ll fight this disastrous project with everything we’ve got.”
The third section starts at a point on the border west of Santa Teresa and extends approximately 12.4 miles, over Mount Cristo Rey, to the Rio Grande near El Paso. This section already has older mesh border walls, and DHS may be installing newer walls there, Jordahl said.
The sections of the border described in the waiver lie in the same general area as the New Mexico National Defense Area, a newly created military buffer zone which the U.S. government is trying to use — along with novel criminal charges — to discourage people from crossing the border.
Gov. Lujan Grisham, in the statement provided to Source, urged meaningful consultation with state and local officials before the federal government begins construction that “could cause lasting harm to our communities and environment.”
“New Mexico’s natural and cultural resources deserve consideration in this process,” she said.

(Courtesy of the Office of Secretary of State)The Washington State Library in Tumwater and the Washington Talking Book and Braille Library in Seattle will close to the public on July 1 due to a lack of state funding.
State libraries will also eliminate 12 jobs due to the financial pressure. 
Shuttering the facilities will curb access to the state’s trove of historical and governmental collections and force cancellation of an array of services and programs, the secretary of state’s office announced Friday.
“Libraries are cornerstones of civic life and education in many areas of our state. The impact of the closures will risk denying communities access to the information, literacy tools, and resources they depend on,” Secretary of State Steve Hobbs said in a statement.
The move comes after lawmakers and Gov. Bob Ferguson didn’t provide $6.7 million in the budget to cover a shortfall created largely by a decline in revenue from fees paid on real estate transactions.
At the Tumwater library, those who dial up Ask A Librarian or the main switchboard, or send an inquiry by email, can expect to wait up to a week for a response. Additionally, subscriptions to newspaper and genealogy databases will be discontinued, and the acquisition of new materials will be drastically limited.
When the Talking Book and Braille Library closes to the public, responses to voicemail messages will take longer. Circulation and registration services will be slowed as well.
Programming such as multisensory story time and the Low Vision and Touch of Braille workshops will be canceled. Production of braille and audio materials could also be reduced at the state’s only accessible library service for people who are blind or have other disabilities.
“These disruptions jeopardize equitable access to information for some of Washington’s most underserved residents unable to read standard print,” said Washington State Librarian Sara Jones. “While a newly signed bill will provide some funds in the future, the current funding gap is affecting our employees and important services now.”
A bill signed by Ferguson on May 19 will impose a new $50 surcharge on all filings handled by superior court clerks, of which $20 would go to the secretary of state’s office for the library, archives and state legacy projects. This would generate up to $6 million in a full biennium, according to a fiscal analysis.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/6264508415_47e9637024_o.jpg,,,2025-06-06 18:07:18.238668

(Photo by Alex Baumhardt / Oregon Capital Chronicle)While Democratic members of Oregon’s congressional delegation expressed alarm at the sudden resignation of the leader of the state’s only national park, the Republican who has the park in his district declined to take a position Friday.
Kevin Heatley, the new superintendent of Crater Lake National Park, resigned from his post May 30 over staffing concerns after just five months on the job.
Heatley, who had previously worked at the Bureau of Land Management, told Oregon Public Broadcasting, KGW, The Washington Post and several other news organizations that staffing was already lean at Crater Lake, and layoffs of probationary employees President Donald Trump ordered, followed by hiring freezes, mandates to leave vacant positions unfilled and new federal incentives from the Office of Personnel Management and the office known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to resign or retire were making it worse.
Oregon’s congressional delegation met the news with differing levels of concern.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Dexter, representing Oregon’s 3rd Congressional District, wrote Wednesday to Doug Burgum, secretary of the Department of the Interior, demanding to know if he or the agency had undertaken any analysis of what staffing levels were like there or how bad it had gotten. Dexter is also a member of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.
On X, formerly known as Twitter, Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said it is clear to him that Trump is “hellbent on destroying natural treasures like Crater Lake.”
U.S. Rep. Cliff Bentz, who represents Oregon’s 2nd District —his district includes southern Oregon’s Crater Lake — said on the phone Friday he’d “look into it.”
“The person’s (Heatley) concern may be well founded. It may not. Until I know the facts better, I’m not going to take a position on it, but now that you’ve raised an issue, we’ll look into it,” he said.
The national park in southern Oregon, famous for its vibrant and translucent volcanic lake that is among the deepest in the world, typically sees about half-a-million visitors each year. But this summer, 60 to 65 seasonal positions will need to be filled, Heatley told journalists in several reports, and just eight ranger positions have so far been filled to keep visitors in the 286-square-mile park safe.
“I mean, the train is still running on the tracks, but it’s not heading in the right direction,” Heatley told OPB on June 2. “I cannot, in good conscience, manage an operation that I know is moving in the wrong direction.”
Spokespeople for Crater Lake did not respond to Capital Chronicle requests for staffing and hiring data.
The federal jobs portal USA Jobs does not list any current vacancies at Crater Lake. The Kansas-based company running Crater Lake’s lodging, concessions, retail and boating operations had 18 vacant positions listed on its site as of June 5.
The National Parks Conservation Association, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit conservation group, called the staffing issues at the 63 National Parks a “full-blown staffing crisis.”
They report that the Department of the Interior’s own workforce database shows that as of May 13, the Park Service had just over 18,000 employees across all parks, a more than 16% drop from 2023, the previous fiscal year — a decrease equal to that of the previous ten years combined. The association said the recent sharp drop was driven by Trump-incentivized buyouts, early retirements, deferred resignations and leaving vacancies unfilled.
Interior Department data also shows 39% of seasonal and temporary staff at the national parks have been hired so far — about 3,300 employees. That’s less than half the number of seasonal employees Park Service officials said they’d hire in a February memo.
In her letter to Burgum, Dexter called Heatley’s resignation a “flashing red warning sign that something is very wrong,” in a news release Wednesday.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The University of Utah has terminated its recognition of a fraternity accused of “egregious and serious” hazing, including forcing new members to drink alcohol and use drugs, sleep on a basement floor, and do chores at 3 a.m. 
According to a letter from Vice President for Student Affairs Lori McDonald, the university will not consider applications to recognize the Sigma Nu – Epsilon Lambda fraternity until 2031. 
The letter, signed in May, details a number of hazing allegations that occurred during fall 2024 and spring 2025 semesters, pointing to “a pattern of misbehavior over the past six years, including hazing, alcohol-related violations, and destruction of property.”

In January, the university was alerted to possible violations of student code from the fraternity. It launched an investigation that was completed in May. 
That investigation, according to a report released by the university, found at least 13 incidents of “subtle, harassment and violent” hazing. That included:

An event where new members were forced to drink large quantities of beer, vodka and whiskey.
Requiring new members to complete chores as early as 3 a.m. or risk facing humiliating sexualized punishment by active members.
Blindfolding, kidnapping and bringing new members to an “exotic dance club.”
Telling new members to participate in an interview while using marijuana, or risk removal.
Giving members “derogatory” nicknames.
Hosting expensive and unsanctioned parties where alcohol was provided.  
Requiring new members to carry “pledge packs” at all times, which included items like tobacco, condoms, a golf tee, gum, Zyns and a marijuana pen.

The investigation report also detailed a tradition where new members were forced to stay in the basement of the fraternity building. 
“During this timeframe, limited food was provided, new members slept on the basement floor, and they were required to clean the facility and sing songs while actives and alumni were present,” the document reads. 
“I do not have confidence the Sigma Nu chapter will follow the University’s directions, policies, or the terms of a suspension, and therefore, termination of the University’s recognition of the chapter is warranted,” McDonald wrote to the fraternity in the May 19 letter. 
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the university’s Greek Council Executive Board said hazing is “harmful, unacceptable, and has no place in our community.” 
“The actions that led to this decision, do not reflect the values or true purpose of Greek life. Greek organizations should stand for leadership, service, friendship, and personal growth,” the board said.
According to the university, three fraternities have lost their official recognition since 2002.

File photo by J. Scott Applewhite/Associated PressVermont Attorney General Charity Clark celebrated a court order Thursday that paused some of the Trump administration’s cuts to AmeriCorps programming. The federal agency facilitates national volunteer service through grants and job placement in six areas: education, environment, disaster preparedness, health, economic opportunity, veterans and military families.In April, President Donald Trump’s administration terminated nearly $400 million in AmeriCorps grants and ordered the reduction of its professional workforce. The agency placed 85% of its federal workforce on leave and informed its professional employees their contracts would be terminated on June 24. In Vermont, the terminated grants accounted for $2.4 million in funding, impacting 200 AmeriCorps volunteer positions related to housing services, food security, school programming, flood recovery and more. Also, the administration dismissed volunteers with the National Civilian Community Corps, which impacted work at a Habitat for Humanity project in Bennington. The cuts prompted Clark to join a coalition of attorneys general from 22 other states and the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania in a lawsuit, arguing that the Trump administration acted unlawfully.U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman of Maryland temporarily blocked the termination of grants and ordered the agency to restore AmeriCorps and VISTA volunteers, who work to alleviate poverty by supporting local organizations, within all the states that brought the lawsuit. The judge also stated that the agency must follow legal requirements to provide the public advance notice and the opportunity to comment before major service changes are made.“I am pleased that the Court affirmed our argument that the Trump administration lacks the authority to unilaterally cut AmeriCorps programs. This is a win for the rule of law as well as for Vermont communities, which have been well served by AmeriCorps volunteers for decades,” Clark wrote in a statement.READ MORE
The judge required that AmeriCorps notify award recipients of the order by the end of Friday.Boardman did not provide all the relief that the states sought in their lawsuit. Her order did not affect the Trump administration’s order to put the AmeriCorps’ professional workforce on forced leave or the planned cuts to those federal positions. Also, the court ordered the Trump administration to restore one group — National Civilian Community Corps volunteers, who focus on disaster relief — “to the status quo” prior to April 15. But the order limited the restoration of grants and volunteers through other AmeriCorps programs to those in states that are parties to the lawsuit. In 2024, AmeriCorps volunteers served at over 300 locations across the state, including homeless shelters, youth centers, food banks, schools, veterans’ facilities and other organizations.SerVermont, the State Service Commission for Vermont that oversees the bulk of AmeriCorps programs in the state, declined to further comment Friday.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Federal judge protects AmeriCorps volunteers in Vermont and 22 other states from Trump cuts.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Americorps-generic-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 18:07:18.238668

The bills were moved forward by the Senate Judiciary Committee following additional testimony on the reintroduced package – but not before the panel heard emotional testimony from gun violence prevention and safety advocates and gun rights groups, the latter of whom opposed the bills.
Senate Bill 224 would ban bump stocks, devices that let users essentially convert their semi-automatic weapons into rapid firing weapons. A bump stock was one of the primary tools used in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, the deadliest in American history. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2024 struck down federal rules created after the shooting that defined a semi-automatic weapon equipped with a bump stock as an automatic weapon, which was already banned under law.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe federal high court’s decision, however, has not deterred Michigan Democrats from seeking ways to ban them at the state level. Michigan would join 17 others in adopting a similar policy.
Sponsored by Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia), Senate Bill 224 would add bump stocks to a list of disallowed firearms equipment in Michigan.
“Destructive weapons of war should never have a place in our communities, yet devices that allow individuals to convert a rifle into a functioning machine gun remain legal in our state,” Polehanki said. “And let me be clear: these are not tools for sport or self-defense. Bump stocks are used to inflict maximum harm in seconds, and their continued availability puts every one of our communities at risk. That’s unacceptable, and it’s time for a change.”
Senate Bills 331 and 332, both sponsored by Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), would prohibit the purchase, possession and distribution of firearms without valid serial numbers, which are commonly referred as ghost guns because they are untraceable in federal and state firearms registries.
McMorrow’s bill would make a first offense a misdemeanor with a penalty up to a $5,000 fine and one year in prison. Successive offenses would be considered felonies with up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
A member of McMorrow’s staff delivered testimony on Thursday, but in a statement issued following the committee hearing, the senator said ghost guns were designed to deliberately evade accountability, requiring no background checks, no serial numbers and no way to trace them if used to commit a crime.
“As we see law enforcement officers recovering these untraceable firearms at an alarming rate, Michigan can’t afford to wait,” McMorrow said. “Just as rapidly as new weapon production methods emerge and evolve, so too must our laws and public safety efforts. Our communities deserve nothing less.”
Polenaki also sponsored Senate Bills 225 and 226 along with Sen. Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield).
The bills would make the Michigan Capitol Commission’s open and concealed carry bans law, and would also apply to the Anderson House Office Building and the Binsfeld Senate Office Building.
At least 26 other states have a similar ban in place to maintain the safety of their Capitol grounds.
Bayer during testimony on Thursday recounted the fear she felt when armed protesters stormed Michigan’s Capitol and remained in the Senate chamber’s gallery, which several senators said made them feel intimidated as they voted on important legislation.
“Those types of threats and intimidation have no place in any work environment, especially not one where the work of the people is being done,” Bayer said. “Every day, we have students and teachers, parents and public servants walk the halls of our Capitol. It’s our responsibility to make sure they feel safe doing so, and this legislation will help ensure all people feel safe freely participating in our state’s democracy.” 
Members of Moms Demand Action, Students Demand Action and various other gun safety groups, like Brady and Giffords, testified Thursday in support of the measures, hoping they would keep firearms out of the Capitol and keep ghost guns and bump stocks out of the hands of future mass shooters.
Linda Danders with Moms Demand Action said from the very first time armed extremists showed up at the Capitol to intimidate lawmakers, her group knew there was a real and imminent threat to the safety of Michiganders and the state’s democracy. 
“That’s why we’ve been urging Michigan lawmakers to prohibit guns in the Capitol,” Danders said. “Thanks to the efforts of many in this room, open carry of firearms in the Capitol Building is now prohibited, but there is still a dangerous loophole left for individuals to carry concealed, loaded handguns into and on Capitol grounds, including in this building.”
Tom Lambert, legislative director for Michigan Open Carry, said he was opposed to the package, calling it another episode in the continuing series of “people who hate guns, don’t know what they’re talking about and they don’t care,” referring to Senate Democrats’ push for greater gun control.
“You have serious Second Amendment issues, you also have serious Fifth Amendment issues. Not only are you taking lawfully possessed property that people acquire lawfully and possess lawfully today and you’re prohibiting it, you’re in the alternative requiring them to deface these items that, again, lawfully, do not have a serial number on them,” Lambert said of the ghost guns bill. “If you put one of these federally regulated serial numbers on them, you will decrease the value of those items, some of which are worth a significant amount, which constitutes a Fifth Amendment taking.”

Lambert insinuated that could lead to legal consequences for the state that could cost a lot. 
“I hope we put [that] in the budget to pay for all that stuff,” he said.
In response to emotional testimony from a student, Sen. Sue Shink (D-Northland Township) said no young person should have to worry about the threat of gun violence.
“Quite frankly, at my age, it’s not something I should have to worry about either,” Shink said. “And I’ll just tell you, and also so that the people who are from those gun organizations know that, yeah, it’s scary to know that they’re out there pushing violence and pushing fear on people who just want to live in peace, who just want to be left alone to pursue their life, liberty and happiness. It’s bullshit. You shouldn’t have to put up with it.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Facetune_22-04-2025-13-44-27-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-06 18:07:18.238668

However, an expanded state water contact advisory for the river from elevated bacteria levels, issued on Thursday, remains in effect.
The new warning extends an already-existing advisory for the Pearl River — which since 2019 has ranged from the northern tip of Hinds County to Byram — to the Na Sandifer Memorial Highway Bridge just north of Monticello, in total stretching over 60 miles. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality cautions against contact with the river — such as swimming, wading and fishing — in the affected areas until further notice. 
“This expansion of the advisory is based on test results showing the potential for human health risk well beyond the original advisory zone,” said MDEQ Executive Director Chris Wells in a Thursday press release. “We continue monitoring the situation and conducting additional testing to determine the full extent of the impact.”

MDEQ told Mississippi Today on Friday that, based on JXN Water’s information, between 10 millionto 20 million gallons of untreated sewage entered the Pearl River per day during the malfunction. Over nine days, that would equal 90 millionto 180 million gallons total. For reference, there were 41 sanitary sewer overflows (or SSOs) at the West Bank Interceptor between the start of the year and March 31, according to JXN Water’s quarterly report, totaling around 5 million gallons.
“While this is one of the most extensive water contact advisories we’ve issued in recent years, we do not anticipate that the expanded advisory will remain in place long-term,” said MDEQ Communications Director Jan Schaefer. “The release has been stopped, and we expect bacteria levels to begin to normalize through natural biological processes and dilution.”
According to JXN Water, the city’s third-party utility in charge of its sewer and drinking water infrastructure, its contractors discovered a “catastrophic failure” at the West Bank Interceptor where it crosses Hanging Moss Creek on May 28. The city has long struggled with that facility, which is the main transmission line to the Savanna Street Wastewater Treatment Plant, dating back at least to its 2012 consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency. JXN Water also attributed the recent issue in part to “severe and rapid erosion” along the river’s banks near the interceptor because of heavy rain this spring.
As a temporary fix, the utility’s contracted crews put in four bypass pumps to redirect wastewater through nearly 4,000 feet of piping. JXN Water said the long term fix requires repairs to two damaged interceptors, estimating a cost of over $7.5 million. The cost of the temporary measures, including diesel for the pumps and rental equipment, will be around $300,000 a month, the utility said.

JXN Water spokesperson Aisha Carson said the utility will use its operations budget to pay those costs, as the large infusion of federal funding it received is largely reserved for drinking water repairs. The utility is working with the EPA to secure emergency funding, Carson added.
U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate placed control of the sewer system under JXN Water in 2023. One of the priority projects included in the order is to rehabilitate the West Bank Interceptor.

According to state records, the facility has been fined $2,750 due to the staff being unable to demonstrate the skills and techniques necessary to manage residents’ behavior, and failing to provide residents with nursing services required to meet their needs.
In one incident, a resident who had complained of acute abdominal pain in March was sent to the emergency room of a hospital where it was discovered he had swallowed a plastic spoon. An endoscopy was then performed to remove the spoon.

State inspectors allege Woodward officials investigated the matter and reviewed video footage that showed the resident, who was to receive one-on-one monitoring from the staff, sitting at the dining room table and putting a spoon in his mouth and down his throat. The footage allegedly showed the worker assigned to watch him left the area at least once.
Inspectors reported, without elaborating, that the video footage was “unavailable” for them to review.
The resident suffered from pica – the practice of eating inedible objects – and had previously swallowed batteries, coins and rocks. A Ziploc bag containing plastic straws and spoons was found in his bedroom after the incident involving the spoon.
In the second incident, a resident of the home was transported to the hospital the evening of March 17, 2025, a day and a half after the staff had noticed one knee was bruised, swollen and unable to bear weight.
The home’s administrator of nursing later confirmed the staff should have notified Woodward’s physician on the morning of March 16, 2025, when they first became aware of the injury.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Her career is ending amid legislative attacks on her profession, but Jodi Fick still thinks “the sky’s the limit” for libraries.
Fick has been working in libraries since 1983 and has led Siouxland Libraries’ 13 branch locations in Sioux Falls and the surrounding area since 2017. She’s retiring on June 20.
South Dakota lawmakers nearly passed a bill earlier this year that would have subjected librarians to criminal prosecution for disseminating obscene books to children. The failed proposal was replaced with a requirement that school and public libraries allow appeals of their obscenity determinations.

Governor signs bills regulating transgender bathroom use and requiring obscenity appeal process

State law says material is obscene if it “appeals to the prurient interest,” is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sado-masochistic abuse or sexual conduct, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
Fick expressed faith that libraries will survive the scrutiny. “The pressures on libraries ebb and flow, depending on what’s going on in society,” she said, adding that the public’s right to access a broad variety of information usually prevails. 
Fick grew up in Mobridge. She earned a bachelor’s degree from Augustana University in Sioux Falls and a master’s in library science from Emporia State University in Kansas. Her library career began with a work-study position at Augustana’s Mikkelsen Library.
After completing her education, she joined the Minnehaha County Rural Public Library as assistant director in 1990, a role she held until a 1995 merger. That year, the Sioux Falls city library system merged with the county library system to form what is now Siouxland Libraries.
When Siouxland Libraries was created, Fick transitioned into the new system as a senior librarian. In 2007, she was promoted to assistant director, and in 2017, she was appointed as the director.
The area served by Siouxland Libraries grew in population from 124,915 in 1995 to 250,551 in 2024. The annual circulation — the number of times materials are checked out — rose from 1.1 million to 2.1 million over that period.
The following conversation with Fick has been edited for length and clarity.
How has the function of a library in a community changed since you started? 
How our libraries function has evolved somewhat. Before the internet, we had huge reference collections. Just ranges and ranges of books that provided valuable information, but it wasn’t like something you’d take home and read. It was, you come, we help you find the information you need, and you go on. Well, once we had the internet, that information became readily available. Of course, you still want to ensure the source can be trusted, and that’s another skill we still provide – knowing how to know if the source is reliable. Is it vetted? Has it been edited? Libraries also have searchable databases of reliable information. 
What is the future of libraries?
The sky’s the limit. When I started, we barely had computers. I was hired originally to automate the library, and we were still using the old card catalog system. The ability for you to even know what books existed was next to nothing, which was a very different library from today. You would come to the library, browse the collection, and go home with things. 
Now, you can sit at home on your phone, browse, and you can even check it out through your local library app and start consuming the information.
I think that books and knowledge will continue to be the core of what libraries are, because we are the gatherers of that knowledge, and make it available to our community to consume. 
But I also see that we hold an important part in being that “third place.”
So, you have places you’re at where you can simply be:  home, work or that “third place,” where you’re not required to buy a meal or pay for something. This is a spot where you can come to, and you can gather with others, you can use meeting room space, or you can just be, that is outside of your home and your workplace, because the community has created these branches that are a spot for you to come to. So, we’re that “third place.” 
There’s a sociologist who calls libraries “palaces for the people.” And I like that image. Libraries are living, breathing things.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
I think over the years, what I have seen is that librarians are staying in tune with the community, trying to understand what the needs are, and then adapting our services to what that community needs at that time. Of course, within our range. At one time, we were the spot to get your IRS tax warrants. Other times, we are helping people find jobs.
I think as long as libraries are reflective of what their community needs, they will continue to be successful. But that also means that what a public library is in South Dakota is, well, there are hundreds of different variations. The answer depends on what the community needs and is.
What did you make of the recent legislative proposal that would have criminalized librarians who check out obscene materials to minors? 
What was interesting was that, as a library, we don’t collect obscene materials. Why was this deemed necessary at all? I don’t know. I wasn’t asked about it. But we don’t collect materials that fit the legal definition of obscenity.
Let’s say we did have obscene materials – which, of course, we don’t – that law would have said that if my job required me to check out this material upon request, and I did it, I would no longer have the protection of “I was just doing my job.” 
Now, the risk to us is slim, but I honestly don’t understand where it was coming from. 
My concern, as the director of the public library, is that it created a picture that library staff are here trying to cause harm to our children in our community, which is so far from what librarians are doing. 
How do you approach the balance between community standards and the library’s role in providing access to a wide range of information, particularly when facing pressures to restrict certain content?
We lean back on the policies that have been set by the library boards. 
Since our inception, we’ve had policies that tell us what we are supposed to collect. So, everything that we do is based on policies that have been developed over the years, not just as practices, but how we provide collections for our communities. Specifically, we have a collection development policy. It defines who selects, who’s responsible for it, what are the criteria we use when we’re selecting, and both for adding and removing materials, or if we find that there’s things in our collections that aren’t appropriate for our collection. So that’s all laid out.

For Siouxland Libraries, the policies are all set by the Siouxland Libraries Board of Trustees. And they are basing a lot of it on freedom of speech rights. So, the First Amendment rights for people to have access to a wide variety of thoughts. 
When we’re selecting, we also do a lot of analysis of what people are using. And we pay attention to the high-use items, low-use items, and also what people are asking us questions about and try to build a collection that’s based on that. 
And there are just certain subjects that are also going to be more sensitive. One in particular is human reproduction, especially when you get into children’s non-fiction. We recognize that can be a very sensitive topic for people. But we have families who come to us wanting resources that can help them when they’re trying to have those conversations with their children. And different families have different expectations for what types of information is appropriate, because parents know their own children best. 
I’m a parent. I have two children. They’re now adults, but I very much remember when it came time to “have the talk,” and make sure that they understood their bodies, and what was going on. 
What I did not want was children living their lives with a lack of knowledge, or misinformed, or ashamed. Most of our families who come in, they want to be able to present information to their children accurately. How that information is presented will vary. Some want details, others want the birds and the bees analogies. So, we have materials that present a variety of viewpoints.
Do you think it’s important that libraries provide access to books that include sexual content that some find offensive? Why?
Look, there will be books that have difficult scenes. Is this obscenity or not obscenity? Well, the term has a pretty narrow legal definition. 
But why are these books important? Often, you’ll see this in teen books or “coming-of-age” books.
A coming-of-age book has a teen dealing with a specific issue, and they grow through the experience, and there’s a resolution. The books are designed to help teens navigate something. Now, why are they navigating things that they’re not going through? Because those things are happening within their communities. It might not be to them specifically, but how much more important is it that they’ve thought about a situation before they’re in the middle of it – they see someone resolve through it? The person in the book may or may not have done what you’d want them to do, but they’re learning from that experience. 
Teens grow into adults. They go through difficult things, and those types of books help them learn about the environment around them. You learn how to deal with situations without actually experiencing that situation. You have a chance to consider things in your head before you’re put into situations that you’re not prepared to handle. 
The pressures on libraries ebb and flow, depending on what’s going on in society. I have files of other times when there have been similar things. In the late ’90s, it was movies. Our library has movies that are G-rated to R-rated. A child might take that home and watch it.
Well, we have been very much supported by our community and by the parents in our community saying, “What a child checks out is to be regulated by the parent.” A child can’t get a library card without a parent’s permission. A parent has full access to what their child is checking out. We very much encourage coming with your child to the library. We support parents’ rights to be the parent.
What are you most proud of?
I’m most proud of how many people continue to use the library.
People are coming, and they’re coming in more and more. The compliments that we receive, the numbers of people who say, “I love the library, I don’t know what my life would be like without access to this.”

Free.,Wrongly deported Maryland man Abrego Garcia returned to U.S.,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/wrongly-deported-maryland-man-abrego-garcia-returned-us,,"WASHINGTON — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to his native El Salvador three months ago, was brought back to the U.S. on Friday and will face federal charges, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said.Abrego Garcia’s case had become a flashpoint in a debate over what due process rights protect immigrants from deportation after federal officials conceded he was sent to a notorious El Salvador mega-prison because of an administrative error. Still, President Donald Trump, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, Bondi and other administration officials said for months Abrego Garcia could not be released because of criminal conduct they had not publicly produced evidence of.Bondi said Friday a federal warrant for Abrego Garcia’s arrest on human trafficking charges compelled his release from the Salvadoran prison system.“Abrego Garcia has landed in the United States to face justice,” Bondi said at a Department of Justice news conference Friday afternoon. “He was a smuggler of humans and women and children.”The 10-page indictment filed in the Middle District of Tennessee comes after a federal grand jury indicted him on May 21 for allegedly transporting migrants in the U.S. without legal authorization within the country.Chris Newman, an attorney representing the Abrego Garcia family said at a virtual press event Friday that he remained skeptical of the federal charges lodged at Abrego Garcia.“I can tell you that we should all treat whatever charges that are being leveled against him with a high degree of suspicion,” Newman said. “We should make sure that he gets a fair (trial) in court because he’s clearly not getting a fair hearing in the court of public opinion.”Bondi did not detail when the investigation in Abrego Garcia began, but said the federal indictment charges contained “recently found facts.”“This is what American justice looks like upon completion of his sentence, we anticipate he will be returned to his home country of El Salvador,” Bondi said.Outcry over due processAbrego Garcia’s wrongful deportation to the notorious mega-prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, drew national outcry as the Trump administration clashed with a federal court that ordered the return of the Beltsville man and resisted the U.S. Supreme Court’s order to “facilitate” his return.Despite the orders, Trump administration officials did not appear to take any public steps to secure Abrego Garcia’s release, and at times seemed to relish their defiance of the courts.Bondi thanked El Salvador’s government Friday for releasing Abrego Garcia in compliance with the warrant.The Trump administration has argued in federal court in Maryland for months that Abrego Garcia is in the custody of El Salvador and therefore cannot be returned, despite a $15 million agreement between the U.S. and the Salvadoran government to keep roughly 300 men removed from the U.S. and detained at CECOT. Abrego Garcia had been moved to a different El Salvador prison prior to his release.Abrego Gacia had deportation protections to his home country of El Salvador since 2019.He was pulled over by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in March and informed that his immigration status had changed. He was later placed on one of three deportation flights on March 15 to CECOT.The Trump administration admitted his removal was an “administrative error” but has since alleged that Abrego Garcia was a leader in the MS-13 gang without producing evidence in the federal civil court overseeing the suit challenging his removal.Maryland U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador to press for Abrego Garcia’s release and return to the U.S., welcomed the news as a victory for due process rights.“As I have repeatedly said, this is not about the man, it’s about his constitutional rights – and the rights of all,” the Maryland Democrat said in a statement. “The Administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.”William J.

The region is among the areas meant to benefit from the BEAD program for rural broadband access. (Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)The Trump administration on Friday released revised rules for a federal program meant to widely expand broadband access, stripping the Biden-era effort of many key requirements and making it easier for Elon Musk’s company to win grants.
Under the revised guidelines, the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, will take a technology-neutral approach to expanding broadband access rather than focusing on fiber internet. The original program favored fiber because of its speed, reliability and ability to reach remote locations.
The change opens the door for more internet providers to use BEAD grants for technologies including satellite internet service, which is provided by Elon Musk’s Starlink. Under the new rules, Starlink could receive $10 billion to $20 billion in BEAD money, up from $4.1 billion the company would have received under the original rules, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Groups applying for BEAD funding also will no longer be required to offer a low-cost service option for internet users in locations they are serving. Some states had proposed services as low as $30 a month.
Instead, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration now encourages internet providers to propose their “existing, market driven low-cost plans” to meet the cost requirement.
A lagging broadband program faces more delays as Trump plans changes

As part of the Trump administration’s push to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives within the government, the new guidelines also remove provisions that encouraged states to work with companies and representatives from minority communities. Requirements related to labor, the environment and climate change also were cut.
And the agency eliminated a provision of the original program that encouraged states to seek out non-traditional providers, including municipalities or political subdivisions that provide internet service.
Louisiana’s, Nevada’s and Delaware’s proposals, which had been approved, will be rescinded.
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick promised to launch a rigorous review of the BEAD program in March, saying in a statement that because of “woke mandates, favoritism towards certain technologies and burdensome regulations, the program has not connected a single person to the internet and is in dire need of a readjustment.”
In April, the Trump administration gave states an additional 90 days to submit their final plans for the $42.45 billion program in anticipation of the changes, further delaying an effort that’s set to go back to the planning phase after more than three years.
Evan Feinman, the former director of the BEAD program, said states will now have to rework their proposals again.
“For some reason, [Secretary] Lutnick, who said the program was going too slowly, wants to slow the program down much more, force states and the private sector to do a ton of extra work and spend a bunch of extra taxpayer money all so we can get worse connections to people that will cost them more every month,” he said.
The Internet & Television Association, a trade association representing the broadband and cable industries, praised the new guidelines in a statement, saying, “We welcome changes to the BEAD program that will make the program more efficient and eliminate onerous requirements, which add unnecessary costs that impede broadband deployment efforts.”
But Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, said in a statement that the changes will “cement the digital divide for decades.” The Benton Institute is a nonprofit organization championing digital access for all.
“[Lutnick] is hurting our economic competitiveness, our healthcare and education, and our ability to work and stay connected with loved ones,” Garner said in the statement. “He is denying rural Americans access to the modern economy and our increasingly connected world.”

After a pandemic-era pause, repayments on defaulted student loans restarted last month, and many borrowers are running into barriers. (Seth Wenig/The Associated Press)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
Universities try 3-year degrees to save students time, money

When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.










These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.


– Celina Damian, California student loan servicing ombudsperson


Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
 ‘Can’t wait for Washington’

Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
More public colleges admit high schoolers even before they’ve applied

Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
 Repayment

Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
Transparency bills seek to reveal the true costs of college

“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
 ‘Incentive to hike prices’

Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

The first batch of Missouri’s summer food benefits for children were issued on Thursday night, a spokesperson for the Department of Social Services told The Independent Friday. Each eligible child will receive a one-time benefit of $120, loaded onto a card that can be used like a debit card to buy groceries.
The program is designed to help low-income families pay for food during summer months. States pay 50% of the administrative costs and the federal government pays 100% of the benefits. 
It’s part of a permanent federal program in its second year of existence called Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer, or SUN Bucks. The program aims to help kids who receive subsidized school meals avoid a summer drop-off in nutrition.
The state in years past has struggled to get the benefits out to cover the summer months. Last year they didn’t begin going out until September, due to technical issues, the state said at the time. 
Food security advocates in the state were relieved when Missouri opted into the program after weighing factors like technology issues and staffing.
There were 11 Republican-led states that opted not to offer the program this year, and a 12th, Oklahoma, will offer it only to tribal nations. 
Most eligible families in Missouri will receive the benefits automatically. 
The following groups of kids are automatically eligible, and their families will not need to apply for benefits: 

Students who are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch during the school year,
Households already enrolled in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or temporary assistance,
And children between ages 7 and 17 in foster care, who are experiencing homelessness or are migrants.

Those benefits will be issued on an existing card if the family is enrolled in SNAP benefits or temporary assistance, or on a new mailed card if they are not. Families who need a new EBT card can request one by phone or the ebtEDGE mobile app.
Families who are not automatically eligible must submit an application online by Aug. 31. The state’s eligibility navigator will tell families whether they must apply.
Benefits will expire 122 days after they are issued, regardless of usage, so families must act quickly once the benefits are distributed. They should also keep the cards for next summer’s program, the state’s website advises.
An estimated 475,000 Missouri kids could receive the benefits, according to a letter to the state from the federal Food and Nutrition Service earlier this year.

Employees and the health center are continuing to spar about who exactly has the right to join the newly formed Hospice United.

Hospice staff at another University of Vermont Health Network subsidiary have voted to unionize, also becoming a part of AFT-Vermont. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerHospice staff at the University of Vermont Health Network Home Health & Hospice voted overwhelmingly in favor of formalizing their union on Thursday after roughly six months of organizing.The vote came as hospice employees and management at the nonprofit subsidiary of the UVM Health Network have continued to spar before the National Labor Relations Board over who exactly has the right to join Hospice United, which will operate under the umbrella of AFT-Vermont. “Hospice care is unique in the fact that the team model is interdisciplinary, so it’s only natural to all of us that our bargaining unit would represent all of the voices of the team,” said Nell Smith, who works as a volunteer coordinator for UVMHN Home Health & Hospice. “I have trust that that will happen.” UVM Health Network Home Health & Hospice provides long-term care for people with severe health needs, as well as palliative and hospice care for people with terminal illnesses. Hospice United will only represent employees who contribute to the hospice side of the organization’s operations.Organizers maintain that the union should encompass roughly 85 hospice employees, including nurses, social workers, chaplains and bereavement coordinators, among other staff members. Management, meanwhile, contends that about 15 of those employees should be excluded from the union, arguing that some of those positions — such as chaplains and bereavement coordinators — do not have the right to collectively bargain with the rest of the unit.According to Emma Galvin, an organizer with AFT-Vermont, 56 staff members voted 49-7 to formalize the union. Also, 13 additional employees voted “under challenge,” meaning that, because the hospital administration is currently challenging their right to be in the unit, their votes would have only been tallied in the case of a close vote. As employees and administrators at UVMHN Home Health & Hospice continue to dispute the scope of the union, both groups will begin to look toward negotiating their first bargaining agreement. “Throughout this process, HHH has focused on ensuring hospice staff had an opportunity to have their voices heard,” said a statement released by the UVMHN Home Health & Hospice. “We believe the election administered on-site by the National Labor Relations Board met that goal and expect to be in contact with the union soon to begin negotiating in good faith a collective bargaining agreement.”AFT-Vermont currently represents over 11,000 health care and higher education workers in Vermont, a number that has grown sharply in recent years as large swaths of the state’s health care workforce have sought to organize for better wages and working conditions. Over 100 nurses at the Northwest Medical Center in St. Albans unionized in February as a part of AFT-Vermont.The union now represents all seven locations within the University of Vermont Health Network, which includes three hospitals in Vermont and three hospitals in New York as well as the home health and hospice organization. In 2023, over 2,000 support and technical staff at the UVM Medical Center joined the Vermont Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, nearly doubling the size of Vermont’s largest health care union, which falls under the penumbra of AFT-Vermont. Later that year, over 300 nurses and technical staff at Central Vermont Medical Center voted to join AFT-Vermont as well.In March 2024, a similar number of support and technical staff at Porter Medical Center, the third Vermont hospital in the health network, also joined the union.Read the story on VTDigger here:  UVM Health Network hospice employees vote to unionize.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/uvmmc-nurses-strike-4-20240702-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-06 18:07:18.238668

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Antonio Chairez Rios stepped out from behind a gate enclosing the local Immigration and Customs Enforcement office south of Albuquerque on Friday, prompting cheers from several dozen activists who had been waiting three hours to learn whether he would be detained and eventually deported.  
His release late Friday morning meant the grandfather of two — if only for a few more days  — would not be sent away from the country he’s lived in for at least 20 years. 
For the last nine years, Chairez Rios, an immigrant from Mexico, has dutifully attended every annual check-in appointment with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, each time securing a stay of deportation, according to his attorney Rebecca Kitson.
His next check-in had been scheduled for September, but authorities abruptly re-scheduled it a few days ago for 9 a.m. on Friday, Kitson said. That was not a good sign, she said. 
She assumed the check-in really served as a way for ICE agents to rack up another deportation without having to go through the trouble of arresting someone at their home or in public. 
News reports elsewhere and reports from her colleagues suggest ICE is increasingly arresting people at annual check-ins, with agents no longer allowed or willing to use discretion or consider the details of individual cases when deciding whether to arrest and deport someone, she said.

“From the indications that we received, we were pretty clear that their intent is to arrest everyone now,” she said. “It’s really just easier to arrest people who show up.”
Chairez Rios was deported in 2006 but then re-entered the country after he received photos showing that his two young daughters were living on the streets of Albuquerque with their mother, who was addicted to drugs, Kitson said.
“In his mind there was no other choice” but to return, Kitson said. “Eventually, he got here and was granted full custody of his children because there was no one else, because they were in severe danger.”
Since returning to take care of his kids, a judge issued a stay of deportation repeatedly, allowing him to raise his daughters and work. He took a tough construction job and suffered a traumatic brain injury after falling 20 feet onto concrete, Kitson said. He was briefly in a coma from the injury, she said.
ICE ‘disappeared’ 48 New Mexico residents, attorneys say

The exploitation he suffered as an undocumented immigrant in the construction industry prompted Kitson to seek what’s known as a “T visa” on his behalf, which are temporary visas for victims of human trafficking.
The fact that the visa application remains pending marks one reason she hoped Chairez Rios and the attorney who accompanied him to the check-in could argue he be allowed to stay in the United States a little bit longer, she said. 
Soon after Kitson learned that Chairez Rios’s check-in had been re-scheduled, she sounded the alarm to various immigration advocacy groups. Despite the short notice, nearly 100 people showed up at the ICE office, chanting and picketing for several hours. 
Chairez Rios arrived with his daughters and two grand-kids about half an hour before the check-in, smiling and wiping tears from his eyes as he saw the crowd gathered with signs that said “Keep Antonio here!” 
He walked into the HSI office holding a grandson in his arms, taking a final look back at the crowd before what could be his last time in the U.S. According to Kitson, deportation would mean he’d have to stay in Mexico for at least 10 years before he had any legal way of returning.

According to Kitson, the events that unfolded over the next two and a half hours in a nondescript government office provided an increasingly rare reprieve from President Donald Trump’s new mass deportation push.
Chairez Rios’s legal team fought against an apparent detention order, Kitson said, which she described as an informal appeal that made its way up through several supervisors stationed outside of Albuquerque, Kitson said. 
ICE supervisors were still considering the appeal by 11:30 a.m. or so. That’s about the time they gave Chairez Rios the choice of leaving the office with an ankle monitor on or staying and waiting for a decision. 
Kitson’s best guess is that Chairez Rios will still be arrested and deported, she said. And she said he’ll be paranoid in the coming weeks about when agents could come to arrest him. But that didn’t happen Friday, she said, which is a win by itself.

Chairez Rios spoke briefly to reporters and activists, gesturing to the device on his ankle and offering gratitude to the people who waited and chanted and prayed for him. 
“They don’t have a decision yet, but I do feel powerless because it seems unfair to me that one who is not a criminal is waiting after 20 years working here,” he said in Spanish. “I would like to have a chance, because all my family is from here, my daughters, my grandchildren.”
He said agents scheduled another check-in for September, but they told him that he could be arrested at any time between now and then.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-06 21:18:16+00:00,Mississippi Today,Jackson State alums demand open dialogue with Mississippi college board,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/06/jackson-state-alums-demand-open-dialogue-with-mississippi-college-board/,A group of Jackson State alumni has launched a letter-writing campaign seeking accountability and transparency in the president search process.,"Jackson State University alums are blowing up Mississippi lawmakers and the state’s college board inboxes with one clear message: Give us a fair and transparent president search. 
Thee 1877 Project launched an email campaign “For a Better JSU” this week asking faculty, students and supporters of the historically Black university to send e-letters to hold the Institutions of Higher Learning board responsible for the school’s last three picks for president and what it calls its failure to create an open and inclusive search for school leadership. The group is not affiliated with the JSU National Alumni Association. 
The effort comes after the announcement of former president Marcus Thompson’s resignation with no explanation. The news was a disappointment to many state lawmakers and alumni last month who felt whiplash from his departure, a familiar situation experienced with his predecessor, Thomas Hudson, who also resigned without explanation. Thompson’s resignation marked the university’s third leadership turnover in less than a decade. Thompson’s predecessor, William Bynum, also resigned following his arrest on a prostitution solicitation charge.
“For too long the leadership selection process at JSU has failed the institution and its stakeholders. It has bred instability, eroded public trust, damaged our university’s reputation and squandered taxpayer dollars,” the campaign’s website states. “These are not minor missteps— they are systemic failures. The process has lacked transparency, inclusivity and consistency that any respected academic institution should demand.” 
In a personalized email sent to IHL Commissioner Al Rankins and board members, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves and several state House and Senate lawmakers including Chris Bell, Greg Holloway, Sollie Norwood, Grace Butler Washington, Rob Roberson and Dennis DeBar, the group urges the following:  

A public acknowledgement and statement from board members addressing its failures of previous president search processes and lessons they have learned before the next national search 
A national search of the university leadership of the “highest caliber” 
A transparent president search and process that includes input from students, faculty, alumni and community members 

The group said its goal is to get 1,000 individuals to participate in the campaign before IHL’s next board meeting, June 19. As of June 6, 500 emails have been sent according to Mark Dawson, a spokesperson for the group. He said the group plans to expand its campaign in the coming weeks to include additional emails to officials such as State Auditor Shad White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann. 
“We need to let them know this process they have in place is not good,” Dawson said. 
The campaign is also filling a void for alumni who are frustrated by JSUNAA’s silence and inaction. Many have begun to question the association’s role and its leadership when it comes to advocating for the university’s future. 
Last month, JSUNAA President Patrease Edwards, shared a statement asking alumni to refrain from public comment and speak positively about the university after Thompson’s departure. 
When rumors circulated that IHL had selected a new president and Edwards was asked to send a letter to alumni on the selection and reasons the board did not open up a candidate search this week, Edwards responded to those claims on social media. Her response was the first time alumni had heard from since her statement. She subsequently deleted her comment.
“Processes and procedures [for them to advocate or hold account] can be challenging for JSUNAA right now. It is not for us,” Dawson said. “We don’t want to brush things under the rug, you can’t fix anything that way. Now is the time to raise our voice, organize and partner with IHL to have an open dialogue so we can get this right.” 
Edwards told Mississippi Today the role of JSUNAA is to support the university and its students. She said she does not speak on personnel issues because that is beyond the association’s purview. 
When asked if the association had considered expanding its mission to acknowledge the questions alumni have posed of her leadership and inaction, Edwards said the association does advocate but alumni should join the national group as a way to support the university. By joining the association, it shows a true representation of the school’s alumni base “and speaks more volume than anything.” 
“We can be vocal on social media all we want but if we are not showing our financial support of our university through active membership in the National Alumni Association through ongoing consistent gifts to the university and to students and student programs, we will never be able to have a voice,” Edwards said. 
Despite what he described as the “aggressive silence and inaction” from the national association, Dawson said the group doesn’t see itself as overstepping. Rather it’s providing a true account to the history of the university and a platform for alumni and supporters’ demands. 
“[Jackson State] was founded twelve years after bondage. We have weathered through a long and troubled history of people trying to knock us down and we have survived despite the odds ,” he said. “Being quiet is not in our DNA. We’re rising  up yet again.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/06171242/JSU18-mobile.jpg,,,2025-06-06 18:07:18.238668

Legislation to reform Pennsylvania’s quarter-century-old cyber charter school law and return to taxpayers hundreds of millions in excessive tuition payments passed in the state House on Wednesday with bipartisan support.
The bill now heads to the state Senate where a favorable vote would ratify one of Gov. Josh Shapiro’s budget priorities by capping cyber charter tuition at $8,000 per student next year. It would also establish a statewide formula for special education tuition.
That would save school districts an estimated $616 million a year according to a House analysis of the bill’s fiscal impact. 
The upper chamber, however, is moving forward with bipartisan legislation that would allow parents in poorly performing school districts to spend tax dollars on private school tuition. That’s the solution Republicans prefer — and that Shapiro, a Democrat, has previously endorsed — to give students an alternative to traditional public schools.
As lawmakers in Harrisburg buckled down this week for the month-long push to negotiate the state budget by the June 30 deadline, education funding, as always, will be a subject of prolific debate.
The General Assembly must decide how much to spend on the second installment of a $4.5 billion multi-year commitment to fair education funding. That’s in response to a state court ruling that said students in less wealthy communities have suffered a disadvantage for decades because of the state’s reliance on property taxes to pay for education.
Layered on that is the debate over whether and how much taxpayers should spend to provide educational alternatives for students in poorly performing schools or for whom the traditional public school setting is not working.
“It is not a conversation any longer about Ds versus Rs or conservatives, moderates or progressives. It’s not a conversation any longer about who has and who hasn’t,” state Sen. Anthony Williams (D-Philadelphia) said last month. “This is simply the divide in America that says we’re all in the same boat, and if we don’t educate our children … we are in big trouble.” 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shapiro’s proposed $51.5 billion spending plan calls for $1.5 billion more for education including $526 million in fair funding. But in his budget address, Shapiro said controlling how much cyber charter schools are paid by students’ home school districts would maximize the impact of education funding increases.
Sponsored by Rep. MaryLouise Isaacson (D-Philadelphia), House Bill 1500 would amend the charter school law that was first passed in 1997 and amended in 2002 to allow cyber charter schools. It passed with a 104-98 vote, including the support of Republican Reps. Thomas Mehaffie of Dauphin County and Kathleen Tomlinson of Bucks County.
In response to the House vote on cyber charter reform Wednesday, the CEOs of five public cyber charter schools said the reduction in funding would be debilitating.
“Every member of the PA House Democratic Caucus voted today in support of the largest proposed cut to public education in nearly 15 years — a cut that would further disenfranchise some of our Commonwealth’s most vulnerable children,” the leaders of Esperanza Cyber Charter School, Reach Cyber Charter School, PA Virtual Charter School, PA Cyber Charter School, PA Distance Learning Charter School said.
Marcus Hite, executive director of the Pennsylvania Association of Public Cyber Charter Schools, described the tuition cap as “arbitrary and unrealistic.” He added that it does not take into account the real costs of educating students, particularly those with disabilities and unique learning needs.
“This bill is not about fairness or accountability—it’s about eliminating school choice for thousands of families,” Hite said. “H.B. 1500 is rooted in the dangerous belief that if we just throw more money at failing school districts and take options away from families, everything will magically improve. That’s not how education works, and it’s not what families want.”
Shapiro made news in 2022 as a candidate for governor by saying he supported private school tuition vouchers. Such programs have been a goal of conservative lawmakers across the country and one is outlined in President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” that the U.S. House passed last month. It includes $5 billion for a national school voucher program. 
Shapiro  proposed a $100 million scholarship fund 2023 that passed the Republican-controlled Senate, but it was shot down by House Democrats. He endorsed the proposal again in his 2024 budget proposal, and although rapper Jay-Z joined in support of the program, it wasn’t in the final budget. Shapiro hasn’t said one way or the other if he still backs the idea, but it wasn’t part of this year’s proposal. 
Pennsylvania already has two programs that allow individuals and businesses to contribute to private school scholarship programs in lieu of state personal income and corporate net income, and other taxes. The programs provided $340 million such tax credits in 2022-2023, according to watchdog group Education Voters PA. The group has criticized the program, claiming it funds schools that are free to discriminate on the basis of religion, disability and LGBTQ status in their admissions policies.   
Senate Bill 10 nonetheless resurrects the Pennsylvania Award for Student Success (PASS) scholarship proposal from 2023. It would allow parents of students in the bottom 5% lowest performing school districts to apply for scholarships ranging from $2,500 for half-day kindergarten to $10,000 for high school students each year. The bill passed the Senate Education Committee 8-3 last month to be considered by the full Senate.
Isaacson said her bill, which also passed the House last session, is the result of “repeated and urgent calls” to update the law that remained unchanged as the number of cyber charter schools grew and enrollment swelled to 65,000.
“This proposal is about fiscal responsibilities and aligning tuition to the actual cost of providing cyber education,” she said. 
Republicans who opposed it said it denied a voice for families that choose cyber charters.
“It will close real schools, displace real students, strip families of the very choices that they depend on to give their children a chance at success,” Rep. Martina White (R-Philadelphia) said.
School districts must pay tuition for each student who chooses to attend a cyber charter school instead of their local public school. For regular education students, it’s based on the district’s per-pupil spending minus costs that don’t exist for cyber students, such as transportation and facilities.
For special education students, the tuition is calculated based on the district’s overall special education spending divided by 16%, the presumed proportion of students requiring special ed service. Critics say that formula is flawed because it underestimates the number of special education students and skews tuition toward the cost of services for students with the most intensive needs. And students with individualized education plans are 27% more likely to attend cyber charter schools, according to the Pennsylvania School Boards Association.
Education watchdog groups say that results in a windfall for cyber charter organizations because the tuition they get has little relation to the actual cost of providing an online education. It also opens the door to waste and abuse, according to Education Voters PA, which catalogued spending by the state’s largest cyber charter, Commonwealth Charter Academy (CCA), that included a posh social club membership and the purchase of a luxury SUV.
Republican Auditor General Timothy DeFoor released a report in February during House and Senate budget hearings that examined the finances of five cyber charters and found they had amassed excessive budget surpluses. The five charters’ fund balances grew 144% from 2020 to 2023, when they held a combined $619 million in unencumbered funds.
DeFoor’s report also highlighted “uncommon” spending practices such as purchasing gift cards, paying bonuses to teachers and the acquisition of 21 physical properties by the state’s largest cyber school.
House Education Committee Chairperson Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh) listed claims from those reports as reasons to reign in payments to cyber charter schools. Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) called it a “damning indictment” of the institutions.
“We would all get in trouble if we were taking gift cards as part of our compensation … that’s a pro tip for anybody who’s in the room, don’t do that,” House Education Committee Chairperson Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh) said.
In addition to capping tuition, HB 1500 would establish the Cyber Charter School Funding and Policy Council to recommend changes in how cyber charter schools are funded and how they operate.
Isaacson’s bill would also require cyber charters to return money to the state, if its general fund surplus is more than half of what it spent in the previous year or its capital fund surplus is more than 20% of what it spent in the previous year. That money would be available through the Commonwealth Financing Authority for public school building improvements, with 25% earmarked for the Solar for Schools program that lawmakers and Shapiro created last year.
“We’ve all heard stories about asbestos, mold. We had a school district that had a high school that was completely flooded out. It would be great to be able to reinvest those dollars in the children and the teachers that we see each and every day in our actual physical public school buildings,” Schweyer said.
Cyber charter schools have also drawn scrutiny for poor student proficiency rates. Schweyer noted only 4.7% of CCA students scored proficient in math on state assessments.
“If any of your public schools had a 95% failure rate for math proficiency, would you be satisfied?” he asked. “Better question, would we be getting what we’re paying for?”
HB 1500 would limit increases in enrollment for cyber charters that face “significant challenges related to academic achievement, student growth, graduation rate and other areas.” And it would place a moratorium on new cyber charter applications through 2030.
Republican Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) argued passing the bill would amount to eliminating lifelines for students who are unable to thrive in traditional public schools. 
“Outcomes and statistics can be tricky,” Topper, who shared that his parents chose to homeschool him when the noise and disorder of public school proved to be too much. 
“Many of the students who are falling through the cracks and who are attending these cyber charter schools are doing so because they are struggling,” he said, adding that success for some might be simply earning a high school diploma. The COVID-19 pandemic showed the value of cyber schools to the point that most school districts have added their own cyber programs, Topper noted.
“We need to continue to talk about how we can do better in all aspects of public education, including funding, including formulas,” Topper said. “But the toxic nature of this conversation must end, and we must look at ways to move forward together as an entire system.”

Rogers U.S. Courthouse in downtown Denver is pictured on Jan. 21, 2021. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The man accused of injuring more than a dozen people in a firebombing attack on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall appeared on Friday in Denver for the first time in federal court, where he faces a hate crime charge.
Mohamed Sabry Soliman, a 45-year-old Egyptian citizen, has been charged in connection with the attack on participants in the Boulder chapter of Run For Their Lives, a group that aims to raise awareness of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. An arrest warrant alleges that he told investigators after the attack that he had targeted the group because he wanted to “kill all Zionist people.”
The federal hearing came one day after the defendant was formally charged on 118 criminal counts in state court in Boulder County, including dozens of charges of attempted murder and the use of incendiary devices. If convicted on those state-level charges, he faces a combined sentence of hundreds of years in prison.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Denver separately charged the suspect with one count of “a hate crime offense involving the actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin,” as part of what acting U.S. Attorney J. Bishop Grewell called a “message to the community that no acts of anti-Semitism are going to be tolerated.” Grewell suggested earlier this week that additional federal charges may be forthcoming.
The suspect was escorted into the courtroom Friday afternoon by U.S. marshals for an administrative hearing that lasted less than 10 minutes. Speaking through an Arabic-language interpreter, he gave short affirmative answers to a series of questions from Magistrate Judge Timothy P. O’Hara regarding his rights as a criminal defendant. He will be represented by an attorney from the Office of the Federal Public Defender.
O’Hara set a preliminary hearing in the federal case for June 18.
Federal authorities say the suspect, a Colorado Springs resident, was living in the U.S. unlawfully after overstaying a visa that expired in 2023. A federal judge in Denver has temporarily blocked the deportation of his wife, Hayam El Gamal, and their five children, after the Department of Homeland Security announced that it had taken them into custody and was “processing (them) for removal proceedings from the U.S.”

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas by a group of voters and the Christian Ministerial Alliance. It claimed boundaries for Arkansas’ 2nd Congressional District were racially gerrymandered and diluted the votes of Black Arkansans. 
Congressional and state legislative districts are redrawn after the U.S. Census each decade in a process known as redistricting. The goal is to create districts that contain roughly the same population. 
The Ministerial Alliance’s lawsuit was one of four filed to challenge Arkansas’ 2021 redistricting process and the only one that hadn’t been dismissed. 
On Friday, U.S. Circuit Judge David Stras, U.S. District Judge D.P. Marshall Jr. and U.S. District Judge James Moody Jr. granted the state’s motion for summary judgment, saying there was not enough evidence to support the plaintiffs’ racial discrimination claims.
“Multiple Arkansas citizens challenge how the General Assembly redrew the state’s congressional district lines,” Friday’s order states. “Although their allegations were plausible enough to survive a motion to dismiss [Docs. 35, 42], the evidence does not back up their claims of racial discrimination. For that reason, we grant summary judgment to Secretary of State John Thurston.”
Thurston, who was secretary of state when the lawsuit was filed in 2023, was elected state treasurer in 2024 during a special election. The governor appointed Cole Jester to succeed Thurston. 
Previously, the entirety of Pulaski County was included in Arkansas’ Second Congressional District, which is represented by Republican U.S. Rep. French Hill. During the 2021 redistricting process, Pulaski County was split between three congressional districts.
Plaintiffs alleged the General Assembly considered racial data when redrawing district lines and unconstitutionally “cracked” the Black voting bloc in southeast Pulaski County. 


Let us know what you think...


 

The state’s attorneys submitted a motion for summary judgment in favor of the state last October. 
According to Friday’s order, the original complaint alleged two constitutional claims —  one for racial gerrymandering under the Fourteenth Amendment and one for vote dilution under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. 
The federal panel said race needed to be “the predominant factor” motivating the General Assembly’s decision and that awareness or acceptance of a “racially disparate impact is not enough.”
Three-judge panel hears arguments but doesn’t rule in Arkansas redistricting lawsuit

Creating “an alternative map” is one way to prove redrawn boundaries were racially motivated, the panel said. However, that only works if the alternative map still accomplishes the Legislature’s partisan goals.
“If it does not, then it just highlights how the pursuit of a nonracial aim — like retention, partisanship, or geography — could have led to an unintended racial disparity,” the panel wrote. “All three of the plaintiffs’ alternatives fall short in exactly this way.” 
Citing a U.S. Supreme Court reversal of a decision by a three-judge panel that found South Carolina had discriminated against Black voters in a 2023 redistricting lawsuit, Stras and his counterparts noted the high court emphasized that the courts must “start with the presumption that the legislature acted in good faith.”
“Absent direct evidence of racial discrimination and with only weak circumstantial evidence supporting the plaintiffs’ case, the presumption of legislative good faith tips the balance,” Stras wrote. 
That coupled with the fact that no alternative map achieves the General Assembly’s goals with “significantly greater racial balance,” meant the judges could not reasonably find that the plaintiffs had proved enough for their claim of racial gerrymandering to survive summary judgment, according to the ruling.
The primary obstacle of the presumption of good faith holds true for the plaintiffs’ vote-dilution claim, according to Friday’s order. While the vote-dilution claim requires race to be a “motivating factor” instead of the predominant one, the panel argued “the plaintiffs do not have enough evidence to get there.”
“Most of what the plaintiffs offer are the materials we have already discussed: maps, statistics, and legislative history, none of which are enough to infer a racial motivation,” the panel wrote. 
The federal judges acknowledged as evidence a report from a university doctoral candidate that describes Arkansas’ “long history” with racism and resistance to Black voters, but wrote that much of that predates the passage of the 1964 Voting Rights Act. 
“Even if he identifies a few scattered examples since then, none are ‘reasonably contemporaneous with the challenged decision,’ giving us little insight into what the General Assembly may have been thinking four years ago,” the panel wrote.

More than 200 wildfires burning across Canada have churned acrid air across the U.S. this week.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerSmoke from Canadian wildfires continued to obscure Vermont skies on Friday as the Department of Environmental Conservation issued another air quality alert for the northwest portion of the state. The alert, which includes the counties of Chittenden, Franklin and Grand Isle, is set to end at midnight. An expanded alert will be issued by the agency Saturday, according to the National Weather Service office in Burlington. The air quality alert will last from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. and cover the counties of Caledonia, Chitteden, Essex, Franklin, Grand Isle, Lamoille, Orleans and Washington. “It’s a moderate level of pollutants, so it’s not going to affect everybody, but it’s mainly for sensitive groups like people with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children,” said Peter Banacos, science and operations officer at the National Weather Service’s office in Burlington. While rain is helping to drown out the particulates, smoke that’s hovering over the St. Lawrence Valley could move into northern Vermont over the weekend, according to Banacos.Those tiny particles within the smoke, known as fine particulate matter or PM 2.5, can get trapped in people’s lungs before entering their bloodstream, causing possible health problems. The wildfire smoke brings elevated concentrations of those particles that can be unhealthy for sensitive groups like older adults and children, pregnant people, outdoor workers and people living outside.People with asthma should keep their relief medicine nearby, and if residents experience scratchy eyes or throat, a headache or coughing, they’re encouraged to move indoors, according to a media release from the Department of Environmental Conservation on Friday.READ MORE
On Friday afternoon, the air quality for much of the state was good, and residents could enjoy outdoor activities. But in Burlington and St. Albans, the Environmental Protection Agency’s fire and smoke map indicated that the levels of PM 2.5 were above 100 on the air quality index, meaning the air was unhealthy for those sensitive groups.The smoke has migrated from more than 200 wildfires churning through Canada, with six new fires starting Friday. Canada faces an especially severe and early start to its fire season, as more severe wildfires become more common under climate change, which is primarily driven by the burning of fossil fuels. While 69 fires are burning in British Columbia, more than 100 have consumed the country’s less fire-prone prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.“With these wildfires so far removed from Vermont, we’re not expecting real significant issues,” Banacos said. He recalled worse conditions in 2022, when wildfires raging in Quebec brought thick, low-level smoke to Vermont that reduced visibility and increased air quality issues. “If we get fires that are closer, that could change,” Banacos said.The worst effects are across the Great Lakes, where smoke has settled over major cities like Detroit and Toronto, but unhealthy air has traveled as far south as Florida this week.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Wildfire smoke brings air quality alert to northwest Vermont.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/hazy-skies-1-20250606-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-06 17:10:17.519373

Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) broke down a new package of ""polluter pay"" bills at an Oct. 25, 2023 press conference. | Kyle DavidsonDemocratic lawmakers in both the Michigan House and Senate announced Friday they would be taking another stab at legislation to hold polluters accountable for cleaning up contamination. 
For years, Michigan Democrats have introduced “polluter pay” legislation seeking to alter the current regulations on polluter responsibilities, which lawmakers and environmentalists argue have left taxpayers holding the bag.
Michigan is home to tens of thousands of contaminated sites, many of which are “orphan sites” where the responsible party is either no longer in business, or cannot be identified.
Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor), a longtime advocate for polluter pay policies, said in a statement that the bills would put liability where it belongs: with the polluters.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“It’s shocking that Michigan law doesn’t require polluters to actually clean up their mess or even report all spills,” Irwin said, noting the reintroduced package of bills aims to ensure more thorough cleanups and comprehensive spill reporting.
During the previous legislative session, Irwin, alongside Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor), led the introduction of renewed polluter pay bills intended to give state regulators more tools to enforce environmental cleanups.
After the introduction of the renewed package in October 2023, the bills were subject to workgrouping with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and various industry stakeholders. 
Although several of the bills in the previous package passed through the Democratic-led Michigan Senate, the efforts never came to a vote in the House, as partisan bickering and party infighting left the House’s previous Democratic leadership unable to hold session at the end of their term. 
With Republicans now in control of the chamber, the reintroduced polluter pay policies will likely face an uphill battle in the House, though Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) told the Michigan Advance that it would be great to see the policies move forward in some form.
According to a statement from Irwin’s office, several of the renewed polluter pay bills have already been introduced in the Michigan House, with the rest set to be introduced next week. Additionally, Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), who chairs the Senate Energy and Environment Committee, said he intends to hold a hearing on the bills next week. 
Proposals in the 2025 polluter pay bills include:

Stricter pollution reporting and cleanups requirements; 


Creating an avenue for EGLE to update cleanup criteria as researchers learn more about contaminants while prioritizing the removal of contamination over implementing use restrictions;
Allowing individuals exposed to hazardous substances to sue polluters for the cost of medical monitoring;
Allowing the state to hold polluters accountable for cleanup costs and damages to the environment from contaminants not regulated before 1994, such as PFAS;

Democrats were unable to advance the policies while they held control of both Legislative chambers, but Nick Occhipinti, state government affairs director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, said the policies are still viable, even in a split-power Legislature.
“You do any polling on asking Michiganders if polluters should pay to have both legacy and existing sites cleaned up to protect public health, to redevelop those sites and return them to the community, return them to prosperity, they are overwhelmingly in support,” Occhipinti said.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s attorney general said Thursday he “demands” the removal of Afghan refugees who were resettled in the state in 2021 with Gov. Kevin Stitt’s support. 
Gentner Drummond, who is also a Republican candidate for governor, said the thousands of Afghan refugees were not properly vetted in 2021 and pose a threat to public safety. His statement followed a travel ban from President Donald Trump on 12 countries, including Afghanistan. 
Stitt and the organizations who helped resettle around 1,800 refugees from Afghanistan in Oklahoma pushed back. They said Drummond’s statement was inaccurate and creates unnecessary fear about the Afghan population in the state.

The Republican governor said in a statement Friday that the Biden administration had failed to secure a safe exit from Afghanistan, costing American lives and left Afghani citizens in danger. 
“They aided our troops in some of the most dangerous combat situations,” Stitt said. “It is unconscionable that anyone would suggest that we should have left them at the mercy of the Taliban. Individuals using their official platform to campaign for a higher office are using prejudice and fear tactics to sow discord. If the attorney general can identify laws being broken, he should use his existing authority to prosecute criminal activity. Oklahomans see through the political rhetoric.”
Drummond rebuffed Stitt’s statement. He said Friday his top focus as attorney general is to ensure “law and order,” adding that it was a public safety issue. 
“We greatly value the Afghan friends and allies who assisted US forces, but federal investigations have clearly borne out that vetting was woefully insufficient,” Drummond said. 
Drummond on Thursday referenced two acts of violence involving Afghan refugees, including one threat to Election Day in Oklahoma City.  
Tax dollars are being used to pay for resettlement efforts and “foreign nationals” who are not properly vetted pose a threat, he said in his statement. 
“Adding insult to injury, Gov. Stitt illegally directed millions of our tax dollars to pay for resettlement expenses,” Drummond said Thursday. “Now that President Trump has acted in the best interests of the United States by fully restricting Afghan nationals, I am demanding that Gov. Stitt reject the approval he gave to the Biden Administration so all Afghan refugees can be removed from Oklahoma.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But leaders of community organizations who helped with resettlement efforts said Drummond’s statement is inaccurate and sows unnecessary fear about a vulnerable population. 
Patrick Raglow, executive director at Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City, said it’s “ludicrous” to say this population is a threat for having not been vetted. 
“His beef is not with the Afghan arrivals so much as it is with the governor, and this just happens to be the shape of the rock he’s throwing at the governor,” he said. “That’s my personal opinion, but the statement itself is most unfortunate and factually flawed. It creates a little bit of hostility and animus in our community for those who are here, who fled violence and were not brought here to import violence.”
Raglow said in 2021, Catholic Charities was approached by Stitt to aid in the resettlement efforts after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban. Catholic Charities has been involved in refugee resettlement for decades. 
He hopes that people draw a distinction between refugees and asylum seekers and immigrants. 
“Every refugee is an immigrant. 99% of immigrants are not refugees,” Raglow said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLEVeronica Laizure, executive director of CAIR Oklahoma, said refugees undergo some of the more strict security screenings. She said she’s disappointed in Drummond’s words. CAIR Oklahoma is a nonprofit advocacy group working to “enhance the understanding of Islam, protect civil rights, promote justice, and empower American Muslims.” 
“We are pretty dismayed and disappointed that (Attorney General) Drummond feels it’s appropriate to hold an entire population accountable for the actions of a very, very small minority, and that he’s willing to generalize and paint all of our Afghan neighbors with the same brush,” she said. “We live in Oklahoma, which is a state that’s very familiar, painfully familiar, with the impact of domestic terrorism, and yet we don’t assume that everyone who looks like Timothy McVeigh holds his same views or would commit the same actions that he did.” 
Afghan refugees who came to the U.S. were individuals, or family members, who worked with the U.S. military at high risk to themselves, resulting in violence and death, Laizure said. 
Islamophobia is at a high level right now, Laizure said, which puts this community on edge. She said she encourages people to reach out to people and organizations who have real experience before “operating based on stereotypes and prejudice.”",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P2282114-scaled-1-1024x916.jpg,,,2025-06-06 17:10:17.519373

Ned Lamont pitched an idea to Congress during his annual State of the State address in January: “Rethink the Jones Act.”
The remark — which referenced a century-old maritime law that limits trade between U.S. ports to American-made ships — drew little attention from the local press or public at the time. The comment got scattered applause during the address, appearing to even surprise the governor.
But for one of member of Connecticut’s congressional delegation, the idea opened up a rare point of disagreement between political allies with a long record of working together to support Connecticut’s shipbuilding industry and maritime trades.
Last month, U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, penned an op-ed that dismissed calls to repeal the Jones Act as “a page out of Project 2025,” the conservative agenda laid out by allies of President Donald J. Trump. Courtney was responding directly to another op-ed by a scholar from libertarian think tank CATO Institute, and the piece made no mention of Lamont’s differing views on the subject.
Courtney said conversations about the maritime law have happened more at the staff level with the governor’s office.
“I think at this point, we agree to disagree. But I feel very confident that the basic goal of trying to increase the building capacity is something that … the two of us agree on that,” Courtney said in a recent interview, referring to his shared commitment with Lamont to the shipbuilding sector in maritime states.
For his part, Lamont has stood by his call to revisit the Jones Act. During a recent event in eastern Connecticut, he pointed to the law’s impact on the nascent offshore wind industry at the State Pier in New London.
“We have to bring up all the wind turbines on international vessels,” Lamont said. “Then we have to offload them, put them onto another vessel. They go offshore, and it’s relatively expensive. You know, be very selective, but we ought to make it a little easier for us to build the energy we need in the future.”
Courtney, who serves as ranking member of the House Armed Services’ Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, said debate over the Jones Act has been a “recurring, perennial issue” since he came to Congress almost two decades ago.
CATO Institute and the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 have called for repealing or reforming the Jones Act. Meanwhile, sea services like the U.S. Coast Guard have been strong proponents of the law as well as the Shipbuilders Council of America, which represents dozens of companies that operate 80 shipyards around the country.
More formally known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, the law was written to address post-World War I era concerns about U.S. shipbuilding and the unavailability of a maritime fleet to transport troops to Europe. It requires ships going between American ports to be built, owned and operated by the U.S. and fly American flags. (The popular name of the law comes from its original sponsor, U.S. Rep. Wesley L. Jones of Washington).
More than a decade after its original passage, the Jones Act was updated to include subsidies for the construction of vessels manufactured in American shipyards. But those subsidies were eliminated by the Reagan administration in 1981. Courtney noted countries like South Korea continue to provide subsidies to their shipbuilders.
The Jones Act “really wanted to make sure that we were going to have a healthy merchant marine workforce and fleet,” Courtney said.
“The worst thing we can do in my opinion is to whittle away at the Jones Act,” he continued, adding it’d be “a race to the bottom and would decimate any semblance of a merchant marine fleet in the U.S. and a merchant marine workforce that’s out there.”
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, there were 92 Jones Act-compliant, oceangoing vessels available for port-to-port shipping last year.
Some U.S. territories are exempt from the law, including American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands. Waivers can also be temporarily issued in certain cases such as matters of national defense or in response to natural disasters.
But the Jones Act applies to other noncontiguous areas of the U.S. like Puerto Rico, which has been a point of contention for some critics in Connecticut who argue it increases shipping costs for the island territory. During this year’s General Assembly session, a resolution passed out of the Commerce Committee calling on Congress to amend the Jones Act and provide exemptions for Puerto Rico by allowing foreign-flagged ships to transport certain goods, including liquid natural gas. But the effort died in the House when the session ended earlier this week.
Lamont’s interest in the Jones Act appears to be mostly focused on its impact on the cost of energy. In his State of the State address, the governor spoke about how Connecticut, like the rest of New England, gets the majority of its electricity from power plants fueled by natural gas pipelines.
In the winter, those pipelines become constrained due to the demand for gas to heat people’s homes, leading to temporary price spikes.
While liquid natural gas can also be imported through terminals in Massachusetts, Lamont noted those imports come from overseas on foreign-flagged ships, due to the lack of Jones Act-compliant tankers available to carry it from ports on the Gulf Coast.
“We bring in very inexpensive natural gas from Pennsylvania, but that pipeline is at capacity, and we bring in LNG by foreign ships, which is more polluting and more expensive,” Lamont said. 
Whether repealing the law would actually spark a resurgence in shipping between U.S. ports is subject to some debate, however.
Ryan Kellogg, an economist at the University of Chicago, said that repealing the Jones Act would have only a “modest” impact on energy prices New England, due to the further distance ships must travel from Gulf Coast ports and lower prices when compared to overseas markets. In a 2023 paper studying how a potential repeal would affect the price of gasoline and diesel, Kellogg and a co-author found that the biggest benefits would come to ports farther south along the East Coast.
“If anything, the problems may be a little bit worse when it comes to LNG, just in the sense of, really what you’re competing with now are these really big price differentials to Europe and Asia,” Kellogg said. “An LNG carrier is simply not going to go to New England unless they get a price that’s comparable to what they could get by sailing to Europe.”
The American Maritime Partnership — a coalition that represents vessel operators, shipbuilders, repair yards and others in the domestic maritime industry and supports the maritime policy — argued that changes to the Jones Act wouldn’t remedy issues like high energy prices in the region.
“Claims that the Jones Act drives high energy costs in New England reflect a misunderstanding of both the law and regional energy markets,” Jennifer Carpenter, president of the American Maritime Partnership, said in a statement. “Connecticut’s energy costs stem from its over-reliance on volatile spot markets, inadequate pipeline infrastructure, and limited storage capacity, not national security laws like the Jones Act.”
In April, Trump issued an executive order promising to reassert “America’s maritime dominance” through commercial shipbuilding. The order directed officials to come up with a plan for new investments in shipbuilding, along with a study of existing cargo preference laws.
And federal lawmakers in both parties are looking to incentivize U.S. shipbuilding as part of legislation called the SHIPS for America Act. 
Courtney pointed to the planned development of Jones Act-compliant ships in Philadelphia and the construction of the Charybdis, the first American-made offshore wind installation vessel, as an example of the kind of work supported by the Jones Act. (The Charybdis was originally intended to work on wind projects being launched from New London but is now scheduled to work off the coast of Virginia).
Courtney added that the support of other prominent Republicans, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., is a sign of the Jones Act’s enduring popularity in Congress. 
“I just think politically waiving or weakening the Jones Act is going to run into a firestorm of bipartisan opposition,” Courtney said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2024_1003_SR_LongIslandSound_304-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 17:10:17.519373

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas legislative committee filed a report Friday detailing a requested audit into the Board of Corrections’ 2023 hiring of a Little Rock attorney, a move that raised concerns from lawmakers about the board’s procurement practices.
The nonpartisan Arkansas Legislative Audit began the probe a year ago at the request of the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee, which heard the report Friday and continued to express frustrations about attorney Abtin Mehdizadegan’s contract with the prison board.
Mehdizadegan has been representing the Board of Corrections in both its legal challenge against two 2023 state laws and Attorney General Tim Griffin’s suit against the board for allegedly violating the Freedom of Information Act in Mehdizadegan’s hiring.
Griffin’s office usually represents state agencies in legal cases, but Arkansas law allows special counsel to be appointed in disputes between the attorney general and constitutional officers. Board member Lee Watson, who was the panel’s secretary at the time it began working with Mehdizadegan, reiterated this to the committee Friday.
Watson said the circumstances surrounding the board’s November 2023 dispute with Griffin, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and then-Corrections Secretary Joe Profiri required special action. The board and the executive branch officials clashed over who has ultimate authority over Arkansas’ prison system, including the expansion of facilities.
Lawmakers criticize Arkansas Board of Corrections members, attorney over altered contract

“Our governor and our secretary were moving forward with moving prisoners into overcrowded facilities,” Watson said. “Based upon our collective experience, we believed that that would endanger the people in that facility and the general public nearby.”
He repeated past statements to lawmakers that Profiri’s and Sanders’ actions justified hiring Mehdizadegan after an executive session at a brief meeting in December 2023.
The Joint Performance Review Committee spent three April 2024 meetings discussing and questioning Mehdizadegan’s hiring and contract, and the panel voted to recommend that the Arkansas Legislative Council not review the contract.
The audit report found that Mehdizadegan was present and spoke at several Board of Corrections meetings, but this was not reflected in the meeting minutes.
The report also took issue with the board signing “engagement agreements” with Mehdizadegan “without establishing how the Board would pay for these services, as the Board has no appropriation or funding.” The engagement agreements also did not include the contract length or cost.
Mehdizadegan’s relationship with the board began when Watson informally contacted him as the board’s legal liaison, Watson previously told lawmakers, but auditors “were unable to verify” his appointment as liaison until after Mehdizadegan’s hiring.
Additionally, Mehdizadegan has submitted invoices totaling $230,138 to the board for his legal work, but those invoices were unpaid as of Feb. 11, the report states.
Auditors recommended in the report that the Board of Corrections make the following changes:

Making all board business public
Amending the board’s bylaws to include liaison appointments in required public business
Including all relevant details in proposed contracts
Consulting with state procurement officials before procuring goods or services
Making sure all information submitted to state procurement officials is “complete and accurate”

 
BOC special audit report 

Mehdizadegan wrote the board’s 30-page response to the audit findings, recommending that auditors revise the report “and find that the Board acted lawfully, reasonably and appropriately in its selection of special counsel.”
Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, said he was “disappointed” in the board’s response.
“All I was looking for in response was, ‘Hey, we were in uncharted territory, we didn’t know what we were doing, and you know what? We should have followed the procurement process,’” he said.
Mehdizadegan and Board of Corrections Chairman Benny Magness were present at Friday’s committee meeting but did not face questions from lawmakers.
The lawsuits
Less than a week after being hired, Mehdizadegan filed the board’s lawsuit against Sanders, Profiri and then-Secretary of State John Thurston, challenging the constitutionality of Act 185 and Act 659 of 2023.
Act 185 requires the secretary of corrections to serve at the pleasure of the governor rather than the board, while Act 659 alters the reporting structure for the directors of the Division of Correction and Division of Community Correction, requiring them to serve at the pleasure of the secretary rather than the board.
The board argued the laws violate Amendment 33 of the Arkansas Constitution, which protects the power of constitutional boards like the board of corrections from the executive or legislative branches of government.
Pulaski County Circuit Judge Patricia James granted a preliminary injunction in January 2024, which Griffin appealed.
Arkansas Supreme Court sends AG’s FOIA lawsuit against prison board back to circuit court

The Arkansas Supreme Court allowed the lawsuit to continue Thursday when it dismissed the state’s motion to send the case back to the circuit court, order the preliminary injunction vacated and dismiss the case as moot.
The high court also dismissed a motion to disqualify Mehdizadegan from further participation in proceedings before the court.
Last month, the state Supreme Court reversed a lower court’s dismissal of Griffin’s suit against the board for allegedly violating the FOIA to hire outside counsel.
Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox gave Griffin 30 days to work with the corrections board on an agreement with an outside attorney to represent it. Fox dismissed the case without prejudice in January 2024, ruling Griffin’s office failed to make an effort to initiate the statutory procedure that allows special counsel to represent state officials and entities.
Griffin moved to vacate the circuit court’s order, arguing his office could not certify special counsel until the board asked for legal representation. The Supreme Court agreed and sent the case back to Fox.

Yellowstone […]","This frame capture of a video from a webcam shows a small eruption emanating from Black Diamond Pool in Biscuit Basin, a subbasin of Upper Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park, on May 31, 2025.  This was the site of a hydrothermal explosion on July 23, 2024. (Provided by the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory)On Saturday night, an eruption from the Black Diamond Pool in Yellowstone National Park shot up about 20 feet, according to the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory.
On May 14, scientists had installed a temporary and mobile camera at the Biscuit Basin site, northwest of Old Faithful, following a massive explosion there on July 23, 2024.
Yellowstone Volcano Observatory scientist-in-charge Michael Poland said this week the detection of the burst at the Black Diamond Pool shows the camera was a good investment, and the plan is to install a permanent monitoring station in the area.
“This felt like a really good use of resources to capture an event that will help us better understand what’s going on at Biscuit Basin,” Poland said.
This summer, scientists will be testing and phasing in the installation of a permanent station there, with a microphone to capture acoustic noise, GPS station, and equipment to monitor seismic changes.
The camera on the site can’t stream video, but it can record it on site, and it can send static images every 15 minutes to the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, a consortium of state and federal agencies that monitor and provide hazard assessment in the Yellowstone Plateau region.
Poland said scientists capture and review those images for changes, and sure enough, the images of the pool on May 31 from 8:30 p.m. to 8:45 p.m. looked different.
“It looked like the pool had been disturbed, rocks moved, water was around all the edges,” Poland said.
He said a look at the video confirmed the camera had captured a small eruption.
Poland said a couple of eruptions after the explosion last summer had been observed, and a number of smaller ones had been detected based on seismic data and acoustic monitoring.
On Nov. 5, 2024, a geologist in the park taking samples witnessed an eruption of muddy water going up 20 or 30 feet, he said. Then, on Jan. 3, 2025, a tour group looking at bison nearby observed a small eruption in the pool.
“We have all these other suggestions of other data that these events have happened many times,” Poland said.
By comparison, Old Faithful shoots up from 106 feet to more than 180 feet, according to the National Park Service.
Poland said the smaller flareup captured on video is probably typical of the current activity at the Black Diamond Pool.
The area has a history of eruptions and explosions, and it probably formed in the early 20th century, Poland said.
“Since that time, it has gone through periods when it has been a bit more active and then periods when it’s quiet,” he said.
In the mid-2000s to mid-2010s, it erupted maybe a few times a year, and then it went quiet until 2024, Poland said.
Last summer, in a massive explosion, the pool threw rocks as large as 3 feet wide hundreds of feet into the air and reformed pools.
No one was hurt, but the boardwalk was damaged, and Yellowstone National Park still has marked the area as closed.
“The history at this particular pool seems to be one where it likes to have a muddy explosion from time to time,” Poland said.
But Poland said one explosion there doesn’t forecast another one.
At Old Faithful, the “plumbing system” is established, and it creates consistent behavior, Poland said. It erupts on a regular basis, as its name suggests.
However, Poland said most hydrothermal features don’t have such well-defined or steady plumbing systems.
He said one reason is that hot water carries lots of minerals, and as it gets close to the surface and cools, minerals drop off and tend to coat “conduit walls,” where water flows, and seal them off.
The water then looks for a different way to move, and it will break a seal, resulting in an explosion.
But he said scientists don’t know enough about the subsurface conditions of most hydrothermal areas or how they change over time to forecast which features will have explosions, when they might take place, or how big they might be.
“That’s one of the real challenges we face with hydrothermal activities,” Poland said.
In an email, a spokesperson for Yellowstone National Park said the parking lot and boardwalks are still closed at Biscuit Basin: “We are closely monitoring activity at the site for the possibility of additional events, and it will reopen when it is safe to do so.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/explode-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-06 17:10:17.519373

The decision dismisses suits brought by towns who argued the state should not be allowed to force compliance with the MBTA Communities multifamily zoning law.
The post MBTA Communities law is not an unfunded mandate, judge rules  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","A PLYMOUTH COUNTY judge overseeing a bundle of municipal lawsuits from towns seeking to halt enforcement of the MBTA Communities housing law has denied their motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed their complaints. In a 40-page decision released Friday afternoon, Superior Court Justice Mark Gildea considered lawsuits brought by the towns of Duxbury, Hanson, Holden, Marshfield, Middleton, Wenham, Weston, and Wrentham, plus a taxpayer suit brought by Hamilton residents. The collection of suits argued that, because the state auditor’s office concluded that the MBTA Communities law is an “unfunded mandate” by forcing cities and towns near public transit to zone for multifamily development, the state should be blocked from enforcing the law until a funding mechanism is put in place. More broadly, they claimed, the state imposed improper compliance requirements through the law as a condition to receive significant grant funding.Involving towns across six counties, the decision came at a critical time for a set of MBTA Communities with just over a month left to get into compliance with a revised set of state regulations.Zoning for a potential 750 new units or more in each community, they argued, would impact infrastructure and services within their borders. These issues touched on water and sewer, education, buildings, roads, and other governmental services along with some municipality-specific concerns. The injunctions would have both freed up grant funds the state was withholding for non-compliance with the law and stop the state from excluding these towns from future grants. The anticipated possible costs that the towns could incur from the rezoning are “indirect” and therefore not in need of specific funding from the state, Gildea wrote. Similarly, the towns did not claim specific enough details about infrastructure costs, he wrote. “The only allegations … before the court are generalized comments about large-scale issues they foresee,” such as impacts on sewer capacity without specifics, which are not enough to support an unfunded mandate claim, Gildea wrote. There was only “speculation” about possible direct costs, he concluded, noting that the filing and affidavits submitted include words like “may,” “expect,” “possibly,” “anticipate,” and “estimated.” The court, Gildea wrote, is also not bound by State Auditor Diana DiZoglio’s office finding that the law constitutes an unfunded mandate. He disagreed with the auditor’s ultimate conclusion, calling the determination “flawed as a matter of law.” There is no requirement to construct new housing, and even advocates of the law argue that claims of overwhelmed resources and booming amounts of new units are greatly overstated.  The regulations being challenged here, he wrote, “do not compel construction. They merely encourage it.” And there is actually funding available, he said. There are programs – like MassWorks and HousingWorks that are competitive grants for a variety of infrastructure projects associated with housing development – for municipalities based on the cost they claim will arise in either conducting the rezoning process or seeing an influx of related units. The towns did not convince Gildea that the MBTA Communities rezoning process exceeds regular zoning tasks that would make the process cost anything more than “incidental local administration expense[s]” not requiring specific funding.  None of the towns showed that they would likely succeed on the merits of the case and are not entitled to a preliminary injunction that would require releasing withheld grant funding, the judge ruled. “We are pleased the courts have again affirmed the intent of the MBTA Communities Law, and we look forward to working with the remaining communities to complete their zoning changes,” said Ed Augustus, Secretary of Housing and Livable Communities, in a statement after the ruling. “Massachusetts’ housing shortage has led to unaffordable prices and rising rents, but the MBTA Communities Law is working to deliver new housing where it’s needed most and to bring down the cost of housing for all residents.” The judge also disposed with the argument that towns like Holden and Middleton are not “adjacent” to the MBTA system and therefore subject to the law. The towns, he wrote, seem to “misconstrue” the word adjacent to mean adjoining – essentially incorrectly claiming they would have to be touching a municipality with MBTA service. The MBTA Communities law has been a stand-in for the long dispute over city and state powers. Advocates for local control claim that the towns that have actively rejected compliance should be free to refuse. But this ignores long-held, common understanding that municipalities are merely “creations” of the state Legislature, Gildea wrote. The rights of a town and its voters are “subordinate” to state lawmakers deciding to enact the MBTA Communities law, he added.  Even some municipalities who submitted compliant action plans were hoping to drag their feet on fully rezoning while the courts considered the “unfunded mandate” determination. Gildea’s decision will have implications across the state, including in the first town to resist – Milton. Taxpayers in Milton threw the town into the legal mix yet again by suing at the end of May on unfunded mandate grounds, and the Planning Board is weighing another round of potential but unspecified litigation.  The post MBTA Communities law is not an unfunded mandate, judge rules  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Single-Family-Housing.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-06 17:10:17.519373
,DC,2025-06-06 20:23:37+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Republicans in Congress axed the ‘green new scam,’ but it’s a red state boon",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/republicans-congress-axed-green-new-scam-its-red-state-boon,,"WASHINGTON —  Clean energy manufacturers and advocates say they’re perplexed how the repeal of tax credits in President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” will keep their domestic production lines humming across the United States, particularly in states that elected him to the Oval Office.While some Republicans have labeled the billions in tax credits a “green new scam,” statistics reviewed by State Newsroom show the jobs and benefits would boost predominantly GOP-leaning states and congressional districts. Now the industry is already slowing amid Trump’s back-and-forth tariff policy and mixed messaging on energy and manufacturing.Trump vowed in early April to “supercharge our domestic industrial base.”“Jobs and factories will come roaring back to our country, and you see it happening already,” he told a crowd in the White House Rose Garden while unveiling his new trade policy.But as a way to pay for the $3.9 trillion price tag of extending and expanding the 2017 corporate and individual tax cuts, U.S. House Republicans found billions of dollars in savings by slashing over a dozen clean energy tax credits enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden.Critics say the mega-bill, which passed the GOP-led House on May 22 in a 215-214 vote, would effectively strip away the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit and other incentives.They have bolstered the production of batteries and solar components in numerous states — top among them North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee, Texas, Nevada, Illinois and Oklahoma, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.U.S. senators are now negotiating the massive budget reconciliation legislation.Kevin Doffling, CEO and founder of Project Vanguard, an organization that connects veterans to clean energy jobs, warned pulling the plug on the clean energy tax credits will stifle progress the U.S. has made against other countries, namely China.“We're just going to see a huge pullback from investments inside of advanced manufacturing here in the U.S., and then we'll go source it from other places, instead of doing it here,” Doffling said on a May 28 press call pressing for senators to protect the tax credits.Doffling’s organization works in several states, including Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Minnesota, Washington and Utah.Moving away from fossil fuelsThe suite of tax credits enacted under the IRA incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of a reduction in the effects of climate change.For example, the IRA’s Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit is awarded per unit produced and sold, and in some cases the capacity of energy output. Battery cell manufacturers can earn up to $35 per battery cell multiplied by potential kilowatt hours. In the case of solar, the credit offers producers 7 cents per solar module multiplied by wattage output. For mining operations extracting critical minerals, such as lithium, companies can receive a 10% tax break on the costs of production.Most credits phase out by 2032 under the Biden-era law, except those for critical mineral mining, which continue.A group of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam” — echoing Trump’s rhetoric — pushed to accelerate the expiration in the final version of the mega-bill, even for critical mineral mining and production. The federal government classifies critical minerals as crucial to national security.The House-passed bill also severely tightens language around foreign components, titled “foreign entities of concern,” making the credit practically unusable as many parts of the clean energy manufacturing supply chain are global, industry professionals say.The legislation also repeals “transferability,” which allows companies with little or no tax liability to sell the credits.For example, a critical mineral mining company would not turn a profit during an initial phase and could sell the credits to offset the cost of operations.Schneider Electric, a global corporation with a U.S. base in Massachusetts, has facilitated 18 transfer deals worth $1.7 billion in tax credits for U.S. companies since 2023. In a statement, Schneider said the deals “reflect growing market interest in flexible financing mechanisms that directly fund renewable projects.”Silfab Solar, which recently built a solar cell manufacturing and module assembly plant in Fort Mill, South Carolina, announced in mid-May the sale of $110 million in Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credits to help fund its expansion. The company already runs a solar manufacturing site in Burlington, Washington.Investment soaredSpurred by the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit, known as 45X, actual investment in clean energy manufacturing since August 2022 reached $115 billion in April, up from $21 billion over the same length of time prior to the IRA, the Clean Investment Monitor found.Of the 380 clean technology production facilities announced since the third quarter of 2022, 161 are now operational, according to CIM data.The credit spurred a “sea change” in U.S. clean energy manufacturing, said Mike Williams, senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress and former deputy director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which advocates for the joining of labor and environmental organizations.Despite solar technology’s roots in the U.S., the nation “didn’t even have a toe” in solar manufacturing, Williams said. Other countries, most notably Germany and then China, have dominated the industry.“But after the Inflation Reduction Act passed, all of a sudden we see panel manufacturing, we see parts and components manufacturing, absolutely exploding. Plants have announced and started construction in Georgia, in Oklahoma,” Williams said in an interview with States Newsroom.Active manufacturing of solar components, advanced batteries and wind turbines and vessels is concentrated in rural areas. Most are located in states that went red in the 2024 presidential election, according to the Clean Power America Association’s May 2025 State of Clean Energy Manufacturing in America report.The renewable energy policy group estimated the industry supports 122,000 full-time manufacturing jobs across the U.S.Active solar manufacturing sites and expansions are clustered in Texas, Ohio and Alabama, according to data from the association. Should major project announcements in Georgia pull through, the state would surpass Alabama for third place.Advanced battery manufacturing spans 38 states, with the largest concentrations in California, Michigan and North Carolina.But various parts of the battery production process stretch throughout the country — for example, battery cell production in Nevada and Tennessee and module production in Utah. Other supporting hardware is made in South Carolina, Arizona and Texas.Lithium, a critical mineral for battery production, is currently mined in Nevada and California. And investors are eyeing other spots in the U.S., namely Alaska, to mine and produce graphite, another critical mineral.China largely dominates the world’s critical mineral supply chain, according to U.S. Geological Survey data for 2024.When accounting for the full suite of clean energy tax credits that were enacted in 2022 — including residential, electric vehicles and clean electricity credits — just over 312,900 new jobs are linked to the industry, the bulk in Republican-led congressional districts, according to the advocacy group Climate Power’s 2024 report on clean energy employment.Troy Van Beek, CEO and founder of the Iowa-based solar company Ideal Energy, said his business weathered the pandemic and has been able to add jobs, but is now facing uncertainty again.“​​We're getting our feet under us and really starting to operate. I went from 20-some jobs to over 60 jobs, and those are good-paying jobs for people and their families. So we need that stability in the industry,” said Van Beek, who spoke on the call with Doffling.“What troubles me is the rocking of the boat to such a degree that we can't get anything done, and that's been very difficult to deal with,” he said.Industry slowdownThe industry has seen a pullback since January and the beginning of the Trump presidency.Six announced projects representing $6.9 billion in investment were canceled in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Clean Investment Monitor’s latest State of U.S. Clean Energy Supply Chains report. While investment in clean energy overall continues to grow, the beginning of 2025 shows a slowdown from where the industry was a year ago.Van Beek, whose solar company provides construction and installation among others services, said recent talks to strike a deal with a solar manufacturer collapsed after threats to the tax credits.“We had worked an entire year on putting together (a deal) with one of the leading manufacturers in the world that has U.S. manufacturing to actually have joint ventures and work with them on projects,” Van Beek said. “And when this came up, that deal came to a screeching halt.”Van Beek did not name the company on the call and did not respond to a request for a follow-up interview.Several companies declined States Newsroom’s requests for comment while senators negotiate the bill.Spencer Pederson of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association said the unpredictability is interrupting how operators are planning for the coming years.“Whether large or small, just the business certainty and the ability to plan out your business is disrupted when you have any type of tax mechanism that is abruptly halted when you're doing business planning at five- or 10-year intervals,” said Pederson, the association’s senior vice president of public affairs.Too expensive, Republicans saySome House Republicans, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, urged party colleagues to protect the clean energy tax credits — for example by removing the “overly prescriptive” restrictions on foreign entities of concern and keeping in place transferability of tax credits.Kiggans wrote to House Republican tax writers in mid-May that “the last thing any of us want is to provoke an energy crisis or cause higher energy bills for working families.”Her co-signers included Don Bacon of Nebraska, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, Gabe Evans and Jeff Hurd of Colorado, Dave Joyce of Ohio and Dan Newhouse of Washington, who all eventually voted for the final bill.Far-right House members won on not only shortening the lifespan of the credits, but also on keeping the restrictive foreign entity language and on repealing a company’s ability to transfer credits.The right-leaning National Taxpayers Union hailed the “commonsense changes” championed by the far-right House Freedom Caucus, under the leadership of Maryland Rep. Andy Harris.The organization, which favors cutting government spending and lowering taxes, pointed to the cost. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the credits as of 2022 were valued at roughly $384.9 billion over ten years.“The longer these subsidies remain in law, the more expensive they will become and the harder it will be for Congress to remove them. Now it’s up to the Senate to support the Green New Deal Rollbacks,” Thomas Aiello, NTU’s senior director of government affairs, wrote in the days following the House vote.Hope in the Senate?But representatives from multinational corporations to mid-size businesses and sizable trade associations are now looking to the U.S. Senate to restore measures that they say created a boom time for investment, production and new energy on the grid.Jeannie Salo, chief public policy officer at Schneider Electric, said in a statement to States Newsroom that “The Senate should restore and extend the timelines for key energy and manufacturing credits and their transferability to ensure the nation continues to attract key investments and projects that will power the U.S. economy and help make energy more affordable.”Pederson said the restrictions on foreign components and company ties are “particularly restrictive coming out of the House.”“So we're hoping to work with the Senate Finance Committee and some of the members of the Senate who have indicated some willingness to make the foreign entity of concern language a little bit more workable,” Pederson said.Doffling believes senators have a “longer term vision” of the nation’s energy strategy than House members who face reelection every two years.“They see what's happening not just in their district, but in the entire state that they represent,” Doffling said.The House bill just sets the U.S. “further behind,” he added. “This bill is all about going backwards in time and hoping for the best.”“I wish they could look at the numbers and understand the economic impacts it's gonna have. … But somehow we're talking about the fact of hamstringing a whole entire industry itself over verbiage of the word ‘clean.’”",,,,2025-06-06 17:10:17.519373

(Photo by Jennifer Peacock | Assembly Republican Office)Supporters of a new law that ended New Jersey’s controversial county-line ballot system signaled there is no rush to amend the statute, even after a federal judge warned this week that the law may be unconstitutional.
U.S. District Court Judge Zahid Quraishi in a Tuesday order said some balloting practices that were challenged in court last year likely remain unconstitutional despite changes signed into law this March, but Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) said he thinks the law, which he sponsored, “meets constitutional muster.”
“Ballot design has always been in the purview of the Legislature, but I’m aware of what he said,” Scutari said.
Scutari added that he had not read the order but had heard some of the judge’s concerns through other mediums.
It’s unclear what effect Quraishi’s order will have on future elections. There are primaries on Tuesday — gubernatorial and Assembly candidates are on the ballot — but it’s too soon to change ballots before then.
The new law was spurred by a lawsuit filed in February 2024 by now-Sen. Andy Kim and two other congressional candidates. The three Democrats alleged that the state’s county-line ballot system — which groups party-backed candidates on the ballot no matter what office they’re seeking — is unconstitutional.
In March 2024, Quraishi ruled that Kim’s lawsuit was likely to succeed on its merits, and he barred county clerks from using county-line ballots in the June 2024 primary. Instead, he ordered them to use office-block ballots, which group candidates by the office they’re seeking.
The Legislature then acted. Earlier this year, it passed the new ballot law, which revamped the design of primary ballots largely to conform to Quraishi’s March 2024 edict. But the judge, in his new order, noted that the law permits candidates to bracket with one another on the ballot and have their ballot positions determined by a single draw instead of individual draws.
Those provisions, he wrote, “likely do not remove the unconstitutional practices alleged.”
Quraishi’s March 2024 order barred clerks from conducting ballot draws that “do not include a separate drawing for every office and candidate” and required ballot draws offer each candidate an equal chance of securing the best ballot position.
The Kim lawsuit alleged  Jersey’s bracketing system — which allowed candidates to have their ballot positions drawn as a group if they shared a slogan, as did candidates backed by party leaders — violated other candidates’ associational rights by requiring they bracket with others to avoid being disadvantaged by the ballot itself.
Under prior law, ballot draws for candidates for high office could determine placements for those seeking other offices, from the state to local level.
The new law allows candidates seeking the same office, like two running mates for a single Assembly district, to have their ballot positions drawn as a group. Quraishi said this week that leaving ballot draws to clerks’ discretion could harm candidates in the future.
One of the law’s sponsors said the Legislature would act if Quraishi orders further changes.
“The ballot design legislation was written with unprecedented public input and reviewed by counsel from the Office of Legislative Services, as is the case with any law. If there is a legal challenge and a court determines we need to address something, I’m sure the legislature will,” said Assemblyman Al Barlas (R-Essex), who co-chaired an Assembly panel convened to consider new ballot design.
As the new law was being contemplated, numerous witnesses urged legislators to require randomized electronic ballot draws and rotating candidate ballot positions to ensure each appeared in the first position as often as their opponents and warned that bracketing provisions could disadvantage solo candidates.
Quraishi’s concerns haven’t spawned wide-reaching worry among the state’s most prominent politicians.
“They put the people who are running together together. I don’t have a great passion about that one way or the other, but the ballot worked for me,” Gov. Phil Murphy told reporters Thursday. “It was dead straight forward, dead easy.”

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Earlier this week, a young child in San Juan County with one dose of the measles vaccine contracted the measles on a domestic flight, putting area doctors on watch for more cases.
“I would say we’re in a cautious holding pattern,” Dr. Brad Scoggins, a pediatrician based in Farmington, told Source New Mexico. “We’re appropriately concerned, but not panicked.”
Measles, a highly contagious respiratory virus, spreads through contact with airborne droplets from an infected person’s coughs and sneezes. Symptoms can take one to three weeks tos develop, and include headache, cough, fever, red eyes and a spotty red rash on the head and face that spreads across the body.
New Mexico health officials report measles exposures in San Juan, Lea county hospitals

Scoggins said the clinic has enacted increased precautions to prevent spread, such as using virtual visits or testing any cases with symptoms of fever and rash outside of the clinic.
The New Mexico Department of Health reported no change in the state’s number of cases Friday, but public health officials have recently warned they expect a rise in cases due to summer travel.
Much like cases across the U.S., over 80% of New Mexico’s 81 measles infections impacted people who are unvaccinated or of unknown status. However, 13 cases of New Mexico’s included patients with at least one dose of the vaccine.
One dose of the measles vaccine offers 93% protection from infection and a second dose offers higher protection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
When spread increases, measles can sometimes infect vaccinated people, but but with less severity, because the vaccine primes the body’s defense system to fight it, Scoggins said.
“In real world terms, that means that the duration of illness is a bit shorter, and the severity is less,” he said. “[Measles, mumps rubella] vaccine is considered a sterilizing vaccine. So once you’ve had the vaccination, you should theoretically not be able to transmit it — or at least, it’s much less likely.”
Scoggins said he empathizes with parents who are concerned about safety and efficacy of vaccines, despite decades of research.
“There’s a whole lot of noise out there right now, and it’s hard for parents to know, I think, who to listen to,” he said.
Scoggins said he’s working to counter misinformation by pointing people to works of history including “The Great Influenza” on the 1918 flu epidemic and “Man and Microbes,” a history of plagues.
“It offers a little bit of a historical perspective because we live in a time where we’re so protected from these things, but it’s only because of what our forebears have instituted,” he said.
Scoggins said that vaccine advice doesn’t just apply to his patients, noting his own children have vaccinations, as do all 12 of the pediatricians and nurse practitioners in his office with children.
“All of our kids have had their vaccines on their regular schedule,” he said. “We don’t do anything for other people’s kids that we wouldn’t do for our own.
Officials from San Juan County Regional Medical Center urged patients to call the NMDOH hotline at 1-833-796-8773, with any questions about testing, vaccines or symptoms.
“The best thing our community can do to protect themselves is to get vaccinated against the measles,” said Laura Werbner, a spokesperson at San Juan County Regional Medical Center. “Talk to your pediatrician about the measles vaccine for your children. If you are an adult and have not been vaccinated, you can still get the vaccine.”
More information about free vaccine clinics can be found at the state’s measles webpage.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-06 20:16:47+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Violence fell notably during Jackson’s 100 Days of Peace, but ‘we can’t say’ why",Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/06/violence-fell-notably-during-jacksons-100-days-of-peace-but-we-cant-say-why/,"The reduction in violence was one goal of 100 Days of Peace, also known as 100 Days of Action, an initiative launched earlier this year by the Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery.","By the final day of “100 Days of Peace” in Jackson Friday, the city once called America’s deadliest had recorded a marked decline in violent offenses — 35% fewer homicides and nearly half of shootings — compared to last year. 
But amid instability at the city’s fledgling violence prevention office, the exact reason for the recent respite eludes city leaders. 
The reduction in violence was one goal of 100 Days of Peace, also known as 100 Days of Action, an initiative launched earlier this year by the Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery. 
From Feb. 27 to June 6, the office planned to host events to raise awareness and loosely create an atmosphere of peace in Jackson. It also announced $150,000 in grants, which began in January, to three community violence intervention organizations, Strong Arms of Mississippi, Living With Purpose and Operation Good.
The plan was to collect data to document how their work reduced violence outside of  police involvement or incarceration. It was a fitting opportunity for the office, which was only launched in 2022 with a $700,000 grant from the National League of Cities, to justify why the city should allocate its own resources to these efforts, instead of simply increasing the police budget.
But before that could happen, the city fired Keisha Coleman, the director of the office who was spearheading these data collection efforts. 
“We didn’t make it there,” Coleman said. “And I would like to get that information cause I still can look at it from a violence standpoint. We know homicides are down, but we can’t say with 100% accuracy what’s contributing to that.”

In other words, Coleman said she’d hoped to “prove that because of the 100 Days of Action and the initiatives that came from the office, it was a critical piece to keeping peace in the city.” 
To do that, Coleman said she had asked the three organizations to submit reports to her describing the number of people served, including their age and city zip code, what service they received, and how long they had been in each organization’s program. 
With Coleman gone, it’s unclear if the city of Jackson is hip to what data has been collected or if it plans to analyze it to determine what programs are most effective moving forward. When the city fulfilled Mississippi Today’s requests for data analysis after Coleman was fired, it only provided one report that Living With Purpose completed in February, before 100 Days of Peace began. 
But the city should have possession of more data than that. Benny Ivey, a co-lead of Strong Arms, told Mississippi Today his organization had submitted reports to Coleman detailing the work they were doing. 
“We’re constantly in the community working with kids,” he said. “We’ve got a bunch of parents that reach out to us weekly wanting to get their boys enrolled in their program. We pick them up, they play ball, we have group sessions.” 
Ivey did not seem to know that data analysis had been a goal of 100 Days of Peace. 
“100 Days of Peace was something that Keisha and the Office of Violence Prevention came up with just to bring awareness,” he said. “But events and barbecues and cookouts and waterslides, all that’s fun, but we’re out there on the ground with our boots trying to make real change.” 
Fredrick Womack, executive director of Operation Good, said his organization is working to make Jackson safer whether or not the city is able to collect data.
“We work every day to have peace,” Womack said. “We want 365 days of peace.” 
In some cities, the impact of solutions to violence that do not involve police has been straightforward to qualify: The mayor meets with rival gang members, and they agree to a ceasefire, in exchange for job training. 
But in Jackson, a variety of organizations are working to reduce violence outside of the police, and they employ different methods. In general, it can be difficult to show through crime data reported by the police how these organizations are impacting violence in the city — precisely because their work is intended to prevent people from becoming a statistic. 
Operation Good uses a variety of models, including an approach called “it takes a village,” to prevent interpersonal conflicts from turning violent and reduce the social conditions that lead to such conflicts. Strong Arms and Living With Purpose primarily work with credible messengers, folks in the community who have been involved in the criminal justice system, to encourage youth to take a less violent path in life.  
When the city launched the Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery more than two years ago, the goal was to help these organizations grow by offering support through additional grant funding and technical assistance, such as how to collect data.
Coleman said, when she showed Ivey the data she intended to collect earlier this year, he was ecstatic because he had not yet figured out how to do that. 
“Their passion exceeds their administrative duties,” she said. “They were doing the work, but they just hadn’t conditioned themselves to record it.”
But the first monthly deadline to submit data came and went with nothing submitted, she said. As part of the memorandum of understanding with the city, these three organizations were supposed to be submitting data to Coleman.
Strong Arms ended up submitting a quarterly report, Coleman said. She also met with Womack at Operation Good’s office to talk to him about the data she was needing, leading Womack to show her that he collected more data than she was asking for. 
“When she saw our spreadsheet and saw that it was more detailed and so forth, she just said that would be sufficient,” Womack said. 
But when Mississippi Today requested this information, the city only provided one report from Living With Purpose. Titled “OVPTR performance management meeting report,” the form shows that between Jan. 1, 2025, and Feb. 28, 2025 — the start of 100 Days of Peace — the organization reported 11 individuals had received a “ceasefire communication” outside of custody. 
The organization also conducted 19 mediations. While this term is not defined in the document, the spreadsheet notes that 80% were conflict mediations, with “two sides,” as opposed to “conflict intervention conversations,” which only had “one side.” (In Womack’s case, a mediation occurs after an Operation Good staff member intervenes in a potentially violent situation and helps the people involved leave with mutual understanding.) 
The form does not include location data, so it is not clear in which areas of the city these mediations took place in.

Multiple statistics show that violence and crime have fallen in Jackson. The Jackson Police Department recorded 17 homicides from Feb. 27 to June 6 of this year, compared with 26 in the same time frame last year. 
The Gun Violence Archive, a national nonprofit, documented 33 shootings in Jackson, compared to 61 last year. 
But JPD was not an official arm of 100 Days of Peace, and the department has its own explanation for why the city’s violent crime rate plummeted this year.
“Well, crime is down because a lot of people are still in jail,” Deputy Chief Sequerna Banks said. 
That’s because many people are receiving high bonds they cannot pay, preventing them from returning to the community.
“We’ve had some low bonds, something we’re not happy with, but that’s out of our control as far as setting bonds,” Banks said. “But most definitely the high bonds play a part. People are in jail on high bonds and not having to worry about them getting out and that plays a very high part in crime being down.” 
Ask Operation Good, Living With Purpose or Strong Arms why crime is down, they will say it’s because they are working to prevent people from committing crimes. 
For instance, Womack noted that Operation Good has actually intercepted more violent incidents this year compared to last, because Operation Good’s area has grown beyond south Jackson, and Womack has been able to hire more mediators. 
To support Womack’s point, Coleman said she had envisioned creating a series of heat maps of Jackson. She wanted to look at crimes committed in previous years and compare that to the past 100 days in Jackson to see if there was a reduction in the areas of the city served by the three organizations. 
“I explained that was gonna be the role of the Office of Violence Prevention, that once they collected their information or recorded their data, we would take it and synthesize it collectively, and we would create the stories and the narratives that go along with the data to show how the credible messengers and violence interruption organizations are real drivers of crime reduction in Jackson,” she said. 
Coleman never got that far, and confusion persists among city officials about what data can actually be provided to the public. 
“I don’t know if your public records request would account for all of their work,” outgoing Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said on Tuesday after the city council meeting, when asked if the city had any data on 100 Days of Peace. “It wouldn’t account for everything that they – you would only have access to the public information of us giving to them.” 
“I’m talking about communicating with them and understanding where they were engaged and what their engagements yielded,” he continued. “None of that would be recovered by a public records request, which is the meat of that type of work. The meat of actual violence interruption, you don’t go talk to gang members and say okay I need you to sign this document. It is actually about the connections, so that would never be connected by a public records request.” 
Safiya Omari, the mayor’s chief of staff, said that a number of offices around the country have been working to prove the efficacy of non-police approaches to violence. 
“There’s a lot of information that we collect,” she said. “What we have is a disconnect between data and actual work and now we are trying to bridge that disconnect.” 
Omari noted one example of data the city has obtained to support the office’s work. 
“For example, we know the six zip codes that have the highest amount of gun violence in the city,” she said. “The work is supposed to center around programmatically addressing what’s happening in the community. Events are good in terms of raising awareness, but you actually have to have some boots on the ground kind of work taking place.” 
A document analyzing those six zip codes was never provided in response to Mississippi Today’s records request for data. 
Other details are missing. Coleman said she distributed gun safety locks at the Westside Community Center as part of 100 Days of Peace, but that handout was not documented in the records provided to Mississippi Today.

Photo via Adobe StockWhen they returned to Montpelier for this legislative session, Vermont lawmakers looking to rein in Big Tech had to retrace their steps. Last biennium, after months of contentious negotiations, the state Legislature passed a sweeping data privacy package — a 100-plus-page bill that would have established some of the strongest online privacy protections in the nation. But despite broad support, Gov. Phil Scott vetoed the bill, arguing that it would harm local businesses while opening the state up to costly litigation. A vote to override the veto failed narrowly in the Senate.At the start of this session, the architects of last year’s bill followed a more piecemeal approach, splitting the changes into two main bills. One, S.69 — known by advocates as the Kids Code — would require social media companies to adjust their design codes for users under 18 with the goal of making platforms like TikTok and Snapchat less addictive and harmful for children. The other, S.71, would establish comprehensive data privacy protections, minimizing the amount of Vermonters’ data that tech companies and online retailers can collect, use and sell.With the session nearing a close, lawmakers are celebrating the passage of the former bill, which was overwhelmingly approved by both chambers last week and was delivered to the governor on Friday.But after months of testimony and dealmaking, legislators have chosen to put the data privacy overhaul on ice for the year. The primary reason to take more time, leading lawmakers have said, is to try to counter the narrative spread by an intense lobbying campaign waged by local and national interests against more stringent data privacy rules.“The public and even other members of the body don’t realize how extreme the lobbying tactics are on tech bills in the building,” Rep. Monique Priestley, D-Bradford, said last week.  “Lobbyists have a lot to do with deciding the fate of these bills.”Rep. Monique Priestley, D-Bradford, listens during a House Commerce and Economic Development Committee at the Statehouse in Montpelier on April 8, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger‘There are all these different levels of industry’ With federal lawmakers mostly unable or unwilling to effectively regulate cyberspace, Vermont legislators have been trying for years to establish digital privacy ground rules at the state level.In their latest attempt, state lawmakers this year put forward S.71, which seeks to minimize the amount of data that companies can harvest from Vermonters, enabling them to collect only what is necessary for the service they provide. In its original form, the bill also includes a private right of action, allowing consumers to sue companies for illegally collecting and selling sensitive data.  Almost as soon as it was introduced, the bill hit a wall of resistance from local businesses and national groups. “We have concerns about untested and confusing definitions, a continued private right of action being included and moving in a way that will catch businesses getting it wrong to the benefit of litigators rather than helping them get it right to the benefit of consumers,” Megan Sullivan, vice president of the Vermont Chamber of Commerce, said during a Senate committee hearing in March. The Vermont chamber and others instead backed S.93, another bill introduced this year that proposes weaker data protections and does not include a private right of action. But lawmakers have said that it’s hard to distinguish homegrown concerns from those of big tech companies who have swarmed the building this year as well. According to records from the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and TikTok all had representatives in the Capitol this year. Collectively, the six companies spent just over $110,000 on lobbying activities in Vermont since January. Representatives from nationwide industry lobbying groups that represent tech conglomerates, like the State Privacy and Security Coalition and the Connected Commerce Council, have also been in the building, according to records from the Secretary of State’s Office. “There are all these different levels of industry — the international companies and local businesses,” Sen. Wendy Harrison, D-Windham, said. “It’s more helpful for me and other legislators to know what the impact is on actual Vermont businesses.”Sen. Wendy Harrison, D-Windham, listens to testimony during a Senate committee meeting at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Feb. 28, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger Credit: Glenn Russell‘A compromise with industry’Lacking sufficient support to pass S.71 as written in the Senate, Harrison and fellow members of the Senate Committee on Institutions decided to amend the bill, essentially replacing it with the language of S.93 — thereby removing the private right of action — before passing it out of the chamber and over to the House. According to Priestley, the House Committee on Commerce, which took up the bill in April, expected to reach a compromise with industry players and eventually restore the bill to something closer to its original form before advancing it this year. Instead, they’ve decided to hold onto the bill for the summer.“Toward the end of session we were trying to get to a place where we could strike a compromise with industry, and it was really not coming to that,” she said.Priestley said that the pause would allow her coalition to work with lawmakers in other New England states like Connecticut, Massachusetts and Maine, which are developing similar policies. She also said she hoped the time would allow for lawmakers to find daylight between the concerns of Vermont businesses and those of tech conglomerates.“Our decision in wanting to take a pause this summer is in large part to make sure that we’re actually getting engagement from Vermonters and small businesses from all over the state because that’s who this is protecting,” she said.  Lawmakers have similarly decided to shelf until next year S.70, a bill that would put up stricter guardrails for third-party data brokers, and H.342, a bill that would grant public servants the legal right to request that their private information be removed from data broker websites like Whitepages.Priestley said she and other bill drafters would now “be spending all summer on engagement, education and coalition building” and will look to move forward on the bills next year.‘It’s critical to support our kids’Vermont lawmakers have found more common ground on the Kids Code, which cleared the Legislature last week and is now under review by Gov. Scott. Taking aim at social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram that consumer advocates say are explicitly designed to keep children hooked, the bill would require platforms to adjust their algorithms and design codes for users under 18, functionally prohibiting certain addictive features like 24-hour push notifications and endless scroll for minors. The legislation would also force social media platforms to adopt stringent default privacy settings for minors for their safety, while minimizing the data that the platforms can collect from younger users to then use or sell. Supporters say the bill would go a long way toward improving the mental health of teens by mitigating the worst excesses of social media use, a goal that also lies behind the ongoing push to ban smartphones from Vermont classrooms. A miscellaneous education bill, H.480, which would require K-12 schools in the state to adopt phone-free policies, passed out of the Senate last month and is awaiting approval from the House.“It’s critical to support our kids,” Harrison, the lead sponsor of S.69, said in an interview last week. “Having the ban on cellphones and the Kids Code together, I’m very pleased that we (in the Senate) have passed both of those.”The Kids Code now heads to the desk of Gov. Scott, who has tentatively signaled his support for the bill, at least in spirit.“I’m in favor of trying to protect kids from social media,” Scott said Wednesday at his weekly press conference, noting that at that point he had not officially received the bill. “They may have come to a place where I can support it, but, again, we’ll take a look at it when we get it.”Scott has continued to raise concerns that the Kids Code could face an uphill battle in the courts, where groups representing tech firms have attempted to torpedo similar laws passed by other states. However, the support from legislators in both chambers would be enough to override any veto, if it holds.Most prominently, NetChoice, an advocacy group representing Google and Meta, among many other companies, has sued several states, including California and Maryland, to block the implementation of social media design code laws on First Amendment grounds.However, Vermont lawmakers say the state’s Kid Code deliberately avoids those pitfalls by targeting the structural design of social media platforms rather than moderating content.  “We’ve basically been trying to keep up with those lawsuits and making sure that our language reflects what is being called out in court,” Priestley said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  As ‘Kids Code’ awaits action from Vermont Gov.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Clean energy advocates said Iowa stands to lose jobs, manufacturing facilities, renewable energy project expansions and face more expensive utility bills if Congress passes the budget reconciliation bill as is. 
Many of these credits were extended via the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which put them under attack from Republican lawmakers opposed to the green policies. Renewable energy advocates say continued investment into wind, solar and other clean energy sources, regardless of environmental impact, is vital to meeting growing energy demands. 
Nearly three-fifths of Iowa’s total electricity generation comes from renewable sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which also reports Iowa is one of the top states for solar and wind energy generation. Since 2019, Iowa has generated more electricity via wind than from coal and continues to grow its solar production.

Kristina Costa, who formerly worked at the White House implementing the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy and climate policies, said the IRA established at least 10 years of tax credits to support clean energy industries, which launched new projects and expanded the industry.
“The House bill that the Republicans passed explodes that entire paradigm,” Costa said. “It functions as a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act.” 
Costa, during a Thursday press conference with Climate Power, said the bill “really radically” changes how clean electricity developers can plan and develop their projects, by eliminating the ability to “lock in” a tax treatment at the start of construction. 
“This is going to create a lot of uncertainty for project developers,” Costa said. “It’s going to raise financing costs for project developers pretty considerably … but it also just means that fewer projects will end up qualifying for the credits.” 
How the bill impacts clean energy projects
Clean energy tax credits impact transportation, power generation, industry and construction and create incentives for projects like renewable vehicle fuels, solar, wind, nuclear power generation and more. 
Per the reconciliation bill text as it passed the House May 22, the bill would terminate clean vehicle credits, residential energy efficiency credits, hydrogen fuel credits and place restrictions on credits for clean electricity production, zero-emission nuclear energy production and other sectors. 
Some of the restrictions include strict construction timeline requirements, like beginning construction within 60 days of enactment, and bringing the projects online by 2028.
Costa said these timelines create an “incredibly sharp cliff” for developers to work within for projects that often take years and can face lengthy setbacks from supply chain disruptions.
The budget bill also has extensive language pertaining to and restricting projects that have any ties to foreign entities. 
Costa said these restrictions are “very complicated, unworkable, Byzantine requirements” that impose “a lot of red tape” for developers and would have the “immediate effect of freezing the market.” 
She said it would require companies to understand where “literally every nut, bolt, screw and wire in a project they are building comes from” and certify that it does not have any ties to China or to Russia.
Costa said gutting these policies will lead to increased energy costs for American customers. A study from Clean Energy Buyers Association analyzed the impact of removing just two clean energy tax credit programs, and found it would cause an average increase of 7% for residential electricity costs.
Part of the problem is an anticipated 2% energy demand increase nationwide, in 2025 and again in 2026, according to the EIA. Much of that energy demand is a result of battery manufacturing and data centers. 
Iowa alone has roughly 100 data centers, which is one of the largest concentrations in the midwest. 
“The near term additions to the grid are going to come from renewables, or they’re supposed to come from renewables under the current tax regime,” Costa said. “That is why you would see these consumer electricity price increases.”
A spokesperson for Alliant Energy, one of Iowa’s utility companies with significant investments in solar and wind energy, said the company is monitoring the bill. 
A spokesperson for MidAmerican Energy declined to comment on the pending legislation. 
Earlier this year, NextEra Energy proposed restarting its Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear plant near Palo. A representative from the company did not answer questions about the impact the Republican-sponsored bill would have on the Iowa project. 
A study from The Nature Conservancy found that clean energy tax credits in Iowa alone would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa, if left intact through 2032. 
Repeal of the credits would also affect associated manufacturing companies, like those that make solar panel parts, or wind turbine blades. 
Analysis from Climate Power found 400,000 jobs nationwide would be in jeopardy without the tax credits supporting the expanding industry. 
Joe Zimsen, an Iowa resident with 10 years of construction experience in the wind industry, said the IRA created a “tremendous amount of hope” among his colleagues in the industry that has now “disintegrated” because of budget bill. 
Zimsen formerly worked on wind projects near Grinnell, but now works for Renew Energy as a construction manager for off-shore wind projects. He and his family still live in Iowa, and he urged Iowa senators to oppose the bill as it is currently written.
“This policy of killing offshore and onshore wind and solar energy is going to have tremendous detrimental effects and set us back another 10 to 15 years behind our competitors, like China and Europe,” Zimsen said. “We can’t afford to do that.”
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Tuesday that wind energy incentives have been at risk since 2015 when he worked to extend them, and he said he senators would try to find a “compromise” on them again, Radio Iowa reported.
But, the so-called, “big beautiful bill” comprises much more than just clean energy concerns, which Grassley said means one issue can’t “stand in the way” of the rest of the bill.
U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

The road leads to a site where an Australian company called Felix Gold could begin mining antimony. (Max Graham/Northern Journal)Alaska hasn’t produced antimony — a shiny mineral used in weapons, flame retardants and solar panels — in almost 40 years.
That could change this summer, according to the executives of a Texas company that has snatched up more than 35,000 acres of mining claims in Alaska.
Dallas-based U.S. Antimony Corp. is looking to the state as a new source of antimony for its smelter in Montana, the only plant in the United States that refines the mineral.
Alaska’s antimony, the company says, could help the U.S. overcome a recent ban on exports of the mineral from China, the world’s top antimony producer. Antimony is among several minerals — many of which are used in renewable energy — that the U.S. has sourced primarily from China and other countries in recent decades. Efforts to build more mines in the U.S. have accelerated amid worsening trade tensions and growing demand.
With no active antimony mines, the U.S. in recent years has imported roughly 60% of its antimony from China. Meanwhile, need for the mineral has surged as antimony-laden arms flow to wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.
The price of the mineral has quadrupled in the past year, rising from around $13,000 to $55,000 per ton.
U.S. Antimony is now expanding its Montana smelter and rushing to find more ore to supply it. Alaska is its “primary focus” for boosting production, an executive said in an interview last week.
In the past eight months, a U.S. Antimony subsidiary, Great Land Minerals, has acquired claims in three different areas of Alaska’s Interior: outside Fairbanks; near the small town of Tok; and along the Maclaren River off the Denali Highway, a scenic road that runs outside the national park.
U.S. Antimony says it’s looking to truck antimony ore some 2,000 miles from Alaska to its processing plant in Montana. That operation could start as soon as September, executives said on a recent call with investors.
“We can’t get that antimony from Alaska to Montana fast enough,” Joe Bardswich, U.S. Antimony’s chief mining officer, said on the call.

The company’s plans coincide with a separate effort by an Australian company to start up its own small-scale antimony mine near Fairbanks.
Felix Gold is seeking to restart production this year at a long-shuttered antimony mine that sits within a few miles of a residential subdivision, Hattie Creek.
The company also is eyeing prospects near the hamlet of Ester on the outskirts of Fairbanks — where U.S. Antimony’s subsidiary has claims, too.
The potential developments are generating a mix of responses locally.
Some residents worry about environmental impacts of mining and its potential to transform tranquil Fairbanks-area neighborhoods into noisy industrial sites.
“I don’t want to be all NIMBY. But it literally is my backyard,” said Lisbet Norris, who lives in Hattie Creek, about 10 miles north of downtown Fairbanks. “It’s just so close.”
Norris, a dog musher, runs sled tours on trails that cross Felix Gold’s claims on state land, and she’s concerned that mining might impede her business. She’s also worried about heavy industrial use of the dirt road that connects her neighborhood — and Felix Gold’s potential operations — to the rest of town.
Other Fairbanks residents, however, say they support mining in the area; some cite the town’s early history as a gold mining town and the potential economic benefits of new mines.
“It’s because of mining that Fairbanks is what it is,” said Roger Burggraf, a local prospector who owns some of the claims that Felix Gold has leased to study the feasibility of antimony mining.

Burggraf said he understands the concerns of people who live near gold and antimony prospects. But when they bought their properties, “they should have realized that if a mine developed, that might change their lifestyle,” he added.
Felix Gold has a permit only for mineral exploration, not active mining.
The company aims later this year to apply for additional state permits, and to finish studying the profitability of developing a small antimony mine near the Hattie Creek subdivision.
U.S. Antimony also has applied only for a permit to search for antimony, though it hopes to apply for more permits and start mining within a year. If its exploration efforts show a mine would be profitable, it would propose an underground operation, said Rodney Blakestad, U.S. Antimony’s vice president of mining.
The footprint would be small, more similar to the family-run placer mines in the area than to a large-scale hardrock mine, according to Blakestad.
“We’re not Fort Knox,” he said, referring to Fairbanks’ huge open pit gold mine.
But before U.S. Antimony begins mining, it wants to buy antimony ore from existing placer gold mines.
Antimony often appears alongside more-valuable gold, and gold miners have typically thrown it aside.
Now that antimony prices are surging, though, U.S. Antimony representatives say every little bit is valuable. A 25-ton truck could carry some $600,000 worth of minerals, Bardswich said in an interview.
That means small loads of antimony ore from shallow, exploratory trenches that the company intends to dig at its Alaska prospects this summer also could be worth driving 2,000 miles to the Montana smelter, company executives said.
In the meantime, they intend to launch an advertising campaign to share their interest in buying the mineral from placer miners.
“People don’t realize this: Gold is not the best mineral to be mining, if you’re looking for really good value,” said Blakestad. “Antimony is.”

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois’ latest budget misses the mark in several key areas, according to one independent nonprofit fiscal analyst.

State lawmakers sent Gov. JB Pritzker a $55.2 billion budget on May 31 that raises $1 billion in new revenue and increases spending by more than $2 billion in fiscal year 2026 compared to the current year.

But the head of one of Chicago’s top nonpartisan government research organizations said lawmakers made too many short-term decisions to balance the budget in fiscal year 2026 that could make future fiscal years more challenging.

“It’s an incomplete budget,” Civic Federation President Jose Ferguson told Capitol News Illinois. “It does not add in any meaningful way to discuss any structural issues the state has. It’s a maintenance budget.”

Ferguson said a key reason for that is at least $271 million in fund sweeps used to balance the general revenue fund. Fund sweeps occur when lawmakers dip into lesser-known and underutilized funds outside the main general fund to use as a source of revenue for the fiscal year. This year’s budget also pauses several transfers to keep certain dollars available in the general fund for use this year.

For example, the budget calls for pausing the final transfer of motor fuel sales tax revenue to the road fund. The move would free up $171 million of general fund spending in FY26, but delays putting that money toward road construction projects.

“It's not balanced on gimmicks,” House Speaker Chris Welch, D-Hillside, told Capitol News Illinois for the latest episode of the “Illinois Lawmakers” program. “It's balanced based on revenues and expenditures, and it's based on what we know. We passed a budget based on what we knew at the time, and we weren't going to pass the budget with cuts alone.”

The FY26 budget would also suspend the monthly transfer to the “rainy day” fund for one year, freeing up $45 million for general fund use.

“It’s absolutely a mistake,” Ferguson said, calling that decision “troubling.”

The “rainy day” fund should continue to grow over time, he said, especially “knowing that we are going to need to go to some last-case resorts in all likelihood when we understand the federal impact and when we approach the transit issues as well, and this was not the moment to go to that well.”

The fund is still expected to grow from interest income and cannabis revenue in FY26.

Lawmakers used some of the fund sweeps to give the governor authority over a new $100 million “emergency” fund to plug unforeseen budget shortfalls.

Pritzker argued at a news conference after the budget passed that the state’s “structural” deficit – or the gap between ongoing spending and baseline revenues – has improved since he took office in 2019.

“We're diminishing the one-time expenditures that we have to make,” Pritzker said. “So we've gotten, really, much closer than ever before to balancing that structural deficit.”

Relying on fund sweeps will only make budgeting more challenging if a crisis arrives, Ferguson said.

“Everyone acknowledges that it is all but certain that there are additional things that are going to need to be attended to in the coming months,” Ferguson said.

An eye on Congress

New action from Congress that punches holes in state budgets, coupled with the state’s public transportation fiscal cliff, could be a wake-up call for lawmakers, Ferguson said.

The U.S. House has already passed a domestic policy plan that would shift more cost of government programs to states, cut Medicaid funding and phase out clean energy tax credits. The Senate is expected to make changes to the legislation, but President Donald Trump wants to sign the bill into law by July 4.

While many components may not hit Illinois’ budget this year, state lawmakers are watching for any changes that could require them to return to Springfield and adjust the FY26 budget.

“We have told the caucus to stand on the ready,” Welch said. State lawmakers boosted spending in the FY26 budget for safety net hospitals and federally qualified health centers, but the state wouldn’t be able to absorb major federal cuts to Medicaid.

“We got some room in there to be able to respond, but it’s hard to prepare when you don’t know exactly what’s coming down the pipe,” House budget leader Rep. Kam Buckner, D-Chicago, said during a news conference Thursday with the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

House Republican Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, was less worried Congress will cut Medicaid and other key benefits.

“After conversations with the Illinois delegation, I don’t feel that there’s going to be any concerns with cuts that are important in our Medicaid budget,” McCombie told Capitol News Illinois.

Last-minute budgeting

Democrats unveiled a more than 3,300-page spending plan about 24 hours before it passed the General Assembly, while the $1 billion tax plan was filed about five hours before lawmakers took a vote.

Ferguson, the Civic Federation president, criticized the legislative process that gives lawmakers and the public little time to review the budget’s contents.

“It was chaotic, nontransparent – nontransparent even to the legislators that had to vote on it – and not really the way that we want to go about this business, especially at a sensitive time,” he said.

A group of conservative lawmakers also contended the process was illegal in a lawsuit filed this week in Sangamon County. The Illinois Freedom Caucus argues that the budget amendments were not read on three separate days in each chamber of the General Assembly, which they say violates the state constitution.

The constitution states a bill “shall be read by title on three different days in each house,” but does not specify that each amendment to a bill receive the same.

Each of the bills were read on three separate days this spring in both chambers, even though the substantial amendment containing the budget was filed in the final hours. For example, the bill lawmakers used to raise $1 billion of revenue was originally filed to establish an Emmitt Till commemorative day. The bill met the three readings requirement in both chambers before the Emmitt Till Day provision was removed in the final hours of session in favor of the tax plan.

The constitution also states that it’s up to the House speaker and Senate president to “certify that the procedural requirements for passage have been met.”

In applying what’s known as the “enrolled bill doctrine,” the Supreme Court has consistently declined to infringe on the legislature’s authority to certify its own bills, due to separation of powers concerns. It has also consistently upheld broad authority for the General Assembly to gut the original contents of a bill and amend it with a new subject, making the lawsuit a long shot.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Immigrants being held inside a federal prison in northeast Kansas and their attorneys reported an unsanitary, inequitable and unhealthy environment that has left people, even those who have won their immigration cases, deprived of basic needs.
Based on interviews with people inside the prison and attorneys representing those people, immigrants face unsanitary and crowded living quarters, extended lockdowns, delayed and costly medical treatment, restricted contact with their families, and no access to religious services. 
In some cases, these conditions have led to suicide attempts.
“These aren’t criminals,” said Michael Sharma-Crawford, a local immigration attorney and chair of the Kansas and Missouri chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “In theory, none of these people deserves to be in jail.”
A pair of letters — one sent to the warden of the Leavenworth Federal Correctional Institution complaining of a rat infestation and another sent to the warden, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Prisons — detail conditions that are “well below” what is required of the federal agencies.
Attorneys and advocates claim in the letters, sent May 5 and May 29, that a “significant number” of people remain imprisoned at Leavenworth despite having won their immigration cases, which often fall under civil law, not criminal. Some cannot return to their countries of origin because, upon return, they could face torture or violence.
While the possibility of securing release for people facing deportation is low, Sharma-Crawford said ensuring they are held within legal standards could be done.
Leavenworth, formerly the Fort Leavenworth Military Prison, is one of two facilities in the state currently used to detain immigrants.
In February, ICE and the Bureau of Prisons agreed to hold immigrants at Leavenworth. A separate facility in Leavenworth, a shuttered prison owned by private company CoreCivic, was planned to reopen and detain immigrants as well, but a judge blocked the company from doing so Wednesday based on local zoning rules.
Sharma-Crawford said he has heard anecdotes about ICE officials in and around Chicago driving across the region, including to Kansas and Missouri, frantically trying to find a place to hold people.
More than 1,300 men are typically held in the medium-security prison, and about 220 are held in a minimum security “satellite camp.” At least 80 immigrants are being held at Leavenworth, according to the letter.
Randilee Giamusso, a spokeswoman for the prison bureau, declined to comment on the letter’s claims but confirmed the bureau received the letter.
“The Federal Bureau of Prisons is committed to ensuring the safety and security of all inmates in our population, our staff, and the public. We have received the letter,” Giamusso wrote in an email. “However, we do not comment on matters related to pending litigation,  legal proceedings, or investigations.”
Media officials at ICE did not respond to requests seeking a comment.
 
Life without sunlight
“Several immigrants” at Leavenworth experienced such a depression from extended lockdown periods, which sometimes lasted 20 hours at a time for three days straight, that they attempted suicide, said the May 29 letter signed by a collection of six civil rights organizations and attorney groups.
After their suicide attempts, they were reportedly put in solitary confinement.
“One detainee who witnessed a suicide attempt has felt depressed and fearful during subsequent lockdowns,” the letter said, “but has been afraid to report his mental health symptoms to staff for fear that he, too, will be removed from the unit and will be placed in solitary confinement.”
Another representative of the prison bureau declined to confirm or deny the letter’s claims about suicide attempts in Leavenworth.
Karla Juarez, executive director of Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation, said in a news release that the conditions at Leavenworth are horrifying.
“What’s happening at FCI Leavenworth is not only a violation of ICE’s own policies — it’s a violation of our shared humanity,” she said.“These are people who have already won their immigration cases and who should be free with their families, not locked in overcrowded cells without access to medical care or even sunlight.”
People serving sentences from criminal convictions at Leavenworth are able to use the prison’s outdoor yard for recreation and exercise. Those in ICE’s custody are not, despite that being a condition of the two agencies’ collaboration.
The agreement between the federal agencies said: “ICE detainees will have access to education and psychology materials, leisure and law libraries, and indoor and outdoor recreation.”
Reports from inside the prison have found that people being held for immigration reasons have access to none of these things.
Plus, a pervasive language barrier has created a hurdle for immigrants in the prison who say their basic needs aren’t being met, the letter said.
Those imprisoned for crimes and in immigration cases both report that they usually do not encounter prison staff who speak Spanish, the letter said. One person who only speaks Spanish said he wasn’t offered a translator when given medical care. Another, who only speaks Russian, said his requests for medical assistance have gone unanswered for months.
Access to prescribed medications, dental care, mental health care and medical care has been delayed, the letter said, and “when they are seen by staff for treatment, they are not provided with proper care and are instructed to pay for medication, which is in violation of ICE policy.”
The letter concludes with a list of 14 recommendations. The foremost suggestion demands the release of all detained immigrants who have won their immigration cases. Others included providing free and timely medical care, interpretation services, free and private confidential calls with attorneys, access to a chaplain, free printing from the prison law library, recreational services, and outdoor time.
 
The ‘rodent letter’
In early May, the Kansas Federal Public Defenders wrote to Crystal Carter, the prison warden, and Nathan Atkinson, a general attorney for the prison bureau, about a months-long rat infestation in Leavenworth that showed “no signs of abating.”
“Rats have infested the housing area,” said the letter, obtained by Kansas Reflector, “Clients report rats stealing commissary and finding rat feces in their food, as well as finding dead rats in the common areas.”
The federal defenders saw and heard rats during visits with their clients. The letter outlined the health and safety hazards associated with such infestations, arguing that allowing the rodents to remain could degrade conditions so much so that it amounts to a constitutional violation.
Often, in-person visits are the attorneys’ only options, they said in the letter. They called video visits “problematic” because clients are frequently brought into video visitation rooms late, or the wrong person is brought in, or all the rooms are full, so visits have to be done in a common area.
Carter, the warden, stated in a May 13 response obtained by Kansas Reflector that the prison had cleaned infested areas and implemented pest control measures, including regular inspections, baiting, and setting traps.
A person who was detained in Leavenworth earlier this year described the prison to civil rights groups and attorneys as “very dirty.”
“We didn’t have any cleaning supplies. Food was the hardest part because it wasn’t a pleasant meal. There was no way to wash clothes. We only had one uniform, and that was it,” said the man, who was unnamed in a press release from the ACLU of Kansas. “Honestly, the time we were locked up in the cell was the worst. We had no communication with our families, and they didn’t comply with the necessary resources.”
While both letters make claims that the federal agencies are breaking the law, attorneys and advocates have not filed a lawsuit or an official complaint. If proper conditions for immigrants cannot be ensured, that’s when they could go to court, said Sharma-Crawford, the immigration attorney.
At one point, immigration officials and courts would allow leniency for immigrants with open cases who were in good standing, Sharma-Crawford said
“That grace is gone,” he said. “That humanity is gone.”
Eunice Cho, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, said the Trump administration should cease the use of federal prisons to detain immigrants.
“Holding people in extended lockdown, and denying them access to adequate medical care, legal counsel, and even sunlight isn’t just inhumane,” Cho said. “It’s illegal.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/U.S.-Penitentiary-Leavenworth-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-06 16:09:06.577566

Jim Carlin, shown here at a rally in October 2021, has launched a Republican campaign for U.S. senator.  (Photo by Katie Akin/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Former state legislator Jim Carlin, a Republican, announced he is running for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat in the upcoming election — the latest candidate this week to announce their plans to run in 2026.
Carlin, who served in the Iowa Senate from 2017 through 2023 and previously in the Iowa House, is running for the seat currently held by U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst. Since his time in the Iowa Legislature, Carlin went on to found the Iowa Liberty Network, an organization focused on recruiting and electing “constitutional conservative” candidates in state government and other public offices.
In an interview with the Iowa Capital Dispatch, Carlin said Ernst is not reflecting Iowa Republicans’ values in Congress. He pointed to the Heritage Action scorecard for Ernst from the 2023 session, when she received a 42% score on how often her votes aligned with conservative goals. He pointed to her support for money to aid Ukraine in its war against Russia and her vote in favor of the Respect for Marriage Act as examples of Ernst not voting in line with conservative values.

Carlin said Ernst has not delivered on her commitment “make ’em squeal” by cutting federal spending, as well as promises to work to repeal the Affordable Care Act and 2014 campaign statement that she would only serve two terms in the U.S. Senate.
“The people of Iowa can judge whether or not she’s keeping those promises,” Carlin said. “And I believe that when they … evaluate it, when they look at her voting record and the decisions she’s made as a sitting senator, that they will come to the conclusion that she doesn’t represent them well in terms of the things they want to see done and the things that they believe in.”
Bryan Kraber, Ernst’s 2026 campaign manager, pointed to Carlin’s failed primary bid against U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley in the 2022 election. “Good luck trying to take on this combat veteran,” Kraber said in a statement Friday. “Senator Ernst has a proven record of conservative leadership—cutting waste, securing the border, and making Washington squeal to keep Iowans’ hard-earned money in their own pockets. And she delivers for our families, farmers, and veterans. Iowans already saw through Carlin’s last failed campaign, and they’ll reject his desperate attempt at relevance again in 2026.”
Though Carlin and Ernst are battling on conservative bonafides, much of the conversation centered on the upcoming race has focused on Ernst’s town hall statement that “we are all going to die” last week during talks on the funding cuts to Medicaid included in the budget reconciliation bill passed by the U.S. House. Carlin said he supports President Donald Trump’s spending goals and believes cuts that should be made to federal programs but “her handling of that showed a lack of judgment.”
“You don’t flippantly say to people, ‘well, we’re all going to die,'” Carlin said. “That actually kind of reminds me of Hillary Clinton’s statement, ‘what difference does it make,’ on the other side of Benghazi when people died. I thought it was really inappropriate.”
Iowa Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, announced Monday he would compete for the Democratic nomination, saying he “just can’t sit on the sidelines” following the Senator’s comments.
Scholten and Nathan Sage, a Mason City Democrat, are the only Democrats to have officially joined the race, but other potential Democratic candidates also weighed in on Ernst’s comments this week. State Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, who has expressed interested in a run, said “it is of course true that we are all going to die, but our Senators shouldn’t be the ones killing us” in response to Ernst’s comments.
State Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, is also weighing a bid for the seat. Turek joined a call with Protect Our Care Iowa, an organization advocating for health care access through programs like Medicaid, on Thursday and said the proposal to reduce Medicaid spending by $625 billion in the next decade and implement work requirements will prevent more people with disabilities from accessing needed care.
Republicans supporting the “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill have repeatedly stated people with disabilities and complex medical conditions as well other protected populations, like minors, seniors, parents of dependent children and pregnant people will not be subject to work requirements or taken off the program.
But Turek said as a person with a disability who has worked for an organization assessing and providing mobility devices, he has extensive experience with how funding cuts and moves like Iowa’s Medicaid privatization have limited access to needed health care and services for Iowans with disabilities. The state legislator said he went to Washington, D.C., to speak with all members of Iowa’s federal delegation about how the proposed changes will hurt people in need.
“I talked to them specifically about this bill and about the cuts to Medicaid, and additionally about what they’re looking at doing on grant funding,” Turek said. “And we’re looking at 140 organizations and groups here in Iowa, disability services — beyond just Medicaid, that are looking at losing all of their funding in some cases, or 50%, 25%. They cannot plead ignorance. They know exactly what this bill is. It’s a tax break to the richest, most wealthy Americans off the backs of the poorest and the most vulnerable.”
Woman who shouted ‘people will die’ at Ernst town hall runs for Iowa House
Ernst’s comment also led to another campaign launch for the Iowa House. India May, the 33-year-old from Charles City who sparked Ernst’s comments on Medicaid during the Parkersburg town hall, is running for Iowa House District 58, currently represented by Republican Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City.
May, the Ionia Public Library director, is a county death investigator for Chickasaw County and registered nurse. She shouted “people will die” at Ernst during the public meeting.
“People are not — well, we all are going to die, so for heaven’s sake,” Ernst responded.
The day after the meeting, Ernst made an “apology video” filmed in a cemetery where she said she “made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this earth.”
“So I apologize, and I’m really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well,” Ernst said in the video. She also added that “for those that would like to see eternal and everlasting life, I encourage you to embrace my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.”
In a social media post responding to the video, May wrote that Ernst’s apology was “disingenuous and reinforced gaslighting and christofascism aimed toward her MAGA supporters.” She also used the platform to highlight her own run for office.
“In short, my response to Joni’s phoney apology is this: I don’t want to see another Iowan choose between medicine or food. It’s already happening and this bill will make it worse,” May wrote. “… Joni may be disappointed to know that I will continue to email her every day with my concerns, and that it is my intention to run as a progressive Democrat for Iowa House District 58, to undo the damage caused by the incumbent, Charley Thomson, who recently made headlines for targeting a nonprofit organization.”
May had referenced the directive sent by Thomson in his capacity as the House government oversight committee chair to the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, an immigrant rights organization, requesting information about the nonprofit organization’s clients, donors and members. An attorney for Iowa MMJ rejected the request in April, saying it was not legally valid.
Eddie Andrews joins governor’s race
Iowa Rep. Eddie Andrews launched his bid for Iowa governor Wednesday, running as a Republican for the seat that will be vacated by Gov. Kim Reynolds following the 2026 election.
Andrews, a Johnston Republican first elected in 2020, is one of the first GOP candidates to officially run in what is expected to be a crowded field. Former state Rep. Brad Sherman had announced he is running as a Republican gubernatorial candidate before Reynolds left the race. U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra and Iowa Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, have both launched exploratory committees for a gubernatorial campaign, and other high-profile Iowa Republicans like Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and House Speaker Pat Grassley have expressed interest but not made a decision on whether to run.
In a news release on his run, Andrews said his work as a state lawmaker shows why Iowans should back his campaign — he highlighted his support for “landowner rights” through supporting bills restricting the use of eminent domain in carbon sequestration pipeline projects, efforts to increase psychiatric residencies and provide more incentives to keep doctors in the state, as well as proposals to end sales tax on certain essential items.
As governor, Andrews said he wants to focus on improving Iowa’s education system, making mental health care more accessible, and pledged to “destroy the human trafficking industry in our state.”
“Iowa deserves a Governor who listens and delivers,” Andrews said in a statement. “My experience as a tech entrepreneur, minister and legislator prepares me to serve you.”
Democrat Julie Stauch, a longtime Iowa political operative, also launched her campaign for governor this week. Iowa Auditor Rob Sand is considered the frontrunner in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, though Stauch alongside Democrat Paul Dahl will be competing against him in the primary June 2, 2026.

(Photo courtesy David Eaton, Murray State athletics)
College baseball legend Ron Polk has told us again and again through the years: “There is no such thing as an upset in baseball.”
Polk is right, of course. Baseball contains so many variables: bad hops, sore arms, sudden wind gusts, line drives that find gloves, weakly hit ground balls that find holes, capricious umpiring, etc.  All that contributes to the fact that anything can happen on any given day in baseball. But if we don’t call them upsets, then what to call what we have seen happen again and again in the NCAA Baseball Tournament that continues today at sites other than Mississippi?

Rick Cleveland 
Keep in mind, we are watching college baseball in a new era when the richer schools in the elite power conferences can simply buy the best players from the smaller schools in lesser leagues. You would think the pay-for-play and the transfer portal would make it doubly hard for the Murray States, the UTSAs and the Wright States of the college baseball world to compete with the SEC and other power conferences.
But, yet, here we are. Samples:

Closest to home, Murray State, a 4-seed from the Missouri Valley Conference, comes to Oxford, knocks off Ole Miss twice and wins a regional, probably playing in front of more fans in two games than they played before in their entire regular season. Get this: The Murray State head coach Dan Skirka reportedly makes $68,000 a year. Many power conference players make that much and more. Mississippi State just signed Brian O’Connor to a contract that will pay him $2.9 million a year. Nevertheless, the Murray State Racers came off the bus in Oxford hitting line drives and never quit. They will play a Super Regional at Duke beginning Saturday. I would not bet against them.
No. 1 seed Vanderbilt was eliminated by Wright State of the Horizon League. Wright State eliminated the Commodores before eventually losing to Louisville in the championship game. For those who don’t know, Wright State is located in Dayton, Ohio. The Horizon League includes such name brands as Youngstown State, Robert Morris and Northern Kentucky. Vandy probably spends more money on one player than Wright State has in its entire NIL budget. Yet, here we are.
UTSA of the American Athletic Conference stunned mighty Texas, the No. 2 seed overall, beating the Longhorns not once, but twice, in the Austin Regional. Want to know the beauty of this? UTSA lost its best pitcher and its best everyday player to the portal last year. The shortstop went to Arizona State. The pitcher went to – you guessed it – Texas. UTSA coach Pat Hallmark, asked about the players who left said this: “We’re not here if those players are still here. We’re here because they left. … If they want to get in the portal, get in the portal. We’ll go after the next guy.”
A record 13 SEC teams made the tournament. Only four advanced. And one of those, LSU, had to rally from behind to beat Little Rock in the championship game after losing to Little Rock the day before. Little Rock of the Ohio Valley Conference entered the tournament with a losing record and an RPI of 243.

The guess here is that legions of college baseball fans, disgusted with what the transfer portal and NIL have done to college athletics, will find themselves pulling for teams such as Murray State and UTSA as the tournament continues. 
More than likely the eventual champion will come from the Big Boy leagues. Such powers as Arkansas, LSU, Tennessee and Florida State still remain. They all host Super Regionals. They have all the advantages. 
Murray State? 
Wouldn’t that be something?",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/06142729/Murray-Celebrates.jpg,,,2025-06-06 16:09:06.577566

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Controversy continues to swirl around the president designate of Florida A&M University with the latest dispute over Marva Johnson’s five- year contract and how she will earn her pay.
FAMU Board of Trustees Chair Kristin Harper said Friday Johnson’s contract puts the university at odds with the FAMU Foundation, which is responsible for providing most of the money in the contract. That’s because state law caps state contributions at $200,000 annually for presidential salaries.
FAMU Foundation’s board chair said it could not afford a $750,000 base salary, the Tallahassee Democrat reported, which is what Johnson requested.
The FAMU Foundation anticipated the new president’s salary would be $588,562, Harper said, reading from a letter from the foundation. 
The contract says the board “shall use its best efforts to cause the foundation to contribute to the university portions of all payments” beyond $200,000. That language concerns Harper, who said she is not sure trustees have the ability to make the foundation, a direct support organization of the university, do anything.
“I have concerns about the burden, the financial burden that this places on the university and the university’s inability to fund this sweetheart deal of sweetheart deals,” Harper said.

There was significant pushback among alumni to Johnson’s candidacy much of which was centered around Johnson’s political connections to former Gov. Rick Scott and Gov. Ron DeSantis. Alumni also cited the lack of higher education administration experience as a reason to reject. Johnson.
Despite the opposition the FAMU Board of Trustees voted 8-4 last month to select Johnson its next president. Harper voted against selecting Johnson. After the trustees approved Johnson, the board voted to put FAMU trustee Nicole Washington in charge of negotiating the contract. At the time, Harper said she was offended.
The pick to run Florida’s only public HBCU is an ally to top Florida Republicans

On Friday Washington disagreed with Harper’s assessment about the foundation’s ability to pay.
“It’s my understanding that the foundation will be required to amend their budget to accommodate this expense,” Washington said. 
“Required is quite a strong word,” Harper replied.
Washington on Friday stood by the contract she negotiated, which was ultimately approved with an 8-3 vote.
“I compare this process to, similar to, buying a house. I still regret not buying a house back in 2017 when the median home price in Florida was $237[,000]. In 2025, that median price is $389,400, a 60% increase. The market has changed,” Washington said, calling the contract “competitive yet balanced.”
Johnson is yet to be approved by the Board of Governors. If approved, her contract would take effect Aug. 1.
Total compensation would be about $840,000 in the first year and rises up to about $981,000 in the final year.
Comparing the contract to other historically Black colleges and universities, the FAMU contract rises above the average HBCU contracts that search consultants evaluated of $446,094. The average of other institutions with a similar research capacity as FAMU is $617,021, according to consultants. 
Trustee Craig Reed took issue with the size of the contract compared to former President Larry Robinson, whose total salary was $591,669 in his last year.
“I find it highly difficult to approve a contract that significantly exceeds, essentially, what we paid our previous president that had significant experience as a sitting president and as a faculty member in a higher ed institution,” Reed said.
Compared to other State University institutions, FAMU’s package would land it below the 50th percentile in the first year, which is $899,644. 
The contract also provides Johnson a spot as a faculty member at the FAMU college of law after her presidency. 
Priorities
One concern voiced by some trustees and a pack of people during public comment, was whether the contract prioritizes retention rather than performance.
The five-year contract would start Johnson at a base salary of $650,000 with a 3% annual increase. 
The contract provides annual performance compensation of $86,000, if the board deems her performance worthy. For comparison, the recently negotiated University of Florida contract would’ve provided Santa Ono with a 20% performance bonus. Johnson’s performance bonus would be approximately 13% of her salary.
Her contract provides a $150,000 annual retention payment, able to be cashed out after the three and five-year marks. The retention bonus would be approximately 23% of her annual base salary.
“I’m just concerned, you know, about what matters more to this board: Occupying a seat or delivering outcomes for student success?” Harper said, adding that she would prefer that performance and retention were swapped. 
Trustee Zayla Bryant, a student, stood with Harper.
“And with that only being less than half of what her retention payment would be, I feel like that sets a clear standard or sets a clear indicator that her presence is more important than her performance,” Bryant said. 
But Washington countered that the two are intertwined.
“It’s interesting that you see that as an ‘either or.’ I see that as a ‘both and.’ In order for the president to remain for three years would require that she has performed over that time,” Washington responded, adding that “This is not a contract that anybody is going to get just for sitting in the seat.”

(Photo via Google Earth)A female resident of a Coralville care facility wandered from the home earlier this year and was later found at a Nebraska truck stop 265 miles away.
The incident occurred in January at Community NeuroRehab’s Glen Oaks facility in Coralville, a state-licensed, five-bed residential care facility for people with mental or developmental disabilities.
Newly disclosed state records show that a worker at the facility told state inspectors on May 14, 2025, that she was working the morning shift at 9:40 a.m. on Jan. 2, 2025, when she checked on a resident who was due for her medication.

The resident, who had previously been diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury, dementia and psychological issues, was not in her room. The worker discovered a bent window screen underneath the bed, and in looking out the window she saw a footprint on top of an air-conditioning unit directly under the window. It was snowing at the time, and the temperature was around 22 degrees.
The staff then launched a search for the woman in the community. Shortly after 5 p.m., the resident’s mother called the facility to report that her daughter had been found, confused and frightened, 265 miles away at a truck stop in Gretna, Nebraska.
According to state inspectors’ reports, the woman had “hitched a ride from a semi-driver who drove her to Nebraska.”
In their written report, state inspectors said the woman had “engaged in some type of sexual activity,” as determined by the medical provider she saw on Jan. 3, 2025, “resulting in a very traumatic 24 hours.” A review of lab work revealed that testing for sexually transmitted infections was negative, the inspectors reported.
A worker at the home allegedly told inspectors she had been trained to check and make sure each resident was present at the beginning of her shift but acknowledged she had not done so on Jan. 2, 2025.
Inspectors concluded the resident had walked 2.3 miles through a mostly residential neighborhood to an interstate highway and then hitched a ride where she appeared to have been picked up by the driver of a semi-truck.
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing recently fined Community NeuroRehab $3,000 for resident-safety violations related to the incident.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An ousted member of the state’s top school board will lead the process to approve K-12 textbooks that align with controversial new academic standards for social studies.
Former Oklahoma State Board of Education member Kendra Wesson will continue as the chair of a key committee that chooses all state-approved textbooks for public schools. She has been State Superintendent Ryan Walters’ designee to lead the committee since she joined the state Board of Education in January 2023.
“​Serving in this role and being able to still help my state is what it’s all about, right?” Wesson said. “It’s not about (having my) name in lights. It’s about doing the serving and coming in and being who I am and consistently being who I am. So, I value it very much.”
Wesson, of Norman, said she brings high integrity to the role and has enjoyed the committee and its staff, so “it meant a lot to me to be able to stay here.”
A spokesperson for Walters’ office did not immediately return a request for comment on the superintendent’s designee and the coming textbook adoption cycle.

Gov. Kevin Stitt replaced three state Board of Education members, including Wesson, on Feb. 11 while complaining the board had fallen victim to “needless political drama.” The three removed members had voted with Walters to advance a now-defeated proposal to have public schools collect students’ immigration status, an idea Stitt opposed.
Wesson and the State Textbook Committee gathered Friday for an orientation meeting to initiate the 2025-26 adoption cycle, a process that determines which textbooks the state will approve for the next six years. The committee last met Feb. 7 to conclude the 2024-25 cycle.
Like with the state Board of Education, the governor appoints all members of the 13-member textbook committee except for one — the state superintendent, who can choose a designee to serve as the committee’s chair in his place.
The committee, mostly made up of educators, will receive sample products by July 1 from textbook publishers interested in selling to Oklahoma school districts. The number of companies bidding in the small-market state has dwindled in recent years while political debates over classroom content grew. 
After the July 1 deadline, teams of subject-matter experts will begin quality reviews of the submitted learning material in August before making recommendations to the textbook committee, said Carolynn Bristow, project manager of educational materials for the Oklahoma State Department of Education.

The process culminates in the committee’s Nov. 14 vote to approve a list of textbooks aligning with the newly enacted standards for social studies education. The committee also will vote on instructional materials for personal financial literacy courses. The state will execute contracts with publishers in February after the board’s final meeting of the adoption cycle.
Wesson said the committee will follow the typical textbook adoption process and doesn’t anticipate any differences from previous cycles.
The committee and its review teams will adhere to a pre-approved rubric to evaluate textbook materials, she said.
The rubric checks for classroom usability and compliance with state academic standards. Last year, the committee also added social and moral questions to the rubric asking whether the submitted materials “degrade traditional roles of men and women,” promote “illegal lifestyles” or neglect the importance of religion in preserving American liberties.
“We have a great team here at (the state Education Department) that keeps us on track, and that’s why that rubric is there, to keep everybody on the same page,” Wesson said. “And so you will always find this committee, especially, following that process.”
The new social studies standards, which dictate what public schools must teach to students in history and government classes, have been the source of significant public scrutiny this year.

The standards now require schools to educate students about biblical teachings and Judeo-Christian values that influenced the American colonies and founding fathers, which Walters has said is crucial to ensuring students understand the full context of the country’s history. 
Language casting doubt on the integrity of the 2020 presidential election results also is required teaching.
Stitt’s three new appointees to the state Board of Education said they were unaware of the 2020 election language at the time they voted on the standards on Feb. 27. Walters said he is responsible for adding the new content, but he didn’t acknowledge it until weeks after the board vote.
Despite bipartisan concerns among the state Legislature, the Republican supermajority in the state House and Senate permitted the standards to take effect. A lawsuit in Oklahoma County District Court contends Walters’ administration failed to uphold proper transparency procedures.
Wesson said the State Textbook Committee won’t have any issues finding textbooks that align with the new social studies standards, even with the new content that has made headlines.
“We’re not going to have a problem there at all,” she said.

(Getty image)Attention voters in Central Falls and Rhode Island’s Senate District 4: The deadline to register to vote or change your affiliation to participate in special city and legislative elections is days away.
Voters have until 4 p.m. on Sunday, June 8, to register or change party affiliation ahead of the July 8 Democratic Senate District 4 primary and a special city election in Central Falls. Forms can be completed online at vote.ri.gov, or by mailing or dropping off a paper form at your municipal board of canvassers office.
In Senate District 4, spanning North Providence and a small section of Providence, four Democrats have signaled their intent to run for the open seat left vacant after former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio died in April. There is also one Republican and one independent who have declared they are running, and will compete in an Aug. 5 general election.
Senate candidates must submit nomination forms with 100 valid signatures from voters by June 10 to have their name appear on the ballot.
Central Falls will hold special elections — without a primary —  on July 8 for an open seat on the City Council alongside a ballot question over changes to the structure of the city school board. One candidate, Anthony Solano, will appear on the ballot for the open City Council District 4 seat, having already submitted the required signatures by the May 7 deadline. 
Close behind the registration deadline is a second key date for primary voters: The deadline to apply for a mail ballot. Applications are already available online, due back no later than 4 p.m. June 17. Applications sent by mail must be postmarked by the Aug. 20 deadline. 
Another special election is slated for Aug. 5 in Coventry to decide two seats on the Coventry Town Council. Three candidates — Richard Houle, Kathy Farwell and Robert Delellis — have declared their intent to run in the nonpartisan race, for which there is no primary. Coventry voters have until Sunday, July 6, to register to vote.
More information on upcoming election dates and deadlines for voters and candidates is available on the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s website.

Wyoming’s lone congressperson wants to codify Trump’s push to require English proficiency among drivers. Reaction was mixed among truckers on I-80.
The post Hageman wants to crack down on truckers’ English. Drivers are split over whether it’s needed. appeared first on WyoFile .","In a state where the vast majority of residents are white, the truck stops along Wyoming’s 400 miles of Interstate 80 stand out as racial and linguistic melting pots. 
Among the idling semi-trucks and in the lounge areas where people wait their turn at a shower, drivers speak to each other or into phones in Russian, Spanish, Nepali, Hindi and more. 
To some, including President Donald Trump and supporters of his Make America Great Again political movement, these roadside Babels represent a troubling trend — an increasing number of truck drivers who don’t speak English as a first language — and a public safety threat. 
Over the last two months, the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers, including Wyoming Rep. Harriet Hageman, have moved to take truck drivers who don’t speak a certain level of English off the road.
Federal law has long required commercial truck drivers to possess a certain level of English proficiency. But in 2016, the federal government issued guidance that while drivers could be cited if a law enforcement officer found they failed to meet that requirement, they could also drive on. 
On April 28, Trump reversed that policy and instituted a new crackdown. Beginning June 25, Wyoming Highway Patrol officers, along with their counterparts in other states, will work under new guidelines that call for them to test the English of drivers they interact with if they suspect a lack of language proficiency. Drivers could face those tests if pulled over on suspicion of a traffic offense, or during inspections that sometimes occur at weigh stations and the state’s port-of-entry facilities. 
If drivers fail the roadside test, they’ll be taken out of service — forced to park their truck until a different driver can reach Wyoming and take the wheel. Among immigrant truck drivers, that burdensome consequence has raised concerns about the arbitrariness of patrol officers and inspectors conducting language exams. 
Hageman has championed the issue, and this month announced her cosponsorship of legislation to codify Trump’s executive order into law — meaning a future president couldn’t just relax the enforcement requirement again.
A spokesperson for Hageman did not respond to an email requesting an interview with Wyoming’s lone representative. 
Trucker response
It’s a crackdown drawing mixed reactions among truck drivers passing through Wyoming. 
“I’m a native Russian speaker, but I feel it was my obligation to learn English,” Grey Kiroff, who has been driving trucks in the United States since 2002, told a WyoFile reporter Wednesday, after stepping down from his cab at Love’s Travel Stop outside Laramie. 
“This is an absolute necessity, it’s not just a good idea,” he said. 
But others considered the new emphasis on English proficiency another prong in the Trump administration’s assault on the country’s immigrant workers. 
“I have seen people who don’t speak English do this job really well,” one driver, who said he’d immigrated to the United States but declined to share his name or country of origin, told WyoFile. Lacking English proficiency is “not a barrier” to safe driving, the driver said, speaking to WyoFile next to his truck while stopped at the Akal Travel Center 20 miles further west. 
Another driver there, who spoke to a reporter in Spanish, said he could not converse in English but was perfectly capable of reading road signs. He also declined to share his name, as did several opponents of the Trump administration’s rule change, saying they did not want to draw attention to themselves.
Tightening the language requirement, the Spanish-speaking driver said, would hurt an economy that depended on many immigrant drivers.

Nearly every truck driver interviewed by WyoFile agreed people need to be able to read road signage to some degree — particularly in Wyoming and the Mountain West, where signs identify steep grades or warn of inclement weather. 
“The hills are messed up,” Ron Brown, a driver from Pennsylvania, said. “If guys don’t know how to read the signs, they’re not even going to drop the Jake.” Brown was referring to using the engine brake on a long downslope, which can keep a truck from blowing its brakes and beginning an out-of-control descent.    
“I don’t feel that it’s racist, I feel that it’s necessary,” Kim Starr, a driver from California, said. 
But drivers disagreed on whether significant numbers of truckers were on the road, who couldn’t hit that threshold of English proficiency.
Inside the Akal travel center, reputed for a small restaurant churning out Indian cuisine, an employee said the many drivers he interacts with all have a sufficient grasp of English. Long-distance truck drivers crash because they’re using their phones or watching videos while driving, or they’re intoxicated, or they fall asleep at the wheel, said the employee, who gave his first name as Jamal but declined to share a last name.
“It’s not about the language,” Jamal said. “It’s all politics.”
Roadside test
Wyoming Highway Patrol officials provided WyoFile with a copy of the new testing rules, issued May 20 by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The new regulation calls for officers to first ask drivers a series of questions, such as “how long have you been driving today?” or “did you perform your pre-trip inspection before you started driving today?”
If officers decide someone is unable to respond well enough to those questions in English, they can take the driver out of service, preventing them from traveling on. If the drivers pass that portion of the test, however, officers are also directed to quiz the driver on traffic signs. 
The guidance obtained by WyoFile includes 37 images of highway signs. Officers are instructed to quiz drivers on four of them — and drivers must properly identify at least three to pass the test. 
Officers can pick from a set of signs that vary widely, from a simple speed limit sign to a sign stating “trucks over 10 tons must enter weigh station next right.” 
In Wyoming, troopers will escort a truck driver who fails the test, if it’s administered along the side of the highway, to the next good stopping point, Lt. Colonel Karl Germain told WyoFile.
Immigrant truck drivers are concerned about the potential for bias as state troopers and inspectors are given the power to determine a legal level of English. “Accents, cultural differences, or imperfect grammar should not be a reason to end someone’s career,” an online petition calling for federal regulators to rethink Trump’s executive order states. The petition had more than 7,500 signatures as of Friday. It also notes that with just 60 days from order to implementation, truck drivers and companies haven’t had time to prepare for the English tests. 
“We all contribute to this country, and we all deserve equal respect on the road,” the petition, which does not note an author, says.

Long-standing industry instability and legitimate public safety concerns are mixing with the current political climate, University of Minnesota economics professor and former long-haul truck driver Stephen Burks told WyoFile. Trucking companies have become places of high turnover, where drivers are worn down by firms’ desires to keep them on the road and away from home for long periods, coupled with often low pay, Burks, who studies the industry with an emphasis on labor economics, said.
Amid those pressures, and amid the impacts of free-trade agreements that allowed Canadian and Mexican drivers into the country in increasing numbers, American truck drivers have long worried about immigrants who accept lower pay and companies that skirt rules to bring in cheaper drivers. Companies that might bend the rules on foreign drivers are also likely to worry less about regulations that increase driver and motorist safety, Burks said. 
Regulating drivers’ English addresses those various anxieties.
“This English proficiency thing is kind of a new variant on the same concern, and it naturally meshes for the Trump folks with the anti-immigrant sentiment,” he said. “Is there a legitimate underlying issue? Yes, there is. I can not tell you how big it is.”
Connor’s Law 
Supporters of the crackdown, like Hageman, point to specific tragedies. The bill Hageman is cosponsoring is called Connor’s Law, and is named after Connor Dzion, an 18-year-old who was killed by a semi-truck driver in 2017, on Interstate 95 in Florida. I-95 is the principal north-south highway along the East Coast. 
Dzion’s family sued two truck companies, and a jury issued a $1 billion damage verdict after finding drivers for both companies were distracted and responsible for Dzion’s death. 
One driver, a Russian immigrant, created a mile-long traffic backup after crashing his tractor trailer, Jacksonville, Florida-based attorney Curry Pajcic, who litigated the case for the Dzions, told WyoFile. That driver was on drugs and watching pornography on a cell phone when he crashed, Pajcic said. 
Dzion, in a Toyota Corolla his parents gifted him on his 16th birthday, was the last car in the traffic backup. A second truck driver, an Indian immigrant to Canada who had been driving for 25 hours straight from Montreal, smashed into Dzion and killed him. 
That driver drove by multiple signs warning of stopped traffic, keeping “the hammer down on cruise control at 70 mph,” Pajcic said. The truck crested a low rise in the road and hit the traffic on the other side. The driver was allowed to return to Canada after the crash, according to Pajcic. As a result, lawyers were unable to get his cell phone data or post-crash drug test results. 
Pajcic’s team proved the driver had falsified his driving logs, the attorney said, and they proved he couldn’t read signs in English in depositions. 
It’s possible the language barrier was one factor among others, Pajcic said, but he believed if the driver could have understood the signs, he may have slowed down in time. “There’s a reason the rules say ‘you gotta read fucking English,’ if you don’t you’re gonna kill someone,” Pajcic said. 
He and Dzion’s parents have worked with lawmakers on Connor’s Law, he said, because even if other factors are involved in such crashes, they believe stricter enforcement of English language proficiency could save lives. “We never want there to be another Connor,” he said. Pajcic too, though, said he thought the new rules could also protect jobs for U.S. drivers. 
“It takes away American jobs,” he said of companies bringing in foreign drivers. “It drives down the quality of our drivers and we need to protect American roads.”

Across the country, some state lawmakers are concerned that the growing data center industry is creating a surge in demand for new electricity and grid infrastructure. (George Frey/Getty Images)Since the legislature established the Utah Inland Port Authority (UIPA) in 2018, UIPA has demonstrated an ability to spend millions of tax payer money on one bad idea after another.  The latest is to bring artificial intelligence (AI) data centers to their Wasatch Front project areas. UIPA is being caught up in a 21st century gold rush, but like the one in 1848, it will turn out to be mostly fool’s gold.
Nationwide, state and local officials are fast tracking data center permits in their communities, foolishly giving them enormous tax breaks. Most of the biggest data centers are being built by the mega-billionaire tech bros like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, the very same people who are already hoarding unprecedented wealth and power. Much of the impetus for these data centers has degenerated into a race between these mega-billionaires to see who ultimately dominates the holy grail of computing — “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), essentially human brain level sophisticated computation. Data center construction has doubled just since 2022, and the only result is further concentration of wealth and power at the top of  big tech.
The tech bros race to rule AGI is the crown jewel in their pathologic ethos of “move fast and break things.” Numerous experts are warning about the existential danger of AGI. It will render many jobs obsolete, it represents a grave national security threat, and it blurs the lines between truth and fiction. This next level AI creates new content by analyzing and mimicking patterns from vast amounts of existing data. Its uses are far beyond helping students to cheat on writing papers. It’s being used to spread climate misinformation, exacerbate housing discrimination of Black communities, create increasingly sophisticated phishing scams, and assisting state and corporate surveillance, monitoring workers’ every move. AI is stymieing worker critical thinking and not delivering productivity gains.
A State Department report concluded AI could pose an “extinction-level” threat, comparing it to the threat of nuclear weapons if not regulated. AI workers are concerned about the irresponsibility, and perverse motives of these tech companies’ executives.
Our environment is another one of the things they are “breaking.” Data centers already rank in the top 10 water-consuming industries. Data centers can consume up to 5 million gallons of potable water a day, 25 times the 200,000 gallon commercial limit set by Salt Lake City. Good luck saving Great Salt Lake if we surround it with UIPA-subsidized data centers.
Cryptocurrency serves no useful purpose and requires massive AI computations. Each Bitcoin transaction generates the equivalent carbon footprint of one million VISA transactions.  Bitcoin is already one of the leading global industrial polluters. The quality of the algorithms is dependent on the size of the computing systems, and AGI can require 10 to 100 times more computing power than say GPT-4, with an exponential increase in energy demand.  One complex can require 100 MW of electricity, the entire output of a small coal-fired power plant. Energy demand from AI data centers is forecasted to more than quadruple by 2030, strain on local electrical grids will be substantial. “Hyperscale” data centers can require dozens of highly polluting diesel generators for back-up power.
AGI electricity demand is undermining decarbonization strategies worldwide, driving an increase in carbon emissions at the worst possible time for climate mitigation. Gov. Spencer Cox cited electricity demands of AI as contributing to Utah’s “energy crisis” justifying his “Operation Gigawatt,” a promotion of his “all of the above” strategy, including more polluting, climate killing fossil fuels and risky nuclear power.
Data centers are noise pollution centers. They emit constant humming and buzzing that can exceed 85 decibels, which is bothersome and harmful to neighbors. Noise pollution is the second most hazardous environmental pollutant after air pollution, causing many of the same adverse health outcomes.
Musk’s xAI is being used primarily for his chatbot, Grok, which allows creation of unfiltered deepfake images, like Mickey Mouse wearing a Nazi uniform, and ever more pornography. Musk calls it “the most fun AI in the world.”  The environmental price tag of all that “fun” is enormous. For example, Musk’s AI supercomputer center in Memphis, Tennessee, uses 35 methane driven gas turbines, none have pollution controls required by EPA. It is already one of the largest emitters of toxic nitrogen oxides in a highly polluted county, far more than an oil refinery. Imagine if Utah allowed UIPA to bring several of these to Salt Lake, Tooele, and Weber Counties, each emitting far more pollution than another oil refinery.
In many ways the explosion of artificial intelligence is already harming society and threatening our future. We should rename it “artificial stupidity.” Utah should be smarter than to allow UIPA to drag us into competing for tax payer subsidized big tech data centers, leaving the rest of us as collateral damage.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Utah-data-center.jpg,,,2025-06-06 15:09:17.375450

Idaho law enforcement agencies never send texts to people to demand payments, threaten penalties for violations or tolls that haven’t been paid, or for missed jury duty, the Idaho Attorney General’s Office said in a news release. 
“Scammers stole over $63 million from Idahoans last year, predominantly targeting our seniors,” Attorney General Raúl Labrador said in a statement. “These scammers are now using fake DMV texts to steal even more. Idaho families need to know that legitimate government agencies never demand payments through text messages.”
Claiming to be from the Idaho DMV, some of the scam texts say your driver’s license could be immediately suspended unless you pay — through a suspicious link. 
The Idaho Attorney General’s Office urges Idahoans to look out for red flags, like:

Demanding payment urgently — or through gift cards.
Threats to suspend licenses, or even arrest.
And suspicious web links that might look official.

If you receive a suspicious text, do not click any links or share your personal information. Report the text to the Federal Trade Commission, and delete it. The FTC’s fraud reporting website is https://reportfraud.ftc.gov. 
The Idaho Transportation Department is also warning Idahoans about scam texts that falsely promote online payments or quicker access to REAL IDs, also known as Star Cards. 
“Scammers are targeting Idahoans with messages that look official but are completely fake,” Idaho DMV Administrator Lisa McClellan said in a statement. “Your REAL ID can only be obtained in person through an authorized DMV office, not by clicking a link in a text message.”

(Stock photo by Doug Wilson via Getty Images)Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has signed into law a bill allowing municipalities to establish a Length of Service Award program for members of volunteer first-responder organizations. 
Under the provisions of House File 1002, municipalities that establish such a program can apply for matching state funding. The state funding will be awarded on a dollar-to-dollar basis for awards of up to $500 per person. Volunteer firefighters, volunteer emergency medical care providers, and emergency peace reserve officers are eligible for a Length of Service Award. 
“It’s more like we’re unpaid firefighters and first-responders,” said Kent Brix, first vice president of Iowa Firefighters Association. “We all go through the same training as professionals, we deal with the same situations as professionals. It’s just that small communities can’t afford to hire people full-time.”
According to Brix, volunteer participation is a major problem, with most volunteer departments down five to six people. Across the state, he estimates, 100 to 150 people are dropping out of volunteer first-responder programs each year. Many of the volunteers are age 50 to 70 — and sometimes older. Low volunteer rates mean that some communities are very short on people to respond to emergency calls. Brix believes that by providing an incentive for volunteers, it will increase participation in the programs. 
“It takes so much of your time with all the training required by the state and new rules,” said Keith McDavid, a former Pleasantville volunteer firefighter of 33 years. “It’s a lot of time and effort. And the amount of time a volunteer puts in is crazy sometimes, especially if you become a volunteer EMT.” 
When McDavid became a volunteer, the fire and rescue teams in Pleasantville were separate with around 20 members each. Now both teams have been combined with only a total of only to 15 to 20 members. He also noted that participation on an individual basis is diminished, with many members unable to put in as much time. The result is a reduction in capability to address emergency situations in a timely manner.
McDavid said he was never personally interested in a monetary reward, but notes that one of the biggest issues for volunteers is the cost of equipment. During his time in the service, his team would buy used firetrucks through eBay and refurbish them with the assistance of members who had experience as mechanics. 
Brix said that affording firetrucks, buildings and equipment is a major issue for organizations. Volunteer fire organizations get a certain amount of tax money from their community, he said, and they hold around two to three fundraisers each year, but even then it’s a “constant money chase.”
“It’s something to protect a person’s life, so it’s not cheap,” Brix said. “We always have different equipment we have to have to protect ourselves and protect our communities.”
Reynolds also signed House File 969 on Friday, a bill dealing with cancer coverage for firefighters.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The completion date and cost for a new westbound Washington Bridge is finally here. But it will take two more years and $59 million more than expected to resurrect a new thoroughfare connecting Providence and East Providence.
Gov. Dan McKee unveiled the November 2028 target completion date and an up-to-$427 million contract cost at a State House press conference Friday. 
The long-awaited news comes nearly a year-and-a-half after state officials halted all traffic on the westbound highway after engineers discovered broken anchor rods that put the bridge spanning the Seekonk River at risk of collapse.
State officials originally sought to rebuild the bridge by August 2026 at an estimated cost of $368 million.
“I understand that this has been a challenging time for those who rely on the Washington Bridge, especially in the early days before we were able to restore six lanes of traffic,” McKee said. “We owe it to you to deliver a bridge that is safe and will ultimately make your lives easier.” 
Tasked with constructing the new bridge is Walsh Construction Company. The Chicago-based firm worked on the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge on Interstate 95 over the Quinnipiac River in New Haven, Connecticut, along with the Interstate 90 Westbound Innerbelt Bridge in Cleveland, Ohio.
For this project, the firm will draw from its design of the Chain of Rocks Bridge in St. Louis, Walsh Program Manager Charles Parish told reporters.
“It’s not often that you get to build the same project twice, or the same bridge twice,” Parish said. “But our ability to do that on the new Washington Bridge gave us the confidence to commit to both the price and schedule that we’re sure we can meet.”
The state’s plan calls for five lanes of travel over the new bridge, along with an onramp from Gano Street in Providence and a new offramp to Waterfront Drive in East Providence. The original bridge had four lanes.
Construction is scheduled to begin next month, which overlaps with the ongoing demolition of the existing bridge. Demolition contractor Aetna Bridge Company is expected to complete its work by the end of 2025.
During that time, Walsh will secure permitting, workers, and pre-fabricate material to rebuild the bridge, Parish said.

Walsh will be paid at least $339 million to build the new bridge, with incentives and contingencies that could bring the total cost up to $427 million. The deal also has built-in daily penalties of $25,000 for exceeding the project deadline. With demolition and emergency repairs, the entire project adds up to $570 million, which is “well within what we budget,” McKee said. 
McKee’s administration has identified more than $713 million in financing available for the project over the last year. That includes $35 million in remaining pandemic relief aid, $107.6 million from the state’s capital plan fund, and up to $334.6 million in Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles bonds, which allow the state to borrow against future allocations of federal transportation money.
The state was also awarded nearly a pair of federal infrastructure grants worth roughly $221 million. The grants were temporarily frozen under President Donald Trump’s initial flurry of executive orders, but released to Rhode Island in late March. 
However, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, in a lawsuit filed with 19 other states in May, warned that funding could still be at risk due to a federal directive tying infrastructure grants to compliance with the Trump administration’s diversity and immigration policies.
McKee said he does not believe federal funds will be taken away from the project.
“We have the sign off from [Transportation] Secretary (Sean) Duffy,” the governor said Friday.
Also unclear: how the new price tag will impact the state’s budget. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said in a statement that legislative leaders will review the governor’s announcement as they shape a final fiscal 2026 budget.
“As the bridge project moves forward, the House of Representatives will continue its work ensuring the administration is accountable,” Shekarchi said.
Walsh was one of two finalists vying to rebuild the bridge after the state issued its latest bidding window last December.  The other proposal came from a joint venture by American Bridge and MLJ, firms based respectively in Pennsylvania and New York.
Rhode Island Director of Transportation Peter Alviti Jr. said both companies were qualified and made similar technical proposals. Walsh’s proposal projected around $340 million in hard construction costs, while American Construction and MLJ’s bid estimated nearly $387 million. 
Because it did not win the state’s tentative contract, the losing bidder will receive a $1.75 million consolation prize for participating, as set out in the state’s solicitation. It took two rounds of requests or proposals to yield any firm bids, a sore spot that McKee’s critics continue to seize on, including his potential 2026 Democratic gubernatorial rival, Helena Buonanno Foulkes.
“Governor McKee’s catastrophic failure to manage the Washington Bridge has impacted countless Rhode Island families and businesses, forcing them to endure longer commutes, lost wages, and economic hardship,” Foulkes said in a statement Friday.
But McKee said he has no regrets.
“As far as I’m concerned we’re in a good spot,” he said. “The people in the state of Rhode Island know that the funding is there, the time schedule is there, and we have a quality bridge-builder to actually execute the project.”

(Photo by Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld lower court decisions barring counties from imposing safety standards on a pipeline subject to federal safety standards.
The cases involved Summit Carbon Solutions, the company proposing to build a carbon sequestration pipeline through the state, and county supervisors from both Story and Shelby Counties in Iowa.
Summit sued the counties in 2022 for enacting ordinances that required county-specific setback requirements and other regulations the company argued were preempted by federal pipeline safety laws.
A federal judge ruled in favor of Summit in Dec. 2023 and issued permanent injunctions, stopping the counties from enforcing the regulations, which would have impacted the carbon sequestration pipeline and other pipelines.

The county supervisors appealed the decision and presented oral arguments in November 2024 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The counties argued that local land use and zoning regulations are not “preempted standards” under the Pipeline Safety Act.
Writing for the appeals court, U.S. Circuit Judge Duane Benton wrote that the county ordinances “focus” on safety and “repeatedly” mention safety risks associated with the pipeline, which “undermines” the Pipeline Safety Act’s goal of preempting state regulations on safety.
“This holding does not prohibit local governments from considering safety, nor prevent them from enacting all zoning ordinances, as the counties suggest,” Benton said in the opinion. “This court emphasizes the distinction between safety standards — which the PSA preempts — and safety considerations — which the PSA does not preempt.”
The county ordinances also included emergency response requirements and abandonment provisions which the court ruled were also preempted by federal regulations.
Circuit Judge Jane Kelly, however, dissented on those elements and wrote she does not believe that PSA preempts setback and abandonment provisions. Kelly said that while the counties’ setback requirements are “animated in part by safety considerations” they do not have the “direct and substantial” effect on safety that is reserved for federal regulation.
Kelly also wrote that per her understanding, the Pipeline Safety Act “does not cover pipelines that have been abandoned” and therefore the Shelby County abandonment provision is not “expressly preempted.”
The court affirmed the lower court’s decision in both cases, but ordered the federal court for the Southern District of Iowa to reconsider an additional ordinance that’s at issue in the Story County case.
Sabrina Zenor, on behalf of Summit Carbon Solutions, said the ruling “confirms” pipeline safety regulation set by the federal government and the Iowa Utilities Commission’s role in route and permit decisions.
“This supports a consistent, lawful permitting process for critical infrastructure projects like ours,” Zenor said in a statement.
A press release from Bold Alliance, a group representing landowners opposed to the pipeline project, called the order an “anti-local government ruling” and said the parties involved in the case are examining their “legal and legislative options” in response to the decision.
“The landowners, impacted community members, county and state elected officials who worked for months or years to develop ordinances and state regulations are witnessing their hard-won efforts to enact common sense protections for their communities stripped away by judicial fiat,” the statement read.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Salt Lake City officials warned this week that water use is up this time of year compared to the past several years, and they’re urging residents to be mindful of their consumption amid heat and drought. 
As Utah has seen an unusually warm spring this year — with temperatures in the Salt Lake valley reaching the 90s some days — the Salt Lake City Department of Public Utilities issued a news release Thursday warning that water use is up both overall and outdoors. 
The department reported water demand in recent weeks has been “trending upward compared to the average water demand over the last three years during the same time period.”
Great Salt Lake is again on the decline, and summer likely won’t help it

“We must protect our natural resources and support efforts for the Great Salt Lake,” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall urged in a prepared statement. 
Laura Briefer, director of the Salt Lake City Department of Public Utilities, said as of Thursday, total water use had increased by 5% in the department’s service areas, with outdoor water use up 10%. 
“Though snowpack in our area was average this year and our reservoirs are full right now, overall runoff is lower than expected, and much of the state is projecting drought conditions,” Briefer said. “It is important that our community members continue to focus on water conservation given these factors and the potential for drought conditions to worsen.”
In addition to providing water to Utah’s capital of Salt Lake City — which is home to more than 217,000 people —  the Salt Lake City Department of Public Utilities also services portions of suburban cities of Millcreek, Holladay, Cottonwood Heights, Murray, Midvale and South Salt Lake. 
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, 95.5% of Utah was experiencing abnormally dry conditions as of Thursday, with 76.2% in moderate drought and 44.6% in severe drought. About 3.2% — an area concentrated in Washington County in the southwestern corner of the state — was in extreme drought. 
Utah creeps deeper into drought as long-term forecasts point to a hot summer

This time last year, only 23.9% of the state was classified as abnormally dry, according to the drought monitor. 
Plus, hotter than usual temperatures are expected to persist through the summer. According to the three month seasonal outlook from the National Weather Service, Utah is forecasted to have above average temperatures through August. As for rainfall, the service says it’s unclear whether there will be above or below average precipitation this summer. According to its models, there’s an equal chance of both in the majority of the state. 
Salt Lake City officials urged both homeowners and businesses to conserve water. They noted that the city offers a variety of programs meant to reduce water use indoors and outdoors, including landscaping rebates, low-water grass seed, irrigation controllers and water-wise toilets. 
Here are some of the water conservation programs and resources Salt Lake City officials highlighted: 

Salt Lake City’s Turf Trade site, where customers can order low-water grass seeds.
Utah State University’s Water Check program, which provides customized pressurized sprinkler schedules for select areas. 
Salt Lake City’s Rain Barrel program, which sells rain barrels to Salt Lake City Public Utilities customers.
Utah Water Savers’ Slow the Flow incentives programs for water-smart landscaping, toilet replacement, and smart sprinkler controller installation.

Thalia Mara Hall was closed last August due to mold remediation, to replace the heating and cooling systems and perform updates to the fire system. The building had previously failed an inspection in late January.
State Fire Marshal and Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney issued the following statement on June 6: 
“The State Fire Marshals Office (SFMO) conducted a follow-up inspection of Thalia Mara Hall on Tuesday, June 3, 2025, and determined that the building met standards to reopen. A Certificate of Occupancy will be issued to the City of Jackson (COJ). A hydrostatic test was conducted on Monday, June 2, 2025, to determine the integrity of pipes and valves in the building. The test was successful. The building elevators and escalators remain out of service pending repair and inspection. The COJ has scheduled a new fire curtain to be installed in July.
A condition of the reopening is that a third-party fire watch must be in place until the fire curtain is installed and passes inspection. A fire watch involves having someone monitor the building during events for fire hazards and to alert occupants and emergency services if a fire breaks out.
My office remains committed to working with Jackson officials to protect the health and safety of the public and important cultural structures like Thalia Mara Hall.”
Thalia Mara Hall’s closure brought with it a slew of scheduling issues for performing arts groups such as Ballet Mississippi and Mississippi Symphony Orchestra, who had to move performances to Madison Central High School Auditorium and Jackson Academy Performing Arts Center.
The city has spent nearly $3 million in repairs, with the bulk of the funding going to Guarantee Restoration Services, which was in charge of mold remediation, encapsulation and HVAC cleaning.

State workers increase pressure in union negotiations 
State employees picketing outside negotiations between Minnesota budget officials and their union on Wednesday said they were absolutely willing to strike over Gov. Tim Walz’s part-time return-to-office order that took effect this week.
“One-hundred percent I would. We can’t just roll over here,” said Erin Malone, an auditor for the Department of Revenue, at a demonstration in St. Paul with more than 50 workers and supporters on Wednesday.
The two unions representing nearly 40,000 state workers — the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — are also fuming over the state’s health care proposals they estimate will raise many workers’ costs by thousands of dollars a year. The administration says rising health care costs leave them no choice.
The soonest state employees could strike is in late summer, once contracts expire on June 30, they complete 45 days of mediation and then provide 10 days notice. The union explained those details in a FAQ for their members posted late last month in another sign that negotiations are headed toward a volatile impasse.
State employees haven’t gone on strike since walking off the job for two weeks 2001, but MAPE President Megan Dayton says she’s never seen her members so fired up by Walz’s unilateral decision to force workers back to the office. Hundreds of workers showed up to multiple demonstrations organized by the union over two days this week.
Under Walz’s order, state employees must work in the office at least 50% of the time unless they live more than 50 miles away or receive an exemption. Walz argues the policy will improve collaboration, mentorship and workplace culture, with the added benefit of bringing bodies and dollars back to a forsaken downtown St. Paul.
The policy officially began June 1, but some agencies have delayed implementation as they make space for employees to return. After the COVID-19 shifted office jobs to workers’ homes, state agencies began downsizing their office footprint in anticipation of permanent remote work. The Department of Revenue, for example, reduced its leased office space by 35% since 2021, saving $2.45 million annually.
Many workers argue they’re more productive at home and complain that the order adds to their costs in parking and gas. Some also question the motive, suspecting Walz could be distancing himself from public unions ahead of another run for governor — or trying to nudge workers off the payroll as the state stares down fiscal uncertainty.
The state has also proposed changing contract language to make it easier to lay off workers in the event of “fiscal exigencies” such as federal funding cuts, as well as epidemics, natural disasters and national security emergencies.
“I think it’s political posturing,” said Christine Retkwa, a data analyst at the Department of Human Services. “It can’t be collaboration if we’ve been more productive… It’s not to save costs.”
Walz’s relationship with public sector unions, which have historically been an important political ally, have soured rapidly since he announced the policy in March without consulting the unions. The union compared Walz to Elon Musk, and Walz did not invite anyone from the union to attend his State of the State Address.
Job Corps students face homelessness
Tens of thousands of students at Job Corps centers across the country are facing homelessness after the Trump administration’s Labor Department announced it will eliminate the vocational training program for low-income teenagers and young adults.
“You don’t hit the ground running, you just hit the ground period. Straight homeless – nothing. Just straight into the ground,” Tyrone Bills, one of more than 150 students at the Hubert H. Humphrey Job Corps Center in St. Paul, told Fox 9.
Last Friday, the Labor Department gave students a week’s notice to move out and abandon their free training to fill jobs in manufacturing, construction, law enforcement, health care and other high-growth industries.
The department later extended the deadline, and then a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from killing the program. By then, many students had already moved out.
Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, once an advocate for Job Corps, justified eliminating the $1.7 billion program because of “serious incidents” as well as high costs and low student graduation rates.
Just 38% of students graduate, with an average cost of more than $80,000 a year, according to the agency. The National Job Corps Association disputed these figures, saying graduation rates before COVID-19 have historically been above 60% while the cost is less than $50,000 per enrollee.
Minnesota surpasses 3 million jobs in 2024
Minnesota continued to have one of the country’s strongest labor markets in 2024, adding 40,000 non-farm jobs to push the state above 3 million jobs for the first time, according to the second annual State of Working Minnesota report from the labor-backed think tank North Star Policy Action.
In the Midwest, Minnesota has the highest median wages, the highest share of workers in unions and the highest rate of health insurance coverage. The state also has the lowest unemployment rate for Black residents in the region and the lowest fatal injury rate on the job.
Wage inequality also declined, while union membership increased by nearly 7% (although this can fluctuate from year to year due to imprecise data, and the general trend has been down for unions.) Support for unions is near historic highs, and that’s helped nearly triple the number of union elections over the past five years, according to the report.
It wasn’t all good news: unemployment ticked up while the median wage moved down from $26.43 to $25.52 in an unusual break from a nearly exclusive upward trend.
There is also cause for concern, according to report author Aaron Rosenthal, given federal Republicans’ drive to reduce spending on health insurance for the working poor to offset some of the costs of tax cuts largely benefitting the wealthy.

Working families are increasingly reliant on health insurance through Medical Assistance, the state’s version of Medicaid. The number of people insured through Medical Assistance in families with at least one full-time worker increased 165% over the past 15 years.
In rural areas, roughly 18% of adults and 37% of children are insured through Medical Assistance, compared to 15% of adults and 30% of children in the Twin Cities metro area.
National jobs data released on Friday showed hiring has slowed as Trump’s trade war and federal cuts have put employers on edge, with nearly all of the 139,000 job gains for the month being concentrated in health care and hospitality. The federal government lost 22,000 jobs.
Doctors and nurses picket across the state
In a first for Minnesota, newly unionized doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners picketed outside several Allina clinics on Tuesday as negotiations stalled over a first labor contract. (It was an informational picket and not a strike.)
Frustrated with what they describe as factory-style health care, the clinicians voted by a wide margin to unionize with Doctors Council SEIU in October 2023, forming the nation’s largest private-sector doctors union with more than 600 members across 60 Allina clinics in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
But since then, union leaders say they’ve made little progress toward finalizing a first labor contract covering wages, benefits and working conditions — despite meeting with hospital leaders nearly 40 times.
“We’re not seeing Allina come to the table with meaningful proposals,” said Dr. Chris Antolak, a family physician, outside Allina’s clinic in Coon Rapids.
Unionized nurses also took to the picket lines outside 11 hospitals in the Twin Cities and two in Duluth in their push for greater staffing levels to protect themselves from workplace violence and improve patient care. The Minnesota Nurses Association is negotiating contracts covering roughly 15,000 nurses at seven of the state’s largest health systems.
Contracts expired on May 31 at St. Luke’s and Essentia in Duluth  and will expire at the end of this month at Twin Cities hospitals run by Allina, Children’s, M Health Fairview, HealthPartners and North Memorial.

Midjourney/AI-generated art A bipartisan group of state lawmakers, including six from Georgia, is calling on Congress to cut a provision out of the massive federal spending bill that freezes state regulations on artificial intelligence for 10 years.
“As state lawmakers and policymakers, we regularly hear from constituents about the rise of online harms and the impacts of AI on our communities,” the lawmakers wrote. “In an increasingly fraught digital environment, young people are facing new threats online, seniors are targeted by the emergence of AI-generated scams, and workers and creators face new challenges in an AI-integrated economy. Over the next decade, AI will raise some of the most important public policy questions of our time, and it is critical that state policymakers maintain the ability to respond.”
The Georgia signers were Sen. John Albers of Roswell and Reps. Todd Jones of South Forsyth and Gary Richardson of Evans, who are all Republicans, as well as Democratic Reps. Scott Holcomb and Tanya Miller of Atlanta and Sam Park of Lawrenceville.
In all, 261 legislators from all 50 states signed the letter.
Georgia lawmakers from both chambers met over the summer last year to discuss potential AI regulations. Albers, who chairs the Senate AI study committee, often stressed that he did not wish to overregulate, saying that he saw lawmakers’ duty as balancing protections for Georgians with creating a friendly environment for businesses.
During this year’s legislative session, no major AI bills passed into law, including broadly popular provisions like increasing penalties for using AI to create child pornography or deceptive “deep fake” campaign advertisements.
An Albers bill intended to create a new state advisory board on artificial intelligence and to require local governments to report on their use of the technology died in the Senate Economic Development and Tourism Committee on the advice of Suwanee GOP Congressman Rich McCormick.
Then-committee chair Brandon Beach, who now serves as U.S. Treasurer, said at the time that McCormick told him not to take any action on AI because Congress would take care of it.
Senators created a new committee this year to examine artificial intelligence and digital currency, but members have not yet been appointed and no hearing dates have been set.
The GOP’s megabill, which has become the cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda, passed the House by a single vote and is now in the hands of the Senate.
Getting the legislation through the House was a challenge the first time, with factions within the Republican Party at odds over the size of cuts to federal programs and the expected increase in the deficit.
The new focus of the AI provision could prove to be another sticking point. Members of the House including Rome Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene have indicated they were not aware of the regulation ban when they voted for the bill and will not support it when it comes back to the House unless the rule is removed.
“I voted for President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill because it delivers his MAGA campaign promises and he endorses the bill and wants Congress to pass it in order to fund his MAGA agenda,” Greene said on social media. “Do I love the price tag? NO. But I want OUR policies funded. I campaigned across the country for YEARS with Trump, more than any member of Congress, and the man NEVER said he would destroy state rights for 10 years to let AI tech companies run rampant!!! TAKE IT OUT OR I’M VOTING NO WHEN IT COMES BACK TO THE HOUSE!!!!!”

Uttering and publishing a false or altered public record, also punishable by up to 14 years in prison;
Substantial endangerment to the public, punishable by up to five years in prison;
Discharge of an injurious substance to waters of the state, punishable by up to two years in prison.

“Serious violations by businesses that endanger the health and well-being of Michigan residents and our environment cannot be tolerated,” Nessel said in a statement. “I am grateful to the talented prosecutors in my office, the dedicated experts from the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, Michigan State Police, the Genesee County Sheriff’s Office, the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office, and detectives of EGLE and [the Department of Natural Resource’s] Environmental Investigation Section, who all played a significant role in advancing this case through the judicial process.” 
Minhas also faces several misdemeanor charges including nine violations of the state’s liquid industrial waste law and 11 other offenses for violating hazardous waste statutes.
A pretrial date has not been set, according to the Attorney General’s office.

The base reads, “Henry McMaster, 117th Governor of South Carolina.”
This is the first time staff of the Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism, which runs the gift shop, are aware of a novelty item featuring the likeness of a governor being sold at the Statehouse, said agency spokeswoman Sam Queen.
And they’re exclusive to that store.
The idea for the bobblehead came from a conversation between the agency’s director, Duane Parrish, and the governor’s chief of staff, Trey Walker. The two got to talking about how people collect coins, Beanie Babies and baseball cards, and Walker wondered out loud whether a bobblehead of the governor might turn into a collectible of its own, he said.

“It seemed like a neat, novel thing they didn’t have in the gift shop,” Walker said.
Parrish agreed to the idea, thinking the bobblehead “would be a unique item to offer,” Queen said.
The figurine officially hit shelves May 20, about two weeks after the 2025 legislative session officially ended. As of Thursday, the gift shop had sold 28 of the 150 bobbleheads it ordered, despite less foot traffic from lobbyists and legislators, Queen said.
“It’s been a popular item in the short time it’s been available,” she said.
The design was approved by the governor’s office. When McMaster first saw the finished product, he liked it so much he brought one back to the Governor’s Mansion and showed it off during a gathering that night, Walker said.
On Thursday, McMaster told reporters he found the take on himself “interesting,” adding he might buy a couple for his grandchildren.
His only concern is the $50 price tag, which the Republican governor said seems a bit steep.
“Fifty dollars for those things — that was a surprise to me,” McMaster said.
None of the money goes to him or his office.
The price is a matter of limited supply, Queen said.
About 12% of the bobblehead’s cost will support the gift store’s operations. The novelty and scarcity of it will hopefully drive more people into the store to shop, she added.
All proceeds from Statehouse gift shop sales support operations for the parks department. More than 40% of the agency’s budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1 comes from self-generated revenue, including store sales, park entry fees and camping fees.
“It brings a smile and brings in a little bit of money for the state, so that’s a good thing,” Walker said.
McMaster is the longest-serving elected governor in South Carolina’s history. The former lieutenant governor ascended to the job in January 2017, when Nikki Haley became President Donald Trump’s first United Nations ambassador. That gave McMaster two years in office before his first inauguration.

Guillermo Smith speaking at a press conference in the Capitol on March. 19, 2025 (Photo credit: Mitch Perry / Florida Phoenix)Florida Democrats from countries in President Donald Trump’s travel ban list denounced the policy that they say punishes families and hurts the economy during a virtual press conference Friday morning.
Orlando Democrat Anna Eskamani, who’s Iranian-American, said she worries she won’t be able to see her aging grandmother before she passes.
“It is a very difficult reality for many of us, where we are navigating conflict in these homelands that are dictorial in nature, that make it difficult already to survive, and for folks who are fleeing that to achieve the American dream, it is heartbreaking and unAmerican that they cannot do that,” Eskamani said.
Trump issued a proclamation late Wednesday barring the entry of people from a dozen countries, including Iran, and partially restricting entry of nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Florida is home to the largest population of Cubans, Venezuelans, and Haitians in the country.
The travel ban proclamation, which cited national security concerns, goes into effect on Monday.
The Democrats, who are in the superminority at the state Legislature, said Congress needed to be held accountable, particularly Florida’s Republican delegation.
“At least within the Haitian community, ever since on the campaign trail, this administration has been targeting Haitians, and it’s turned its back on Cubans as well,” said North Miami Democratic Rep. Dottie Joseph, of Haiti.
Seminole Republican Rep. Berny Jacques, who is from Haiti, supports the Trump administration’s policy.
“It is essential for our nation’s sovereignty and security,” he wrote to Florida Phoenix.

These bills seek to unnecessarily ban trans girls from competing in high school sports. 
When I first was made aware of the bills, my teacher heart and coaching experience kicked into action, and I got to work reading and thinking. I asked myself, “Why are these bills being proposed?” “Who do these bills impact?” and “How?” Guided by data provided by Kids Count in Michigan, our analysis quickly revealed that these bills are both dangerous and unnecessary. 
The narrative that trans girls are boys is simply wrong and dehumanizing. The argument that trans girls don’t deserve to play sports is discriminatory and heartbreaking. All kids deserve the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities alongside their peers, which has been proven to lead to better attendance in school, something Michigan schools are struggling with right now. 
As a high school coach for 15 years, I know firsthand the community and sense of safety athletics can provide. This is especially important for the transgender teens — representing fewer than 1% of teens in Michigan — who experience higher rates of anxiety and depression than their cisgender peers. More than half of transgender high school students have seriously contemplated attempting suicide. Surrounding them in a supportive system, such as a sports team, could be a lifeline for these students. 
Michigan House Republicans introduce bill to halt gender-affirming surgeries and care for minors

This legislation isn’t just harmful to trans girls; it’s harmful to all girls. We’ve seen anti-trans legislation result in girls being harassed simply for not outwardly looking “feminine enough.” Our female athletes already have to prove their worth of being competitive enough, assertive enough, strong enough, athletic enough. 
Michigan already has policies in place for trans athletes. The Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) reports receiving just two requests per year from transgender athletes wanting to play sports. This legislation unnecessarily targets trans youth while at the same time impacting virtually zero percent of the high school athletic population. 
The bills have passed out of the House and are now headed to the Senate.
There is no doubt about it: this legislation is anti-trans, anti-girl, anti-youth. Michigan kids deserve better.

,DC,2025-06-06 16:54:28+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. Senate GOP will try to drag Trump’s mega-bill across the finish line,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-gop-will-try-drag-trumps-mega-bill-across-finish-line,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republican Leader John Thune will spend a crucial next few weeks working behind the scenes with other top GOP senators to reshape the the party’s “big beautiful bill” — a balancing test accompanied in recent days by incendiary exchanges between President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk over whether the current proposals are so bad that Congress should just go back to the drawing board.South Dakota’s Thune will need to gain support from deficit hawks, who want to see the mega-bill cut at least $2 trillion in spending, and moderates, who are closely monitoring how less federal funding for safety net programs like Medicaid and food assistance could harm their constituents and home-state institutions like rural hospitals.Interviews by States Newsroom with Republican senators in early June showed many major elements of the package, which are far from decided, could change, including provisions that would put states on the hook for unanticipated costs. Arkansas Sen. John Boozman, for example, indicated the Senate may rewrite a proposal in the House-passed bill that would shift some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food aid to low-income people, to state governments.“We can do whatever we want to do,” the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee chairman said when asked by States Newsroom about amending that policy.The final deal — intended to extend the 2017 tax cuts — cannot lose more than three GOP senators and still make it back across the Capitol to the House for final approval, since all Democrats are expected to oppose the bill. Thune only needs a majority vote in the Senate for the special process being used by Republicans.Internal debates about just how to rework the Trump-backed tax and spending cuts measure began in the first week of June during meetings on Capitol Hill and at the White House, as GOP senators began critiquing the House-passed package line-by-line to ensure it complies with their strict rules for the complex reconciliation process and their policy goals.Republicans said during interviews that several provisions in the House version likely won’t comply with the chamber’s Byrd rule, which could force lawmakers to toss out some provisions.Complicating all of it was the very public back-and-forth between not just Trump but GOP leaders and former White House adviser Musk over the bill, which Musk on social media labeled “a disgusting abomination” and a “big, ugly spending bill” for its effect on the deficit and debt limit. “KILL the BILL,” Musk said on X, the platform he owns. Senate leaders so far have dismissed Musk’s criticisms.Fragile House coalitionThe talks, and whatever the legislation looks like after a marathon amendment voting session expected in late June, have already raised deep concerns among House GOP lawmakers, who will have to vote on the bill again in order to send it to Trump.The extremely narrow majorities mean House Republican leaders cannot lose more than four of their own members if all the lawmakers in that chamber vote on the party-line bill.Any changes the Senate makes could unbalance the fragile coalition of votes Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., cobbled together last month for a 215-214 vote. But GOP senators are adamant they will amend the legislation.Complicating matters is a new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that shows the proposed changes to tax law, Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and higher education aid wouldn’t actually help to reduce deficits during the next decade but raise them by more than $2.4 trillion.The numbers are the exact opposite for what Republicans hoped their sweeping tax and spending cuts package would accomplish.Scrutiny beginsThe first stop for the House-passed reconciliation package in the Senate appears to be the parliamentarian’s office, where staff have begun evaluating whether each provision in the current version of the bill complies with the upper chamber’s strict rules.Boozman said staff on his panel have already begun meeting with the parliamentarian to go over the House provisions within its jurisdiction.He expects that section of the package will have to change to comply with the strict rules that govern the reconciliation process in the Senate and to better fit that chamber’s policy goals.“We can't really decide exactly what we want to use in the House version until we know what's eligible,” Boozman said. “We've got some other ideas too that we asked them about. But we need to know, of the ideas that we have, what would be viable options as far as being Byrd eligible.”The Byrd rule, which is actually a law, requires reconciliation bills to address federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit. This generally bars lawmakers from using the special budget process to change policies that don’t have a significant impact on those three areas.Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who is campaigning to become his home state’s next governor, said pushing some of the cost of the nutrition program to states may be problematic.“We're trying to send more costs to the states. Most states can't afford that, so we want to take care of people, but we need people to go back to work,” Tuberville said. “It's not a forever entitlement. It's for part-time, you know, take care of yourself until you get a job, go back to work and let people that need it really, really get it.”Rural hospitals on edgeSenate GOP leaders will have to navigate how best to reduce federal spending on Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower-income people and some with disabilities, that is relied on by tens of millions of Americans, many of whom are loyal Republican voters.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that 7.8 million people would lose access to Medicaid during the next decade if the House’s policy changes are implemented as written.There are also concerns among GOP lawmakers about how losing the revenue that comes with treating Medicaid patients would impact rural health care access and hospitals.Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said under no circumstances would he vote for a bill that cuts benefits to Medicaid recipients and is worried about how provisions in the House package would affect rural hospitals.“They're very concerned about it, rightly so,” Hawley said, referring to conversations he’s had with health care systems in his home state.“This is something that we need to work on. I don't know why we would penalize rural hospitals,” he added. “If you want to reduce health care spending, then cap the price of prescription drugs. I mean, that's the way to do it. If you want to get major savings in the health care sector, don't close rural hospitals, don't take away benefits from working people. Cap the costs, cap the price that (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) is going to pay for prescription drugs.”West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said she’s not yet come to a decision about whether to keep, amend, or completely scrap some of the House changes to Medicaid.“I talked to a lot of our hospitals when I was home to see what the impacts would be, because we have a very high Medicaid population,” Capito said. “I want to see it work and be preserved, but I want it to be there for future generations. And it's just getting way out of control on the spend side. So right now, we're looking at everything.”Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy — chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee — said he doesn’t expect all of the health care provisions in the House bill make it through the “Byrd bath” with the parliamentarian. But he declined to go into detail.“Some of it is more regulatory, that's all I can say,” Cassidy said.West Virginia’s Sen. Jim Justice said he is in favor of requiring some Medicaid enrollees to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month to stay on the program, a sentiment shared by many of his GOP colleagues.“I'm good with every bit of that,” he said. But Justice expects the Senate will make its own changes to the package and that it will be “proud of their own pond.”“Any frog that’s not proud of your own pond’s not much of a frog,” Justice said.He did not go into detail on what those changes would entail.SALT shakersThe state and local tax deduction, or SALT, represents another tightrope  for Thune, who is no fan of the changes made in the House. But he has said repeatedly this week he understands altering that language too much could mean a Senate-amended version of the bill never makes it back through the House to actually become law.Thune said outside the White House following a June 4 meeting with Trump and others that there will very likely be changes to SALT.“There isn’t a single Republican senator who cares much about the SALT issue,” Thune said. “It’s just not an issue that plays.” States that are most affected generally don’t elect Republicans to the Senate.The House tax-writing panel originally proposed raising the SALT cap from $10,000 to $30,000, but Johnson had to raise that to $40,000 in order to secure votes from House Republicans who represent higher tax states like California, New Jersey and New York. The revised cap would benefit more high-income taxpayers in their states.“In 2017, that was one of the best reforms we had in the bill,” Thune said. “But we understand it’s about 51 and 218. So we will work with our House counterparts and with the White House to try to get that issue in a place where we can deliver the votes and get the bill across the finish line.”Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, but can rely on Vice President J.D. Vance to break a tied vote if necessary.At least 218 House lawmakers must vote to pass bills when all 435 seats are filled. But with three vacancies at the moment, legislation can move through that chamber with 216 votes. The GOP has 220 seats at the moment, meaning Johnson can afford four defections on party-line bills.North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven told reporters this week that he’d like to see GOP senators rework the SALT section of the bill, even if that causes challenges for Speaker Johnson’s ability to pass a final version.“Let's talk about SALT, for example. The House has a very large SALT number. The Senate is probably going to take a look at that,” Hoeven said. “There'll be a lot of areas we can look at. There'll be other things we're going to look at. We'd like to get to $2 trillion in savings.”Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno joined in putting his House colleagues on notice that they likely won’t get the agreement they struck with the speaker in the final version of the bill.“I think we're going to make common-sense changes. For example, the SALT cap, by the way, something that definitely helps very wealthy people in blue states,” Moreno said. “I think that cap, the 400% increase, is too much, so we're going to work on tweaking that.”Hawley, of Missouri, speaking more generally about the tax provisions, said he would like the Senate to make sure middle-class Americans benefit from the tax changes, just as much as companies.“I want to be clear, I'm in favor of additional tax relief for working people. So my view is this corporate tax rate, which they lowered in 2017, they made that permanent back then. I know some workers that would like permanent tax relief,” Hawley said. “So I think it's imperative that we do some addition to tax relief for workers. So I think that's important.”A new $4 trillion debt limitDeficit hawks in the Senate have also voiced objections to raising the nation’s debt limit by $4 trillion, arguing that GOP leaders haven’t done enough to assuage their concerns about the nation’s fiscal trajectory.Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul argued that the debt limit increase is more about next year’s midterm elections than good governance.“​​This is really about avoiding having to talk about the debt during election times because people like to go home and talk to the Rotary or the Lions Club and tell them how they're fiscally conservative and they're against debt,” Paul said. “It's embarrassing to them to have to vote to keep raising the debt. But they're unwilling to have the courage to actually look at all spending.”Paul suggested that House Republicans created problems by inflating some of the spending levels in their package, including to continue construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Paul is chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.“The $46.5 billion for the wall is eight times higher than the current cost of the wall. If you're going to do 1,000 miles, you can actually do it for $6.5 billion. They want $46.5 billion,” Paul said. “We can't be fiscally conservative until it comes to the border, and then we're no longer fiscally conservative.”The border wall has been a constant focus for Trump, who made it a central part of his 2016 presidential campaign, when he said repeatedly that the United States would build it and Mexico would pay for it.South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Budget Committee, hinted during a brief interview that Congress can only cut so much spending without going near programs like Social Security, which accounted for $1.5 trillion in expenditures last year, or Medicare, which spent $865 billion. Both are normally considered untouchable.“I think we're going to make some changes to try to find more spending reductions. I think that's a fair criticism of the bill, but you can't do Social Security by law,” Graham said, referring to one of the many rules that govern the reconciliation process. “Nobody's proposed anything in the Medicare area.”Graham added that “trying to make the bill more fiscally responsible is a good thing, but we need to pass it.”",,,,2025-06-06 13:07:58.578141

David Parker will not run in November special election,Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/06/desoto-sen-david-parker-will-not-run-in-november-special-election/,"Parker, one of Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann's top Senate leaders, was facing a special election due to legislative redistricting that changed his district to a slightly majority-Black one.","State Sen. David Parker, a Republican from Olive Branch, announced on Thursday that he will not run in an upcoming special election, creating an open Senate seat in DeSoto County and making him the second incumbent to forgo the special election. 
Parker, who has served 13 years in the Legislature, wrote on social media that the recent death of his childhood friend and the founding surgeon in Parker’s eye-care practice weighed heavily on his decision to leave public office. 
“Their loss has served as a powerful reminder of how precious our time is, and it reaffirmed my desire to devote more intentional time to my family and to the next chapter of life,” Parker said. 
Even though Parker was elected to a new four-year term in 2023, a federal three-judge panel ruled last year that the state’s current legislative maps didn’t comply with federal voting laws and diluted Black voting power.  
The federal panel then approved a new state legislative map that redrew five House districts and nine Senate districts, one of which was Parker’s. 
Parker did not cite this as a reason for his retirement, but state officials also changed his district to a slightly majority-Black district. If the DeSoto County lawmaker drew an opponent, he likely would have spent this year facing a competitive election cycle.
Sen. John Polk, a Republican from Hattiesburg, also announced earlier this year that he will not run in the special election because of health reasons. The redistricting plan placed Polk in the same Senate district as state Sen. Chris Johnson, a fellow Hattiesburg Republican. 
The two departures come at a time when Republican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, the Senate’s presiding officer, has clashed politically with House Speaker Jason White and, at times, with Gov. Tate Reeves. The Republicans have battled over Medicaid expansion, the state’s public pension system, school choice legislation and crafting a state budget.  
Polk and Parker were two of Hosemann’s most loyal lieutenants in the 52-member chamber, so the two departures could create more political challenges for the lieutenant governor as he faces pressure from his fellow state leaders.
The last day candidates can qualify for the redistricting special elections is Monday, June 9. Party primaries will take place on August 5 and the general election is on November 4. 
Three more special elections in the Legislature will also take place soon, though they will happen on a different timeline, set by the governor, than the 14 special elections to account for redistricting: 

Sen. John Horhn, a Democrat from Jackson, will soon resign after he was elected the new mayor of Jackson 
Rep. Orlando Paden, a Democrat from Clarksdale, will soon resign because he was elected as the new mayor of Clarksdale.

Attorney General Kris Kobach says a Kansas governor is obligated to negotiate in good faith with on a tribal compact. In this image, Kelly speaks at 2024 dedication of a replica of the Ad Astra statue of a Native American pointing an arrow at the North Star. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Attorney General Kris Kobach said Gov. Laura Kelly was obligated under federal law to negotiate in good faith with the Wyandotte Nation on a compact agreement to allow operation of casino gambling, including sports betting, on tribal land.
Negotiations with the Wyandotte Nation wouldn’t violate state law applicable to operation of four nontribal casinos in Kansas nor would negotiations be inconsistent with compacts with four tribes in the casino business in Kansas, the attorney general said.
On Friday, Wyandotte Nation Chief Billy Friend said he appreciated the attorney general’s opinion affirming the tribe’s contention that state and federal statute wouldn’t interfere with the tribe seeking a gaming compact in Kansas.
“We were pleased with the opinion,” he said. “We’re looking forward to sitting down and negotiating in good faith and coming up with a fair compact.”
Kobach’s nonbinding legal opinion said the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, or IGRA, governed gaming on tribal land held by the Prairie Band Potawatomi, Sac & Fox, Kickapoo and Iowa tribes in Kansas. IGRA would likewise preempt state law related to a Wyandotte Nation request for a compact applicable to its 7th Street Casino in Wyandotte County and Cross Winds Casino near Park City in Sedgwick County, the opinion said.
Under the Kansas Expanded Lottery Act, or KELA, the opinion said the state’s jurisdiction over gambling activities was confined to four casinos outside of tribal land in Mulvane, Pittsburg, Dodge City and Kansas City, Kansas. These Kansas Lottery facilities operated through management contracts with private companies. KELA does forbid Kansas from adding state-owned casino zones through 2032.
“Because KELA and the management contracts do not prohibit efforts that further tribal gaming under IGRA, they do not prohibit negotiating with the Wyandotte Nation over a compact,” Kobach said.
Kobach said sports wagering could be featured in a compact with the Wyandotte Nation because Kansas permitted that type of gaming at casinos across the state.
In 2022, the Legislature and Kelly granted the four state-owned casinos an opportunity to operate sports books. Since 2023, the Iowa, Sac & Fox and Prairie Band Potawatomie nations negotiated sports betting agreements with the state.
Friend, chief of the Wyandotte Nation headquartered in northeast Oklahoma, said the intent was to seek a compact with Kansas enabling the tribe to participate in sports gambling.
Justin Whitten, chief counsel to the governor, sought the attorney general’s insight into the intersection of IGRA and KELA. The request reflected government and industry concern about potential violation of state management contracts with nontribal casinos.
“A compact with the Wyandotte Nation would not fall under, and would not violate, KELA,” Kobach said. “And, because federal law trumps state law, to the extent there is any conflict between IGRA and Kansas Statutes Annotated 46-2305, IGRA prevails.”
Under the existing system of developing gaming compacts in Kansas, a tribe would begin by requesting negotiations with the governor. The negotiated compact documents would be submitted to the Legislature for consideration. If approved, the compact agreement would be forwarded for review to the U.S. Department of Interior.
Kobach said the U.S. Supreme Court weakened IGRA’s central mechanism for getting states to negotiate with tribes by holding IGRA didn’t abrogate state sovereign immunity.
“This means that if the state does not negotiate with the Wyandotte Nation, or if the Wyandotte Nation believes the state is not negotiating in good faith, the state can invoke its sovereign immunity against any resulting suit by the tribe,” Kobach said.
While a tribe might not successfully pursue a lawsuit against the state of Kansas, Kobach’s opinion said, the federal government could take legal action on behalf of a tribe to sidestep a sovereign immunity defense.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kelly-with-Kansa-sculpture-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-06 13:07:58.578141

Beachler recently filed a civil lawsuit against the woman, Stefanie Boone, who is associated with the group Moms for Liberty, which specifically advocates against school curricula involving LGBTQ+ content and themes.
The harassment Beachler experienced, and the back-and-forth legal battle that is now playing out as a result, was just one more instance of Michigan libraries and librarians facing attacks from right-wing groups dedicated to excising LGBTQ+ related materials from their shelves.
Earlier this week, Michigan Advance highlighted additional efforts in Hartland and in Lapeer to sequester, move or label materials conservative library board members have deemed inappropriate for children – and many with LGBTQ+ characters or content.
But for Beachler, the legal fight she’s facing in Lowell is personal.

Parents have several options to work with the district to ensure they have oversight over the books their children read, Beachler said. There are opportunities to challenge books in the library, a path to require permission to check out books, and other options to direct students away from consuming media their parents might disagree with.
But Boone’s actions have gone beyond that, as she has read excerpts from books out of context at school board meetings, Beachler said, and posted floods of untrue statements about her on Facebook saying she provides pornography to minors, all culminating in Beachler filing a civil lawsuit against Boone on May 13.
“It’s just really hard to talk about. That’s why I’ve actually been working from home a lot. … I mean being called a groomer, being called a pedophile, I was called a whore, a smut peddler,” Beachler said. “I’ve been an educator for 37 years and how can somebody call somebody that name that has invested their life in working with kids? It’s very hurtful and obviously untrue.”
Last June, Boone filed her own lawsuit against Beachler, as well as the school district and several school employees for what she says are violations of her parental rights to challenge indoctrination of students.
Boone is being represented by former Republican Michigan attorney general candidate and attorney Matt DePerno, who is currently facing felony charges for reported mishandling of voting equipment after the 2020 election.
“[The] defendants have continued to groom children by fostering relationships that include secrecy, undue influence, control, and pushing personal boundaries,” Boone said in her lawsuit against Beachler. “[The] defendants have attempted to and have desensitized children to DEI, SEL, sex, social justice issues, alternate sex and gender ideologies, and liberal political ideology, and through manipulative behavior by showing them pornography or discussing sexual topics with them, and have introduced the idea of sexual contact.”
Lapeer library board mulls age restrictions on materials despite shaky legal ground 

Boone did not return a request for comment at the time of this story’s publication.
The years of false statements and accusations published on Facebook posts and through public comments at school board meetings came to a fever pitch in February. Beachler said Boone interrupted a tour Beachler was leading a tour alongside two students of a large-scale renovation of a school library to ask where the mature section was. Beachler’s lawsuit said Boone filmed the interaction, posting the video with the caption “Which way to the PORN section please?”, which was reposted by individuals with large social media followings like former Republican gubernatorial candidate Garrett Soldano.
“I put up with it for five years. I sent a cease and desist order and asked her to stop. It’s only amplified. It’s only gotten worse, to the point where I was getting threats,” Beachler said. “Half of my hair fell out and I’ve broken several of my teeth from grinding my teeth and I couldn’t even work for quite a while because I just couldn’t come here without even crying.”
In the nearly four decades Beachler has worked in education, Beachler said never before has there been such disrespect and dishonesty when it comes to criticisms of educators. And as Michigan faces a teacher shortage in schools that are already struggling to catch kids up on learning losses from the COVID-19 pandemic, Beachler said misinformation campaigns about the books kids have access to at school take time away from the learning experience.
Anyone has the right to talk about how much they disapprove of a book, Beachler said, and Boone can post all she wants on Facebook about how she hates what’s in the school library. That’s her First Amendment right, Beachler noted. But that’s not what Boone’s rhetoric or lawsuit is about, she added: it’s about destroying trust in public schools at any cost.
Lowell is a tight-knit small town community, which Beachler said is filled with “very wonderful people” who lean conservatively, but in general don’t expect people to conform to their own beliefs. There have been, however, some members of the Lowell community that believed what Boone was selling them, especially grandparents, Beachler said.

Some of the books that were being brought to their attention, with passages read out of context, aren’t even in the school library, Beachler said. And when Boone posted her video in February, Beachler said there was a switch in the community who did not support the calls for violence against her.
Several members from the community stood up during the packed March 10 Lowell Area Schools Board of Education meeting following Boone’s video posting, who extolled their disgust for the mistreatment of the librarian with calls for civility in conversations about books.
“So much of this is being done … straight from the Moms for Liberty people. It has been done from a Christian movement, and the behavior and the way that they have treated me is so anti-Christ, it’s been so the opposite of how a Christian person would treat somebody, with respect and truth,” Beachler said. “We can have a difference of opinion. That’s absolutely fine, and you have the right to make those decisions for your children, but again, to be mean-spirited and say untrue things about a person and call them … horrific names has been incredibly hurtful to me and to my family.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-120619990-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-06 12:21:02.525624

(Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz and legislative leaders have a signed agreement for a special legislative session on Monday, with the goal of passing 14 already agreed-upon bills in one day, according to a document obtained by the Reformer.
The long-awaited special session comes after weeks of behind-closed-doors meetings between Walz, House Speaker Lisa Demuth, House DFL caucus leader Melissa Hortman and Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy after the Legislature adjourned on May 19 without passing a biennium budget. The agreement suggests that leaders have whipped enough votes from their caucuses to pass the bills.
The agreement states that lawmakers will vote on just 14 bills, which are mostly budget bills. However, lawmakers will also pass a standalone bill to strip MinnesotaCare from undocumented adults, as well a bill specifically about financial inducements for the development of data centers, though the agreement doesn’t elaborate on the details.
The special session agreement was signed by all caucus leaders, including Senate GOP Minority Leader Mark Johnson, who refrained from signing a previously announced budget agreement last month. Johnson said in May that the agreement fell short of what was required for a bipartisan budget.
Lawmakers during the special session will not be able to make amendments to the 14 bills on the floor, except as previously agreed to.
But the agreement suggests legislators may not have time to fully read the bills, some of which will be hundreds of pages long.
“The finalized bills will be conveyed to the House and Senate on Monday, June 9, 2025, and must be voted upon or passed by both bodies before 7:00 a.m. on Tuesday, June 10, 2025,” the agreement states.
The bills include a tax and local aid bill and a capital investment bill — two pieces of legislation that were on shaky ground throughout the weeks-long budget negotiations.
No other bills other than those listed in the agreement will be considered.
The one-day mandate is a tall order for lawmakers, many of whom are used to making long floor speeches.
Hortman late last month said House Democrats will want to make speeches on the floor about the bill to strip MinnesotaCare from undocumented adults to justify their no votes, though she said she’s confident the work can be done in one day.

(Photo by Wichayada Suwanachun/Getty Images)As a physician, I have witnessed firsthand the inefficiencies in our health care system that make it harder for patients to access the care they need. One of these complexities patients now have to navigate is a growing industry of insurance middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), whose practices meddling in our local health system increase health care costs and block access to critical medications.
PBMs work between health insurance companies and drug manufacturers to negotiate lower drug prices for the health plans they represent. Their function and influence in the health care industry have evolved significantly, and today, PBMs operate with very little oversight or transparency and their decisions are often based on what is most profitable for a health plan rather than what is best for a patient.
PBMs wield significant influence over what treatments patients can access and how much they will be required to pay. These middlemen receive significant rebates and discounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers for the cost of medications and treatments after negotiations, but they don’t pass those savings on to patients receiving the care, increasing what patients are required to pay out of pocket when they pick up their medication at the pharmacy counter.
PBMs can also require only certain drugs be covered by a health plan, impose arbitrary rules around access to provider-prescribed medications, and PBM revenue is often directly linked to the list price of a medicine, so PBMs are incentivized to recommend treatments that would yield the most profit.
The three largest PBMs – CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx – manage nearly 80% of prescription drug claims for 270 million people across the country. To make matters worse, PBMs are increasingly integrating and consolidating with other health care services, including distributors and pharmacies, making the influence PBMs hold over the health care system even larger. As these for-profit entities merge and collaborate, it’s unclear if the system is actually functioning in the best interest of patients regarding quality and cost of care.
PBMs have flown under the radar for far too long, but scrutiny of these middlemen and their impact on our health care system has rightfully grown in recent years, with many federal and state policymakers and regulators calling attention to the outsized role PBMs play in driving up health care costs. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that PBM integration with chain pharmacies and insurers has allowed them to dominate the broader health system and that PBMs have significant control over what drugs are available to patients and how much they are required to pay.
The FTC even filed suit against the three of the nation’s largest PBMs, citing their anticompetitive tactics as a barrier to health care access. In addition, numerous investigations found that PBMs often act in their own financial interest, including pushing patients toward drugs with higher out-of-pocket costs because it’s more profitable for the PBM.
Access to consistent treatments is necessary for Louisiana patients, particularly those living with chronic health conditions or hard-to-treat illnesses such as cancer. Each year, more than 25,000 Louisianans receive a new cancer diagnosis. Alleviating access and financial barriers to care is a necessary step to improving health outcomes for patients.
It is overwhelmingly clear that we must take action to reform PBM practices to improve access to care for patients and stop letting middlemen meddle in our health system. There has never been a time when we can do more for patients as doctors, but at the same time, there has never been a time when we have more complexities in the health care systems impede healthcare access and affordability. This “profit over patients” business model is putting critical care out of reach for many Louisiana patients. Time is overdue to curb harmful PBM practices.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/health-care-stock-image-1024x618.jpg,,,2025-06-06 12:21:02.525624

We need spaces where Black women don’t have to shrink themselves just to get by.,"You know that saying, “Things aren’t like they used to be”? 
It hits different every time, especially when it’s used to downplay what Black women are still dealing with today. Honestly, not enough has changed. Right here in Connecticut, just like everywhere else, Black women are still fighting to be seen, heard and taken seriously.
People love to point at “progress” like it’s some magic fix. They’ll drop a few names of successful Black women in politics or Hollywood, like that’s supposed to erase centuries of harm. But real life for most of us isn’t a trending topic or a feel-good headline. It’s daily. It’s constant. And it shows a way bigger problem hiding behind those few success stories.


Being overlooked isn’t just about feeling bummed out; it has real-life consequences. In serious moments, like medical emergencies, it can mean delayed treatment and serious trouble. You see this a lot in healthcare. There’s this unconscious bias about Black women and how we experience pain. When our safety or basic needs are ignored, this lack of attention can lead to unfairness in getting important resources, showing that being invisible can sadly become a matter of life and death.
This also happens at work, where we get praised for working hard but somehow always get passed over for promotions. It’s in our schools, where Black girls get labeled as “trouble” and don’t get the same understanding as other kids. Over and over, we hear, “Well, at least it’s better now,” and it’s like a slap in the face. 

Xyania Clarke
And I’m asking you: Better than what? 
Better doesn’t mean good enough. Better doesn’t mean equal.
But for some reason, that’s where everyone stops. Even in Connecticut, a state that loves to call itself progressive, Black women’s struggles barely make it into the conversation. DEI panels and hashtags sound nice, but how often do they actually focus on us? How often do they talk about what it’s like to move through the world being both Black and a woman?
I’ll tell you: Not enough.
The hard truth is, society expects us to be strong enough to carry the world’s weight, but not too strong, so we don’t make anyone uncomfortable. We’re supposed to be the backbone, the peacemakers, the ones who show up for everyone else while getting the bare minimum in return.
And the second we speak up, we get hit with, “It’s not that bad, everybody struggles,” or “You’re being too sensitive,” basically telling Black women to be grateful because “Things aren’t as bad as they used to be.” It’s just another way of telling us to shut up. And we’re over it!
So, here’s the deal: Yeah, we can see that some things have changed — but that doesn’t mean the work is done. Progress doesn’t always mean fairness, and right now, things still aren’t fair for everyone.
We can celebrate the wins without pretending the system isn’t still working against us. In Connecticut and everywhere else, it’s time to stop checking boxes and start making real, lasting changes that truly focus on and support Black women —not just with words, but with actual steps.
We don’t need more empty slogans. We don’t need another panel that goes nowhere. We need healthcare providers who actually listen to us. Employers who promote us because we’ve earned it, not just to make their team look diverse. We need schools that lift up Black girls instead of putting them in boxes with old, biased ideas. We need spaces where Black women don’t have to shrink themselves just to get by. Because “better than it used to be” is still not good enough — and we deserve so much more than that.

Along with punishing the 14 states that use their own funds to cover immigrants who are here illegally, analysts say last-minute changes to the bill would make it all but impossible for states to continue helping some immigrants who are in the country legally, on humanitarian parole.
Under the bill, the federal government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole — immigrants who have received permission to temporarily enter the United States due to an emergency or urgent humanitarian reason.
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering adults without children who are eligible under Medicaid expansion, but the bill would cut that to 80% for those states, doubling the state portion from 10% to 20%. That’s the same penalty the bill proposes for states that use their own money to help immigrants who are here illegally.
Ironically, states such as Florida that have extended Medicaid coverage to immigrants who are here on humanitarian parole but have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would not be harmed by the bill, said Leonardo Cuello, a Medicaid law and policy expert and research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

It is “wildly nonsensical and unfair” to penalize expansion states for covering a population that some non-expansion states, such as Florida, also cover, Cuello said. “It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.”
West Virginia is one of the states where lawmakers are nervously watching U.S. Senate discussions on the proposed penalty. Republican state Rep. Matt Rohrbach, a deputy House speaker, said West Virginia legislators tabled a proposal that would have ended Medicaid expansion if the federal government reduced its share of the funding, because the state’s congressional representatives assured them it wasn’t going to happen. Now the future is murkier.
Cuello called the proposed penalty “basically a gun to the head of the states.”
“Congress is framing it as a choice, but the state is being coerced and really has no choice,” he said.
There are about 1.3 million people in the United States on humanitarian parole, from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ukraine and Venezuela as well as some Central American children who have rejoined family here. The Trump administration is trying to end parole from some of those countries. A Supreme Court decision May 30 allows the administration to end humanitarian parole for about 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
Not many of those parolees qualify for Medicaid, which requires a waiting period or special status, but the 40 states with expanded Medicaid could be penalized anyway when they do start accepting them as they begin to qualify, said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.










It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.


– Leonardo Cuello, Georgetown University research professor


Meanwhile, an increasing number of states and the District of Columbia already are considering scaling back Medicaid coverage for immigrants because of the costs.
The federal budget bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is now being considered by the Senate, where changes are likely. The fact that so many states could be affected by the last-minute change could mean more scrutiny in that chamber, said Andrea Kovach, senior attorney for health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law in Chicago.
By her count, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia would be affected by the new restrictions, since they accepted some options now offered by Medicaid to cover at least some humanitarian parolees without a five-year waiting period.
“They’re all going to be penalized because they added in parolees,” Kovach said. “So that’s 38 times two senators who are going to be very interested in this provision to make sure their state doesn’t get their reimbursement knocked down.”
The change to exclude people with humanitarian parole was included in a May 21 amendment by U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who chairs the House budget committee. Arrington’s office did not reply to a request for comment, though he has stressed the importance of withholding Medicaid from immigrants who are here illegally.
Need to go to the hospital? Texas and Florida want to know your immigration status.

“[Democrats] want to protect health care and welfare at any cost for illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,” Arrington said in a May 22 floor speech urging passage of the bill. “But by the results of this last election, it’s abundantly clear: The people see through this too and they have totally rejected the Democrats’ radical agenda.”
Some states already are considering cutting Medicaid coverage for immigrants, though Democratic lawmakers and advocates are pushing back.
Washington, D.C., Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has proposed phasing out a program that provides Medicaid coverage to adults regardless of their immigration status, a move she says would save the District of Columbia $457 million.
Minnesota advocates protested a state budget deal reached last month with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to phase out health care coverage for adults who are here illegally, a condition Republican lawmakers insisted on to avoid a shutdown.
Similarly, Illinois advocates are protesting new state rules that will end a program that has provided Medicaid coverage to immigrants aged 42-64 regardless of their legal status. The program cost $1.6 billion over three years, according to a state audit. The state will continue a separate program that provides coverage for older adults.
“Our position is that decision-makers in Illinois shouldn’t be doing Trump’s work for him,” said Kovach, of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. “Let’s preserve health coverage for immigrants and stand up for Illinois immigrant residents who have been paying taxes into this state for years and need this coverage.”
Illinois state Sen. Graciela Guzmán, a Democrat whose parents are refugees from El Salvador, said many of her constituents in Chicago may be forced to cancel chemotherapy or lifesaving surgery because of the changes.
“It was a state budget, but I think the federal reconciliation bill really set the tone for it,” Guzmán said. “In a tough fiscal environment, it was really hard to set up a defense for this program.”
More States Offer Health Coverage to Immigrant Children

Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek is among the governors holding firm, saying that letting immigrants stay uninsured imposes costs on local hospitals and ends up raising prices for everyone.
“The costs will go somewhere. When everyone is insured it is much more helpful to keep costs down and reasonable for everyone. That’s why we’ve taken this approach to give care to everyone,” Kotek said at a news conference last month.
Medicaid does pay for emergency care for low-income patients, regardless of their immigration status, and that would not change under the federal budget bill.
Franny White, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said her state’s Medicaid program covers about 105,000 immigrants, some of whom are here illegally. She said the policy, established by a 2021 state law, can save money in the long run.
“Uninsured people are less likely to receive preventive care due to cost and often wait until a condition worsens to the point that it requires more advanced, expensive care at an emergency department or hospital,” she said.
California was among the first states, along with Oregon, to offer health insurance to immigrants of all ages regardless of their legal status. But it now is considering cutting back, looking to save $5 billion as it seeks to close a $12 billion budget deficit. In May, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment of immigrant adults who are here illegally, and charging them premiums to save money.
“It’s possible that other states will decide to cut back these services because of budgetary concerns,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research organization.
If the federal budget bill passes with the immigrant health care provision intact, states would have more than two years to adjust, since the changes would not take effect until October 2027.
“We have time to really understand what the landscape looks like and really create a legal argument to make sure folks are able to maintain their health care coverage,” said Enddy Almonord, director for Healthy Illinois, an advocacy group supporting universal health care coverage.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-06 16:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,No-fault eviction bill failed a third time in CT. Renters say housing situation is dire,James Watson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/06/ct-just-cause-eviction-housing-shortage/,"Advocates fear CT's low housing vacancy rate incentivizes landlords to evict lower-income tenants — which, in turn, drives up homelessness.","In Connecticut, landlords must legally have “just cause” in order to evict a tenant who is either over 62 years old or has a disability. That includes not paying rent, not abiding by the rental contract, engaging in certain illegal activities or putting other tenants’ health or safety at risk. 
For years, tenants and their advocates have been urging lawmakers to extend those protections to all renters in the state.
The proposal has now failed three years in a row. 
Meanwhile, the situation is growing more urgent, proponents say. Connecticut faces an estimated lack of 110,000 housing units to meet demand. The vacancy rate for housing in Connecticut is 7% for this year, well below the national average of 11%, according to researchers with consultancy ECOnorthwest. 
Advocates fear that’s incentivizing landlords to evict lower-income tenants — which, in turn, drives up homelessness among the state’s most vulnerable groups. 
“If we don’t do something in the next few years, the situation is not going to get better,” said David Rich, a homelessness advocate and president of the Housing Collective, a nonprofit dedicated to creating more affordable housing and ending homelessness in the state.
Last year, 3,410 individuals in the state experienced homelessness — a 13% increase from the year before, according to the CT Homeless Management Information System, which conducts an annual “point-in-time” census of the state’s unhoused population. It was the third year in a row Connecticut’s homeless population rose.
The increase is also affecting younger people. Data from the point-in-time count shows that among the 2024 homeless population, approximately 700 were children. 
For many lower-income families in Connecticut, available housing units often aren’t affordable. The vast majority of the state, 90%, is zoned for ‘single-family’ housing, as opposed to more-affordable multi-family complexes, according to a report known as the Connecticut Zoning Atlas. Even new multi-family construction is often out of reach for lower-income renters, given the high cost of construction.
Rents have also been rising in Connecticut since the COVID-19 pandemic, housing experts say. The problem is exacerbated by the lack of supply and growing demand.
“Many people are working and still can’t afford rents. They need subsidies to keep them afloat,” said Kellyann Day, chief executive of New Reach, a nonprofit in Connecticut addressing housing insecurity. Day said advocacy can only go so far; she believes renters — particularly women and minorities in urban areas — need statutory protections against eviction.
This year, lawmakers put forth House Bill 6889, the latest attempt to extend tenant protections. But the bill died before coming up for a vote in the House. 
The General Assembly did pass a sprawling measure tackling zoning, homelessness and fair rent commissions. The bill seeks to increase housing supply by offering towns prioritization for funding if they change their zoning to make it easier to build multifamily housing and increases the number of fair rent commissions, which are local bodies that can make legal rulings on whether rent increases are acceptable. Many called it the most significant housing legislation in years. 
No-fault eviction protections didn’t make the cut. Critics of the concept were concerned it would make it difficult for landlords to evict problem tenants.

Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, ranking member of the Housing Committee, described the proposal as creating “barriers for housing providers,” deterring landlords from entering the housing market and thus further restricting available units.  
“Taking tools away from landlords, that’s onerous and punitive,” Sampson said. 
Landlords contend that “lapse of time” evictions — which allow a landlord to terminate a lease when the contract’s term has come to an end — are a necessary tool for removing tenants who repeatedly engage in destructive or illegal behavior. 
“There needs to be something in place for a quick eviction if tenants are not properly maintaining a property,” said Jeff Feroni, President of Trio Properties, a Glastonbury real estate firm with a focus in commercial multi-family complexes.
“It’s not really an eviction. It’s just me trying to get back my property. It is a graceful way to end a contract between two people,” said John Souza, Hartford County Landlord and president of the Coalition of Property Owners, an organization dedicated to helping landlords across the state.
Lawmakers and landlords both worry that excess legislation for tenant protections will create a climate that is untenable for landlords to keep renting.
Jessica Doll, executive director of the Connecticut Apartment Association, said the stress should be on growing housing and not targeting landlords. Others also said that a debate around landlords’ agency over properties they own was not useful to addressing the needs of vulnerable tenants in the state.
“Our goal is never to have vacancies, it is always to have long term tenants,” she said.

Negotiating positions
Renters — particularly those who are lower-income — say they feel they’re at a relative disadvantage when they need to work out issues with their landlords.
Advocacy groups, including the Connecticut Tenants Union, New Reach, Make The Road and All In, say protections are needed so people have the ability to raise concerns about poor conditions — such as doors that don’t lock, lack of heat or sewage issues — without feeling they’re risking eviction or a non-renewal of their lease.
Julian Eileen, long time renter at the Manor House Apartment Complex in Bloomfield and one of the leaders of the Manor House Tenant’s Union, said certain landlords try to “blame the victim.” 
When landlords initiate eviction proceedings, many lower-income tenants can’t afford legal representation — which also puts them at a disadvantage, advocates say. 
“The vast, vast majority of tenants still go through the eviction process unrepresented,” said Luke Melanokos-Harrison, vice president of the Connecticut Tenants’ Union. Trying to represent one’s self, while also trying to find housing, is particularly challenging, he said.
Jay Osborne, a social worker and advocate, said his landlord took him to court three times for eviction. Osborne has a disability, and is protected under the current regulations from no-fault eviction. Still, he lost all three cases in court. 
Following an ongoing legal battle, Osborne founded the Windham Mills Connecticut Tenant’s Union to protect tenants in his building who were subject to ‘lapse of time’ evictions, with leases not being renewed.
“There is a big problem in the state,” he said. “There are over a million renters in the state and most of them don’t know their rights.”
In 2020, COVID shifted landlord-tenant dynamics temporarily, with moratoriums on evictions and emergency rent assistance programs. But when those came to an end, the number of people who could no longer afford to rent rose, leading to more non-payment evictions and contributing to the rise in homelessness.
Disproportionate impacts
Amid the current strains in Connecticut’s housing market, the state’s most vulnerable communities are losing their homes.
Antoinette Humes moved out of her housing in New Haven’s East Rock neighborhood last August in order to avoid eviction proceedings after she was unable to make rent. She has been staying in a shelter and living apart from her 16-year-old son so he can continue to go to school in their former neighborhood.
“Everyone has the same story,” Humes said. “People here are working and not getting treated right by their landlords.”

Humes, a single parent, said she doesn’t feel that members of the legislature see her plight clearly — if they did, they’d do something, she said. “I have a pressure that sits with me all day long. I don’t think they voice our pain enough,” she said.
Minorities and women in urban areas have been the biggest casualties of this strain, making up the majority of homelessness cases. According to the point-in-time count, 66% of the state’s unhoused population were minorities — twice as many as those from Caucasian backgrounds, according to the point-in-time census.
A recent survey of 1,400 Black women in the Detroit area found that evictions commonly lead to poor health outcomes for individuals and their communities. The researchers found that more than a third of individuals who experienced an illegal eviction reported worse health. And those who experienced eviction before age 18 — whether court-ordered or illegal — faced higher rates of poor physical and mental health. 
Amy Eppler-Epstein, a housing attorney in Connecticut, has seen first-hand that Black women experience homelessness more than any other group in the state. “You can see certain ZIP codes where evictions are particularly concentrated,” she said.
Sarah Fox, head of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness, a nonprofit dedicated to homelessness prevention, said people of color are more likely to be renters, and are thus at a higher risk of homelessness. 
Minorities and low-income families in urban areas including New Haven, Bridgeport and Hartford, face the highest rates of evictions that lead to homelessness, advocates said. In these areas, evictions are particularly common among single mothers, like Humes, who struggle to afford rent whilst holding stable jobs and looking after children.
Advocates say they’ll be back again next year to push the General Assembly to address what they see as systemic issues driving up homelessness among the state’s most vulnerable communities.
“Until legislation is put in place, there is only so much we can do,” Osborne said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Just-cause-eviction-rally.jpg,,,2025-06-06 12:21:02.525624

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Medical experts are dismayed over a federal report’s claim that kids are overprescribed asthma medications, saying it minimizes how many lives the drugs save.
Safe treatment protocols for asthma management have been carefully studied over the years, said Dr. Perry Sheffield, a pediatrician and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
“The federal government actually has some really beautiful and clear guidelines and strategies, and things that are vetted by and carefully edited by many experts in the field,” said Sheffield, who co-directs a region of the federally funded Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units that serves New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Asthma affects more than 4.6 million American children, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s one of the most common long-term diseases in U.S. children.
The Make America Healthy Again Commission report released in late May, parts of which have been widely criticized, alleges that American children are on too much medication of various kinds, including asthma treatments.
Experts worry that the administration will set policy based on the assessment that would dissuade insurers from covering asthma prescriptions. They also say that the report’s assertions could worsen disparities that affect children’s access to those medications and undermine years of research around the drugs.

The MAHA commission has until August to release a strategy based on the findings in the report.
Black and Indigenous children as well as those living in inner cities or in lower-income households are among those with the highest rates of asthma. Pollution disproportionately shrouds communities of color and can be a trigger that exacerbates the disease.
The report’s message could heighten those disparities, said Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, a University of Texas at Austin professor and a past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Section on Allergy and Immunology.
“One thing that has been very clear is that kids of color are less likely to be appropriately managed in terms of their asthma medication management,” she said. “So a message of overprescription that is simply not supported by the evidence also could potentially exacerbate already-existing racial and ethnic disparities in asthma that we have really not made much headway on.”
The commission’s claims
The report touches on childhood prediabetes, obesity and mental health. However, firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the CDC — weren’t mentioned.
The 70-page report from the commission, chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., claims four main issues are the drivers behind childhood chronic disease: poor diet, aggregation of environmental chemicals, lack of physical activity and chronic stress, and “overmedicalization.”
Matsui and other experts said the report’s use of that word is “problematic.”
“The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma — so, they have coughing, chest tightness, wheezing — that that is not really a disease,” said Matsui. “We know for a fact that that’s a disease, and we know that it is quite treatable, quite controllable, and that it has profound impacts on the child’s day-to-day life.”
Other scientists have similarly criticized the report, saying it makes sweeping and misleading generalizations about children’s health without sufficient evidence. The White House corrected the report after nonprofit news outlet NOTUS found that it cited studies that didn’t exist.










The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma … that that is not really a disease. We know for a fact that that's a disease.


– Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, University of Texas at Austin professor


When it comes to asthma, the report says, “Asthma controller prescriptions increased 30% from 1999-2008.” That sentence originally cited a broken link to a study from 2011; the link was later replaced. Controller meds include inhalers.The MAHA report also claims that “There is evidence of overprescription of oral corticosteroids for mild cases of asthma.” The original version of the report listed estimated percentages of oral corticosteroids overuse, citing a nonexistent study. The wording was changed and the citation was later replaced with a link to a 2017 study by pediatric pulmonologist Dr. Harold Farber.
The study was not a randomized controlled trial, which increases reliability. Farber told NOTUS that the report made an “overgeneralization” of his research. Stateline also reached out to Farber, whose public relations team declined an interview request.
Oral corticosteroids are liquid or tablet medications used to reduce inflammation for conditions including allergies, asthma, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. For asthma, they’re used to treat severe flare-up episodes. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America says the medications have been shown to reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and that while they do come with risk of side effects, they’re mostly used in acute flare-ups. And while rare, asthma-related deaths in kids do occur, and are often preventable.
“Asthma medications, including oral steroids, are lifesaving,” said Dr. Elizabeth Friedman, a pediatrician at Children’s Mercy Kansas City. “I believe that physicians, not politicians, are best equipped and most effectively trained to make the determination of whether or not these medications are needed for our patients.”
Friedman worries that federal characterizations of asthma meds will affect how state Medicaid agencies cover the drugs. When Medicaid coverage changed for a common prescribed inhaler last year, many of her Missouri Medicaid patients were suddenly without the drug. They ended up hospitalized, she said.
Friedman directs Region 7 of the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units, a network of experts that works to address reproductive and children’s environmental health issues. Region 7 provides outreach and education in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska.
She also said she’s concerned that the report is “making a broad, sweeping statement based on one epidemiologic study from one state.”
Increased use
An increase in inhaler prescriptions is not necessarily a bad thing, experts say. It’s a sign that kids are getting their medication.
There has been an increase in inhaler prescriptions, along with a corresponding decrease in the oral corticosteroids, which is what experts would want to see, said Chelsea Langer, bureau chief of the New Mexico Department of Health’s Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau. She said that means kids are “following their asthma action plans and taking the controller medications to prevent needing the relief or treatment [oral] meds.”

Asthma prevalence has increased over the years, meaning more people need medication, noted Dr. Alan Baptist, division head of Allergy and Clinical Immunology at Henry Ford Health in Michigan.
He said that because steroid tablets come with risk of side effects, it is best to limit them.
But for kids without access to a regular pediatric provider or to health insurance that covers an inhaler, cost can be an obstacle, he said. Fluticasone propionate, an FDA-approved medicine for people 4 and older, costs on average $200 or more for one inhaler without insurance.
“What often happens with kids, and especially kids who are in Medicaid, or who are in an underserved or disadvantaged population, they are not given appropriate asthma controller medication,” said Baptist, who helped write federal guidelines for asthma treatment best practices as part of a National Institutes of Health committee.
Baptist noted that while he was glad to see pollution mentioned in the report as a danger for kids, it’s at odds with the recent cuts to environmental health grants that aimed to address such asthma triggers.
“They’re somewhat cherry-picking some of the data that they’re putting down,” he said. “It says the U.S. government is ‘committed to fostering radical transparency and gold-standard science’ to better understand the potential cumulative impacts of environmental exposure. If that’s what they’re saying, then they should be funding even greater studies that look at the effects.”
Dr. Priya Bansal, an Illinois pediatrician and past president of the Illinois Society of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, said she’s concerned the report doesn’t define mild, moderate or severe asthma to differentiate the different best-practice treatment plans.
Bansal also said she worries that federal officials’ characterization of an FDA-approved drug will lead to insurance companies refusing to cover inhalers or oral steroids for her patients who rely on them.
“I’m going to be worried about coverage for my asthmatics,” she said. “The question is, what’s the next move that they’re going to make? If they think that, are they going to now say, ‘Hey, we’re not going to cover inhalers for mild asthmatics’?”

You can read more about the section here.

With graduation season upon us, I can’t help but be proud of the next generation of leaders. Each cap and gown represents not just an achievement, but a hope for the future and for a better Mississippi.
But graduation season has been overshadowed when I read about the freeze of $137 million in federal funds promised to Mississippi schools. My mind drifts to the death of Harvey Johnson Jr. It may not be easy to see the connection between the shooting of a 15-year-old and a school budget cut, but for me — as a district attorney for nearly a decade — the consequences are painfully personal.
A cut in school funding isn’t just a line in a report. It means fewer resources, fewer safeguards and more young lives at risk.  Lives like Harvey’s.
Harvey was caught in a battle between the streets and the schools—and the streets won. One Sunday afternoon in Columbus in 2022, he found himself with a man nearly 15 years older than him, Tommy Flowers Jr. They were drinking and using drugs together until Tommy decided to settle a score. He took Harvey along, handed him a Taurus 9mm and had him fire round after round at a house where he had a beef with the occupants.

What Tommy failed to prepare Harvey for was that the young men in that house were armed too — “Second Amendment ready,” as people like to say. One of them had an AR-style rifle and returned fire so quickly and heavily that it didn’t take long before Harvey was hit and killed.
During the trial, my focus was on holding Mr. Flowers accountable for leading Harvey to his death. The idea that a nearly 30-year-old man would get a teenager drunk and high, arm him with a gun and take him to attack a home he knew was likely to respond with bullets so enraged me that it was difficult to think about anything else. The jury agreed. I moved on to the next case. In my work, there is no finish line.
But when I read about the freeze in federal education funding, the Harvey case came rushing back–not just the facts, but the warning it carries.
What $137 million can do for Mississippi’s schools is not hypothetical. It’s real support: school counselors who notice when a student starts slipping; after-school programs that keep kids safe until their parents are home; mentors, mental health staff and trained resource officers who de-escalate conflict instead of inflaming it. It’s guidance and structure that can help a 15-year-old imagine a future that doesn’t involve a gun.
According to Mississippi Today, about 70 school districts across the state are set to lose these desperately needed funds. The Jackson Public Schools District alone stands to lose $4.5 million. Of that, $3.62 million was set aside for urgently needed construction, and nearly $1 million was planned for instructional support. Other districts had allocated their money toward literacy programs, math tutoring, mental health services and classroom technology. That money was already budgeted—already spoken for.
The shooting that ended Harvey’s life happened on a Sunday. But the choices that led to it happened every day before that — in classrooms without enough adults to care, in neighborhoods without safe places to gather, in homes stretched too thin to fill the gaps.
If we care about liberty, if we care about life, we must care about what our schools can actually provide.
This funding freeze isn’t just a bureaucratic decision. It’s a threat to the only institutions standing between some of our most vulnerable kids and a world full of people like Tommy Flowers who see them as disposable. We may never know exactly what could have saved Harvey, but we know what didn’t: indifference, underfunding and too many missed chances.
As we celebrate graduation achievements, we must remember that the next generation deserves the opportunity to succeed. The next Harvey is already out there. We still have time to save him — but only if we give our schools what they need to reach him first. We owe that to him.  We owe it to our next generation of leaders.

(AP) — It’s a small part in a big movie, but for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, their scene in “Sinners” is a huge deal.
The horror movie blockbuster, starring Michael B. Jordan as a gangster turned vampire slayer, paints a brief but impactful portrait of the tribe using Choctaw actors and cultural experts. For some, it’s the first time they’ve seen the Choctaw way of life accurately portrayed on the big screen.
In the scene, a posse of Choctaw, riding on horseback and in an old truck, arrives at a small farmhouse to warn the couple that lives there of coming danger. When the couple refuses their help, a Choctaw man wishes them luck in his native language before riding off.
“I’ve not seen another movie that has our language, like, spoken correctly,” said Cynthia Massey, a cultural consultant for “Sinners.”
Massey runs the tribe’s Chahta Immi Cultural Center alongside Sherrill Nickey and department director Jay Wesley. All three were hired as cultural consultants to ensure a genuine depiction of the tribe in the film. Together, they sifted through archives, researching how their ancestors would have dressed, spoken and acted in the 1930s, when “Sinners” takes place.
“I was honored and humbled by the fact that they wanted a true representation,” said Wesley, who also acted in the movie.
Wesley connected the filmmakers to Choctaw actors and artifacts like the beaded sashes the Choctaw characters wear in the movie. Those sashes are now part of a “Sinners” display at the cultural center.

The movie’s introduction also features a short snippet of a Choctaw war chant, performed by Wesley’s daughter, Jaeden Wesley, who is a student at the University of California, Los Angeles. While recording, Jaeden Wesley said the filmmakers told her they wanted the Choctaw people to hear their music in the movie.
“We were catering to our own people, even in that short little second,” Jaeden Wesley said.
Shining a spotlight on often overlooked cultures and topics, like the Choctaw people, is part of the mission at Proximity Media, which produced “Sinners.” The company was founded by “Sinners” director Ryan Coogler, his wife and film producer, Zinzi Coogler, and producer Sev Ohanian.
“It was never a question for us that if we were going to portray the Mississippi Choctaw, we got to have the right people who can tell us, who can tell Ryan, what we’re not knowing, what we’re not thinking,” Ohanian said. “It was all because we’re trying to serve Ryan’s story of like putting truth on screen.”
Ohanian and his co-founders didn’t stop with Choctaw consultants; they enlisted a small army of experts who advised on the confluence of cultures mingling in the Mississippi Delta, where the film is set. The resulting cinematic world was so well received, community organizers penned an open letter, inviting Coogler and his fellow filmmakers to visit the Delta. Last week, the Cooglers, Ohanian and others took up the offer, attending a “Sinners” screening in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Clarksdale is where the film’s events unfold.
“I hope this encourages other filmmakers to find opportunities to be authentic in their storytelling and to look at this rich tapestry of culture that’s right here in America,” Ohanian said, noting the film industry has historically misrepresented nonwhite groups.
For Wesley and his fellow consultants, the hope is the film will cultivate curiosity in audiences, encourage them to learn more about Choctaw culture and visit the Chahta Immi Cultural Center.
“It’s important to be connected to this culture because this was here before the public was here,” Massey said. “Probably three-quarters of Mississippi was Choctaw land, and now we only have 350,000 acres.”
They say Choctaw participation in the film has cultivated a sense of pride among tribe members. Nickey hopes it will encourage a sort of cultural renaissance at a time when she says fewer and fewer Choctaw speak their native language.
“I know for a fact that there are a lot of kids out there that don’t even know how to speak our language. They only speak English,” Nickey said. “I hope they know it’s okay to speak our language.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/06103844/AP16126717205614.jpg,,,2025-06-06 12:21:02.525624

Photo by Patrick Bilow/Stowe ReporterThis story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on June 5.A years-long effort to coexist with the beavers around Memorial Park in Stowe is proving futile, according to town officials.Last week, the selectboard voted to remove a “beaver deceiver” from the park, which was installed last summer to deter the industrious animals from damming up culverts. The board also reiterated its authorization to trap beavers in the area, if necessary.The Memorial Park beavers have been busy for years, building dams that have exasperated an already-inadequate drainage system in the park. Culverts, of which there are several in Memorial Park, serve as a prime location for beaver dams, but their structures are notorious for blocking up the park’s stormwater system and worsening flooding events, which occur regularly in the area.READ MORE
In response, the town hired Skip Lisle to install beaver deceivers in Memorial Park last summer. Lisle is a Vermonter who installs his deceivers throughout the country. The contraptions deter beavers from culverts by altering the water flow at the inlet, eliminating them as a prime location for dams. They’re also designed to collect debris without interrupting water flow, but their effectiveness in this category depends on who you ask.Lisle’s deceivers were successful in driving the beavers out of Memorial Park, but they’ve been building a metropolis upstream, including a dam at least 30 feet long and eight feet high, a hut and a sizable pond.Over the weekend, during a period of heavy rain, the dam burst in one spot, releasing a rush of water that quickly overran the culverts, flooding the park’s baseball fields and reaching the cafeteria of the nearby elementary school.This is far from the first time the park has flooded, and selectboard member Nick Donza urged the board to act, saying people are starting to get frustrated when little league games are canceled due to floods, or there’s water in the school.The beavers were quick to patch up the dam and the pond filled up again almost overnight, but Harry Shepard, Stowe’s public works manager, doesn’t want to wait until the dam bursts again.To curb the impact of another flood in Memorial Park, the town removed one of Lisle’s beaver deceivers, which Shepard said was collecting debris and worsening floods, and utilized a pump to reduce the water level of the pond. The town has plans to slowly disassemble the dam this summer.Harry Shepard, Stowe’s public works director, Dan Danforth, parks superintendent, and Matt Frazee, parks and recreation director, discuss what to do with a beaver dam above Memorial Park on Friday. Photo by Patrick Bilow/Stowe Reporter“The issue with the deceivers is they compromise the hydraulic capacity of the culverts,” Shepard said.Lisle was staunch in his disagreement of that assessment and accused the town of scapegoating his devices, one of which remains in Memorial Park.Lisle said his deceivers were “mischaracterized” by Shepard to the selectboard. The deceivers aren’t the problem, he said, it’s the culverts, which are “too small and in a state of disrepair.”Shepard agreed the culverts are inadequate, but that’s the system the town is stuck with for now, he said. A multi-million-dollar project to renovate Memorial Park, including improving the park’s grading and stormwater system, is currently making its way through a gauntlet of zoning approvals, and might not even be possible considering Memorial Park’s state classification as a protected wetland. But that hasn’t eased Lisle.“This is the dumbest possible thing they could have done,” Lisle said, adding the park has been flooding since long before his devices were installed. “These are valuable devices the town is now just disposing of.”The deceivers cost the town about $17,000. When the selectboard voted to hire Lisle, it was part of a plan to entertain alternatives before the town resorted to trapping.The town has employed other tactics over the years, like installing wire around the base of trees, but Shepard and some selectboard members have indicated that cohabitation isn’t really working out.Last year, the selectboard said it would start trapping the beavers around Memorial Park if the alternatives failed, and during last week’s selectboard meeting, Donza asked, “Are we not there now?”A beaver deceiver. Photo by Gordon Miller/Stowe ReporterThe town doesn’t need additional approval from the selectboard to trap the beavers, ultimately killing them, according to town manager Charles Safford. Trapping, if it occurs, would take place during trapping season in October. Safford added the town is following guidance from the Agency of Natural Resources in dealing with the beavers.Brenna Galdenzi, president of Protect our Wildlife and a Stowe resident, has helped the town explore alternatives to trapping for years, and she doesn’t think the town did its best to assure the success of the beaver deceivers and she’s certain trapping won’t solve the problem either.According to Galdenzi, the town should have cleared the beaver deceivers of debris more frequently. Shepard said there was never a discussion about maintaining the devices after they were installed. He ticked off a long list of tasks and projects for his staff, clearing the deceivers has not been a high priority.Galdenzi said trapping isn’t a one-off action and, often, when beavers are removed from an area, a new family shows up and they can revive a dam almost overnight. If you trap once, Galdenzi said, you trap every year.The selectboard was not unanimous in its vote to remove the beaver deceiver, with Paco Aumand casting the sole nay vote.“I’m sensitive to the flooding issue,” Aumand said, “but I don’t think this solves our problem for this summer.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Beavers a dam dilemma for town public works.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Beaver-Dam2-Stowe-Reporter-060525.jpg,,,2025-06-06 12:21:02.525624

Kay Ivey on Friday appointed Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, to serve as president of the Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC).
Almond will fill the vacancy left by Twinkle Cavanaugh, who is departing for a position in President Donald Trump’s administration. The appointment is effective June 16, and Almond is set to step down from her House District 63 seat on June 15.
“Cynthia has proven to be an extremely effective public servant and leader, and I am confident the people of Alabama will be even better served when she takes the helm at the Public Service Commission,” said Ivey in a statement.
As president of the three-member commission, Almond will oversee the regulation of public utilities in the state. Critics have long accused the PSC of being passive toward the companies it oversees. Since 1982, the commission has operated under a system that guarantees utilities a profit, a process different from a formal rate hearing, where an entity must justify any rate increases.

During her time in the House, she served as vice-chair of the Ethics and Campaign Finance Committee and was a member of the Ways and Means Education, Judiciary, and Rules committees. Almond carried legislation to update public records laws in 2023 and 2024 and require state agencies to respond within a set period.
“I am honored to have been asked by Governor Ivey to fill this important position,” Almond said in a statement. “I believe my training as an attorney and legislator will prove to be helpful in performing this role.”
Prior to her time in the state Legislature, Almond served four terms on the Tuscaloosa City Council, where she was elected president pro tempore.
Almond attended Vanderbilt University and is a graduate of the University of Alabama and the University of Alabama School of Law.

(Photo by Tom Foley/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Pride Month event organizers in Iowa are seeing an increase in participation amidst national and state activity targeting the queer community. 
“People in the community that are passionate about diversity, equity and inclusion and are passionate about the LGBTQ+ community are showing up because they know this is an important time,” said Wes Mullins, executive director of Capital City Pride.
Every June, celebrations of Pride Month focus on self-affirmation, dignity, equality, increased visibility and connections within Iowa’s LGBTQ+ community, and Capital City Pride’s Pridefest is the largest LGBTQ+ annual gathering in Iowa. The focus is on the so-called “Five Pillars of Pride,” which are education, family, health and wellness, community and celebration.
Each year, Pridefest hosts the Pride Stride 5k — an event that in previous years never had more than 500 participants. This year, there are more than 750. Additionally, all of the available vendor spaces at Pridefest have been booked for the first time in the event’s history.
“One of the hardest things in the LGBTQ+ community is combatting a sense of isolation and loneliness,” Mullins said. “With the political attacks on the LGBTQ+ community that have been happening, it’s even more important to make sure people are able to connect.”
Earlier this year, Iowa became the first state to remove civil rights protections from a protected class by removing “gender identity” as a protected characteristic under the Iowa Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in employment, housing, education, credit and public accommodations. After the law goes into effect on July 1, transgender Iowans will no longer have those protections under the state’s Civil Rights Act. 
Mullins calls the revisions to the Iowa Civil Rights Act an “embarrassment.” PHC Iowa, a healthcare provider, has already closed all gender-affirming care clinics to avoid losing federal funding. A 2024 study found that state-level, anti-transgender laws can cause up to a 72% increase in suicide attempts among transgender and non-binary youth. 
“I think people have whiplash in Iowa City, seeing the things happening at the state or federal level and they say, ‘that’s not my community, that’s not what’s happening here,’ but the reality is that is happening to a lot of other folks,” said Andy Owens, executive director of Iowa City Pride.
House File 856, a bill signed into Iowa law on May 27, prohibits public entities from engaging in certain activities relating to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The new law also prohibits any state organization from attempting to promote a policy or activity that references unconscious or implicit bias, cultural appropriation, transgender ideology, group marginalization, anti-racism and many other related concepts.
Owens says the dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion on a state and federal level has had an impact on many young people in need of support. “When offices that are dedicated to support and advocacy disappear, then resources become more scarce,” he said. “That hurts.”
Legislation targeted the LGBTQ+ community
Another bill, House File 51, targeted drag shows, defined as shows in which a performer “exhibits a gender identity that is different than the performer’s gender assigned at birth.” Initially, the bill provided that anyone who brought a minor to one of the performances could be charged with a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. The bill was later revised to include an “obscene performance” definition and to make it a misdemeanor offense to take a minor aged 13 or younger to one of the performances.
Owens says in its original form the bill was “not an easy pill to swallow” and sparked fears that the organization would not be allowed to have outdoor drag performers during the festival. However, due to revisions in the bill’s final language, Iowa City Pride will proceed as planned. 
Iowa City Pride is one of the oldest Pride organizations in the country, founded just a year after the Stonewall riots in 1969. Owens said this is a “challenging” time for Iowans on the LGBTQ+ spectrum, especially trans individuals. However, he added, these times also provide “an opportunity for us to recalibrate” and maximize support. He said Pride organizations are “working even harder” to stage more events, support the community and work with other Pride organizations and advocacy groups throughout the state.
Mullins said Capital City Pride has also tried to partner with other organizations, such as lobbyists and legislative organizations — at least to the extent they can, given CCP’s status as a non-profit organization. As part of its work, CCP is connecting isolated individuals to mental health services and community organizations “in the midst of these attacks.”
Owens said he feels anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment and protest have been “drowned out by the voices of people who are supportive.” He says this year’s Pride festival is “shaping up to be the biggest one” Iowa City has ever had. Additionally, ICP has started an unofficial partnership with Coralville to expand their Pride organization and expand their community’s work beyond Iowa City.
When asked how the community can support their work, both Mullins and Owens said the same thing: show up and donate. As nonprofit organizations, much of CCP’s and ICP’s revenue consists of donations — but both organizations stress the importance of being present for Pride events. Mullins also suggests that people check in on friends and family who are members of the community to ensure everyone feels connected.
The Capital City Pridefest has events all month. The festival this weekend provides a family and youth zone for children, a teen zone, a pet pageant for “four-legged friends,” and a “Pride Ride” bike ride for members of the Iowa cycling community. 
The Iowa City Pride festival will take place on June 21 from noon to 10 p.m.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Capital-City-Pride-event.jpg,,,2025-06-06 11:19:21.057745

Activist groups, including GR Rapid Response to ICE and Movimiento Cosecha GR, say they quickly mobilized through social media, with members showing up outside the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program office to let new arrivals who were showing up for appointments know about the ICE presence, while others entered the office to warn people waiting inside.
“People who show up for check-ins were being taken anyway. This is what we’ve come to. We need to do much more to help the affected community. Still, I’m hopeful that over time, the number of people helping will increase,” Ivan Diaz, a former Kent County commissioner and candidate for Michigan senate, said in a text statement.

The arrests are just the latest by federal agents in Michigan that continue to spark concern among community members and activist groups of the increasing intensity and sweep of federal actions against the immigrant community.
Restricting legal status
Since the start of the current administration, the Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, protections for immigrants and humanitarian paroles are in danger of being removed from hundreds of thousands of foreign individuals.
Christine Sauve, from the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, told Michigan Advance that it is uncertain how many members of the community across Michigan currently live under either TPS or humanitarian parole.
“There are currently 31,500 cases pending in Detroit’s immigration court, and the majority of those cases involve individuals with parole. These individuals deserve to have their case heard and their day in court, especially if they fear persecution in their country of origin,” Sauve said.
On Monday, May 19, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way, at least for now, for the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status for 350,000 Venezuelans who arrived in the United States in 2023.
That followed a February decision by the federal government to cut similar extensions for just over half a million Haitians, leaving them vulnerable to losing their jobs and facing deportation after August.
Additionally, by the end of May, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a court order that had protected almost 500,000 Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelans immigrants with temporary legal status through what is referred to as the CHNV program, from losing their humanitarian parole protections, exposing them to possible deportation.
In an X post, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote that the decisions by the federal government are within their legal authority to revoke the temporary status granted to hundreds of thousands during the Biden Administration.
“Biden’s program violated black letter immigration law, incentivized additional illegal immigration,” Jackson wrote.
Sauve did not appear hopeful about the issue being resolved in a timely manner for those facing deportation.
“During this time, current CHNV parolees will not have a legal immigration status. Individuals utilized these legal immigration pathways in good faith, and overnight they have been rendered undocumented, unable to work, and subject to deportation.” Sauve said.
Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole are two distinct immigration protection mechanisms. TPS allows qualified nationals already present in the U.S to live and work legally for a specific period, while humanitarian parole, granted on a case-by-case basis, allows certain individuals to enter or remain in the country temporarily. They are given to individuals from countries affected by armed conflict, natural disasters, or who might face persecution.
“Many individuals with parole status have fled dangerous situations in their country of origin and have pending applications for asylum or other immigration benefits that they may be eligible for,” Sauve highlighted. “They have built lives and become part of our Michigan communities. They are our neighbors and co-workers.”

Economic consequences
Another aspect of the mass deportations promised by the federal government is the impact to Michigan’s agricultural economy in which a considerable portion of the working population is undocumented.
In March, days after half a million Haitians found their TPS extension cut, a Michigan food corporation declared their operation would be significantly affected by losing such a large number of employees. Clemens Food Group in Coldwater employs around 400 Haitian TPS holders as its workforce.
According to a report by the American Immigration Council, based on 2022 data and published in 2024, TPS holders have contributed positively to Michigan industries and paid a significant amount of taxes in the U.S.
“Forcing them to leave the country not only risks putting these individuals in danger, but also threatens to significantly disrupt local economies,” the report stated.
The council says TPS holders across the state make significant contributions to both public coffers and the private economy, including earning $57.9 million in household income, which translates into $5.2 million in state and local taxes paid, $6.7 million in federal taxes paid.
“The end of TPS and parole designations is devastating for our clients and their families, but also for their families, workplaces, and communities across Michigan,” Sauve said. “These programs are lifelines for vulnerable individuals and should not be cruelly ended prematurely, while immigration cases are still pending or conditions are still not safe for individuals to return.”

(Photo by Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Legislature is advancing legislation that would allow politicians to spend their campaign funds on a broader group of expenses, including country club memberships and gym fees, while providing less transparency about who provided the money. 

House Republican Caucus Chairman Mark Wright, R-Covington, is the sponsor of House Bill 693 and said several elected officials and campaign finance experts had input on the proposal. 

The 101-page legislation makes “little to no change in substantive law” and mostly brings “practices that have been followed for decades” into the state code, Wright said at a Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee meeting Wednesday.

Louisiana’s Ethics Administration David Bordelon, who is in charge of enforcing the state’s campaign finance laws, had a different take. While the legislation reinforces some of the state ethics board’s guidance on campaign finance, it also “undoes” previous instruction the board has issued about political spending, he said at the same meeting. 
Republican Gov. Jeff Landry is the driving force behind this massive campaign finance rewrite. Two private attorneys for Landry, Stephen Gelé and Charles Spies, helped draft the proposal. 

Gelé and Spies are representing the governor in charges he faces from the ethics board over failing to disclose trips he took on a political donor’s private plane to Hawaii in 2021. That case isn’t affected by Wright’s legislation. 

Gele said the bill is meant to correct over-enforcement of campaign finance laws. The ethics board’s aggressive posture has impeded on the public’s right to free speech and political expression, he said. 

“That right is burdened when you have to pay lawyers and accountants significant amounts of money to make sure you are complying with the law or to fight ethics complaints over the law,” Gele told lawmakers in the committee hearing.

Landry, as governor, stands to benefit more from the loosening of campaign finance restrictions than any other elected official in the state. He has more money in his campaign accounts, and his reelection campaign in 2027 will likely be the most expensive. 

Wright’s legislation makes it easier for politicians to raise money and curbs existing public disclosure of that fundraising. It also explicitly permits politicians to spend their campaign cash on expenses the ethics board has been scrutinizing.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Spending more freely

As one example, the bill would enshrine the right to spend campaign money on “events related to the Mardi Gras celebration in Washington D.C.,” a five-day celebration that takes place every year in January. Lawmakers have complained in recent months that the ethics board was questioning their Washington Mardi Gras expenses. But who the board might be scrutinizing hasn’t been disclosed publicly because its investigations are confidential. 

Senate committee members pushed back on other carve outs for campaign spending in the bill. On Wednesday, the committee removed a provision that would have allowed political funds to go toward paying parts of candidates’ home mortgages and utility bills. 
They also tweaked language in the bill permitting politicians to cover their country club dues, gym memberships and Louisiana Mardi Gras krewe fees with campaign funds. 

The Senate committee replaced the words “country club” and “health club” with “private club” in the legislation. They also added a clause requiring politicians who want to use their money for club memberships to produce “a preponderance of evidence that the expense was not for personal use.” 

This means dues for country clubs, gyms and Mardi Gras krewes could still be covered with campaign cash, but the politician might be asked to justify the expense. 

“Be very careful about using campaign funds for subsidizing your lifestyle,” said Sen. Greg Miller, R-Norco, who offered the amendment at the committee meeting. “I don’t think we want to encourage that.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Less disclosure on campaign spending

While allowing candidates to spend more freely, the bill includes provisions that would lessen the amount of information available to the public about political donations and spending. 

Wright’s legislation raises the dollar-amount threshold at which a political donation or expense has to be included on a public campaign finance report more than 20 times. 
For example, the current law requires campaign contributions and expenditures that are over $200 and given within 20 days ahead of an election to be reported on a public campaign finance report within 48 hours. The proposed law would increase that threshold to $5,000. 
Individuals who are not political candidates or explicitly with a political committee could also spend money on an election without disclosing contributions they accepted for the politicking under the legislation.

These nontraditional political campaigns would also only have to disclose campaign spending if it was over $1,000 and included “express advocacy.” In the bill, “express advocacy” is defined as political communication that features phrases like “vote for” and “defeat” or that includes the candidate’s name and the office they are seeking. 
More subtle campaign expenditures – those that don’t mention an election or involve public advertising – wouldn’t have to be disclosed by sources that aren’t overtly political. 
Initially, this legislation also eliminated all campaign finance reporting requirements for ballot proposition campaigns, such as state constitutional amendments and tax millages. Wright backed off those changes when they proved unpopular.
The bill needs at least three more votes to pass, including from the full House and Senate. Those must be taken before the legislative session ends Thursday.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-06 11:19:21.057745

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)DOVER — A recreation of a TARDIS — the blue British police box and time-traveling spaceship from “Doctor Who” — sits on a Kansas prairie with one purpose: fostering connection, both with oneself and with others.
Other art installations along a walking path in Laura Mead and Dave Kendall’s backyard in Dover form a meditative journey and, like their well-attended virtual town hall in February for an absent U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, represent the couple’s mission to reignite dialogue.
There are a few other literal and figurative bells and whistles — the TARDIS leads to an artistic interpretation of the spaceship, complete with a console, for example.

Mead hears a common response to their work: “I feel less alone.”
“People are longing to feel connected. They’re longing to feel a part of something, and shared values,” Mead said. “As we become more isolated in these bubbles, it becomes harder to even talk to people who think differently. It’s hard to find them.” 
The virtual town hall they hosted lasted two and a half hours, which signaled to them that Kansans are looking for a space to talk. As a next step, they’re producing a forthcoming podcast about how government changes affect people’s lives. At the town hall, both Republicans and Democrats shared their lived experiences.
Mead sees the value of diverse opinions and perspectives reflected back in the prairie — but also the harm of negativity.
During a walk through the prairie, she pointed to a small patch of land with about a dozen types of plants. Farther down the path, closer to the highway and before the art installations, an invasive species had taken over a stretch. The couple consulted with specialists and sprayed the grass with chemicals, which stopped the spread.
  The brown patches show where an invasive species began to take over and was killed with chemicals, turning the grass brown. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)
“This just blows my mind,” Mead said. “There are seed banks underground where these seeds can last for 50 or more years. And if the conditions are right, they just bloom. And unfortunately, metaphorically, I think the conditions are right right now for some of the less established parts of human nature to bloom.”
Their property is a registered agritourism site, and they offer free appointments to walk the trails. Mead has seen people who were initially resistant to the walk, usually brought there by an eager partner, return more connected with themselves. 
Mead gestured toward a white bench nestled between two trees. She recalled an older man who had been unsure about joining the walk but was eventually persuaded by his wife. Mead said the man sat on the bench for about 30 minutes and upon return shared that he had been able to truly listen to himself. 
“In this liminal space we’re in, there’s an opportunity for some of our best qualities to bloom,” Mead said. “I think there is a basic human goodness. And if we can create the right environment, that will arise.”
Kendall, who has written opinion columns for Kansas Reflector, grew up on a Kansas farm. After some time in California, he returned. Mead grew up in Vermont, then moved to the prairie — a part of the world where both Kendall and Mead feel a connection. Kendall is especially worried about the Trump administration’s approach to climate change. 
“You can’t care about the climate until you’re in it,” Kendall said.
  Dave Kendall believes a connection with nature can foster better climate change policy. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)
They believe stability, both emotional and political, can be achieved through connection. Their forthcoming podcast series will provide a platform where people from all backgrounds can answer the questions: How have changes in the federal government affected your life? What kind of America do you want to live in? What is important to you?
“This dehumanizing and othering is a difficult thing for people. It makes me unpopular in some circles, but we can’t other even the people that are following the policies of this administration,” Mead said, referring to President Donald Trump. “We can disagree, which I do.”
Mead said that connection has allowed her to see that people on the other side of her politically are wanting safety, security, and respect.
The couple run Prairie Hollow Productions, a documentary production company, for which they interviewed former Republican U.S. Sen. Nancy Kassebaum. 
“I learn every time I talk to Senator Kassebaum, because she’s intelligent. She’s thoughtful. Even if we don’t necessarily agree with certain budget items or whatever, I like that kind of exchange with people. It’s healthy,” Mead said. “So my hope is that our society will deescalate some of this vitriol, deescalate some of this othering and find a way to talk again.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TARDIS-and-Laura-Mead--1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-06 11:19:21.057745

Hruska Federal Courthouse in Omaha, where the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held its hearing on the pipeline cases on Nov. 20, 2024. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld lower court decisions barring counties from imposing safety standards on a pipeline subject to federal safety standards.
The cases involved Summit Carbon Solutions, the company proposing to build a carbon sequestration pipeline through Iowa and ending in North Dakota, and county supervisors from both Story and Shelby counties in Iowa.
Summit sued the counties in 2022 for enacting ordinances that required county-specific setback requirements and other regulations the company argued were preempted by federal pipeline safety laws.
A federal judge ruled in favor of Summit in Dec. 2023 and issued permanent injunctions, stopping the counties from enforcing the regulations, which would have impacted the carbon sequestration pipeline and other pipelines.
The county supervisors appealed the decision and presented oral arguments in November 2024 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The counties argued that local land use and zoning regulations are not “preempted standards” under the Pipeline Safety Act.
Writing for the appeals court, U.S. Circuit Judge Duane Benton wrote that the county ordinances “focus” on safety and “repeatedly” mention safety risks associated with the pipeline, which “undermines” the Pipeline Safety Act’s goal of preempting state regulations on safety.
“This holding does not prohibit local governments from considering safety, nor prevent them from enacting all zoning ordinances, as the counties suggest,” Benton said in the opinion. “This court emphasizes the distinction between safety standards — which the PSA preempts — and safety considerations — which the PSA does not preempt.”
The county ordinances also included emergency response requirements and abandonment provisions which the court ruled were also preempted by federal regulations.

Circuit Judge Jane Kelly, however, dissented on those elements and wrote she does not believe that PSA preempts setback and abandonment provisions. Kelly said that while the counties’ setback requirements are “animated in part by safety considerations” they do not have the “direct and substantial” effect on safety that is reserved for federal regulation.
Kelly also wrote that per her understanding, the Pipeline Safety Act “does not cover pipelines that have been abandoned” and therefore the Shelby County abandonment provision is not “expressly preempted.”
The court affirmed the lower court’s decision in both cases, but ordered the federal court for the Southern District of Iowa to reconsider an additional ordinance that’s at issue in the Story County case.
Sabrina Zenor, on behalf of Summit Carbon Solutions, said the ruling “confirms” pipeline safety regulation set by the federal government and the Iowa Utilities Commission’s role in route and permit decisions.
“This supports a consistent, lawful permitting process for critical infrastructure projects like ours,” Zenor said in a statement.
A press release from Bold Alliance, a group representing landowners opposed to the pipeline project, called the order an “anti-local government ruling” and said the parties involved in the case are examining their “legal and legislative options” in response to the decision.
“The landowners, impacted community members, county and state elected officials who worked for months or years to develop ordinances and state regulations are witnessing their hard-won efforts to enact common sense protections for their communities stripped away by judicial fiat,” the statement read.

The study conducted by nonprofit research group, the Urban Institute, analyzed ways Fairfield County could benefit economically by closing racial gaps.
Doing so would result in more than $15 billion in revenue for the county’s economy, according to Tina Stacy, principal research associate with the Urban Institute. The revenue is estimated based on the change in county gross domestic product.
“Business, philanthropy, local and state governments and the general public can all play a role in shrinking these gaps and benefiting the larger community. So really, you know, I think this shows that economic growth is not a zero sum game, right? We all benefit when gaps are closed and everyone thrives.”
The report focused on five main aspects of a community. They were education, wealth-building, health and well-being, housing and workforce development.
Looking for ways to construct housing quicker, cheaper and easier to build will make it more affordable for people to live in Fairfield County, Stacy said.
“Any way we can increase that supply across the income distribution is going to help reduce those inequities,” Stacy said.
If Black and Latino residents in Fairfield County had the same education opportunities and salaries as their white neighbors, it would also result in 33,000 more homeowners in the area, Stacy said.
Connecticut is currently employing several programs that the report commends for increasing homeownership. However, the study found there’s more to be done, including providing down payment assistance for first-generation homeowners.
“Their parents weren’t able to purchase a home, and we know from our history of housing in the U.S. that that kind of barrier can be passed down from generation to generation,” Stacy said. “Being able to break that barrier and allow first-generation home buyers to purchase a home and build up that savings and equity can really go a long way towards reducing these inequities.”
Another recommendation was parking reform.
Traditionally, developers looking to build housing complexes were required to include a parking lot for residents’ vehicles. This can be a barrier to development in communities with few available plots or lot size requirements.
Under newly-passed state legislation, developers are no longer required to include on-site parking, opening up development opportunities and pushing for more biking and walking.
The study was done in collaboration with Fairfield County’s Community Foundation and DataHaven, along with an advisory board of leaders from Fairfield County in the public, private, philanthropic and nonprofit sectors.
Mendi Blue Paca, president of Fairfield County’s Community Foundation, said the report paints a clear picture of what is possible for the area.
“When we lift up everyone, we all rise,” said Blue Paca. “This isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do. The question isn’t whether we can afford to make these investments. It’s whether we can afford not to.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Medical experts are dismayed over a federal report’s claim that kids are overprescribed asthma medications, saying it minimizes how many lives the drugs save.
Safe treatment protocols for asthma management have been carefully studied over the years, said Dr. Perry Sheffield, a pediatrician and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
“The federal government actually has some really beautiful and clear guidelines and strategies, and things that are vetted by and carefully edited by many experts in the field,” said Sheffield, who co-directs a region of the federally funded Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units that serves New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Asthma affects more than 4.6 million American children, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s one of the most common long-term diseases in U.S. children.
The Make America Healthy Again Commission report released in late May, parts of which have been widely criticized, alleges that American children are on too much medication of various kinds, including asthma treatments.
Experts worry that the administration will set policy based on the assessment, dissuading insurers from covering asthma prescriptions. They also say that the report’s assertions could worsen disparities that affect children’s access to those medications and undermine years of research around the drugs.
Blue Cross Blue Shield now requires prior approval for severe asthma drugs in some states

The MAHA commission has until August to release a strategy based on the findings in the report.
Black and Indigenous children as well as those living in inner cities or in lower-income households are among those with the highest rates of asthma. Pollution disproportionately shrouds communities of color and can be a trigger that exacerbates the disease.
The report’s message could heighten those disparities, said Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, a University of Texas at Austin professor and a past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Section on Allergy and Immunology.
“One thing that has been very clear is that kids of color are less likely to be appropriately managed in terms of their asthma medication management,” she said. “So a message of overprescription that is simply not supported by the evidence also could potentially exacerbate already-existing racial and ethnic disparities in asthma that we have really not made much headway on.”
The commission’s claims
The report touches on childhood prediabetes, obesity and mental health. However, firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the CDC — weren’t mentioned.
The 70-page report from the commission, chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., claims four main issues are the drivers behind childhood chronic disease: poor diet, aggregation of environmental chemicals, lack of physical activity and chronic stress, and “overmedicalization.”
Matsui and other experts said the report’s use of that word is “problematic.”
“The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma — so, they have coughing, chest tightness, wheezing — that that is not really a disease,” said Matsui. “We know for a fact that that’s a disease, and we know that it is quite treatable, quite controllable, and that it has profound impacts on the child’s day-to-day life.”
Other scientists have similarly criticized the report, saying it makes sweeping and misleading generalizations about children’s health without sufficient evidence. The White House corrected the report after nonprofit news outlet NOTUS found that it cited studies that didn’t exist.




The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma … that that is not really a disease. We know for a fact that that’s a disease.


– Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, University of Texas at Austin professor



When it comes to asthma, the report says, “Asthma controller prescriptions increased 30% from 1999-2008.” That sentence originally cited a broken link to a study from 2011; the link was later replaced. Controller meds include inhalers.
The MAHA report also claims that “There is evidence of overprescription of oral corticosteroids for mild cases of asthma.” The original version of the report listed estimated percentages of oral corticosteroids overuse, citing a nonexistent study. The wording was changed and the citation was later replaced with a link to a 2017 study by pediatric pulmonologist Dr. Harold Farber.
The study was not a randomized controlled trial, which increases reliability. Farber  told NOTUS that the report made an “overgeneralization” of his research. Stateline also reached out to Farber, whose public relations team declined an interview request.
Oral corticosteroids are liquid or tablet medications used to reduce inflammation for conditions including allergies, asthma, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. For asthma, they’re used to treat severe flare-up episodes. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America says the medications have been shown to reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and that while they do come with risk of side effects, they’re mostly used in acute flare-ups. And while rare, asthma-related deaths in kids do occur, and are often preventable.
“Asthma medications, including oral steroids, are lifesaving,” said Dr. Elizabeth Friedman, a pediatrician at Children’s Mercy Kansas City. “I believe that physicians, not politicians, are best equipped and most effectively trained to make the determination of whether or not these medications are needed for our patients.”
Friedman worries that federal characterizations of asthma meds will affect how state Medicaid agencies cover the drugs. When Medicaid coverage changed for a common prescribed inhaler last year, many of her Missouri Medicaid patients were suddenly without the drug. They ended up hospitalized, she said.
Friedman directs Region 7 of the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units, a network of experts that works to address reproductive and children’s environmental health issues. Region 7 provides outreach and education in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska.
She also said she’s concerned that the report is “making a broad, sweeping statement based on one epidemiologic study from one state.”
Increased use
An increase in inhaler prescriptions is not necessarily a bad thing, experts say. It’s a sign that kids are getting their medication.
There has been an increase in inhaler prescriptions, along with a corresponding decrease in the oral corticosteroids, which is what experts would want to see, said Chelsea Langer, bureau chief of the New Mexico Department of Health’s Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau. She said that means kids are “following their asthma action plans and taking the controller medications to prevent needing the relief or treatment [oral] meds.”
Trump has canceled environmental justice grants. Here’s what communities are losing.

Asthma prevalence has increased over the years, meaning more people need medication, noted Dr. Alan Baptist, division head of Allergy and Clinical Immunology at Henry Ford Health in Michigan.
He said that because steroid tablets come with risk of side effects, it is best to limit them.
But for kids without access to a regular pediatric provider or to health insurance that covers an inhaler, cost can be an obstacle, he said. Fluticasone propionate, an FDA-approved medicine for people 4 and older, costs on average $200 or more for one inhaler without insurance.
“What often happens with kids, and especially kids who are in Medicaid, or who are in an underserved or disadvantaged population, they are not given appropriate asthma controller medication,” said Baptist, who helped write federal guidelines for asthma treatment best practices as part of a National Institutes of Health committee.
Baptist noted that while he was glad to see pollution mentioned in the report as a danger for kids, it’s at odds with the recent cuts to environmental health grants that aimed to address such asthma triggers.
“They’re somewhat cherry-picking some of the data that they’re putting down,” he said. “It says the U.S. government is ‘committed to fostering radical transparency and gold-standard science’ to better understand the potential cumulative impacts of environmental exposure. If that’s what they’re saying, then they should be funding even greater studies that look at the effects.”
Dr. Priya Bansal, an Illinois pediatrician and past president of the Illinois Society of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, said she’s concerned the report doesn’t define mild, moderate or severe asthma to differentiate the different best-practice treatment plans.
Bansal also said she worries that federal officials’ characterization of an FDA-approved drug will lead to insurance companies refusing to cover inhalers or oral steroids for her patients who rely on them.
“I’m going to be worried about coverage for my asthmatics,” she said. “The question is, what’s the next move that they’re going to make? If they think that, are they going to now say, ‘Hey, we’re not going to cover inhalers for mild asthmatics’?”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Cruise ship passengers in Alaska’s capital city, visitors to the Alaska State Capitol and residents could be greeted by officials in hazmat suits next week as the city hosts a large-scale military exercise.
“Operation ORCA” will test the readiness of first responders and members of the Alaska National Guard for a terrorist attack that involves chemical, biological, nuclear or explosive weapons, said Lt. Col. Brett Haker, commander of the 103rd Civil Support Team, which is putting on the exercise.
Haker said ORCA is held every other year in Alaska, but this is the first time for Alaska’s capital city and for the State Capitol itself, where they will stage a scenario involving an attack by fictitious Russia-based terrorists. 
Streets on three sides of the Capitol building will be closed to traffic for three days, June 9, 10 and 12, according to the Juneau Police Department. The Capitol itself will remain open to the public during the exercise.
Haker said some parts of the scenario will involve a houseboat at or near Juneau’s cruise ship docks, which welcome more than 1 million visitors per year.
“They will see us in our hazmat suits. We will have signs up, and ultimately, they’ll see us entering and exiting. We’ll have our vehicles — they are all like a blue Air Force color. They look civilian, but they all have lights on, and they look like, like an emergency vehicle,” he said.
The exercise will involve about 100 people, he said, including members of the FBI, U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Coast Guard, local police and fire departments, and local governments including the Tlingit and Haida Central Council. 
Some members of the National Guard from other states will also participate, and large military cargo planes will be involved.
Haker credited his operations officer, Capt. Kyle Rehberg, for organizing much of the exercise but said it will also be a test of organization for everyone involved. 
“Ultimately, the main purpose is to improve interoperability, so that we are all speaking the same language when we work with all these additional first responders … and we have these complex problem sets that we have to work through collectively,” he said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/250517-Alaska-Capitol-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-06 10:08:05.673973

SPRINGFIELD — A bill that would lift long-standing restrictions on small poultry farmers in Illinois, reducing red tape and transforming the way local farmers process and sell their products, is heading to the governor.

Under a measure dubbed the “chicken bill,” farmers who process fewer than 7,500 birds annually would be exempt from state and federal inspections of their poultry operations or from having to send birds to USDA-approved processing facilities — an increase from the previous 5,000-bird threshold. The change, part of an update to the Illinois Meat and Poultry Inspection Act, also allows these farmers to sell their poultry beyond their own farms — including at farmers markets, roadside stands and through delivery — a major shift from earlier restrictions.

""This is important for our small farmers to be able to get their product to the community, and that's what this is all about,"" said Sen. Sally Turner, R-Beason, who co-sponsored the bill. The Illinois House voted 116-0 on Friday, May 30, to approve House Bill 2196, and the Senate passed it unanimously on May 22.

Turner represents a largely rural district spanning 10 counties. ""Farmers in my community, especially small farmers, are important to me, personally, but also to our whole district,"" she said.

State Rep. Charlie Meier, R-Okawville, a farmer himself, said the legislation provides local agriculture with a much-needed boost.

""We always want to get the freshest product to the consumer. We want them to know where it came from,"" Meier said. ""So what's better than meeting the farmer who's raised those chickens, knowing where they're coming from? They're fresh, and you're getting a good, healthy product.""

Initially, the bill faced pushback from some public health groups, which argued for stricter labeling and packaging rules to ensure the safety of poultry products for consumption.

The revised bill includes mandated temperature controls during storage, transportation, shipping and delivery. Processed poultry must be packaged in sealed, leak-proof containers to prevent contamination. Each package must also be clearly labeled with the farm’s name and address, the product name, net weight and a statement indicating that the poultry was processed under exemption and not inspected by state or federal authorities.

""Everything you see in that bill was done by some of the public health coalitions,"" Michael Desmedt, interim director of public health for DuPage County, said. ""I think our voices were heard, and they understood our concerns.’’

Ed Dubrick, a poultry farmer and policy organizer with the Illinois Stewardship Alliance, a nonprofit organization that advocates for sustainable agriculture, said he went around the state and asked livestock farmers what they needed to help with the processing of their animals.

Dubrick said the current exemption was too limiting because farmers could only sell “on or from the farm.”

""Expecting someone to come to the farm every time they want some chicken just really isn't realistic,"" he said. ""But if we can bring it to a farmers market where the consumers are, that adds an opportunity.""

Illinois is one of the few states without more flexible on-farm poultry processing exemptions, Dubrick said.

“In many states — about 40 — you’re allowed to process up to 20,000 birds under similar rules. We’re only asking for 7,500,” he said.

Farmers will benefit, according to Dubrick.

""It gives them the opportunity to drive both their production and their profits on their farms,"" he said

For consumers, he said, ""I think you'll see an increase in the availability of local poultry, and I don't think you'll see any difference in food quality or safety. Farmers are proud of their product. They're not going to put their name, their reputation, their business on the line.""

Anna Morrell, co-owner of The Little Farm at Weldon Springs in Clinton, said the bill could make it more viable for her and her husband to scale up their small operation, which began in 2020.



[caption id=""attachment_70009"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1140""] Anna Murrell, owner of “The Little Farm” holds her 6-week-old goose. (Medill Illinois News Bureau photo by Grace Friedman)[/caption]



“This basically just opens up another avenue for getting poultry processed with lower overhead and gives us an avenue of sales into farmers markets,"" Morrell said. ""We're currently not operating under the poultry exemption. We take our meat to USDA-inspected facilities, but there are very few processors in Illinois that process poultry.""

Morrell said the current law had made it more challenging for poultry farmers in Illinois to sell their products; this bill would decrease the number of miles farmers have to travel to get their poultry processed.

If signed, Legislators and advocates say the bill represents a rare collaboration between producers, public health departments and state lawmakers.

""And let's see if we can't keep a few more farm families on the farm and give kids another chance at a future on the farm,” Meier said.

Tim Walz speaks with Minnesota Reformer Editor in Chief Patrick Coolican in front of States Newsroom leaders and reporters Thursday, June 5, 2025 at the Royal Sonesta in downtown Minneapolis. (Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday said that communication between states and the federal government under the second Trump administration “is nonexistent,” opening the door to catastrophe in the case of a natural disaster or other emergency.
Walz, during an interview with Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference in Minneapolis, said that the Trump administration is unprepared for the next disaster — like another global pandemic — and that leaves states particularly vulnerable.
“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.
The Minnesota governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.
Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty.
Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.
He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray.
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”

More intra-government disagreement and possible litigation over the MBTA Communities housing law are again on the table in Milton as a special Town Meeting creeps closer.
The post Milton complies with the MBTA Communities law, with an asterisk appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AFTER ALMOST TWO years of contentious back-and-forth over whether to abide by the MBTA Communities housing law, Milton has submitted a plan to the state that lays out a path to compliance. But the next two weeks will be a bumpy ride. In the 10 days before Town Meeting voters may decide to give their stamp of approval or reject two plans to up-zone parts of Milton, town officials may decide to square up for another legal battle. While elected officials ponder litigation, several Milton residents beat them to it with a new lawsuit against the state housing office. The affluent Boston suburb was the original flashpoint over a 2021 law that requires cities and towns near public transit to create multifamily districts of reasonable size. The vast majority – 133 out of the 177 MBTA Communities – now have zoning that meets the state requirements or have submitted a plan to do so. Thirty-five small towns adjacent to public transit have an end-of-year deadline to submit a plan, and just a few municipalities remain openly defiant as their mid-July deadline approaches. Milton’s stance remains mercurial and the town itself tightly divided. Though the planning board and voters at Town Meeting approved a plan in 2023, 54 percent of voters tossed the rezoning plan by special referendum in early 2024, prompting the state attorney general to sue the town to force compliance. After the Supreme Judicial Court ruled in January that the law is enforceable and mandatory, town officials pressed forward with efforts to rezone, and did land on an option that would meet state requirements while easing off on some of the areas targeted for the most density under the earlier plan.  In the past month, however, the town’s journey involved several sharp pivots. On May 8, the planning board voted to submit two plans to the warrant committee that approves items to be put before Town Meeting voters for its special June 16 meeting.  One would treat the town as an “adjacent community” and another as a “rapid transit community,” the latter of which is how the state defines Milton.  Milton is 0.95 miles from the Ashmont MBTA station and within 5 miles of a commuter rail line. Even though the Mattapan High-Speed Trolley system that extends from the end of the Red Line subway line passes through its borders, many in the town disagree over whether Milton is more like the communities that are “adjacent” to public transit rather than directly served by it. Because the state housing office designated Milton as a rapid transit community, the town must rezone for a potential addition of 25 percent of their total current units. If it were considered adjacent, the obligation would drop to 10 percent. But five days after deciding to submit the two plans, the planning board reversed itself and voted not to include the “rapid transit community” plan on the Town Meeting warrant. According to the Milton Times, the Planning Board voted 4 to 1 to pull back the 25 percent plan because members still thought Milton was being treated unfairly and were swayed by state Sen. Bill Driscoll’s statements that a compromise with the state can still be reached before the next deadline for compliance on July 14.  Indignant residents in favor of rezoning gathered the necessary signatures for a citizen’s petition to include the plan on the warrant. Town Meeting member Karen Friedman-Hanna, who was among those who organized the citizen’s petition drive, told the town warrant committee in a meeting this week that she “received more emails and calls than I’ve ever gotten in my 30 years of being a town meeting member. Many of them were very upset that the planning board was continuing to promote only an illegal and costly 10 percent plan despite many compromises being made when this newer version of the compliant plan was developed by the planning board.” With the petition in hand, the town’s Select Board authorized the town administrator, Nicholas Milano, to submit an action plan and send a letter to the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities. The town had two articles on the warrant to “establish multi-family overlay districts related to the MBTA Communities Act,” he wrote in the letter – one from the planning board for the 10 percent rezoning, and one by citizen’s petition for the 25 percent rezoning. He noted a separate East Milton Square mixed-use overlay district – a different warrant article and proposed zoning bylaw – as evidence of the Town’s ongoing work on mixed-use growth unrelated to the MBTA Communities law.In the action plan, which the state approved to bring the town into interim compliance, Milano noted that a continuing area of concern for the town is the long-term quality of the Mattapan Trolley.   “The Town has concerns about the capacity of the Mattapan Trolley and its ability to absorb new riders and achieve the goal of taking cars off the road,” he said. It is also worried about the state’s “commitment” to the Mattapan Trolley Transformation Project to replace the iconic but not terribly speedy orange trolley cars along the line – a project which is now in its eighth year. “Those improvements will be crucial to ensuring the trolley is able to support the potential new density that a [MBTA Communities] district will create,” Milano wrote. “While the MBTA has made periodic announcements about this project, there is no indication that it continues to move forward in any capacity.” As May wound to a close, 16 Milton residents filed a lawsuit in Norfolk County Superior Court as taxpayers against the Commonwealth and its housing office, describing a “one-sided campaign of aggressive enforcement through threats, intimidation, coercion, and punishment.” This adds Milton – or at least some of its residents – to the list of towns that have sued the state separately since late February, looking for a court declaration that the MBTA Communities law was an unconstitutional “unfunded mandate” and they should be excused from compliance until the state properly funds the impacts of the rezoning effort. Marshfield, Middleborough, Hanson, Halifax, Weston, Duxbury, Carver, and Wilmington have sued. Middleborough dropped its suit in late March, reaching an agreement with the state, which accepted a new expanded smart-growth district proposed to town voters to count towards compliance with the MBTA Communities law. Broadly speaking, laws that impose direct service or cost obligations on municipalities must be paired with funding to cover that cost. In the 2021 economic development bill, the Legislature created the concept of MBTA Communities and the basic rezoning requirements but left it up to the state housing office to determine the rules for compliance. No funding mechanism was included at the time. Halifax “is required to incur significant costs to upgrade its infrastructure and provide services in order to comply” with the housing law, it argued in its complaint filed on May 8. This, in the assessment of the state auditor’s office that kicked off another round of back-and-forth between the state and municipalities, counts as an unfunded mandate. “I think the SJC decision clearly answered the question about whether it was constitutional and answers the question about whether the attorney general has the authority to enforce the law,” Secretary Ed Augustus, of the housing office, said on Thursday. The auditor’s office introduced an additional level of explanation needed for each MBTA Community, he said. “Some towns feel like they agree with the auditor’s finding and want to go through the court route to get a decision about whether, in fact, this is an unfunded mandate.” Augustus said he’s confident that the attorney general can make the case in court that technical and financial assistance have been provided to every municipality who asked for it to come up with a compliant zoning plan. The Milton taxpayers are seeking an injunction to halt enforcement of the law, and a hearing is scheduled in Norfolk County Superior Court for June 11.  During lengthy Monday and Wednesday meetings, the committee in charge of the Milton warrant agreed to send both the 10 and 25 percent rezoning plans to the voters and discussed the taxpayer lawsuit. Macy Lee, a committee member, said on Wednesday that the multiple cases have been consolidated and the other towns will be coming in for the injunction hearing.  Milton’s planning board will meet on June 12, scheduled to discuss the zoning proposals set to go to Town Meeting four days later. It is expected that possible litigation will again be on the table, depending on the outcome of the prior day’s injunctive relief hearing. The court route is just “part of the process,” Augustus said. “People have options. The real headline is, despite all of these questions – some of which have been answered, some of which will be answered shortly – 75 percent of the communities have done what is necessary and are now opening up the opportunity to build more housing.” The post Milton complies with the MBTA Communities law, with an asterisk appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mattapan_05.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-06 10:08:05.673973

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)And then there were two. In late May, Aberdeen businessman and political influencer Toby Doeden entered the race for the Republican nomination for governor of South Dakota. He joins state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen as the only announced candidates, so far, for the nomination. 
Throughout his announcement speech, and sprinkled liberally through his campaign website, are references to Doeden’s support for President Donald Trump. It’s hard to miss the comparisons between the president and the gubernatorial candidate. 
Doeden takes pride, as Trump did in his first campaign, at never having been elected to public office. Doeden, however, knows something about how to get other people elected. Through his Dakota First Action political action committee, he supported a bevy of anti-establishment Republicans who were able to unseat legislative incumbents in the last primary. 
While Doeden sees his lack of electoral experience as a positive, voters always run a risk when they decide to put someone in a position of power who has never been there before. In his first term as president, Trump often seemed befuddled by the finer points of how the federal government works. For Doeden, promising to shake things up in Pierre is the easy part. Harder than the shaking is the governing. 
Doeden joins race for governor with pledge to eliminate property taxes

While he’s shaking things up in Pierre, Doeden has promised to cut spending from a state government budget that he sees as bloated. That made it seem odd when among his first pronouncements as a candidate was the creation of not one but two new state agencies. He has proposed to create the South Dakota Department of External Revenue to find new revenue sources for the state and the South Dakota Department of Government Efficiency, which sounds eerily like Elon Musk’s DOGE.
We can only hope that Doeden’s version of DOGE has a lighter touch than the Trump/Musk version, which is prone to cutting government by sending in a lumberjack to do work that was best suited for a surgeon. Much of DOGE’s work and Trump’s attempts to shrink the federal government have ended up in court battles that haven’t been winners for the president. 
Doeden’s version of his personal history seems to play off the Trump-inspired myth that people who have made a fortune can relate to the problems and challenges faced by the rest of us. Doeden touts his hardscrabble youth, something that Trump never had, as a way to connect with voters. 
Yet Doeden faces the same ironic set of circumstances as Trump, touting personal success that won’t make him subservient to donors all the while that his website welcomes donations. That suggests that somehow candidates like Doeden and Trump are better suited to lead us because they’re rich, yet their wealth doesn’t keep them from asking for our money. 
In his announcement, Doeden railed against career politicians, the likes of which have yet to enter the race for the Republican nomination. Widely speculated as potential candidates are Gov. Larry Rhoden, U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson and Attorney General Marty Jackley. Hansen hails from the same populist wing of the party as Doeden, which runs the risk of them splitting the primary vote from that group. 
It will be Doeden’s challenge to get Republican voters to choose his brand of populism over Hansen’s. He’ll need to do that while getting them to cast aside the established leaders who have devoted their lives to building up government. To be successful, Doeden will have to convince voters that it’s in their best interest to let him tear it all down.

An ambitious proposal that would require fossil fuel polluters to pay for climate disasters caused by the greenhouse gases they emit appears to have stalled in the face of strong opposition from those same fossil fuel polluters.
As CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo explains, a bill by Assemblymember Dawn Addis would require multinational oil and gas companies to pay for emissions from “the extraction, production, refining, sale, or combustion … of fossil fuels” or other petroleum products such as oil and gas. Though it’s unclear how much these companies would pay, the money would be set aside to fund disaster preparedness and climate efforts, including evacuation planning, building climate-resistant communities, electrifying school buses and more.

Addis, a San Luis Obispo Democrat: “Oil caused the climate crisis, in large part … they lied about it, as they caused the damages, and it’s time for them to come to the table and create more affordability for the very people that they’ve harmed.”

But despite the Los Angeles County wildfires in January mobilizing bill proponents, the measure has sat idle since clearing its most recent committee hearing in April. That same month, another bill that would have allowed victims of wildfires and other climate disasters to sue oil companies for damages died in the Legislature.
Oil and gas companies lobbied strongly against both proposals. Jim Stanley, a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association, said Addis’ bill and its twin measure in the Senate are “misguided” and punishes companies “for providing a legal product that was, and remains, critical to our state’s economy.”
Because the bill includes “urgency” provisions, it’s exempted from certain legislative deadlines, including today’s house-of-origin deadline (more on that below). The measure sits before the Legislature as Gov. Gavin Newsom also proposes to reroute money from California’s landmark cap and trade program to pay for Cal Fire operations and the High-Speed Rail project.

CA Legislature vote on labor bills

To keep bills alive for this session, state legislators have until today to advance bills through the house where they were introduced. For some bills related to labor and wage theft, it’s been a mixed bag this week:

Pausing one wage theft bill: Sen. Scott Wiener said Thursday that he is shelving his wage theft bill until January “for further work.” The measure would have enabled workers to recover more money from lost wages through private lawsuits, rather than filing claims through the Labor Commissioner’s Office, which has a severe backlog. The San Francisco Democrat’s proposal stemmed from a CalMatters series probing the state’s wage theft issues.


Penalties for stealing wages: Another bill to hold employers that commit wage theft accountable passed through the Assembly Tuesday. The proposal would require state agencies to deny renewing licenses or permits for employers that have outstanding wage theft claims. Though most Democrats (and two Republicans) approved the measure, Assemblymember Anamarie Ávila Farías of Concord was the only Democrat to vote against it, along with six other Republicans.


Workers’ rights outreach: The Senate on Monday approved a bill that would expand and make permanent an outreach program to educate employees on labor rights and workplace protections. The measure passed along party lines, with all 10 Republicans voting against — though two Democrats abstained from voting, which is the same as voting no.




Safety net to end for CA community colleges

A safety net for struggling California community colleges is set to expire at the end of June, leaving many campuses — particularly in the Bay Area — grappling with difficult cost-cutting measures, write Desmond Meagley and Lylah Schmedel-Permanna of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network.
Since 2018, most community college districts began receiving incremental cost-of-living adjustments to help pay for the rising costs of maintaining buildings, employee benefits and other expenses.
But these adjustments are slated to end on June 30 — and without it, districts must find other ways to close their budget gaps. Some are already feeling the squeeze: Cabrillo College in Santa Cruz, for example, is facing a $5.9 million shortfall and said it would cut 5% of its course offerings and impose a hiring freeze for vacant positions.

California’s climate ‘superfund’ plan may have stalled,Alejandro Lazo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/climate-change/2025/06/climate-superfund-california-legislature-oil/,"Proposed legislation hasn't moved out of the state Assembly or Senate, raising questions about how far California will go in its efforts to make oil and gas companies pay for climate damage.","In summary
Proposed legislation hasn’t moved out of the state Assembly or Senate, raising questions about how far California will go in its efforts to make oil and gas companies pay for climate damage.


In the battle over how to pay for damage wrought by climate change, California lawmakers had an idea: Create a “superfund” that makes big polluters pay.
The Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act of 2025 would make the world’s largest sources of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels financially responsible for the damage caused by wildfires, droughts and other events exacerbated by the warming climate.
The idea adopts the “Superfund” model — created by Congress in 1980 to clean up the nation’s worst toxic waste sites — and applies it to greenhouse gases, aiming to hold companies financially accountable for emissions that drive climate change. 
New York and Vermont have already enacted similar measures despite massive opposition from the oil and gas industry.
But the proposed California legislation has stalled since April, even as environmental groups — galvanized by the death and destruction of the January Los Angeles wildfires — have made it a top priority.
Identical versions in both legislative houses have sat idle in Assembly and Senate committees despite a full-court press by supporters framing the superfund as a solution to California’s $12 billion budget deficit. The bills passed out of their first committees but have not advanced further. 
“Nobody can afford the kind of financial crisis that the climate crisis has caused,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat from San Luis Obispo, one of the authors, told CalMatters. “Oil caused the climate crisis, in large part … they lied about it as they caused the damages, and it’s time for them to come to the table and create more affordability for the very people that they’ve harmed.”
The funds would be earmarked for paying for community disaster preparedness, such as evacuation planning and emergency housing, as well as energy efficiency, zero-emission fleets and charging, and natural resource protection, among other projects, according to the bill.
Opposition includes oil companies and major business groups. In addition, despite worsening wildfires and floods, many Californians have been increasingly voicing concern that the state’s climate policies are driving up gas and electricity costs.
“At a time when Californians are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis, these bills will likely result in massive price increases for gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electricity and consumer goods.”JIM STANLEY, WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSN.
Oil and gas industry lobbying has been fierce. Jim Stanley, a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association, the industry’s top lobbying group in the West, said in a statement that the measures were “misguided proposals to retroactively punish companies for providing a legal product that was, and remains, critical to our state’s economy.”
He said that “at a time when Californians are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis, these bills will likely result in massive price increases for gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electricity and consumer goods.”
The climate superfund also faces resistance from a powerful ally of Big Oil: California’s State Building and Construction Trades Council, a key union that has repeatedly backed the industry’s positions, as CalMatters has previously reported.
Earlier this year, the council also opposed legislation by state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, that would have allowed residents to sue oil companies for climate damages.
In April, Keith Dunn, a lobbyist for the trades union, told an Assembly committee that the climate superfund would drive up energy prices, kill middle-class jobs and act as a stealth tax on working families. “The affordability gap is widening,” Dunn told lawmakers. “It’s not by chance, it’s by choice.”
Both measures include “urgency” provisions, which allow them to take effect immediately if passed by a two-thirds vote and signed by the governor. That higher threshold makes them less vulnerable to certain legal challenges and exempts them from the usual legislative deadlines. (Most bills must clear their house of origin by today.)
“There was quite a bit of opposition earlier in the year so we’re continuing those conversations,” Addis said. “We have time to have those conversations.”
The bill would make companies pay for emissions from “the extraction, production, refining, sale, or combustion, including by third parties, of fossil fuels or petroleum products,” which includes oil, gas and coal.
Bill targets multinational corporations 
The bill applies to companies that emit more than a billion metric tons of global emissions from 1990 through 2024 — that means multinational oil and gas corporations. Within three months of the law taking effect, the agency would publish a list of companies that would pay into the fund.
There are no official estimates as to how much companies would pay. The legislation would require the California Environmental Protection Agency to estimate costs from past and projected climate damages to people, governments, ecosystems and infrastructure every five years through 2045, using peer-reviewed science.
“It is imperative that we make polluters that caused a large percentage of the climate crisis pay for the thing that they knowingly caused,” said Maya Golden-Krasner, an attorney with the Climate Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity, which has sponsored the California bills. “They’ve known that this would cause damage since at least the 1950s, they knew that these greenhouse gases would be regulated since the 1990s and they’ve been gaslighting us all the way and blocking climate regulation.”
“It is imperative that we make polluters that caused a large percentage of the climate crisis pay for the thing that they knowingly caused.”MAYA GOLDEN-KRASNER, CLIMATE LAW INSTITUTE 
The climate superfund fight is part of a broader national movement against major oil companies that is playing out in legislatures and courtrooms across America. 
California is leading efforts to hold oil companies accountable in court for climate change, recycling a legal strategy deployed during the 1990s, when states alleged that tobacco companies knew cigarettes cause cancer.
Trump-era politics have also been at issue. In April, President Donald Trump signed an executive order targeting state climate programs, specifically calling out Vermont’s and New York’s polluter-pays laws and threatening legal action against California’s landmark cap-and-trade program.
Backers say the climate superfund is a fair solution to California’s budget crunch as well as a long-overdue reckoning for an industry that knowingly caused the climate crisis.
But the plan — which could cause oil and gas companies to pay billions for emissions over the last three decades — faces an uphill battle in Sacramento.
Last year, Californians voiced strong opposition to  plans to overhaul one of its cornerstone climate programs, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard,  which could push gasoline prices higher. Last week, Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Democrat from Bakersfield, called for California Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph, who led the board in its passage of that measure, to resign over cost concerns.
Likely to trigger a legal onslaught 
If enacted, the climate superfund would almost certainly trigger a wave of legal challenges. Donald Sobelman, a San Francisco environmental attorney, told CalMatters that the bill is legally ambitious — and is almost certainly headed for a courtroom challenge if it passes.
The Trump administration, for instance, sued New York and Vermont over their climate superfund measures, arguing they are unconstitutional.
Another potential legal argument, Sobelman said, is that the measure could charge companies now for pollution emitted years or even decades ago. Another is that the measure could act like a tax, which could make it easier to challenge in California court without two-thirds approval by the Legislature. 
And some judges may question whether the science linking the emissions to worsening fires and other climate events is strong enough to single out specific companies for climate damage, leading to the “classic battle of the experts,” Sobelman said.
In addition, courts could determine that consumers hold some responsibility for their actions, such as driving cars and trucks powered by fossil fuels, and that other industries around the world, such as power plants and farms, also emit a lot of greenhouse gases. 
A spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom declined to tell CalMatters whether he supports the measure.
In his May budget proposal, the governor adopted “polluters pay” language to rally support for an existing California climate program, cap-and-trade, which raises money by selling pollution credits to companies. 
The debate is unfolding amid a worsening budget crisis in which lawmakers are under pressure to find new revenue sources — especially ones that don’t involve tax hikes on Californians.  Supporters of the Superfund Act argue that the bill offers a “polluter-pays” principle rather than new taxes.
Newsom’s budget proposal said extending cap and trade “aligns with the polluter-pays principle in which carbon emitters will fund the state’s world-class forestry and fire protection programs in the face of wildfires that have become increasingly destructive because of climate change.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/070622_OilField_LV_CM_009.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-06 09:00:42.714062

Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) during a meeting of the Senate Energy and Environment Committee on June 5, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonMembers of the Michigan Senate are once again weighing efforts to deter out-of-state companies from dumping hazardous waste in the state while updating standards for managing landfills and potentially harmful materials.
Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) on Thursday laid out a renewed proposal for revamping the state’s approach to hazardous waste management before his colleagues on the Senate Energy and Environment Committee.
During his testimony, Camilleri noted the bills are a response to recent attempts to ship hazardous waste from the East Palestine train derailment, as well as radioactive material from the Manhattan Project, into disposal sites within his district.
“I’ve had countless conversations with residents and local municipal leaders who are horrified about that potentially harmful material being transported to their communities on their roads and disposed of in their backyard,” Camilleri said. “Frankly, it is ridiculous that these facilities are located in these dense population centers in the first place.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIf passed, Camilleri’s Senate Bill 246 would require the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to create a hazardous and radioactive waste management plan and issue a moratorium on licensing new hazardous waste storage and disposal facilities or expansions of existing facilities.
It would also place stricter siting requirements on hazardous waste facilities to keep them away from large population centers and cap the amount of hazardous waste disposed of within Michigan by tying it to the amount of waste the state produces.
While federal law prevents Michigan from banning trash from other states, Camilleri said his policy is a creative effort to try and skirt federal regulations on commerce between states by preferencing Michigan’s waste, and allowing other states to send their waste on top of that.
“It’s not a perfect solution to that out of state problem, but it’s our version of trying our best to take care of home first,” Camilleri said.
Additionally, Senate Bill 246 increases the fees for disposing of hazardous waste from $10 a ton to $25 a ton, radioactive waste from $5 per ton to $12.50 per ton, with a portion of the increased fees going towards redevelopment. Another percentage would go toward a new community surcharge reimbursement fund, and another piece would go toward a grant fund to support communities that host hazardous waste disposal facilities.
Camilleri’s proposal would also increase the waste tipping fee, or the charge to dump in Michigan landfills, from 36 cents a ton, to $1.20.
In her budget proposals for the 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 fiscal years, Whitmer asked lawmakers to increase the state’s tipping fee to $5 in order to combat out-of-state dumping and increase revenue for environmental remediation, brownfield redevelopment, local waste management assistance and grants and recycling initiatives.
Alongside Senate Bill 246, Camilleri’s Senate Bill 247 targets a liquid waste injection well in Romulus, creating a $100 per ton tipping fee for the waste that goes into those wells.
“The city of Romulus is, right now, on the hook for all types of public safety,” Camilleri said. “In the event of a disaster with this type of well, they will be the ones forced to pay for additional equipment, additional public safety, including fire and EMS. … This type of fee would help offset some of those costs.”
During the meeting, local officials from Romulus and nearby Van Buren Township and Canton Township shared their support for the bills. They cited concerns about out-of-state dumping, and the public health and environmental threats that could come from storing more waste at facilities like the Wayne Disposal Inc. Hazardous Waste Landfill in Van Buren Township.
Canton Township Supervisor Anne Marie Graham-Hudak noted that the landfill is three miles south of Canton and sits next to two schools in a residential neighborhood. It’s also surrounded by environmental justice communities, she said, neighborhoods where people of color and low-income individuals are disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards.
Kevin Krause, the director of community safety and development for the city of Romulus, said the city is inadequately prepared to respond to an emergency at the Romulus injection well, not only from the perspective of the local fire department, but from the regional and county level, as well. 
“We are under-resourced, under-trained and underprepared at this particular location,” Krause said.
Should there be an issue with the injection well, the response will fall solely on the shoulders of local firefighters to mitigate any threat to the environment and population, while agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Michigan EGLE would only be able to provide administrative support.
Supporting Senate Bill 247 would give the city the ability to develop proper pre-response plans, raise awareness, and incorporate surrounding departments and regional hazardous materials teams into their planning, Krause said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3080-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 09:00:42.714062

(Photo courtesy AmeriCorps)A federal judge in Maryland on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to restore AmeriCorps programs and workers in the 24 states, and the District of Columbia, that sued to stop the deep cuts ordered in April by DOGE and the administration.
U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman said the administration failed to provide sufficient notice of the cuts, which were announced without warning — in the case of AmeriCorps, nearly $400 million in grants were canceled after hours on a Friday, and many workers only found out the next day.
Boardman granted a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocks the cuts in the 25 jurisdictions, most led by Democrats, that filed the suit. Her order does not affect the program in the states that were not part of the suit, or the cuts ordered at the agency’s headquarters.
White House spokesperson Anna Kelly, in a statement Thursday, reiterated administration claims that AmeriCorps failed eight consecutive audits and reportedly made more than $45 million in improper payments just last year.
“President Trump has the right to restore accountability to the entire Executive Branch, and this will not be the final say on the matter,” Kelly’s statement said.
Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D), who led the April 29 suit, with 22 other attorneys general and two governors, has argued the AmeriCorps cuts are unconstitutional because the programs funded by Congress can only be undone by those lawmakers. He welcomed Thursday’s ruling, which he said “safeguards … life-changing services that help build a better Maryland.”

“AmeriCorps programs provide critical resources that Maryland communities rely on to educate our students, preserve our parks, and feed our families through the dedicated service of selfless public servants who tutor children, care for the elderly, and protect public lands,” Brown said in a statement. “As this case continues, I will do everything in my power to defend these essential programs from the Trump administration’s unlawful and reckless cuts.”
The cuts came at the direction of billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Service and began in mid-April, when 85% of AmeriCorps administrative staff was placed on administrative leave, and a little more than a week later began receiving reduction-in-force notices.
States were notified after hours on April 25, a Friday, that nearly $400 million in federal grants had been canceled effective immediately, that grant recipients “must immediately cease all award activities” and AmeriCorps members were to be let go and sent home “due to the agency’s termination of the grant and program closure.”
Officials said that in Maryland, the administration’s cuts affected at least 550 positions at universities, state agencies and other organizations that offer programs such as mentoring services, food pantries and conservation.
The state Department of Natural Resources said in a statement Thursday that the abrupt loss of AmeriCorps funding forced the cancellation of many summer park events and programs such as student field trips, programming for campers and other functions handled by conservation corps members.
“The positive impacts this program has on the State of Maryland can only partly be measured in statistics,” Ranger Sara Marcinak, director of the Maryland Conservation Corps, said in a statement. “The real value are the sparks of stewardship they set in people’s hearts and minds and the resulting fires they carefully tend to further cultivate that stewardship ethic.”
Thanks to some state and private funding, 17 members, or less than half of the state’s Conservation Corps were “reactivated” last week. This season’s environmental education program will continue through August. But state officials did not indicate when, or if, other AmeriCorps members might be back on board.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Boardman’s order gave the government until 5 p.m. Friday to notify states and AmeriCorps members of the injunction, and she gave it until Tuesday to report back on what actions it has taken to implement her order.
DNR spokesperson Gregg Bortz said the agency does not have a comment on Thursday’s court decision. But a spokesperson for Gov. Wes Moore (D) praised Brown’s leadership in the fight against “draconian cuts” to AmeriCorps.
“Today’s ruling makes it clear that the chaotic decision by Washington to immediately dismantle service pathways and abruptly dismiss committed AmeriCorps members actively strengthening our communities was erroneous,” said Carter Elliott IV.
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) — one of two governors, along with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D), to join state attorneys general in the suit — said on social media Thursday that the “federal government made a commitment to organizations across the Commonwealth, and with the abrupt termination of AmeriCorps, the Trump Administration went back on that commitment without obeying the law.”
Boardman denied the states’ request to reverse the reductions-in-force of AmeriCorps administrative staff, saying the damage the states claimed as a result of those firings was too speculative.
Besides Maryland and Washington, D.C., the other states named in the suit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai‛i, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54215765040_0d4e3877b6_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 10:08:05.673973

A cost-of-living increase meant to help community colleges adjust to a new funding formula is expiring, leaving some districts to cut positions and classes.


This June, struggling California community colleges will stop getting yearly cost-of-living increases to their budgets. These increases have kept many districts afloat for the past six years while community colleges adjusted to a new funding method based on district performance rather than enrollment numbers alone.
Most districts are surpassing the system’s goals, while struggling districts have been making cuts to bridge their budget gaps. With yearly cost-of-living increases being eliminated, those struggling districts will need to make even more cuts.  
This year, Cabrillo College in Santa Cruz announced it would cut 5% of its course offerings and pause hiring for unfilled positions as it faces a $5.9 million deficit in the 2025-26 academic year. That deficit is projected to double in three years.
In Oakland, the Peralta Community College District had to close an $11.8 million deficit this year. It has eliminated 68 positions, including financial aid support staff at each of its four colleges. Peralta administrators have also discussed reducing the number of colleges in the four-campus district, possibly by consolidating operations, to decrease costs.
Population decline sparked new funding model
The way that most of California’s community college districts earn their funding changed in 2018. Nine districts in the wealthiest areas of the state, called basic aid districts, continued to receive funding through local property tax revenues only. But for the 63 remaining districts, the new formula split the funding they receive from the state into three buckets – 70% based on enrollment, 20% based on the number of students receiving financial aid and 10% determined by “student success” metrics like the number of those who successfully transfer or receive certificates. 
Previously, the funding model for non-basic aid districts was based solely on enrollment. However, the former chancellor for the state college system, Eloy Ortiz Oakley, predicted that an ongoing decline in state K-12 enrollment signaled a corresponding decline in future community college students. 
“Community college enrollment and K-12 enrollment mirror each other, but lag each other,” he said in a recent interview with CalMatters. Oakley is now the president and CEO of College Futures Foundation.
Oakley said he spent over a year travelling the state and consulting with the system’s administrators and employees to develop a new model that diversified its approach. Today, the funding model uses over 30 measurements to calculate funds based on full-time enrollment, economic demographics and student success outcomes. For example, students who earn transfer degrees net their colleges a larger amount than those who earn trade certificates, although both count for additional funding.
To help colleges that stood to lose money under the new model, the state guaranteed them the same amount of funding they received before the change. California Community Colleges State Chancellor Sonya Christian said that the system supports its underperforming college districts by preventing them from losing money each year “even if a district’s calculations otherwise suggest a lower level,” according to an emailed statement. This stopgap will continue until further notice.
To account for rising costs of building maintenance, educational materials and employee benefits, the state also included incremental cost-of-living adjustments in each district’s budget, allowing administrators to keep up with economic inflation. This temporary adjustment was originally set to last three years. It was extended twice, which let districts keep growing their budgets despite periods of enrollment declines exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, these yearly increases will expire for good on June 30. 
Five of the San Francisco Bay Area college districts that rely on the updated funding formula are underperforming, plus Cabrillo and Santa Monica further south. Without a guaranteed annual cost-of-living increase, these districts will be forced to find some other way to meet rising costs.

Struggling colleges voice concerns about the funding formula
College officials who spoke with CalMatters for this story unanimously supported the funding model’s goals of helping all students to successfully graduate in a timely manner. But some administrators also voiced concerns about their ability to grow their budgets under the formula moving forward.
Due to its proximity to UC Santa Cruz, Cabrillo College attracts a high number of students looking to transfer to the local university. These students generate additional revenue for Cabrillo. But the college’s president, Matthew Wetstein, said many other students don’t. Either their educational goals don’t include a degree for transfer, which is prioritized by the formula, or their household income prohibits them from qualifying for financial aid.
The Peralta Community College District in the East Bay faces a projected $11.8 million deficit for the upcoming fiscal year. Greg Nelson, Peralta’s newly hired deputy chancellor and chief operations officer, said that high turnover among leadership and dwindling enrollment have left Peralta “not prepared” for the cost-of-living increases to go away. He said that he will now prioritize ways to meet the formula’s metrics as he tries to reverse Peralta’s decline.

For Ron Gerhard, the district chancellor of Chabot-Las Positas, eliminating the yearly cost-of-living adjustments “effectively amounts to a cut” to his district and others in high-cost  communities in the San Francisco Bay Area – particularly “in this time and age where inflation is high.” He said that his two-college district has had to make reductions that don’t impact classes so the district could keep up with rising costs.
Chabot-Las Positas’ institutional research shows that students in the region are “least likely” to receive financial aid compared to the rest of the state. This is because students have to work more hours and earn more money to afford the higher regional costs, limiting both their ability to attend school and their eligibility to qualify for financial aid. Other similarly affected districts in the region, including Peralta and Cabrillo, supported the research findings.
Oakley argues that the funding formula is fair, saying that eligibility for Cal Grants and Pell Grants includes the cost of living, and it’s up to colleges to make sure they are accurately reporting that cost. However, federal Pell Grants only consider a student’s cost of living when awarding grants to full-time students, according to the Congressional Research Service. As of Fall 2024, about 74% of community college students in California are part-time.  
How a winning formula looks for one campus
Some colleges experiencing enrollment declines have leveraged other parts of the formula to stay afloat, such as focusing on class offerings that result in degrees and making sure eligible students are applying for financial aid. 
Lake Tahoe Community College District is bringing in 30% more funding under the new formula.
Times were not always easy for Lake Tahoe, President Jeff DeFranco said. His district grappled with pandemic enrollment declines, followed by the massive 2021 Caldor Fire that destroyed hundreds of neighboring homes. 
In response, he says the college made academic counseling appointments mandatory to keep students on track and explain the value of attaining a degree. The new model, he said, calls for more collaboration. “Our front line staff understand it’s important. Our counseling staff understand it’s important. Our administration and our boards understand it’s important,” he said. 
DeFranco also mentioned that the college now focuses on transfer degrees, leading to an increase in completed degrees every year. He said certificate awards are at an all-time high for the college.
“We’ve improved the student success metrics and our enrollment; it can’t just be one or the other. It really has to be both,” DeFranco said. 
But as DeFranco noted, where state budgets are concerned, there is no such thing as perfection.
“[It’s] an imperfect system but I don’t know that there is a perfect system out there,” he said. “The thing I do believe is, what gets measured gets done. That’s a basic leadership principle.”

Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, is pictured on the first day of the legislative session at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca is suing Utah’s attorney general and insurance commissioner over a law passed during the legislative session aimed at stopping drug manufacturers from limiting where hospitals and clinics can buy discounted medication.  
Filed in May in federal court in the District of Utah, the company accuses the law of being unconstitutional and in conflict with prior court rulings. 
Sponsored by Sen. Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, SB69 deals with the federal 340B program, a decadesold provision in the Public Health Service Act that aims to supply hospitals and health clinics with drugs at a discounted price. 
The program requires drug manufacturers to provide discounts on certain outpatient drugs for entities covered under the program, like hospitals, clinics, or Native American tribes. 
According to the American Hospital Association, hospitals can pass savings from the 340B program along to patients by offering health care to uninsured patients, providing free vaccinations, or expanding mental and community health programs.

But Vickers, who owns and operates a pharmacy in Cedar City, said the program is not popular among drug manufacturers, who have tried to limit where the entities covered under 340B can obtain the discounted drugs. Speaking on the Senate floor earlier this year, Vickers said manufacturers have been enforcing a “one pharmacy rule,” where certain drugs can only be obtained from certain pharmacies. 
“From their perspective it’s expanded more than they would like, so they’ve tried to limit the access of drugs,” Vickers said.  “Essentially, you could have a patient being able to get a product at a discounted price in one town but not the other.” 
SB69, which passed in March during the final week of the legislative session, tries to prevent this. The bill is relatively simple at just 53 lines, and states that drug manufacturers cannot restrict pharmacies from contracting with entities covered under the 340B program. It also restricts manufacturers from preventing the delivery of a 340B drug to any location authorized to receive it. 
“I don’t stand here professing that the manufacturers are happy with this, I will tell you they’re not,” said Vickers earlier this year, telling his Senate colleagues that states that have passed similar legislation have been targeted by lawsuits. “But what we’re looking at is providing access to medication at a discounted price.” 
Vickers was right. AstraZeneca, the global pharmaceutical company that generated more than $54 billion in revenue in 2024, is now suing Utah Attorney General Derek Brown and Utah Insurance Commissioner Jon Pike to stop the enforcement of SB69. 
The Utah Attorney General’s Office did not provide comment on the active litigation. 
In the complaint, attorneys for AstraZeneca point to prior court rulings that supersede Utah’s law. 
“Apparently dissatisfied with the scope of federal law, the State of Utah has enacted a statute seeking to achieve under state law precisely the same result that federal courts have resoundingly rejected,” the complaint reads, accusing SB69 of requiring “discounted pricing for sales at an unlimited number of contract pharmacies.”
According to AstraZeneca, the requirement in SB69 goes beyond the original intent of the 340B program, putting state law at odds with federal law and violating the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. 
Plus, the lawsuit alleges, SB69 violates the Contracts Clause of the Constitution because it interferes with agreements between drug manufacturers and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as the Constitution’s Takings Clause, which protects private property from being seized for public use, since SB69 requires AstraZeneca to transfer its private property (prescription drugs) to entities covered under 340B.

WEST BLOCTON, Ala.—“The lilies have bloomed this season if you know where to go.”
It’s a line in Birmingham band I Declare’s newly released song “Cahaba,” and it’s the truth.
At the recent Cahaba Lily festival, you could hear the sacred Southern knowledge passing from one person to another.
“Where do you go? Have you been yet? Is the water low enough to see them?”
The lilies, a species endemic to the southeastern U.S., are named after Alabama’s longest free-flowing river, the Cahaba. They bloom boldly atop the jagged shoals that line the river’s bottom each year between Mother’s Day in May and Father’s Day in June.
This year, as is growing more often the case, an unusually rainy May has led to a less than ideal viewing season. But still, like clockwork, Alabamians have flocked to the Cahaba to see what they can.
“On the banks of the big river, watching nature’s finest show,” the song’s lyrics say. “It’s a biological marvel, a cesspool of teeming growth. A reflection of our survival in the water’s steady flow.”
It wasn’t always like this.

Dr. Larry Davenport is known as the world’s foremost expert on the Cahaba Lily, scientific name Hymenocallis coronaria. He was the keynote speaker at the 35th annual Cahaba Lily Festival, a gathering about 40 miles southwest of Birmingham that he’s been part of since its beginnings.

When the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was searching for an expert to investigate the lily and its potential candidacy as an endangered species, they turned to Davenport. At the time, in the late 1980s, the Cahaba Lily wasn’t anywhere near the cultural symbol it’s now become for the region. A recent academic article called the flower “charismatic”—a characterization that left Davenport thrilled. The Cahaba Lily has come a long way in three decades, he said.
“It was a mysterious plant at the time,” Davenport said. “Little was known about it.”
So Davenport decided to take up what would ultimately become a lifelong challenge, investigating everything he could about the plant’s habitat, anatomy and life cycle.
Ultimately, USFWS chose not to list the Cahaba Lily as an endangered species, though organizations like the Nature Conservancy consider the lily “threatened.”


Historically, large populations of the flower have been wiped out by human activities like the damming of Alabama’s rivers.
The construction of a dam on the Black Warrior River in the early 1900s effectively drowned a miles-long stretch of the flowers, sometimes called shoal lilies.
“That was the motherlode,” Davenport said. “And when the dam was put in, all of those lilies were flooded out.”
A century later, another human activity—the burning of fossil fuels—has added yet another obstacle to the lily’s ability to thrive.
Research suggests that as the climate warms, heavy rain events in the southeast U.S. will become more frequent, as will periods of drought.
Siltation, where sediment coats the shoals needed for the plant’s growth, is one of the most serious threats to the Cahaba Lily, Davenport said. That type of water pollution, often caused by mining or other development upstream, can also be compounded by the impacts of climate change, which could lead to excessive rainfall that contributes to sediment runoff.
As such rain events become more frequent, viewing the lilies, too, will become more difficult, as the plants will often—like this year—be covered for much of the blooming season by high river water.
That human impact on the Cahaba and its lily—the effects of pollution and lax environmental regulation—are part of the dynamic that I Declare aimed to convey in their new album, “We Ought to Celebrate.”
The band’s five members—Hunter Huie, Austin Noble, Ben Smith, Kyle Posten and Joseph Foster—all grew up below the Mason-Dixon Line, struggling with what it meant to be Southern, white and progressive.
Huie, who grew up in Alabama, said he always identified with the rebellious, anti-authority attitude of his Southern community, but the older he got, the more he resented what he thought were the base political viewpoints that often accompanied it. As he grew older and learned more, he began to realize it was Southern Blacks and other progressives that truly embodied the ideas of fighting against the mainstream and pushing back against unchecked authority, not conservative whites who held fast to a historically bereft view of a “lost cause.”
“I just really hate that there is this patina of white supremacy and racism that coats the surface of everything in the South,” he said. “That’s something we want to fight against. We have to dig deeper.”
That’s at the heart of what “We Ought to Celebrate” is about, Huie said—painting a nuanced picture of the complex, heartbreaking, beautiful realities of the South in which he finds himself living.
“Me and my neighbors, we ain’t never gonna be OK with ‘Let’s Go, Brandon’ plate tags or those Johnny Reb battleflags,” one of the band’s lyrics say. “You and your buddies might be laughing at this son of a yuppy, but I’ll take my chances putting my money right where my mouth is.”
Explicit environmentalism, too, is part of what forms the fabric of I Declare’s new EP.
“Cahaba dreaming,” the band’s lyrics say. “Well I just think you should know. The lilies have bloomed this season if you know where to go. And I’ve got the lead on sallies—they’re buried in the mud. It seems so silly really, but it’s in our blood.”
Sallies (a reference to the region’s robust salamander population), like the Cahaba Lily, have been threatened by human activity, particularly habitat destruction. Just this year, residents of a Birmingham suburb fought a development that had been set to encroach on the habitat of resident spotted salamanders.
Reflecting on that kind of environmental impact is important to the band, guitarist and vocalist Ben Smith told Inside Climate News.
“We feel like being in Alabama, we’re surrounded by this culture that’s dominated by an affinity for the outdoors,” he said. “But we have this precious, unique ecosystem right here that’s absolutely wonderful that we actually don’t care about at all, that we pollute and mismanage. There’s this juxtaposition of this affection for nature while most people are also completely unconcerned with its health and well-being.”
It’s frustrating to witness, Smith said, but it makes for a good song.
Austin Noble, a saxophonist and vocalist for the group, grew up in Adger, a mining town in western Jefferson County that garnered headlines when a mine expanded beneath its residents’ feet. In March 2024, a grandfather living atop a mine in the area was killed when methane, a common byproduct of coal mining operations, leaked into his home, triggering an explosion.
Noble said growing up in a mining community shaped how he views the environment and the need for regulation.
“Everyone I knew in high school, they’d finish up, then head to work for the coal mines,” Noble said. “So they go into the mines, their health is affected and their lifespans are shortened, and this is how they’re repaid. An exploded home.”
That sentiment made its way into the music:
“I remember being told once
Don’t bite the hand that feeds
But what about mother nature
Who brings our thirsty throats a drink
Why should she have to pay for
All our externalities
Growth isn’t always a good thing
Oh man, plaque clogs the arteries”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8086-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 08:05:41.938341

Starting July 1, staff with the Division of Cannabis Regulation will arrive unannounced at dispensaries and collect about 50 products a month off the shelves. They’ll take them to the Missouri State Public Health Reference Laboratory to be tested for things like mold, pesticides and a whole range of other things. 
Ryan Bernard, the division’s testing and research unit manager, said the unannounced sampling has been in the works for a while as a way to add an extra level of compliance. The division, Bernard said, isn’t expecting to find problems.
“We won’t know until we see the data,” Bernard said. “I have full faith and confidence in our testing licensees that they’re testing according to rule as it’s been outlined.”
However, national testing lab experts told The Independent that Missouri’s regulators might be shocked at the results.
“Shelf testing has not gone well in any state that I know of, especially if it’s just starting,” said Josh Swider, vice chair of the cannabis working group for American Council of Independent Laboratories. “It will be very telling very fast.”
Swider pointed to a citation in Arizona in April of a cannabis lab, where the state found more than a dozen alleged “deficiencies” including problems with the lab’s potency testing and pesticide and microbial detection methods.
Swider called the levels of pesticides on the Arizona products “sickening.”
“But this is what you’re seeing around the country,” said Swider, co-founder and CEO of Infinite Chemical Analysis Labs in San Diego. “Regulators are starting to enforce. They’re realizing an issue that’s been systemic for a long time.”
Other common issue Missouri regulars might also find, he said, are inflated levels of THC on products. 
Regulators previously talked about conducting a “round robin” testing, where the state’s certified testing labs would double check each other’s work under the state’s instruction. Amy Moore, director of the Division of Cannabis Regulation, told lawmakers in 2023 that this additional testing rule was “critical.” 
“The challenges in regulating and relying on for-profit cannabis testing labs,” Moore told lawmakers at a 2023 committee hearing, “is one of the most discussed challenges in the national cannabis regulatory community.”
However, the state never ended up getting the process going for a variety of factors, Bernard said, so the unannounced samples will be the regulators first attempt at a testing backstop.
Lawmakers began allocating money for this kind of sampling to be tested at the state laboratory in the fiscal year that began on July 1, 2024 with $3.8 million. Most of it went unspent because the cannabis testing methods were “still in the process of being implemented,” according to state budget documents. Another $2.4 million was allocated for this fiscal year ending on June 30, and it’s unclear how much of it has been spent.
Bernard couldn’t speak on the budget for testing, he said, because the division and state lab budgets are “totally separate.” 
“Our operating budget is DCR only,” he said. “State public health labs is theirs.”
The lab will receive another $2.4 million for the fiscal year beginning July 1. 
Swider said a standard test at a Missouri cannabis lab costs about $400. With the $2.4 million the lab is allocated to conduct 600 tests a year, it would put that rate at $4,000 a test. 
“That’s not good,” he said. 
It would take one employee in Swider’s lab to leisurely do 50 tests in a week, he said, but 50 in a day is doable. 
Bernard said sampling 50 products out of more than 500,000 product tags is “not even close” to being representative of the market, but he called this a “very much preliminary” start.
Bernard has been working closely with the state public health lab, he said, to build the infrastructure for cannabis testing and they’ve had some “hold ups.” 
“[The state lab has] experienced grant-funding delays and and then back orders related to potential tariffs,” he said. “They’ve had equipment failures…so this starting point number will get us to a point where we can start stabilizing the amount they need to purchase compared to the amount that I can sample.”
The goal is to get to a representative sample size as soon as possible, he said. 
At an MJ Unpacked cannabis conference in November, concerns were raised among testing experts about the fact that 82% of Missouri’s cannabis testing is conducted at one licensed lab, Greenway Magazine reported. And that lab catches fewer problems with mold compared to other Missouri labs and those across the country.
At the November panel, information obtained through a Sunshine request revealed that the lab referred to as “Lab D” reported a failure rate for Aspergillus—a mold that poses significant health risks— roughly 8 times lower than the national average.
The state’s other labs had a failure rate of 3.3%, which is aligned closely with the national average of 3.8%. 
Lab D’s failure rate was just under 0.5%. 
The information raised questions about whether the mold was adequately being checked. However, Bernard said those results didn’t raise any alarm for him. 
“Everybody’s being held to the same standards as far as testing is concerned and their ISO accreditation,” Bernard said. “Without doing further investigation, I have confidence that the industry is testing appropriately.”

(BanksPhotos via Getty Images)The intra-DFL rift between labor unions whose members build data centers and progressives skeptical of corporate giveaways was on full display at the Capitol last week as lawmakers considered extending generous tax breaks for data centers’ purchases of computers, software and energy equipment.
It was also evident in a May 28 energy webinar featuring top utility executives, state officials and representatives from regional labor, agriculture and environmental groups.
The conversation came as Minnesota utilities weigh proposals for thousands of megawatts of new data center capacity, representing new electric consumption equal to millions of homes. As other construction sectors falter amid high interest rates and sluggish demand, union laborers and tradespeople see an opportunity in building data centers and the power plants to run them.
“We need to be involved in the next iteration of energy development here in Minnesota,” said Joe Fowler, business manager for Laborers International Union of North America Local 563.
To labor, that means building not only the wind, solar and battery plants that will form the backbone of Minnesota’s future electric grid, but large industrial facilities to soak up the power they produce. Others in the left-of-center coalition say unfettered data center growth could jeopardize progress toward the state’s statutory target of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 while threatening grid reliability and raising costs for ordinary utility customers.
“We want to bring on large users like data centers, but not to the exclusion of others,” said Margaret Cherne-Hendrick, CEO of St. Paul-based Fresh Energy, a policy and communications shop focused on clean energy.
Though the data center boom was the elephant in the room, the conversation touched on some of the broader challenges issues facing Minnesota electric utilities, workers and customers as a dysfunctional state legislative session limps to a close and federal policymakers get closer to passing a budget bill that cuts taxes for the rich and Medicaid for the poor while, experts say, raising power prices for everyone.
How much data center demand is actually coming? 
Developers have proposed nearly 9,000 megawatts of new data center capacity across Xcel Energy’s eight-state territory, CEO Bob Frenzel said in October, or almost 9 million homes’ worth of electricity consumption. Data centers alone account for about half of Xcel’s expected 5% annual sales growth through 2029.
Xcel expects Minnesota’s share of that growth to be about 1,300 megawatts over the next seven to eight years, said Ryan Long, Xcel’s president for Minnesota and the Dakotas. That’s up from 60 megawatts of total capacity as of early last year.
“The curve is up and to the right,” Long told Energy Futures Initiative Foundation CEO and former U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz on the webinar. “It’s shifted from us trying to attract (data center) companies to Minnesota to them knocking on our doors.”
Smaller utilities like Dakota Electric Association are also gearing up for massive amounts of data center development, CEO Ryan Hentges said later on the webinar. Projects proposed for Dakota Electric territory include a 12-building, 340-acre Farmington campus that residents are suing to stop.
But the demand won’t hit all at once, Hentges said.
“One gigawatt is not all going to happen next year,” he said. “It’s going to happen over time, and that gives us more time to plan.”
Can utilities serve new data centers while meeting Minnesota’s carbon-free power mandate? 
The short answer is yes, according to Long. Even with the influx predicted over the next five years, Xcel is on track to shut down its three remaining Minnesota coal units by 2030 and meet the interim state goal of 80% clean power by 2030, he said.
“These are aging, somewhat inefficient plants and we are blessed to live in a region that has excellent renewable resources,” he said.
Xcel could partner on future “clean firm” power projects with big tech companies, which have their own sustainability goals, Long added. Google, utility NV Energy and power developer Fervo Energy recently announced a geothermal power partnership in Nevada, while Meta, Amazon and Microsoft have all inked splashy nuclear deals. Nuclear and geothermal both produce carbon-free power without relying on variable weather conditions.
Those partnerships could eventually help wean Minnesota off natural gas power despite uncertainty around federal support for cleaner technologies, said Sydnie Lieb, assistant commissioner with the Minnesota Department of Commerce.
“In the absence of the federal government continuing to push development of clean firm resources, we are thinking about what the state can do,” she said.
Big data centers could also cover at least some of the cost of new transmission infrastructure needed to serve them, easing the burden on existing ratepayers, Hentges added.
But the state needs to ensure Minnesota data centers fully decarbonize their operations over time, including onsite backup generators that today generally run on natural gas or diesel, Cherne-Hendrick said. It also needs to push data centers to pay into state-administered equity programs facing sharp federal funding cuts, like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, she said.
Is Minnesota really facing a ‘power emergency’? 
Also no, Long said, despite the Trump administration’s claims to the contrary.
Last month, Trump invoked an obscure law to order a Michigan coal plant to operate past its planned May 31 retirement date. Moniz, the former U.S. Energy Secretary, asked whether he could do the same in another Midwestern state committed to transitioning off coal.
Xcel is “obviously paying a lot of attention” to the issue but isn’t changing its coal retirement plans, which have been in the works for years and won’t affect system reliability, Long said.
He allowed that Minnesota will need gas power plants for many years, though they’ll increasingly serve as backup for renewables, nuclear and long-duration batteries. Xcel plans to build a new “hydrogen-capable” gas plant in southwestern Minnesota that will likely operate past 2040.
Will the transition to carbon-free power kill jobs? 
Building new wind, solar and battery plants has been cheaper than running existing coal plants for years, in part because renewable power requires far less labor to operate and maintain.
Fowler said that’s a challenge for unions like LIUNA, whose work in the power sector increasingly focuses on facilities that more or less run themselves. And LIUNA members are uneasy about the future.
“Our job is to work ourselves out of a job — we build something and then move onto the next project,” he said.
A February settlement between Xcel and Minnesota’s utility regulator pushes the utility to expand training opportunities for underrepresented populations and work with labor on workforce transitions at retiring power plants. The training partnership has already produced around 100 graduates who can now work on new power plant or data center construction projects, Fowler said.
“There are real benefits the state will see from … having citizens who feel like their job is waiting out there,” he said.
Is rural Minnesota being asked to do too much to support the green transition? 
Wind and solar development is a double-edged sword for rural communities, where income-earning opportunities for landowners clash with concerns about removing prime farmland from production, said Anne Schwagerl, vice president with Minnesota Farmers Union.
To demystify the issue and strengthen members’ negotiating position with power developers, Minnesota Farmers Union plans to update its five-year-old “farmers’ guide” to renewable energy. But the best way to ensure durable rural support for clean energy is to give farm communities more skin in the game, Schwagerl said.
Right now, for example, conglomerates barge most of the fertilizer used on Minnesota farms up the Mississippi River from massive factories on the Gulf Coast. Minnesota Farmers Union wants to see more local production, ideally led by rural cooperatives using excess wind power with support from federal and state green fertilizer grants, Schwagerl said.
“Our thinking is that the green transition is happening,” she said. “We’re seeing it in agriculture as in energy, and it would be a big bummer to us if it ended up being owned by the same multinational megacorporations.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/nuclear-power-plant-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-06 08:05:41.938341
,California,2025-06-06 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s stubborn problems keep thwarting its ballooning budget,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/california-budget-problems-balloon/,"California's spending has tripled in 25 years under Democratic leadership, while such problems as homelessness, water shortages and poverty grew.","The first quarter of the 21st century has been, in a sense, a test of whether California — a state enormously blessed but enormously troubled — can be effectively governed.
For decades, California’s two political parties had struggled for dominance. Control of its governorship, its Legislature, its congressional delegation and its presidential electoral votes had shifted back and forth as the mood of voters oscillated.
However, by the turn of the century, Democrats had captured all the levers of political power. And over the last 25 years their dominance has grown ever stronger, interrupted only by the performative seven-year governorship of action film actor and nominal Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.
The disappearance of inter-party competition means Democrats have been free to implement their responses to multiple issues spawned by the state’s economic and cultural complexity — such things as erratic water supply, low-performing public schools, homelessness, housing shortages, and chronically high levels of unemployment and poverty.
In general, Democratic governors and legislators have believed that throwing money — lots of it — at those and other problems would result in tangible improvement. An obscure chart in the state budget reveals how much money.
In 2000, the state’s population was 34 million and has since grown by 15% to just over 39 million. According to the state Department of Industrial Relations, California’s consumer price inflation has been close to 100% in that period.
However, California’s general fund — which pays for the state’s core programs, such as education, health care and prisons — has tripled from $78 billion during Democrat Gray Davis’ governorship to $229 billion in Gov. Gavin Newsom’s latest budget. The increase has been financed largely by taxing Californians’ personal incomes, which also have tripled from $1.14 trillion to $3.5 trillion.
General fund spending per capita is 2.5 times what it was in 2000, rising from $2,296 to $5,835. And the number of state employees — 311,239 in 2000 — is now 40% higher at 436,435.
Anyone would be hard-pressed argue that those increases by Democratic officeholders have produced breakthroughs on the state’s most pressing issues. Shortages and the costs of housing, homelessness, low academic scores and other existential issues continue to plague the state.
If the effectiveness of governance has not improved during the last quarter century of one-party dominance and high levels of spending, California’s economic and civic ails may reflect something else, perhaps a lack of creativity or cohesive civic leadership, or maybe a governance structure based on a 19th century model that doesn’t suit a 21st century reality.
The current blame shifting and finger pointing between state officials, especially Newsom, and city and county governments over accountability for homelessness may be a clue that something is lacking. It’s as if everyone knows they can’t fix the problem so they have resorted to face-saving.
The process of choosing a successor to Newsom will kick off a year from yesterday, with the June 2026 primary designating two finalists for the general election four months later.
On Wednesday evening, six of the self-proclaimed candidates for governor — four Democrats and two Republicans —answered questions about how they would govern in a forum sponsored by the state Chamber of Commerce at its annual economic summit.
Their polite banter revealed overall agreement on what some of California’s issues are — particularly the state’s high living costs — but was short on concrete proposals. The event, known in the political trade as a beauty contest, also was overshadowed by former Vice President Kamala Harris’ absence and coyness about running for governor.
Whether she’s in or out, the next governor will have a full plate of unresolved issues that need different approaches if California is to be – despite evidence to the contrary — still governable.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/042425_Dixon-Trail_AH_CM_44.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-06 08:05:41.938341

James Meredith was shot a day after he began his one-man, 220-mile March Against Fear from Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi. 
Meredith survived, and the sniper was arrested. Meredith did the march to encourage Black Mississippians to vote in the wake of the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. 
After Meredith’s shooting, Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders and activists decided to continue the march in Meredith’s name. People from all over the nation came to join the march, which resulted in 4,000 new Black voters. 
The march ended at the state Capitol in Jackson, where 15,000 gathered, including Meredith, who had recuperated from surgery. It was the largest civil rights march in the state’s history.

It’s fair to say Montanans have been raked over the coals for electricity costs by the utility companies that have followed in the wake of the disastrous utility deregulation bill passed by the 1997 Legislature and signed into law by then-Gov. Marc Racicot.
The faulty premise on which the measure was sold to the Legislature was that Montanans would enjoy lower electricity costs thanks to customers having “choice” to shop among the various utilities that were supposed to materialize.
But that didn’t happen.
The opponents to the measure cited the simple fact that Montana already had the lowest price for electricity in the region, thanks in large part because Montana customers had already paid the Montana Power Company, as a regulated monopoly, to build and maintain a series of hydroelectric dams. As one long-time lineman quipped “you can’t make electricity cheaper than water running downhill.”
Driven by the Montana Power Company’s intent to change from a utility to a telecommunications company, Touch America, the 200+ page bill was jammed through in the last weeks of the session with most legislators having no idea what was in it — nor the consequences of their actions.
Yet the Republican legislative majorities voted to grant Montana Power’s wish, bolstered by the Butte Democrats — except for brave Danny Harrington who didn’t kow-tow to the utility.
It was arguably the worst decision ever made by Montana’s lawmakers and governor.
First to go were the dams, which were sold to an out-of-state utility, Pennsylvania Power and Light.  Next to go was the Montana Power Company itself, taking with it the pensions and stock holdings of Montanans who thought of it as “our” power company.
Then Touch America, headed by Bob Gannon, the former CEO of the Montana Power Company, went bankrupt.
In the meantime, Montanans’ electricity bills began their skyward climb as the dams were sold yet again, each time for a higher price, that was then loaded on customers. Realizing the extent of the damage caused by the deregulation debacle, the Legislature finally decided to re-regulate in 2001. NorthWestern Energy is now our “regulated” electricity supplier since acquiring the system in 2000.
It’s fair to say Montana’s Public Service Commission has not been diligent in holding down rates, which have gone from the lowest to the highest in the region.
But here’s the good news.  Thanks to Brad Molnar, who was a commissioner from 2004-2012, was re-elected in 2024, and is now the new president of the Commission, NorthWestern has finally hit resistance to its unending requests for rate increases.
In a tremendous article, Daily Montanan’s deputy editor, Keila Szpaller, lays out in detail Molnar’s firm stance against the increase.  Citing a 50-year old law, NorthWestern claims the Commission did not take timely action and raised rates nearly 17% on May 25 without Commission approval.
Molnar says the increase “will be crushing to many low-income people, many of whom are simply elderly, that are being handed their butts every day in property tax increases, in utilities, insurance for their houses, insurance for their cars. You name it.  This is a very, very bad time to be a poor person, and this will make it worse.”
If the rate increase is unjustified, NorthWestern will have to refund the over-charge plus 10%.  As Molnar put it: “It is time for them to grow up and quit playing the victim and actually take responsibility for their actions.”
We’ll see what happens, but for now, Montanans owe a debt of gratitude to Commissioner Molnar for finally standing up to NorthWestern instead of rubber-stamping their endless rate increases.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1248907535-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 08:05:41.938341

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed two bills this week that would have enshrined a shield law for health care providers who offer gender-affirming care and ensured protections for transgender people incarcerated at local jails.
The vetoes come as President Donald Trump, who Lombardo supported in the election, has escalated attacks against the LGBTQ+ community in the first few months of his second term and issued several anti-trans orders, including one that blocked federal support for gender-affirming medical care to patients younger than 19.
The governor “turned his back on LGBTQ+ Nevadans and their families—vetoing two critical protections just days into Pride Month,” Silver State Equality State Director André Wade said in a statement. “These bills would have provided critical protections to transgender people seeking healthcare and their medical providers, as well as to transgender people in our criminal justice system.”
To the surprise of many LGBTQ organizers, Lombardo in 2023 signed legislation that prevented insurance companies from discriminating against trans people on the basis of gender identity and required the Nevada Department of Corrections to adopt regulations to protect trans and gender-nonconforming people in prison.
The move at the time made him an outlier among Republican governors and legislatures, which have supported and passed bills targeting the trans and queer community. 
Gender-affirming care is supported by a variety of health providers and medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics. But it has been a high-profile target, and several states, including Utah, have banned it.
Democratic state Sen. James Ohrenschall has said prohibiting gender-affirming care will “not only harm transgender individuals but create a climate of fear and uncertainty for health care providers who offer gender-affirming health care services.”
Nevada law doesn’t restrict medically necessary gender-affirming care, but many LGBTQ advocates and medical providers, including pediatricians, worried bans in other states could prevent trans youth from seeking care and doctors from providing it in Nevada.
Ohrenschall brought legislation in 2023 that sought to enact a shield law for medical providers in Nevada but Lombardo vetoed the bill.
With Senate Bill 171, Ohrenschall used the same language from the 2023 bill to yet again try to bolster protections for medical providers who offer gender-affirming care. It would have prevented a medical licensing board from punishing or disqualifying providers.
The bill passed both the Senate and Assembly in party line votes.
“This bill was a clear opportunity to ensure that transgender Nevadans can access the care they need—and that providers can offer it without fear of legal retaliation,” Wade said. “Transgender people in Nevada deserve safety, dignity, and access to life-saving health care. The Governor’s decision puts all of that at risk.”
In his veto message, Lombardo wrote that the bill “would lead to complicated legal battles and uncertainty about what laws providers must follow” and put medical “licensing boards in the awkward position of navigating potentially conflicting mandates in federal and state law.”
The message was similar to his 2023 veto.
The second trans bill vetoed by Lombardo, Senate Bill 141 would have required local detention facilities to develop policies that address the custody, housing, medical and mental health treatment of transgender, gender non-conforming, and intersex people incarcerated. 
Democratic state Sen. Melanie Scheible, who sponsored the bill, said during its hearing it was similar to legislation she brought in 2023 that required prisons to enact similar policies for trans people who were incarcerated. Lombardo signed that bill.
All 15 Assembly Republicans joined Democrats to unanimously pass SB 141, but the Senate voted along party lines.
In his veto message Lombardo acknowledged that he did “which authorized the Director of the Department of Corrections to implement similar policies through regulation with Board of Prison Commissioners’ approval.”
“Federal authority in this space is potentially evolving and, if altered, could conflict with the provisions of this bill leading to decreased state and local access to vital federal funding,” he wrote.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/trans-visibility-day-scaled-1-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-06-06 08:05:41.938341

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With a citizen-led campaign to impose voter ID requirements heading to the ballots, lawmakers discussed the issue at length Thursday before rejecting a legislative proposal mirroring the ballot initiative.
Several Republican members of the Maine House of Representatives said if returning clothes and buying cigarettes requires photo identification, so should voting. They alleged rampant voter fraud by noncitizens, which Maine’s Secretary of State has said is not the case.
Democrats pushed back, saying Maine already has a robust system to prevent fraud, and that requiring voter ID would disadvantage students, seniors and people with disabilities. With a 72-69 vote, the bill, LD 38, was rejected.
“There is a fundamental difference between having to show an ID to buy alcohol or tobacco products or returning an unwanted item to a store,” said Rep. Kelly Noonan Murphy (D-Scarborough).“None of those things are sacred rights granted to us in the Constitution. And therefore, imposing barriers on that right … is un-American.”
With papers shuffling between chambers this week, Maine Morning Star has compiled a slightly more pared down roundup again for Thursday, focusing on the biggest items of debates as well as legislation and issues that we’ve followed all session.
Here’s an overview of what happened Thursday. 
Both chambers
Both chambers have now passed an amended version of LD 1726, which seeks to improve planning for the future of the energy grid. The House supported it ​​with a 75-69 vote, and the Senate followed suit passing the bill 19-13 Thursday afternoon.
After LD 1928 squeaked through the House with a 72-70 vote, the Senate passed it 17-15. This bill would ban single-use plastic containers — such as mini shampoo bottles — at lodging establishments starting in 2030. 
Although Rep. Michael Soboleski (R-Phillips) said the well-intentioned legislation overlooks sanitation concerns and poses challenges for businesses, others praised it for its potential to chip away at plastic use in the state. 
“A conservative estimate is that this bill could eliminate as many as 73 million single-use plastic bottles per year from Maine’s waste stream as we struggle to recycle our way out of the catastrophe of microplastics, that is meaningful action,” said Rep. Vicki Doudera (D-Camden).
Although the proposed net energy billing reform that could save ratepayers more than $65 million has yet to hit the floors, the Senate and House passed an amended version of LD 839, which would create a fund to offset transmission and distribution costs associated with the policy that would otherwise be passed onto ratepayers. 
Additionally, lawmakers backed a bill requiring internet providers to treat all broadband internet traffic equally, a concept commonly referred to as “net neutrality.” LD 536 passed the House 79-66, while the Senate gave its approval Thursday.
With a 74-67 House vote, both chambers supported LD 246, which asks courts to consider a sentence other than imprisonment for primary caregivers. 
Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn) said the bill is needed because “the research is clear, children with incarcerated parents are more likely to face mental health challenges, exhibit behavioral problems, experience social isolation and suffer from economic hardship. These children are also more likely to perform poorly in school and have higher absentee rates.”
With a 73-69 vote, the House also passed LD 1859, a bill that would offer regional hubs for childcare, which can serve as access points in communities, tailored to the needs of those families. The Senate approved it Wednesday. 
Both chambers have now rejected LD 1476, which sought to impose a new lodging fee to help fund homeless shelters in the state. 
A heavily amended version of LD 1787 passed in the Senate after the House gave approval Wednesday. The bill initially sought to allow candidates for district attorney, sheriff and county commissioner to participate in the Maine Clean Election Act, but the version now being considered was amended to increase the contribution limits for gubernatorial seed money donations. (Read more about other proposals related to changing Maine’s clean elections here.) 
Legislation (LD 1900) to grant authority to certain Wabanaki Nations to develop tribal power districts and recognize the authority for child support enforcement passed the House 75-67 on Wednesday and Senate 20-12.
There was also bipartisan support for LD 1886, which would extend the current penalties applied when a motor vehicle violation results in death to violations that result in serious bodily harm. 
Lawmakers killed a proposal (LD 1461) to prohibit school boards from adopting a mask mandate unless directed by a health agency. 
So far, the Legislature has only supported modest refinements to the state’s paid family and medical leave. That approach continued Thursday, when two more bills looking to amend the program were rejected. 
LD 1169, which would allow employers to get a refund for any premiums paid into the state’s plan if they are approved to use a private substitute plan, was voted down 73-68 by the House and 18-14 by the Senate. Both chambers also rejected LD 1400, which looked to exempt certain public school employees from the program.
And the Senate cast a final enactment vote for LD 588, which would give agricultural employees the right to engage in certain concerted activity, which includes talking about wages, working conditions and other employment matters with other employees or the employer. (Read more about that here.)
Non-concurrent matters
After the Senate narrowly voted it down, the House passed LD 1535, which would require the Public Utilities Commission to gather a group of municipal, police and fire officials to discuss the high electricity usage related to illegal cannabis grows in the state. During discussions Wednesday, Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec) said the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee is carrying over legislation into the next session that could provide a more comprehensive approach, including this sort of study.
The Senate insisted on its original vote Thursday night. 
Leaving it in limbo, the House did not again take up LD 810, the bill seeking to modify the law born out of a 2021 referendum question requiring the Maine Legislature to approve any new high-impact transmission lines. 
It fell shy of passage in the House with lawmakers voting 72-75 before ultimately killing the bill under the hammer. However, the Senate passed the bill 18-16 Wednesday.
During an evening session, the Senate rejected LD 1036, which would prohibit landlords from refusing to rent to tenants solely because they rely on programs such as General Assistance or housing vouchers. Since the House passed the proposal 72-70 on Wednesday, the lower chamber will need to take it up again. 
Sen. Chip Curry (D-Waldo) said this is an important issue, but asked the Senate to reject the measure simply because the Judiciary Committee is carrying a similar bill into the next session to allow more time to work on it. 
Although the House rejected LD 1236 earlier in the day on Thursday, the Senate voted 22-10 in favor of its passage after a failed 16-16 vote to reject the bill and impassioned floor speeches about the importance of addressing the presence of fentanyl in the state. 
The amended version of the bill seeks to create a Class A crime for aggravated trafficking of fentanyl when it results in an overdose. 
While no one refuted that fentanyl poses a crisis, Curry said the state can’t incarcerate its way out of it. Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart said he supports a multipronged approach to solving the substance use crisis including access to treatment and other supports, but argued that this bill could bolster that.
Senate action
The Senate advanced two bills that aim to support mobile home park residents in purchasing their parks. (Read more about that here.)
Maine is one step closer to joining its New England peers who all have so-called food waste bans on the books now that the Senate has approved a slightly amended version of LD 1065. The bill would prohibit significant generators of food waste, which could include schools, hospitals, food producers and others, from disposing of food waste if they are close to a facility that could compost or otherwise dispose of the waste.

Democratic state Sen. Rochelle Nguyen’s Senate Bill 316 would have established “guardrails” for pharmaceutical benefit managers, such as requiring PBMs to pass along to consumers rebate savings they receive from the drug companies. Nguyen led the legislative effort but a bipartisan group of eight other lawmakers signed on, including Republican state Sen. Jeff Stone, a pharmacist, and Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus, a medical doctor.
The Senate and Assembly passed different versions of SB216, both with broad bipartisan support. Only Democratic state Sens. Dina Neal and Fabian Donate opposed. However, those votes came in the waning days of the legislative session, and the Senate did not get around to voting on whether to accept the Assembly’s amendments.
Here are 14 other bills the Nevada Current has covered that fell short (or really far) from becoming law during the 2025 Legislative Session.

Pet store ban. Assembly Bill 487 originally sought to ban retail pet sales statewide, following the lead of several municipalities that banned them within their borders. The bill, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Natha Anderson, passed the Assembly with bipartisan support. It appeared stalled in the Senate but, right before a key deadline, was heard by a Senate committee and amended into a study bill. When it returned to the Assembly for concurrence, Anderson moved for the chamber to reject the amendment. A trio of lawmakers from both chambers were chosen for what’s known as a “conference committee” to try and reconcile the differences between the chambers. But it appears no action was taken. That means retail pet sales remain legal in municipalities without bans.
Education management organizations. Senate Bill 318 (State Sen. Skip Daly, D) would have banned charter schools from contracting with for-profit education management organizations. The bill passed the Senate on party lines, with all Republicans opposing. It was referred to the Assembly Education Committee but was never given a hearing. That committee is chaired by Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett, who is also the executive director of a Las Vegas charter school contracted with Academica, the largest EMO in the state.
Third-party ticket vendors. Senate Bill 431 originally attempted to remove an exemption Nevada-based sports teams have from the state’s 8% live entertainment tax on tickets. That is an effort Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal has pushed in prior sessions. This year, the bill was amended into a bill to apply LET to tickets resold by third-party vendors like StubHub. Some of the funding would have supported public transit. The amended bill passed the Assembly with bipartisan support but was never given a floor vote in the Senate.
Farm worker protections. Senate Bill 172 (State Sen. Edgar Flores, D) sought to bolster protections for farm workers and amend overtime pay laws to include agriculture workers. The bill passed the Senate on party lines, with all Republicans opposing, but got stuck in the Assembly.
Free phone calls for prisoners. Senate Bill 323 (State Sen. Melanie Scheible, D) would have created a pilot program to provide free phone calls at Florence McClure Women’s Correctional Center. The bill passed the Senate with 20-0, with one senator excused from the vote, but died on the Assembly side.
Traffic cams in construction zones. Assembly Bill 402 (Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett, D) would have authorized traffic monitoring cameras in construction work zones when workers are present. The bill passed the Assembly with some bipartisan support, but then got stuck in the Senate Finance Committee. It was one of two “red light camera” bills introduced into the session this year. The other missed a legislative deadline earlier in the session.
Prison food study. Assembly Bill 246 (Assemblymember Venicia Considine, D) proposed a study on food quality, waste and nutrition within Nevada Department of Corrections prisons. The bill was considered and passed by the Assembly Judiciary Committee, but died in the chamber’s Ways & Means Committee.
Graduate assistant unions. Assembly Bill 191 (Assemblymember Natha Anderson, D) would have given graduate assistants the right to collectively bargain for better pay and conditions. The bill got stuck in the Assembly Ways & Means Committee.
Commerce tax. Assembly Bill 276 (Assemblymember P.K. O’Neill, R) would have adjusted the commerce tax threshold to inflation. The bill got stuck in the Assembly Ways & Means Committee.
Weight-loss drugs. Senate Bill 244 (State Sen. Roberta Lange, D) would have expanded the types of obesity treatments covered by Nevada Medicaid, including approving weight-loss drugs like Ozempic for wider use. The bill got stuck in the Senate Finance Committee.
‘Second Look’ Assembly Bill 91 (Assemblymember Erica Roth, D) is known as “second look” legislation and would have created an avenue for those incarcerated to have sentences reviewed by the State Board of Parole Commissioners after they’ve served extended periods of time. The bill passed the Assembly on party lines, then died in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Lombardo’s health care bill Senate Bill 495, known as the Nevada Health Care Access Act, was Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s health care bill. It passed the Senate on party lines, with Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus urging her caucus to oppose the bill over amendments added by Democrats related to freestanding emergency rooms. The Assembly did not vote on the bill.
SNAP app. Assembly Bill 474 would have required DWSS to create  a “Smart Surplus Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.” The bill was criticized by local food banks, but passed the Assembly 40-1. Only Democratic Assemblymember Venicia Considine opposed. It was heard by the Senate Health and Human Services Committee but never voted out.
Artificial intelligence. Senate Bill 199 (State Sen. Dina Neal, D) would establish guardrails around artificial intelligence. The bill passed out of a Senate committee in early April but saw no activity after that.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PXL_20250603_180716026-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-06 08:05:41.938341

The announcement came on Wednesday, more than three years after three environmental groups – the Center for Biological Diversity, The Institute for Regional Conservation, and the National Parks Conservation Association— filed a petition requesting that the ghost orchid be listed under the law as a threatened species.
The ghost orchid is endemic to southwestern Florida and western Cuba. It is estimated that its population has declined by more than 90% around the world, and by up to 50% in Florida.
There are only an estimated 1,500 ghost orchids remaining in Florida, and less than half are known to be mature enough to reproduce. They are located mostly in the Big Cypress National Preserve, Florida Panther’s National Wildlife Refuge, Fakahatchee Strand Preserve Park, Audubon’s Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, and other conservation areas in Collier, Hendry, and possibly Lee counties.
Among the factors that have led to the flower decreasing in population are the consequences of poaching as well as recent major storms, such as Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricane Ian in 2022, says Jaclyn Lopez, an attorney with the Jacobs Law Clinic for Democracy and the Environment at Stetson University’s College of Law based in Pinellas County, who is representing the conservation groups.

Other factors that have led to the ghost orchid becoming more vulnerable include increased development and climate change. The ghost orchid is a leafless plant species that uses its roots to photosynthesize and attach itself to a host tree.
“The habitat changes that happen used to be quite slow over time. As sea levels have changed historically that allowed plants to move,” Lopez said. “The difference now is that the levels are rising much more quickly, not really giving plants the opportunity to adapt and to migrate on their own, and so the concern is that some of these trees could be lost to sea level rise.”
In February 2023, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission posted on social media that it had apprehended individuals attempting to steal a ghost orchid. In their petition to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the conservation groups noted that one of the chief threats to the ghost orchid was “overcollection,” and therefore they did not list the exact locations of where the populations of the flower exist.
However, Lopez says that the Endangered Species Act requires very specific data to be included in the petition process, so the conservation groups were still able to provide that information to the Fish and Wildlife Service confidentially.
“We understood that the principal threat is poaching, so we had to make sure that we weren’t going to be the reason poachers could find out their exact location,” she said, adding that the federal agency was later able to communicate directly with officials at Big Cypress and Corkscrew to provide “location specific information on the species” right down to the individual plant.
In a statement, Elise Bennett, the Florida and Caribbean director and attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, welcomed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s announcement on the ghost orchid, but said it was far too early to celebrate.
“[W]ith the Trump administration’s incessant attacks on landmark environmental laws meant to stop species from going extinct, we know our job here isn’t done,” she said. “We’ll continue to do what’s necessary to ensure the ghost orchid and every other iconic Florida species has a fighting chance to thrive in our beautiful state.”
“People love plants,” adds Lopez. “They’re part of our own ecosystem and habitat. They’re part of the aesthetic of living in Florida. And ghost orchids in particular are like the movie star of that ecosystem, so I imagine that this proposal will be gladly supported. I don’t expect any political interference or backlash as a result. so we’re just hopeful that the administration is able to move forward without further delay in giving the species finally all the protection that it needs.”
The Fish and Wildlife Service is taking public comments on the proposed rule until August 4.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The 11 candidates running to become New Jersey’s next governor have a head-spinning list of people endorsing them, everyone from union leaders to celebrities and powerful politicians to obscure municipal officials.
While endorsements typically do little to change election outcomes, political observers say they matter more in crowded primary races like New Jersey’s, where they can sway undecided voters or serve as a tipping point in tight contests. The primaries are on Tuesday, June 10.
“Voters who are less familiar with the candidates and less informed about the race may use endorsements and establishment support as a guidepost,” said Alyssa Maurice, head of research at the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton University. “But for voters who are very engaged and rallied around a preferred candidate, an endorsement is not going to change their mind. It’s not going to be a game-changer.”
Engaged voters likely will be the only people who bother to vote in Tuesday’s primaries, with a recent Rutgers-Eagleton poll showing most registered voters aren’t even aware an election is approaching.
A low turnout could give endorsements more weight than they’d otherwise have and narrow slim margins between candidates in toss-up races, said Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.
In the race to replace Gov. Phil Murphy, former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli is considered the front-runner of five candidates in the GOP primary, while the six-candidate Democratic race remains wide open.
“In a low-turnout primary, where a small number of votes can shape the electorate, every group of votes matters,” Rasmussen said. “Low turnout magnifies the effects of real endorsements that actually drive votes.”
Endorsements only drive votes if they’re backed up with money and canvassing to publicize them and deliver voters to the ballot box, he said.
Some groups have proven especially adept at both, he added. He pointed to the Vaad in Lakewood, an influential coalition of Orthodox Jewish rabbis whose mobilizing helped Assemblyman Avi Schnall topple a four-term incumbent in 2023.
“They have like a high-tech phone tree where they make sure everybody knows, and everybody votes. That is an endorsement that very much matters. There’s no question that’s going to translate into votes,” Rasmussen said.
The Vaad endorsed Ciattarelli and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat, for governor in the upcoming primaries.
The New Jersey Education Association, the union that represents about 200,000 teachers statewide, is another group whose endorsement carries weight — largely because teachers, like most college graduates, tend to vote more faithfully than other demographics, Rasmussen added.
Sean Spiller, one of the six Democrats vying to become governor, landed that endorsement easily — he’s the union’s president.
“They’re putting huge political capital into this endorsement, and I would argue that Spiller’s candidacy wouldn’t even exist if it wasn’t for the NJEA endorsement,” Rasmussen said. “It’s completely symbiotic, in their case, they’re joined at the hip. So there is very likely to be a lot of understanding among teachers in New Jersey of that endorsement.”
Endorsements can cut both ways, he said. He noted that most of the campaign cash boosting Spiller’s bid is funded by an outside group backed by teachers’ dues, which irritated some union members and could make the endorsement backfire at the ballot box.
George Norcross’ endorsement of Democrat Steve Sweeney, the former Senate president, also raised some eyebrows. While many political candidates would want the powerful South Jersey Democratic power broker’s backing, Norcross has plenty of critics, especially since he was indicted last year for racketeering (a judge dismissed the charges in February).
Democrat Steve Fulop also has sought to make rival Rep. Mikie Sherrill’s endorsements “double-edged swords” by denigrating her as the establishment candidate, Rasmussen said. She has collected endorsements from party committees around the state.
“He’s trying to make them into a liability, a sign that he’s the unbossed candidate, he’s the candidate that’s building a new way of doing things,” Rasmussen said.
Otherwise, endorsements largely align with the candidate’s politics and signal something about them, Maurice said. Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, won the support of a group of progressive groups like the New Jersey Working Families Party.
“Everyone has their unique lane, and I think their endorsements reflect that lane that they’ve chosen to run on,” she said. “Sherrill won the most local endorsement contests with establishment Democrats, and institutional support. Sweeney has his South Jersey support. Baraka and Fulop have support from the anti-establishment or progressive groups. Spiller obviously has the teachers union.”
The timing of endorsements also matters, Rasmussen and Maurice agreed.
President Donald Trump endorsed Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner in her bid last year for U.S. Senate, but the endorsement came long before he was reelected, as he fought corruption charges in Manhattan. Serrano Glassner lost in the GOP primary to Republican Curtis Bashaw, who then lost in the general election to Democrat Andy Kim, now New Jersey’s junior senator.
Since Trump’s reelection, the Republican candidates vying for governor — aside from Sen. Jon Bramnick, a longtime anti-Trumper — battled fiercely for both his endorsement and the support of his devotees (Ciattarelli won Trump’s support). Whichever GOP candidate wins the primary, though, that strategy will likely change for November’s election, Maurice said.
“That candidate is going to have to walk a tightrope when it comes to Trump and how much to align himself with the President,” she said. “The effect of a Trump endorsement in the general will really depend on the political mood come November, because a lot can change, so time will tell.”
Other notable endorsements in the governor’s race include:

Baraka — Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman and LaMonica McIver, Make the Road Action New Jersey, New Jersey Citizen Action, the Good Government Coalition of New Jersey, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee
Bramnick — The Philadelphia Inquirer, former House Speaker John Boehner
Ciattarelli — The New Jersey State Retired Police and Firemen’s Association
Fulop — College Democrats of New Jersey, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Progressive Change Campaign Committee
Gottheimer — Assemblyman Gary Schaer, guitarist Stevie Van Zandt
Republican Mario Kranjac — Newt Gingrich and Curtis Sliwa (founder of the Guardian Angels)
Sherrill — Former tennis star Billie Jean King, Sierra Club, Maine Gov. Janet Mills
Republican Bill Spadea — Right to Life (state and national)
Sweeney — Reps. Donald Norcross and Herb Conaway and about 25 union chapters

Mere weeks after taking flak for an unannounced visit to India initially paid for by an undisclosed business, the IndyStar revealed that he was out of the country — again without sharing his travel plans and paid for by an outside organization. 

 

Indiana Democrats are upset that I took some time away from the office.
I decided to give them some feedback on their press release and clear up some misconceptions.

— Diego Morales (@cdiegomorales) May 31, 2025
 

Since the story broke, he has revealed that organizers with the Conservative Political Action Conference picked up the tab for his Hungary visit while pointedly posting about his “personal time” online. But he spoke on both international trips as Indiana’s Secretary of State, not in his personal capacity.
“This certainly, to me, looks political and partisan. And so if someone else is footing the bill for him to make these international trips, it’s certainly worthwhile for your typical voter but also other branches of government … to know where that money is coming from,” said Greg Shufeldt, an associate professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis. 
The website for the Office of the Secretary of State doesn’t include any mention of international relations, but is centered on election oversight, registering businesses and trademarks, and licensing vehicle dealerships. 
Returning the office’s focus to those duties is part of the campaign platform for both Republican challengers who announced in recent weeks.
Knox County Clerk Dave Shelton ran against Morales in the 2022 convention but fell short in the final tally. He announced his bid with Indy Politics in April, days before Morales posted about his intention to run for reelection. 
Shelton described the position itself as the destination, rather than a stepping stone for another office, adding that his early announcement is designed to give him time to meet with delegates. 
“I want to do the job without fanfare. I don’t need my picture taken; I don’t need to make headlines,” said Shelton. “I just want the personal satisfaction of doing the job to the best of my abilities. I will not be a taxpayer-funded tourist on a statewide search for photo ops. That is not me.” 
Party candidates for the secretary of state are chosen by delegates at a convention, rather than through a primary process. The convention is scheduled for next summer, meaning that candidates can’t yet officially submit their names for consideration.

Jamie Reitenour outperformed a former attorney general in the Republican primary election for governor last year and now has her sights set on the office.
“To be super honest, I’m just offended. I’m offended for Hoosiers that he is not taking the secretary of state job, in my opinion, very seriously,” Reitenour told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “It’s an administrative job; it’s not meant to be a job where you’re constantly posting about all your travel.”
Questions about international trips sent to Morales’ campaign didn’t get a response before publication, but the politician has shot back at critics online and in a recent WOWO interview. 
“… I will always take every opportunity to promote Indiana. I am always Indiana Secretary of State, even when I’m out of the office on personal time,” said Morales in a statement shared with Indy Politics. “I will continue to promote Indiana across the nation and internationally.” 
 Traveling for other, political purposes?

Unlike other state employees, the State Personnel Department has little oversight over elected officials. Elected officials don’t punch a time clock or have limits on personal or vacation time. And there are few restrictions or transparency about travel. 
The latter could change following a new state law mandating that such officeholders report their travel expenses from trips “taken in an official capacity” and whether state funding was used. It’s unclear if this would capture Morales’ international trips, where he spoke as Indiana Secretary of State but wasn’t explicitly on state business. 
“Broadly, the travel that Diego Morales is doing is frequently not tied to the day-to-day functions of his secretary of state duties,” Shufeldt said. “Moreover, if you assume that one of his chief responsibilities is the lead election official in the state, Hungary is not the place to go.” 
Indiana SOS publicly posts about India trip after 10 days away

Hungary is no longer considered a democracy to European Union officials, but the CPAC conference could be a jumping off point for other offices for Morales. His wife is also Honorary Consul of Hungary to Indiana.
“He is an ambitious politician and if his end goal was to be secretary of state, he probably wouldn’t be engaging in these sorts of things,” said Shufeldt. “But he’s trying to cement himself in conservative circles outside of the state — whether that is for a future gubernatorial run or congressional run — these things are very clearly tactical, strategic choices to put himself in conservative or illiberal spaces.” 
Former statewide elected officials, speaking generally about office travel, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle they tried not to overlap personal vacations with official duties. 
“Vacation time was limited for me. And when I had vacation time, I valued that and prioritized that with my family,” said Tim Berry, who has held multiple statewide offices. “I really tried to ensure that (it) was reserved just for family time and tried to keep that somewhat separate as much as possible.” 
Berry, a former Indiana Republican Party chair, served as the state’s auditor from 2007 until 2013 after being state treasurer for eight years. 
Critics have questioned if paying for Morales’ international trips would qualify as a campaign contribution. He recently revealed that he paid back the business that initially covered the excursion to India to protect them from “the crazy left,” as reported by State Affairs Indiana. 
Morales is no stranger to criticism. The politician started his term by hiring his brother-in-law for a six-figure position — a loophole to the state’s nepotism law — and bought a $90,000 vehicle with taxpayer money. Additionally, he showered his team with spot bonuses and has been accused of using his office for self-promotion with his name in large font on yard signs, an election security guide and printed maps — the latter of which was criticized by a sitting senator. 
Most recently, the office spent $100,000 for 5-second public service messages on digital billboards around the state, flashing messages about voting alongside directives to learn more about the office’s business and automotive dealership oversight. 
 The challengers

Self-described election nerd Shelton spends much of his time tinkering with and thinking about the minutiae of administration, having won recognition from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission for designing stabilizer brackets for e-pollbooks and improving accessibility for disabled voters. 
But, when he just started out, he said he conferred with other clerks rather than getting assistance from the secretary of state’s office. Even today, “they don’t have that experience” in the office, he said. 
“When you become a county clerk, you’re left, basically, to your own devices on how to learn to do the job,” Shelton said. “One of the things that I want to do is set up an in-person, intensive election boot camp for new clerks. Because our elections are not something you can learn by watching a PowerPoint presentation.”


The eventual Republican nominee might face a familiar name in the fall. 
Beau Bayh, son of former Indiana governor and U.S. Senator Evan Bayh, is said to be interested. He told the Indiana Capital Chronicle he can’t comment as a federal courts employee but his clerkship ends in August. 
Libertarian Lauri Shillings has also signaled her intention to seek her party’s nomination.


Since his showing at the 2022 convention, Shelton said some delegates have expressed “extreme buyer’s remorse” to him. 
“I’m telling people that I want to be a very boring secretary of state,” Shelton summarized. 
For her part, Reitenour calls for a return to paper ballots, fortifying Indiana’s election oversight and more state leadership aligned with President Donald Trump. 
“There’s been more than enough from the President’s administration … in regards to foreign adversaries and the fact that our elections are targeted. So it needs to be taken really seriously,” Reitenour said. “… Obviously, I’m a fan of President Trump. I’m an even greater fan of his leadership. I just think it’s unparalleled the way he’s approached politics … I intend to operate with that same diligence.”
She also vowed to hold weekly press conferences and emphasized the need for an officeholder who balances consumer and business interests, rather than someone who favors one party over the other. 
“I think (the office) will be unrecognizable. It’ll be like, ‘That was Diego traveling the world and this is Jamie right now.’ We’ll be focused on the state of Indiana,” Reitenour concluded. 
Indianapolis Rep. Andrew Ireland has also been floated as a possible contender, though he declined to comment for this story. 
Candidates willing to challenge an incumbent “is a promising sign for small-d democracy,” said Shufeldt, though the outcome is less certain.
Morales himself defeated incumbent Secretary of State Holli Sullivan in 2022, but he was appointed by former Gov. Eric Holcomb and lost due to pandemic-era pushback to Holcomb.
Delegates also rejected the establishment candidate, Rep. Julie McGuire, in favor of Micah Beckwith in the nomination for lieutenant governor last summer, signaling continued support for unconventional candidates.
“It doesn’t necessarily bode well for that more pragmatic … governing wing of the Republican party,” said Shufeldt. “Right now, the actions of Morales and Beckwith appear to be the types of actions I would think come from a politician that thinks they’re untouchable.”

DemasEarly data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services suggests that deaths from opioid overdoses may have declined for the third year in a row. 
According to provisional data from the MDHHS, the state saw a 34% decline in overdose deaths between 2023 and 2024, a decrease of roughly 1,000 deaths.
In response Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel applauded the state’s work to reduce opioid deaths through prevention, treatment, recovery and harm reduction options, many of which are funded by Michigan’s participation in national opioid settlements. 
“The progress we are seeing in combatting the opioid epidemic proves what is possible when real investments are made in treatment and prevention,” Nessel said in a statement. “My office will continue working to hold those responsible for this crisis accountable to ensure the health and well-being of residents are put ahead of corporate greed and help support long-term recovery efforts for Michigan families.”
Since taking office in 2019, Nessel has helped secure more than $1.6 billion in settlements from companies including McKinsey & Co, Distributors Cardinal Health, McKesson, Inc., and AmerisourceBergen, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceutical, Allergan Pharmaceutical, CVS, Walmart and Walgreens.
The majority of these settlement funds are distributed equally between local governments and the state’s Opioid Healing and Recovery Fund. The funds also supported the distribution of more than 1.3 million naloxone kits – alongside other efforts – which have been used to reverse overdose in nearly 34,000 reported instances. 
The state’s chief medical executive, Natasha Bagdasarian, noted that this most recent year of data puts Michigan among the top 5 states for reducing opioid deaths. 
“Through the work of the Michigan Opioids Task Force and our local partners, we’ve distributed more than a million naloxone kits, strengthened our data systems, prevented thousands of overdose deaths using naloxone, and helped people access the care and support they need,” Bagdasarian said in a statement.

Etched into law in 2019, the public long-term care insurance program known as WA Cares survived an attempt to torpedo it at the ballot box last year. Already, $2 billion in tax collections have been banked in the program’s trust fund through the end of March.
Lawmakers continue to fine-tune the program ahead of its rollout next summer.
This past legislative session brought revisions intended to welcome back thousands of people who opted out of the program and to unite the state-run, worker-funded entitlement with private long-term care insurers.
“It’s a test case for the nation. It’s going to be amazing when we roll it out,” said Cathy Knight, state director of the Washington Association of Area Agencies on Aging. “We’ve needed something like this for a long time. It’s not perfect. But for people going through a difficult time, it will be a tremendous help.”
Other states are watching. Like Washington, they face rising costs of care for an aging population, tight state budgets and uncertainties around federal support for Medicaid, said Ben Veghte, director of WA Cares for the Department of Social and Health Services.
“Nobody wants to leave families unprotected dealing with this risk,” he said. “This is seen by many states as a promising model.”
The basics
WA Cares is funded with a 0.58% tax on the paychecks of workers in Washington. It amounts to just under $25 a month for those earning $50,000 a year, rising to $39 a month for those making $80,000 annually.
Collections by the state began in July 2023. A person pays as long as they are working in the state. Deductions stop if they retire, become unemployed or leave the workforce, and resume if the person returns to work.
Beginning on July 1, 2026, those living in Washington who qualify can begin accessing the long-term care benefit, which has a lifetime cap of $36,500, adjusted over time for inflation. Eligible beneficiaries living out of state can tap into benefits starting July 1, 2030. 
The money can be used to offset expenses like in-home caretaking, respite for family caregivers, equipment, medication and meals for people who are older, injured or disabled. In all, 19 different types of services are covered. 
There are two paths to becoming eligible for the full benefit amount – contribute for 10 years or pay in for three years within the last six from the date they apply for benefits. Near-retirees, defined as those born before 1968, who do not become eligible for the full amount will earn a pro-rated share of 10% for each year they work.
A person must work at least 500 hours during the year to earn a qualifying year.
Not every worker is in the program. Before the state started collecting payroll taxes — deemed premiums by the state — those with qualifying private long-term care insurance could opt out. An estimated 413,000 individuals chose this option, according to the Employment Security Department.
A work in progress
This program has faced criticism since its inception. 
Some objected to its mandatory nature. Others said it was unfair that if someone stopped working for a while, then returned, they lost credit for the contributions made before the break.
Critics and supporters said there should be exemptions for people who work in Washington but live out of state. And there was pressure to make the benefits “portable,” so if a person moved out of state after paying into the fund, they would be able to access the benefits.
As the pile of concerns grew, the Legislature passed a law in January 2022 delaying the start of payroll tax collections and delivery of benefits by 18 months, providing time to retool in response to critiques.
Changes made since then allow older workers nearing retirement to get partial benefits. The list of exemptions expanded to include people who live outside of Washington but work in the state, spouses of active-duty military service members, those with non-immigrant work visas, and veterans who meet certain disability requirements.
Meanwhile, Let’s Go Washington, a conservative political committee, capitalized on the frustrations in 2023, gathering 424,000 voter signatures to put an initiative targeting the program on the ballot. That measure, which was in front of voters last November, sought to make participation voluntary rather than mandatory, allowing workers to opt out whenever they want. Voters defeated Initiative 2124.
As the political fight played out, lawmakers made more revisions. Some seemed to come in direct response to concerns raised by program critics. Almost all reflected recommendations of the Long Term Services and Supports Commission, the panel of legislators, agency representatives and community members tasked with monitoring and implementing the program.
A law passed in 2024 makes the benefit available for those who leave the state if they’ve paid into the fund during their career.
And a few weeks ago, Gov. Bob Ferguson signed Senate Bill 5291, which makes several notable alterations.
It allows workers to rescind their private insurance exemptions and opt in. The period to rescind exemptions starts Jan. 1, 2026 and ends July 1, 2028.

State officials said they’ve heard from people who are interested because premiums for their policies have increased. Others said that the array of changes, such as making it possible to use benefits outside of Washington, made it worth joining.
The new law assures people who get out of the workforce for any period of time will resume building credit toward full eligibility when they return. It also provides automatic exemptions for active-duty military members with off-duty civilian work and non-immigrant visa holders.
And it opens a path for private insurers to create supplemental long-term care insurance policies designed for individuals with WA Cares benefits. This is expected to result in options for long-term care that are more affordable.
As envisioned, WA Cares benefits would cover the deductible of the private plan. So when an individual uses up their benefits, the supplemental private plan they purchase will kick in. 
Private plans will need approval by the Office of the Insurance Commissioner. 
There will be some requirements for the private plans. They must provide at least 12 months of coverage after WA Cares benefits are exhausted and allow people to keep their current care providers when transitioning between programs. The policies must also include options to reduce benefits rather than lose coverage if someone becomes unable to pay increased premiums, and they must cover care provided by qualified family members.
Finally, the new law clears the way to test the system for managing eligibility and paying providers. Up to 400 people in four counties — Thurston, Mason, Lewis and Spokane — are to be part of a pilot program that would run from Jan. 1, 2026 up until the formal launch.
There’s much work to be done in the next 13 months. Veghte is convinced the payoff will be felt across the state.
Aging is a phase of life “when we’re all extremely vulnerable. I’ve seen it with both my parents how vulnerable you can become when you’re frail and can’t live independently,” he said. “Having a pot of money the family can use to support that person in those times is a tremendous improvement in the quality of life for aging Washingtonians.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/long-term-care-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-06 08:05:41.938341

Utah is among several Western states seeking to reduce federal land ownership. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Public outcry was swift and forceful after a U.S. House committee last month hastily approved an amendment directing the federal government to sell off more than half a million acres of public land.
A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.
Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
 The ‘balance sheet’

In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.
Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.
“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”
Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.
But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison [to sell off public land]. It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.
 Housing arguments

The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.

In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“[The amendment] is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. ” … It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”
Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “ … There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.
 The costs of management

In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.

“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “ … If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

(Photo from Indiana State Archives)Many Hoosiers recently learned that Indiana has an immunity statute that protects lawmakers from some arrests during the legislative session. The reaction has been surprise and frustration.
One social media user posted, “How have we gotten to the point in this state where our elected leaders are above the law? This is pure insanity & would NEVER be acceptable for the average citizen.”
Another reader responded, “Are they immune from common sense too?”
So, I thought I would delve into the provision and explain why it exists and how often it’s used.
History
State Sen. Mike Bohacek was pulled over for suspected drunk driving in January and recorded a blood-alcohol content of 0.238%. But the Michiana Shores Republican wasn’t charged until this week due to the legislative immunity provision.
The first important fact is that no modern-day lawmaker created this exemption, and it basically mirrors a similar provision for federal lawmakers. The National Conference of State Legislatures said most state constitutions contain similar provisions.
The state’s prohibition is found in Article 4, Section 8 of the Indiana Constitution.
“Senators and Representatives, in all cases except treason, felony, and breach of the peace, shall be privileged from arrest, during the session of the General Assembly, and in going to and returning from the same; and shall not be subject to any civil process, during the session of the General Assembly, nor during the fifteen days next before the commencement thereof.”
Indiana’s current Constitution was adopted in 1851 with numerous amendments since then. But this portion goes back as far as the state’s 1816 constitution before Indiana became a state. Then it was under Article 3.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
For a long time, there was no definition of breach of the peace in Indiana code but lawmakers in 2021 added one: “breaking or disturbing the public peace, order, or decorum by any riotous, forcible, or unlawful proceedings, including fighting or tumultuous conduct.”
The federal immunity provision is almost exact. Some historical texts indicate the language was created so that lawmakers weren’t blocked from being able to vote on a matter or otherwise participate in proceedings.
In his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story said this:
“When a representative is withdrawn from his seat by a summons, the people whom he represents, lose their voice in debate and vote, as they do in his voluntary absence. When a senator is withdrawn by summons, his state loses half its voice in debate and vote, as it does in his voluntary absence. The enormous disparity of the evil admits of no comparison. The privilege, indeed, is deemed not merely the privilege of the member, or his constituents, but the privilege of the house also.”
The Supreme Court of the United States has interpreted the provision to apply to all crimes, but Indiana has generally seen it used in cases of misdemeanors.
Examples
Bohacek’s case is almost identical to one from 1992 when then-Rep. Keith Bulen was pulled over for drunk driving in January. Police also didn’t arrest him due to the immunity clause and he was charged weeks later after session ended. Similar to Bohacek, Bulen refused the breathalyzer test and said a prescribed medicine made him groggy. But Bulen’s incident resulted in him hitting an off-duty police officer’s car.
Bulen’s case, though, was not hidden from public view at the time. He was eventually acquitted.
In 2002, two northwest Indiana lawmakers — Reps. Charlie Brown and Vernon Smith — used the provision to contest their criminal case.
The Gary Post Tribune reported the pair was arrested June 18 on traffic and related offenses. They protested the action and claimed they were shown a lack of respect as elected officials and residents.
The legislature was in special session in Indianapolis, although the men were in Gary.
They were arrested immediately but the chief of police quickly apologized. The men were charged with obstructing traffic later that year by a special prosecutor. Smith was acquitted but Brown was found guilty.
If Hoosiers want to change the constitutional provision they will have to convince lawmakers to start that years-long process because Indiana doesn’t allow citizen-initiated constitutional amendments or referendums.
It remains to be seen what will happen to Bohacek, including any punishment by leaders of the Senate. Voters have the ultimate say on consequences at the ballot box, but they will have to wait a long time. Bohacek isn’t up for election again until 2028.

Missouri U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley was clear in his priorities for the legislation, writing in early May that “slashing health insurance for the working poor is … both morally wrong and politically suicidal.” President Donald Trump was blunter, telling lawmakers not to “f**k around with Medicaid.”
The bill passed by the House, does not pass their test – it does not, as Trump and Hawley claim, contain “NO MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS.” Instead, it will kick millions of people off of Medicaid by piling on new red tape. And it will bury under-resourced state Medicaid offices in so much paperwork that they will be at risk of collapse. 
Together, these forces will mean that eligible Americans in Missouri and around the country will not have access to their Medicaid. Many will be left without health care as they prepare to bring a child into the world, face a new cancer diagnosis, or manage a chronic illness. In other words, if this bill passes, Medicaid will be cut for Missourians when they most need it. 
The House bill imposes new bureaucratic requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries, forcing them to file piles of new paperwork about their jobs, schools, disabilities, or sick family members to keep the health insurance they are already eligible for under the law.
These so-called “work requirements” do not boost employment as advertised – experiments in other states have repeatedly failed to do so. This is, in part, because the vast majority of Medicaid beneficiaries who can work already do. That makes sense – you can’t buy food and pay rent with a health insurance card. 
The reason this bill reduces the cost of Medicaid by billions of dollars is that it assumes regular people will get tangled in the red tape of proving they are eligible for Medicaid. Experts project that over 10 million eligible people will lose their health care because of all the paperwork, including over 180,000 Missourians.
But we believe that even this prognosis is too optimistic. Most analyses only consider the difficulty that people will have proving that they are entitled to Medicaid under the law, but not the difficulty states will have in administering the new paperwork requirements.
We have spent the last several years modernizing the systems that deliver benefits to millions of Americans, including Medicaid. What we have learned is that state Medicaid systems, including MO HealthNet, are already on the brink – and lack the resources and resilience to take on the onslaught of requirements and deadlines about to hit them. Trump’s tax legislation, the new requirements it imposes, and the lightning-fast timeline it requires, are setting Medicaid up for a collapse. 
Here’s how it could play out. States are responsible for determining Medicaid eligibility. They allow people to enroll in one of four ways – by mailing in documents, enrolling online, applying over the phone, or walking into a physical office. Each of these pathways is already at a tipping point.
Medicaid agencies around the country have staff vacancies as high as 30 percent, which means there are already too few workers to open mail, process applications, answer the phones, and staff walk-in centers. As a result, even under the current system, eligible people can see their Medicaid lapse because their paperwork is not processed in time.
Missourians have recent experience with the effects of an overburdened Medicaid system. By law, Medicaid applications are supposed to be processed in 45 days, but as of last May, Missouri missed that deadline 72% of the time – the worst record in the nation – causing the federal government to step in to help for the second time in two years. The wait time on the Medicaid call center was 56 minutes in February 2024.
The House bill will immediately explode the workload for state Medicaid offices. Medicaid beneficiaries will need to prove their eligibility twice a year instead of annually. 
And then it piles on the new paperwork rules. Missouri will have to figure out how to verify that a beneficiary is working, going to school, or meeting the new requirements some other way. They’ll need to send out millions of paper notices, emails, and text messages to notify enrollees about the changes and train staff to handle the deluge of documents that will flood in. Just hours before the bill passed, Congress quietly moved up the deadline for states to make these changes, requiring implementation by the end of 2026 or sooner.
And all this new bureaucracy rests on technology that is already failing. We’ve seen just how broken states’ health care infrastructure is – Luke helped uncover state software errors that improperly terminated coverage for nearly 500,000 eligible kids across 29 states after the pandemic. The added strain imposed by this legislation will crash websites, jam call centers, and trigger even more software errors – trapping working people in the chaos.
Under these conditions, failure isn’t just likely — it’s inevitable. 
We don’t need to guess at how this plays out. When Arkansas tried to implement Medicaid work requirements in 2018 the results were disastrous. People received confusing instructions about how to prove they were working and many never knew about the requirement. The state’s website repeatedly crashed. In the end, more than 18,000 people lost coverage, employment rates did not budge, and the state wasted $26 million on a failed experiment. 
In some states, that will mean lines around the block at overwhelmed county offices. In others, dropped calls, system outages, and piles of unprocessed renewals. These challenges compound. When the website breaks, you call. When your call drops, you drive to the office. Attrition will spike as the overmatched Medicaid staff are increasingly under siege, overtime is mandatory, and time off is cancelled. Smaller and smaller numbers of staff will bear larger and larger workloads until the system collapses.
And, eligible Americans – working adults, kids, seniors, students, and adults with illnesses and disabilities –  will still have no Medicaid. Hospitals will provide more uncompensated coverage, putting some – especially rural hospitals and children’s hospitals – at risk of failure.
This bill sets up state Medicaid agencies to fail at their most basic task – ensuring that eligible people have health insurance. It doesn’t matter to a pregnant mom why her Medicaid is cut, she is going to miss prenatal visits and skip her toddler’s check-up. If Hawley wants to stand up for over one million Missourians who rely on Medicaid, he should oppose this bill.

“We’ve had some good conversations in the last few weeks between the governor and the legislative leaders, and unfortunately, those, you know, conversations have stopped,” Born said.
Lawmakers and Evers announced Wednesday evening that their months-long negotiations had reached an impasse for the time being. 
Republicans said they would move forward writing the budget on their own, saying the state couldn’t afford what Evers wanted, and Evers said Republicans were walking away because they refused to compromise. Evers had said he was willing to support Republican tax cut proposals that even as they were similar to proposals he previously vetoed.
“The spending really that the governor needs is just more than they can afford,” Born said Thursday, “and it’s getting to the point where it’s about 3 to 1 compared to the tax cuts that we were looking at.”
He declined to share specifics about the amounts that were being discussed.
“I don’t think we’re going to relive the conversations of the last few weeks in any details, but certainly, you know, we’ve been focused on tax cuts for retirees and the middle class,” Born said. 
Evers’ spokesperson Britt Cudaback said in an email that Republicans’ “math is not remotely accurate.”
Despite the breakdown in discussions, the GOP lawmakers said they were optimistic about the potential for Evers to sign the budget they write, noting that he has signed budget bills passed by Republicans three times in his tenure as governor.
“I’m very hopeful that we will do a responsible budget that we can afford that addresses the major priorities and a lot of the priorities that I think the governor’s office has,” Marklein said. “I’m very hopeful that the governor will sign the budget.” 
Democrats on the Joint Finance Committee were less optimistic about the prospect for the budget to receive support from across the aisle, saying that it likely wouldn’t adequately address the issues at the top of mind for Wisconsinites, including public K-12 education, public universities and child care.
“We’re going to see a budget that prioritizes more tax breaks for the wealthiest among us at the expense of all of the rest of us and a budget from finance that will get no Democratic votes and that will likely be vetoed by the governor,” Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said. 
Roys said they didn’t know about the specifics of what Evers had agreed to. 
“We can’t really speculate on that, but I can say that we absolutely support the process and the idea of collaborative, shared government,” Roys said. “We are committed to that. We have been ready from Day One to sit down with our Republic colleagues to negotiate.” 
She said for now JFC Democrats will focus on providing alternatives to Republicans’ plans.
“We’re going to do our best to advocate for what Wisconsinites have said they want to need,” Roys said. “We want a lower cost for families. We want to make sure that our kids are the first priority in the budget, and we’re going to be offering the Republicans the opportunity to vote in favor of those things.” 
There is less than a month until the June 30 deadline for the Legislature to pass and Evers to sign the state budget. If the budget isn’t passed on time, then state agencies continue to operate under the current funding levels. 
Committee approves bonding authority for clean water fund
While negotiations have hit a wall, some committee’s actions on Thursday received bipartisan support. 
The committee unanimously approved an additional $732 million in bonding authority for the Environmental Improvement Fund (EIF). The program uses a combination of federal grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s clean water and drinking water state revolving funds and matching state funds to provide subsidized loans to municipalities for drinking water, wastewater and storm water infrastructure projects. 
“This is going to be very good for a lot of our local communities when it comes to clean water,” Marklein said ahead of the meeting. He noted that many communities were on a waiting list for their projects.
The Department of Administration and the Department of Natural Resources told lawmakers in late 2024 that that year was the first time the fund had not had enough resources to meet demand.
Demand for aid from the program increased dramatically starting in 2023, with a 154% increase in the clean water fund loan demand in 2023-24 and a 325% increase in demand for the safe drinking water loan program that year. Insufficient funding for the clean water program led to constraints in 2024-25 and left needs unmet for at least 24 projects costing around $73.9 million.
Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay) said she was thrilled that lawmakers were approving money for infrastructure in the state.
“The state has over $4 billion here,” Andraca said. “A lot of that is one-time money and one-time money should be used for infrastructure — making sure that our communities are in a great position moving forward should the economy turn down.”
The action is meant to cover the next four years of state contributions to the fund.
Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) said in a statement the loans will help Wisconsin communities address aging infrastructure and water contaminants.
“With these additional funds, municipalities will be able to access low-interest loans to modernize their water systems, saving local taxpayers millions of dollars and keeping their water clean for years to come at the same time,” Wimberger said. 
Peter Burress, government affairs manager for environmental nonprofit Wisconsin Conservation Voters, said including the additional revenue bonding authority in the budget is a “smart, substantive way” to make progress towards ensuring Wisconsinites have “equitable access to safe, affordable drinking water.” 
“We urge every legislator to support this same investment and send it to Gov. Evers for his signature,” Burress said. 
Actions on other agencies get mixed or party-line support
Republicans on the committee approved an additional $500,000 for the Medical College of Wisconsin’s North Side Milwaukee Health Centers Family Medicine Residency Program, which focuses on training family physicians with expertise and skills to provide individualized, evidence-based, culturally competent care to patients and families. 
The measure also included  $250,000 annually starting in 2026-27 for the Northwest Wisconsin Residency Rotation for family medicine residents. According to budget papers, starting the funding in the second year of the budget would allow time to find a hospital partner to support residents. 
Democrats voted against the measure after their proposal for higher funding was shot down by Republicans. The Democrats proposal also called for funding a  Comprehensive Assistance, Recovery, and Empowerment Fellowship Program focusing on treating substance use disorders and anAdvancing Innovation in Residency Education project to improve the behavioral health expertise of family medicine residents.
“I hope that my colleagues are reading national news because we’re seeing lots and lots of research funding being cut,” Andraca said. “The Medical College has lost about $5 million in research grants recently, and in addition to other research programs being canceled, I don’t know who has tried to make an appointment with the primary care physician, but there’s really long wait times right now, and this program is literally designed to bring doctors into the state.” 
Democrats proposed transitioning the Educational Communications Board’s Emergency Weather Warning System from relying on fees for funding to being covered by state general purpose revenue. 
Andraca, in explaining the proposal, said state funding for a system like that is more important now than ever.
“We’re talking weather alerts. We’re talking about making sure that people know when there’s something heading their way. We are in a time where we need these alerts more than ever. In fact, yesterday was an unhealthy air day, and… we’re looking at drastic federal cuts,” Andraca said. 
Republicans rejected the measure and instead approved a 5% increase that will be used on general program operations, transmitter operations and emergency weather warning system operations. Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) joined Republicans in favor of the motion. 
The committee also took action on several other agencies with support splitting along party lines
Republicans approved a modification to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation’s budget, lowering it by $3.8 million, due to projections that surcharge collections appropriated to WEDC will be lower than estimated. They also rejected Democrats’ proposal to provide an additional $5 million in the opportunity attraction and promotion fund, which makes grants to  attract events that will draw national exposure and drive economic development.
WEC budget on pause after DOJ letter
The committee was scheduled to take action on the Wisconsin Elections Commission budget, but delayed that after the U.S. Department of Justice sent a letter to the state agency accusing it of violating the Help America Vote Act. The letter threatened to withhold funding and criticized the absence of  an administrative complaint process or hearings to address complaints against the Commission itself. Ann Jacobs, the commission chair, has disputed the accusations and said there is no funding for the federal government to cut. 
Marklein said the state lawmakers want more information before acting on the agency’s budget.
“Out of caution, we think we’re just going to wait and see,” Marklein said. “We need to analyze this and see what implications there may be for the entire Elections Commission and what impact that may have on the budget.”

The mom said something vague about historical fiction, then stepped away and pulled out her phone. I started to list a few options. But the teen cut me off in a furtive whisper.
“Actually,” they said, staring fiercely up at me, “do you have any books about…” they paused. “Trans stuff? With not-obvious covers?”
We did. My heart swelling, incredibly moved that this kid trusted me, a stranger, with a question they seemed not to trust their own parent with, I got them the books.
This is the unspoken honor code between kids and the keepers of books for kids, be they booksellers, librarians, or teachers — the role I hold now. We keepers of stories are assumed to be the accepters of all kinds of stories, the people that help kids find the books they are seeking, no matter the content, and no matter the kid.
But this important work is in jeopardy. Book bans increasingly tie the hands of adults in these roles, preventing them from connecting kids to the books they’re asking for. 
In February, the U.S. Department of Education rescinded all previous guidance that categorized book banning as a civil rights violation. It also eliminated the Book Ban Coordinator position in its Office for Civil Rights, created by the Biden administration, which investigated schools and libraries that removed books in order to determine legality.
Maine is, thankfully, a state where this practice is not widespread. But in recent years, certain districts have become more aggressive with bans. For example, in 2023, the Hermon School Department partially restricted access to more than 80 books in its high-school library, and MSAD 6 in Buxton banned two titles completely, according to PEN America’s annual survey of book bans.
As a current middle school teacher and former children’s bookseller, I’m worried that this trend will worsen. Removing federal safeguards that protect kids’ free access to books could mean that overturning a ban is much harder. And while policy moves slowly, childhood is quick. If a book spends a year or even a few months off a shelf, that can mean it’s not available during the time when a child reader needs it most.
The vast majority of books challenged in Maine are flagged because of sex and gender-based content or LGBTQ+ representation. It’s no secret that the debate over these books is rooted in controversy over the minority groups that they’re written about. But removing them from shelves will do nothing to impact the existence of those minority groups, which have been a fact of life throughout human history and will remain so, regardless of any policies for or against them. Instead, in wrongfully attempting to censor a category of human identity, we stand to lose the cornerstone of humanity itself: our ability to understand, connect to, and care for each other and ourselves.
A predominant children’s literature theory put forth in 1990 by Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop states that books can be “mirrors, windows, or sliding glass doors”; that is, that a story can replicate a child reader’s own lived experience, allow them to view lives different than their own, or facilitate their entrance into another way of life.
A kid with two moms might read a book where the family structure mirrors their own and feel their experiences validated. A kid struggling to understand their identity might read a book with a nonbinary character and gain the language necessary to describe themselves, helping them move forward into the next chapter of their life. But even a kid who is not a part of the LGBTQ+ community can have an affirming experience with one of these books. Encountering diversity through story, reading books that are “windows,” fosters allyship. Empathy is a component of identity, too.
Kids’ job is to figure themselves out — their own identities, values, and interests. Our job as adults is to love and support them no matter what. Allowing kids to select their own books upholds our end of that unspoken code and empowers them to choose which ways of life beyond their own they have access to. It expands their understanding of the available options. In this way, childhood reading is a powerful tool for exploration, dignity, and self-determination. 
As an educator here in Maine, I’m aware that the most important thing I can teach my students is open-minded curiosity, a mindset that will propel them into a lifetime of learning. More than anything, I hope they apply that curiosity and open-mindedness towards people — both others and themselves. Free access to a diverse range of books is one of the best ways to achieve that goal.

Legislation dismissing pending cases for unlawful carry was again vetoed by Gov. Henry McMaster on May 22, 2025. (Stock photo illustration by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolinians will continue to face sentencing for a gun charge that’s no longer a crime after Gov. Henry McMaster again vetoed a bill erasing the pending cases.
A law signed by McMaster 15 months ago made it legal for adults to carry handguns without a permit and allowed past convictions for unlawful carry to be expunged. It set a five-year deadline — until March 2029 — for expungement applications. One conviction per person can be expunged.
But the law didn’t address pending cases.
Last year, McMaster vetoed legislation to dismiss those charges. The Legislature tried again this year with another version of the bill, which both chambers passed unanimously. But the governor vetoed that too.
In his May 22 veto letter, the governor made clear his “fundamental objections to the legislation remain unchanged.”
As the state’s former U.S. attorney and two-term attorney general, McMaster said he’s wary of limiting prosecutors’ authority and discretion to resolve those cases.
“Every case is unique and the prosecutors in our state should be permitted to evaluate each case based on law and the facts and then proceed as they deem appropriate,” McMaster wrote. The bill “would universally strip prosecutors of the ability” to determine whether a case warrants dismissal or prosecution.
Besides that, he wrote, it was a crime when they were charged.
“Their alleged actions were, in fact, unlawful,” he wrote. “To be sure, those actions might not be illegal today, but that distinction misses the critical point that such actions were illegal at the time they were committed.”
The question is whether the House will vote this time to override the governor’s veto.
Last year, the Senate voted unanimously to override the governor’s veto, but it takes a supermajority vote in both chambers for a bill to become law despite a veto. And the House never took it up. So, the bill died.
Last week, the Senate again voted unanimously to overrule the latest veto. The House never brought it up during the Legislature’s one-day special session to adopt the budget. But this time, an override is still possible next year.
House Judiciary Chairman Weston Newton said the chamber will likely take a vote when they return in January. The chamber’s unanimous approval of the bill May 8 suggests an override won’t be a problem, he said.
“It’s dismissing charges that are no longer illegal for the purposes of consistency,” said the Bluffton Republican.
Following passage in March 2024 of the law allowing any adult who can legally buy a handgun to carry it with or without a concealed carry permit, some solicitors dismissed older charges of unlawful possession on their own. But it wasn’t automatic. Some solicitors didn’t.
As of February, 206 people in 11 of South Carolina’s 16 judicial districts had charges pending for that crime alone, according to Lisa Catalanotto, the executive director for the state Commission on Prosecution Coordination.
She didn’t have numbers from the other five judicial districts.
More cases have been dropped since she last collected the numbers in February, said Catalanotto, who didn’t yet have an update.
But a decline isn’t good enough. No one should face conviction for something that’s no longer a crime, said Sen. Deon Tedder, who was again the chief sponsor. This time, three Republicans joined him in co-sponsoring the legislation.

“We had to act as a Legislature. It’s simply not fair,” said Tedder, D-Charleston.
He voted against the bill that legalized carrying a handgun without a permit, which supporters dubbed “constitutional carry.”
But anyone charged with a crime the Legislature has determined is unconstitutional certainly shouldn’t be convicted now, Tedder said.
“This fixes something that we missed,” he said.
During legislative hearings, opponents of the bill argued some people charged with the crime were known violent offenders, and unlawful carry was just the crime they could be arrested for at the time to build a case.
Catalanotto, with the prosecution commission, gave the example of a person who went to a former workplace with a gun, intending to shoot someone, but was chased away at the door. An officer arrested the person for unlawfully carrying a weapon with the intent to add additional charges later, she said.
But Tedder pointed to a sentence in the law specifying that an “immediate dismissal” isn’t mandated if the charge was made “in conjunction with any other criminal offense arising out of the same facts and circumstances.
The bill also specifies that a dismissed charge can’t be the basis of an unlawful arrest lawsuit — another concern of law enforcement that McMaster said in his veto letter he appreciated legislators addressing.

(Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Tensions ran high Thursday morning at the Indiana Supreme Court as justices heard arguments in a case that could change who has the duty of care — private property owners or county officials — for visual obstructions at rural intersections. 
Yerano Martinez collided with another vehicle at a rural four-way intersection in Miami county, claiming an overgrown bush on Jeffrey Smith’s property obstructed his view of a stop sign. He sued Smith and accused him of negligence for failing to maintain the bush. 
Rural intersections sightline proposal to rack up edits

Smith countered and claimed that landowners have no duty to protect motorists from conditions that remain entirely on private property and do not intrude upon the roadway. 
The court proceedings cited previous precedent that said the landowners have no duty to the motoring public to avoid creating or maintaining visual obstructions. 
That ruling established a “bright-line rule,” finding that “landowners owe a duty to passing motorists on adjacent highways not to create ‘hazardous conditions that visit themselves upon the roadway’; but when a land use or condition that may impose a visual obstruction is ‘wholly contained on a landowner’s property, there is no duty to the traveling public.'”
The trial court and the Indiana Court of Appeals both agreed with Smith, granting him summary judgment. Martinez then petitioned the state’s highest court. 
Arguments on Thursday
On Thursday, Martinez’s attorney, Scott Faultless, asked the Supreme Court to overturn the lower court’s ruling and allow a jury to decide whether Smith bears responsibility. Faultless argued that the bush interfered with a public right of way by blocking traffic signage and fell outside previous protections.
“This case is the next step in the race,” Faultless said, referring to the litigation. 
Faultless argued that while the earlier case was correctly decided, it should not shield property owners who allow visual obstructions near public roads. He pointed to Indiana common law and statutes, arguing they impose a duty on landowners to prevent visual obstructions. He added that the bush in question appeared within the public right of way, based on evidence it had been planted and maintained by Smith, and mowed around. 
Justices pressed both sides for clarity. They explored whether a stop sign, as a vital traffic control device, constitutes part of the roadway — and whether obscuring it is protected.

Smith’s attorney, Sheila Sullivan, maintained that local governments are responsible for managing traffic visibility. She argued that counties employ people to handle these kinds of problems. But justices questioned whether rural counties like Miami have the capacity to consistently address such issues. 
During the 2025 session, lawmakers proposed legislation — sparked by a tragedy — taking an aim at dangerous overgrown rural intersections. The bill would apply to any agricultural land located alongside local road intersections without traffic signals. It would also require a landowner or renter to maintain a “line of sight triangle.” 
Under the bill, local governments could send landowners or renters a notice if they were not in compliance. People involved in vehicle crashes resulting from blocked sights would be able to sue for damages. But Senate Bill 183 died. Weaker language passed in another bill. 
The court will make its final decision on whose responsibility it is to take care of the obstruction in the coming days.

The traveling public art exhibit of the life-sized trunked giants is California-bound, with a Wyoming stop along the way.  
The post Migrating elephants amble into Jackson Hole appeared first on WyoFile .","JACKSON HOLE—The stampede of visitors isn’t coming for the grizzly bears, baby bison or Teton Mountain views. 
They’re coming to walk among the elephants. Thirty-two life-size replicas that look surprisingly at home on the range, lumber through the sagebrush, trailing behind a smaller herd of impressive bronze bison.
The Great Elephant Migration has made a stop at the National Museum of Wildlife Art, just north of Jackson Hole, creating a buzz along its journey across the United States. Madison Webb Stanko, the museum’s chief marketing officer, has met visitors who have driven from New Mexico, Colorado and Utah to stroll among the herd at one of its only stops in the Rockies. As a result, the museum has seen a spike in attendance both in person and online, she said. 
“I think it’s the experience,” she said. “It’s the scale of it. You feel small standing in front of it. It does inspire wonder.”

Visitors are advised not to touch the nearby bronze bison statues — or get too close to any of the living and breathing wildlife often visible just up the road in Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. But they can hug, kiss and pet these elephants all they want. 
The public art installation started as 100 elephants on display in July 2024 in Newport, Rhode Island, and has since migrated through New York City’s Meatpacking District, Miami Beach, and Houston.  
Now, the herd has split, with 32 taking up refuge at the museum, four on display in Teton Village and the rest on view through June 16 at the Buffalo Spirit Hills Ranch on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in northern Montana. On May 30, Blackfeet painter and ledger artist Terrance Guardipee led a blessing of the elephants in Jackson Hole at the museum’s sculpture garden, attracting a crowd of more than 300.
“Of all the animals, elephants seem to be one that people feel connected to,” Webb Stanko said, “and it’s an animal you’re not often able to connect to in Wyoming.”
The Asian elephants also bring a story of how to coexist with large mammals. 
“Each sculpture is a replica of a real wild elephant, known by name and personality to the Indigenous communities of the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu,” the exhibit explains. “Here elephants live alongside people in the densest concentrations on the planet.” 
The sculptures are made from an invasive weed called “Lantana camara” that’s overtaking India’s forests and displacing wildlife. They each take four to six months to create, and are for sale for $8,000 to $22,000 to raise money for conservation work that supports coexistence.

Although people have been showing up at all hours to photograph and wander among the elephants, the museum has “elephant guardians” staffing the exhibit during museum hours to answer questions. 
The pachyderms will be packed up after the exhibit ends June 20, but enthusiasts will have one last chance to say goodbye. The museum is inviting the community to a farewell party from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., June 22, when people can decorate the trucks before the herd “migrates” to its final U.S. destination.
After overlooking the wild open spaces of the National Elk Refuge, Webb Stanko said, “they’re going to Beverly Hills from here.”

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/briefs/maryland-launches-new-loan-program-for-laid-off-federal-workers/,"Marylanders affected by federal layoffs this year can now apply for an interest-free state loan to help them pay the bills in the short term, according a press release Thursday from the state Department of Labor.","Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) addressed a crowd of hundreds outside NOAA's Silver Spring headquarters in March, just days after the Trump administration cut hundreds of jobs from the agency. (Photo by Jack Bowman/Maryland Matters)Marylanders affected by federal layoffs this year can now apply for an interest-free state loan to help them pay the bills in the short term, according a press release Thursday from the state Department of Labor.
The Federal Emergency Loan Program is directed at the thousands of Maryland residents who have lost jobs in the federal government so far since the Trump administration began slashing the federal workforce to cut down federal spending.
The loan program was created this year under the new Protect Our Federal Workers Act, sponsored this year by Majority Whip Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) and signed into law in April. The law expands the use of two current employee-assistance funds so they apply to federal workers laid off as the Trump administration rushes to slash the size of government. It also expands the authority of the attorney general’s office to take legal action on behalf of laid-off federal workers in some instances, and it creates an expedited state hiring program for workers who lost jobs due to administration cuts.
“Let’s be clear — these federal workers didn’t lose their jobs because they failed us,” Lewis said in a written statement. “They lost them because of reckless decisions in Washington that turned public servants into political targets. These are our neighbors, our veterans, our civil servants — people who dedicated their lives to this country.”
Federal layoffs drag down state employment gains for second month, new numbers show

The program offers a $700 interest-free loan for residents who qualify. Those residents must have been terminated from a federal job since Trump took office, in a mass layoff, relocation, or closure of a unit of the federal government, or in a similar situation beyond their control.
Former federal workers must also demonstrate that they are experiencing “financial hardships” caused by the loss of their job in the loan application. Recipients have 180 days to pay the loan back, though they can ask for a 90-day extension if hardships continue. Federal contractors are not eligible for the loan.
“This loan program is an important piece of Maryland’s larger effort to respond to federal job loss, providing emergency financial assistance while we are also working to connect thousands of Marylanders to new job opportunities and help with career transition,” Maryland Labor Secretary Portia Wu said in a written statement Thursday.
Maryland’s workforce is uniquely susceptible to the effects of the federal layoffs, and its economy is heavily reliant on federal employment, due to the state’s proximity to Washington, D.C., though the exact scope of the impact to the state is challenging to calculate, according to labor department officials. So far, about 1,600 federal unemployment claims have been filed since the Trump administration started in January, the department said.
In addition to the new loan program, the Moore administration is also working to connect laid-off federal workers with state jobs, among other measures, in an effort to mitigate those impacts.

Utah is among several Western states seeking to reduce federal land ownership. (Photo by Utah News Dispatch)Public outcry was swift and forceful after a U.S. House committee last month hastily approved an amendment directing the federal government to sell off more than half a million acres of public land.
A few days later, lawmakers advanced the larger bill — a sweeping list of President Donald Trump’s priorities — but stripped the federal lands provision.
Yet leaders on both sides of the issue say the battle over selling off federal lands is likely just heating up.
Some conservatives in Western states have complained for decades that the feds control too much of the land within their borders. They see a long-awaited opportunity in a Trump administration that’s sympathetic to their cause. Public lands advocates are bracing for more attempts to turn land over to states, industry groups and developers.
“The threat level is red alert,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit. “Some of these states have been champing at the bit for decades to privatize. They’re certainly not going to let this opportunity pass without an aggressive effort.”
The ‘balance sheet’
In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, some leaders view these lands as a treasured inheritance — places reserved for all Americans and critical for wildlife, tourism and outdoor recreation. Others feel that too much of the land in their states is controlled by officials in Washington, D.C., leaving it off-limits for development and curtailing its economic value.

Doug Burgum, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Interior Department secretary, waits for the beginning of a confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee at Dirksen Senate Office Building on Jan. 16, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)
Trump officials and allies have embraced the latter view. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has repeatedly called federal lands America’s “balance sheet,” describing them as untapped assets worth trillions of dollars. He has launched an effort to identify federal lands suitable for housing development.
Other proposals have centered around using land sales to pay for tax breaks or to finance Trump’s proposed government-run fund that could invest in stocks or real estate.
For some state leaders, the newfound interest at the federal level to turn public lands into cash — along with Trump’s cuts to land management agency staff — aligns with a long-standing movement to reduce federal ownership.
“I look at it as an opportunity to say, ‘Hey, turn it over to the state,’” said Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican.
Utah leaders have made the most forceful push to challenge federal land ownership. The state filed a legal challenge last year seeking to take control of more than 18 million acres of “unappropriated” lands — parcels held by the federal government without a specific designation such as a national park or monument. That effort hit a roadblock earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
But with Trump in the White House, state leaders may pivot from challenging the feds in court to seeking their cooperation.
“We would love if the federal government just turned it over to us and said, ‘Here, manage these lands,’” Schultz said. “That’s an option as well. Those are discussions that are happening. Everything is on the table.”
Schultz declined to say which federal officials have been involved in discussions about transferring lands to the state.
Some lawmakers in Wyoming backed a state resolution this year — which ultimately failed — calling on Congress to hand over all federal lands except for Yellowstone National Park. Idaho lawmakers passed a measure calling on the feds to turn over a wildlife refuge to the state. And Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called for a “systematic release” of federal land in the state.
But public lands also have many supporters in Western states, including some prominent Republican members of Congress, such as Reps. Mike Simpson of Idaho and Ryan Zinke of Montana. Zinke was Interior secretary for two years during the first Trump administration.
John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, said proposals to dispose of federal lands tend to be stymied by fierce public backlash.
“Federal lands are really popular,” he said. “It’s political poison [to sell off public land]. It’s a different West now. Public attitudes have changed.”
Leshy also noted that livestock ranchers especially benefit from discounted lease rates offered by the federal government.
Housing arguments
The most recent clash over the future of federal lands was the amendment sponsored by a pair of congressional Republicans last month. The measure would have directed the Bureau of Land Management to sell more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada and Utah. Local governments would have been able to buy the land at market value, with no restrictions on how they used it.
Backers said the sale would bring in revenue to cover Trump’s proposed tax cuts, while allowing local governments to build much-needed housing on the parcels. Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee said he will try to revive the measure as the Senate considers the bill this month, E&E News reported.
In Nevada, where 85% of land is owned by the federal government, some leaders say their communities are hemmed in by a checkerboard of public lands that constrain development. The city of Fernley, which is growing rapidly, would have acquired 12,000 acres under the proposal.
“We need housing,” said Benjamin Marchant, Fernley’s city manager. “The city can’t plan roads and water lines, sewer lines and gas lines, when you have federal land between two parcels that want to develop. This will bring a practical and helpful consolidation of all these lands into one developable area.”
Nevada leaders have long worked on proposals to transfer some federal lands to local governments and allow for increased growth. But some lawmakers say the latest push bypassed that collaborative process — and failed to include safeguards that the money raised from the sale of the lands would be reinvested into conserving public lands elsewhere.
“It was a complete betrayal of everything we’ve worked on in this state,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “This amendment is trying to sell off half a million acres of Nevada’s public lands in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. This is not going to address our housing problem. These lands are positioned to be sold off for other forms of development and extraction.”
Similar debates are happening in Utah. In southwestern Utah’s Washington County, local officials say the disposal of federally controlled land could help alleviate the region’s housing crisis and increasingly strained infrastructure.
The county is experiencing rapid population growth — in 2022, St. George, the county seat, was the fastest-growing metro area in America. County and city leaders hoped the amendment would have helped them manage the growth. The measure would have disposed of roughly 11,500 acres of federally controlled land in Utah, selling it at market value to local governments.
The proposal received pushback from all sides, including environmentalists, hunting and fishing groups, House Democrats and even conservatives.
“[The amendment] is consistent with how U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Burgum thinks about federal public lands, as simply assets on a ledger to be sold off,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental nonprofit. ” … It’s just antithetical to how Westerners think about the federal public lands that make up so much of our landscape.”
Washington County Commissioner Adam Snow, a Republican, said a lot of the opposition was misguided. The county would have acquired almost half of the land earmarked for disposal, and Snow said much of that would have been used to widen existing roads and construct new ones that are bordered by Bureau of Land Management property.
“These were not pristine wilderness lands. Some of the environmental groups tried to make it sound like we’re selling off Zion National Park, and that’s not even close to true,” Snow said. “If we can just not have to deal with the federal government every time we want to chip seal a road or improve an intersection, that would be really nice. Because we have to ask ‘Mother, may I?’ for everything out here.”
Local leaders say federal parcels could help ease housing pressures as well. Snow said transferring parcels to the city or county is one of the only ways to stop the area from becoming wildly expensive.
“We’re running out of room real quick,” he said. “ … There is still private land to develop, but they’re going to charge an absolute premium.”
The amendment that was stripped from the House bill was widely criticized for not having any restrictions on what could be done with the land.
“There was no language whatsoever that would require Washington County or St. George to do anything with these lands. They could lease them for development. They could sell them outright,” said Bloch.
The costs of management
In Utah, lawmakers have created a state Department of Land Management — essentially a placeholder agency that would be funded and staffed only if their effort to assume control of large swaths of federal land succeeds. Schultz, the House speaker, said the state is committed to keeping the lands in the public domain, reopening roads and campgrounds closed by the feds.
“We’d just take over the job from the federal government,” he said. “It is something that the state absolutely would do, and we’d do it more efficiently, more effectively and we’d have better outcomes.”
Schultz said the state could bring in the revenues needed to manage the land by raising lease prices for oil and gas operations on parcels currently managed for drilling.
But some public lands advocates say that’s not realistic. The federal Bureau of Land Management employed more than 950 people in the state as of 2024, and feds also assume the expensive task of wildfire management on their lands.
“If you look at the history of what Utah has done with their lands, they’ve sold more than half of them,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “We’re certainly of the perspective that states could not handle the economic costs of managing these lands. Their hand would be forced; they would have to sell these lands in order to deal with those costs.”
John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director, said Simpson — the Idaho congressman — and the state’s two senators have all won praise from constituents for their work on public lands compromises.
“Savvy Idaho politicians know that public lands are popular,” he said.
But other state leaders insist their governments are better equipped to manage the lands. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, was among the officials who signed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit against the feds.
“We live here, we work here, and we are far better stewards of our forests and resources than federal bureaucrats in Washington,” Labrador said in a statement. “ … If Idaho owned this land, we could lease it for timber, grazing, and mining — just like the federal government does — but reinvest that revenue right here in Idaho.”

The Army Corps completed a study of Garrison Dam in June 2023. The dam holds back the Missouri River, creating Lake Sakakawea, the largest reservoir of any Army Corps project in the nation.
Flooding in 2011 caused Garrison Dam’s spillway to be used for the first time since it was completed in 1953.
After dam operators closed the spillway gates and operations returned to normal, the dam’s maintenance team assessed the impacts of the historic flooding and the spillway’s ability to handle even larger floods. 
The overall project includes the replacement of the spillway’s drainage system to remove manhole covers from inside the spillway. Some covers were dislodged in 2011. 
Other work at the dam this year includes replacing lighting along Crest Road and concrete repair on the Spillway Bridge that may slow travel, the Army Corps said in a news release.

Tim Walz speaks with Minnesota Reformer Editor in Chief Patrick Coolican on Thursday, June 5, 2025 at the Royal Sonesta in downtown Minneapolis. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday said that communication between states and the federal government under the second Trump administration “is nonexistent,” opening the door to catastrophe in the case of a natural disaster or other emergency.
Walz, during an interview with Minnesota Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference in Minneapolis, said the Trump administration is unprepared for the next disaster — like another global pandemic — and that leaves states particularly vulnerable.
“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.
The governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.

Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty.
Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.

Walz said Midwestern governors stuck together, specifically mentioning former Gov. Eric Holcomb.
“(Holcomb) was very well liked even amongst the Democratic governors,” Walz said Thursday. “

He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray.
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)Tennessee’s private-prison operator lost nearly $45 million in state payments over three years for failing to meet contractual requirements, but it’s landing a nice windfall as part of the state’s business tax cut deal.
Newly-released records show Brentwood-based CoreCivic Inc. and its affiliate CoreCivic TRS LLC & Subs each received refunds of more than $10,000 for three years of tax rebates after lawmakers approved an estimated $1.9 billion franchise and excise tax reduction in 2024. 
Because of the wide range for payouts, the public will never be able to find out exactly how much the state returned to CoreCivic or 16,000 other companies, many of them based out of state, that received more than 10 grand each. Lawmakers approved categories of less than $750 for the list, between $750 and $10,000 and more than $10,000.
CoreCivic is one of the state’s biggest donors to lawmakers’ biggest donors, as well, even though we know that legislators don’t base their decisions on campaign contributions. At least that’s what they tell us.
Tennessee levied $44.78 million in penalties against private prison operator in three years

Release of the lists in the past week has spurred a bit of debate about whether it is transparent enough, especially since it doesn’t specify exact amounts refunded and will be up on the state’s website for only 30 days. 
Aside from that argument and discussion about whether this tax break was a giveaway to make the rich richer, it shows that numerous business entities got what some might call the old double dip.
Take, for instance, SmileDirectClub. The company landed a $300,000 grant from the state in 2017, then hit it big with $10 million from Tennessee in 2019 and the blessing of Gov. Bill Lee for a Nashville expansion. But the tooth-straightening company hit the skids and filed for bankruptcy in 2023, then closed up shop. Yet even though it’s no longer operating, SmileDirect is drawing a refund in excess of $10,000 from the state.
The list is long for companies receiving state grants over the last decade and now tax refunds.
FedEx netted a $10 million grant for a $44 million investment in Shelby County in 2019, and Hankook Tire landed $6 million in 2022 for a $611 million project in Clarksville. And don’t forget about Ford Motor Co., which received nearly a billion dollars worth of incentives for BlueOval City in West Tennessee and will draw a refund in excess of $10,000 under the new scheme (I mean law). Production at the electric truck plant is running more than a year behind schedule mainly because of concerns about the EV industry.
World’s top businesses, Lee Company receive biggest Tennessee tax rebates

The debate centers on whether this stuff is creating a business-friendlier state, putting Tennessee in the midst of economic recruiting wars or simply donating to corporate welfare.
The conservative Beacon Center puts out an annual Pork Report declaring the state’s biggest winners of government largesse. In December, it asked people to weigh in last year on three finalists: Memphis Area Transit Authority spending tens of millions on Grizzlies suites and a downtown office; Lebanon City Council approval of a $1.5 million for an unnamed restaurant; and the $2.3 billion from state and local taxpayers for a new Titans stadium at the same time $80,000 is going toward the old stadium.
Axing of the franchise tax on business property didn’t make the cut. But if that’s not a giveaway, what is? After all, these companies knew the rules when they started, and a letter to the state by businesses challenging the constitutionality of the franchise tax on property could be considered a form of extortion.
One lawmaker said this week if you consider the money as belonging to the businesses and then being turned over to the government in the form of taxes, then it’s not a giveaway. That begs the question, though, what about the sales taxes millions of people pay every time they buy a package of bacon? Where’s the love for the little people?
To which some might say, “What’s love got to do with it?”
Will the “Schwinn-anigans” ever end?
Former Tennessee Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn failed to list a new company called New Horizon BluePrint Group on her federal disclosure form, then dissolved it shortly before the U.S. Senate took up the confirmation hearing for her appointment as deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Education.
Records show she started the business, a Florida LLC, with Donald Fennoy, former director of the Palm Beach County School District in Florida, in February, after President Donald Trump nominated her for the post. Schwinn’s sister took over the company in late March, before it was dissolved, raising questions about the timing.
Typically, folks don’t start businesses after they’ve been nominated for federal jobs, and they don’t forget to put them on their conflict of interest disclosure form either.
The74, an online education publication, reported the failure to disclose the business – which never really came to fruition – might cause Schwinn problems in her Thursday hearing.
Former Tennessee education leader promises feds she will cut conflicts

But that would be the least of her problems, if the Senate looks at her history and not just her work resume.
She spent most of her time Thursday bragging about gains Tennessee students made during her tenure. But Schwinn had some hiccups too during her time here working for Gov. Bill Lee.
The Tennessee Department of Education signed an $8 million contract in 2021 with TNTP, a teacher training company that employed her husband. She had to sign an ethics agreement promising not to discuss TNTP stuff with him.
Lawmakers also passed legislation removing the education commissioner from the textbook approval process because they felt Schwinn was directing business to favored companies. In addition, the Education Department saw an exodus of experienced people during her tenure.
This list could continue.
Not that anyone in Washington, D.C. cares much about conflicts of interest or questionable business dealings. Those are status quo. But at some point, the public will rebel against this type of corruption and put someone else in charge of lining pockets.
What’s next for Sexton?
Chip Saltsman sparked speculation about the political future of House Speaker Cameron Sexton this week when he posted a photo of a Crossville video shoot and said people should “stay tuned” for a “big announcement coming.”
Does this mean Sexton is leaving Nashville and moving back home to Cumberland County? It’s possible.

Great day of filming with @csexton25 in Crossville this weekend
BIG announcement coming
Stay tuned pic.twitter.com/mPRO14jD1n
— Chip Saltsman (@chipsaltsman) June 2, 2025
More than likely, Sexton will be announcing his intentions to run for Congress to replace U.S. Rep. John Rose, who is running for governor.
The Lookout asked Sexton more than a year ago if he was considering a run for the District 6 seat. His response was that Rose held the post. At that press conference, other House Republican leaders laughed and wondered why they weren’t being asked the same question. Probably because nobody cares?
Recently, though, state Rep. Johnny Garrett of Goodlettsville said he was considering seeking the District 6 seat. We haven’t heard much about it since then. Come to think of it, we haven’t seen much out of Rose, either, since the bitterly cold day he announced he was running for governor.
Whatever the case, we’ll be staying up nights to monitor X (formerly Twitter) to see Sexton’s forthcoming pronouncement. It could cause a bigger ripple effect than the time the Mississippi ran backwards.

SoMa Pride is co-hosted by Central Arkansas Pride, which also hosts LGBTQ+ events in October, and the SoMa 501 nonprofit, of which Michael is executive director. The nonprofit launched a crowdfunding campaign in March with a goal of $20,000 to “bridge the gap” after losing “a few major funding sources,” Michael said in May.
As of Thursday, the goal had been reduced to $10,000, and the campaign had raised $6,800, an increase of $4,480 in just under a month.
A May 29 article in The Guardian highlighted nationwide struggles to host Pride events, including SoMa Pride, in the current political climate. Michael said the publicity led to an influx in donations to the event’s crowdfunding campaign.
“It has been extremely uplifting to see the support, not only locally, but from across the country,” she said.
SoMa Pride will include a parade and performance art, such as live music and drag, on Saturday, as well as a Pride “pre-party” Friday evening at the Boswell Mourot art gallery. Saturday’s festivities will have one stage as opposed to two last year, Michael said.
“We did scale it back some, but we’re really going to have a great event,” she said. “We didn’t have to scale back nearly as much as I thought we were going to have to.”

Arkansas LGBTQ+ organizers crowdfund to make up for fewer Pride sponsors in time for June


SoMa is short for “South Main” and encompasses Little Rock’s business district on Main Street just south of Interstate 630.
SoMa Pride was not alone in its crowdfunding efforts. NWA Equality, which runs Northwest Arkansas Pride in Fayetteville, the state’s largest annual Pride festival, raised over $30,000 in early April to make up for lost event sponsors.
Michael and NWA Pride director Richard Gathright both said the current precarity of federal funds, such as grants for diversity initiatives, played a role in shortages of financial support for Pride.
Pride festivities in major cities nationwide this year have lost major corporate sponsors, such as Anheuser Busch in St. Louis. Minnesota’s Twin Cities Pride removed Target as a sponsor after the company dropped its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. The changes have come as state and federal officials have targeted LGBTQ+ rights and DEI initiatives.

Last in a two-part series on Pennsylvania’s 28th Division and a new memorial to soldiers who were killed in the fight to liberate Gathemo, France. Read the first part here.



Tradition holds that for visiting family members, staff will place moistened sand on the engraving on the marker for Jerome Nadolny, who was killed in the fierce fighting around Gathemo, a small village in Normandy, using a wet sponge. The process brings the name out on the marble Latin cross, so it can easily be seen from 15 to 20 feet away.

An American and French flag – standing about knee high – will be placed in front of the grave. Traditionally, the U.S. marker is symbolically on the right side – as if it were in the soldier’s right hand and facing home. The French will be on the left – always toward inland territory.
Then, he and his cousin, Kurt, will travel to Gathemo, where nine soldiers of the 28th Division, including three from Pennsylvania, lost their lives as the Allies pushed inland from the beaches of Normany to liberate Europe.
They’ll be the sole American relatives of the fallen soldiers who will be on hand for a ceremony Saturday honoring their sacrifice during the fight for the town 81 summers ago. The gathering will include the dedication of a plaque and memorial and a renaming of a street in honor of the 28th Division, a Pennsylvania National Guard unit before the war. The trip is the culmination of an improbable sequence of events that began when Nadolny went in search of the war history of a long-lost great-uncle. Nadolny admits to feeling a little pressure, because he doesn’t want to let his family down or any of the other families.
“I know it’s going to be a heavy experience for me personally. I wish I could share this with my dad,” he said. “It was on my bucket list to just go to that cemetery, but now to actually go to the cemetery? It’s obviously a trip of a lifetime, right?“
 Gathemo today

Visitors to Normandy will notice Allied flags – American, British, and Canadian – hanging not just on poles, but in windows and on doors in village after village. This isn’t just a phenomenon that happens in the typical tourist areas around the landing beaches or landmarks made famous in the 1962 movie, The Longest Day, or the HBO miniseries, Band of Brothers.
The Battle of Normandy stretched beyond what happened on June 6, 1944. Allied troops applied relentless pressure in an effort to push the German occupiers back.
The clash lasted for more than two months, as it became a war of attrition. Allied troops had to constantly resupply the front lines, while the enemy dealt with losses – in terms of men and machines – it simply couldn’t replace
In the end, the Allies suffered 210,000 casualties,while the Germans dealt with losses of 400,000 men.
Town and after town touched by the Battle of Normandy has its own monuments or historical markers to pilots whose downed aircraft crashed nearby, soldiers who died in their streets or units that helped liberate them.
In Periers for example, The Four Braves memorial honors the 90th Infantry Division — which liberated the town as part of Operation Cobra. This was a piece of the successful U.S. breakout — which played a big role in the rapid collapse of the Germans’ defense in Normandy.
Two Pennsylvanians who lost  their lives — Private 2nd Class Andrew J. Speese III of Philadelphia and Sgt. Tullio Micaloni of Oneida — are immortalized as part of the memorial.

One tour group recounted how in the town of La Haye du Puits, a man noticed they were Americans. He hurried home and later found the group at a restaurant eating lunch. He excitedly, in French, described what it was like as a boy in the summer of 1944 to see his home liberated.
As his story was translated, he pulled a piece of silk parachute from his jacket — given to him by a U.S. soldier. He simply wanted to share his gratitude for the sacrifice made by the Allies.
Even in 2025, people in Normandy’s villages and towns still think there is history to be acknowledged and a debt owed.
Gathemo, with a population of 267, will join the others Saturday, with a permanent “thank you.”
Over several days in early August, 1944, the 28th attacked German troops occupying the town.
Progress was slow, measured in a few hundred yards at times, but by the afternoon Aug. 10, the 28th had liberated Gathemo. The division’s losses were nine men killed, including three from Pennsylvania, and an estimated 235 wounded.










For those few who bring up the Battle of Gathemo in some remote barroom in years to come – there will always be a lifting of glasses to our buddies whom we left behind in the orchards and wheat fields of that hallowed ground!


– From the Bloody Patch: A True Story of the Daring 28th Division


The 77-day Battle of Normandy came to an end on Aug. 19, after tens of thousands of German troopers were captured when the Falaise pocket was closed by Allied troops.
A mere 10 days after that, the men of the 28th Division were in Paris, taking part in the liberation day parade through the city.
Located nearly 90 minutes from the English Channel and Omaha Beach, Mayor Christelle Errard describes Gathemo as having all the hallmarks of a quaint Norman community – a bakery, a bar, gift shops and five farms.
The church, destroyed in the fight, was rebuilt after the war and features a pointed bell tower. According to the mayor, the granite used for the altar and the cross came from Gathemo’s quarries.

 ‘There are no words strong enough’

The town’s role in the Allied push to encircle and destroy part of the German Army in the final weeks and days of the clash has largely been forgotten – overshadowed by the fight in Mortain and Saint-Lambert-sur-Dives, among others. Errard became mayor of Gathemo in July of 2020 and has lived in the community for a decade. She was born in another historically significant part of France – Verdun. It’s the site of one the longest and most ferocious battles of the First World War.
“We have a mission in our world: to listen to our history, to transcribe it, so as not to forget Our duty to remember is here. And the witnesses of this period will soon all be gone. I also understood that many don’t want to share what they experienced,” she wrote in an email exchange using Google Translate to go from French to English. “My father never spoke about this period when he was 6-years-old, yet four years ago, on his deathbed, he relived the scenes he had witnessed.”

Now, she said, it’s Gathemo’s turn to pay tribute to the young Americans who fought to liberate Europe.
“Many returned home with physical and mental injuries, but many, like Pvt. Nadolny, did not return to their families,” Errard wrote. “My son will be 23 in June, the same age Pvt. Nadolny was when he lost his life in Gathemo, for Gathemo. I cannot remain indifferent. The tribute is small, but I hope it is the beginning of another story for Gathemo and all the people who will stop and pay their respects at this memorial.”
The monument with the names of the nine men killed will be located close to the back of the church in Gathemo. It will be on a granite stone with an M1 helmet featuring the division logo placed on top. A plaque honoring the entire division will be dedicated, and a street will be renamed in honor of the 28th Division, which, according to unit lore was nicknamed the “Bloody Bucket” by the Germans because of the red keystone patches worn on their uniforms.
The Mike Pride Museum in Normandy covered the 1,800 Euro price tag.
“Dear American friends, there are no words strong enough to express our gratitude and respect,” Errard said. “I would like to say BRAVO and THANK YOU.”
Two men who were just children at the time of the battle will be on hand for the ceremony – 87-year-old Guy Lelandais and 80-year-old Michele Golonde.
Errard says for Lelandais, whose cousin was killed by an exploding shell in front of his eyes, preserving the history of the liberation of his hometown has been a lifelong passion. He has – collecteding testimonies from around the region.

Galonde was just six months old when the 28th Division pushed the Germans out of Gathemo, hiding in a cellar with his family, according to Gerrard. His older sister was in front of the baby carriage he was in when a shell exploded – wounding her in the leg, which left her permanently disabled.  But as fate would have it, she likely saved Galonde’s life because of where she was standing.
Nadolny plans to have dinner with the mayor and hopes to shake Lelandais’ hand and ask him what he remembers about the fight to free the town.
“I mean sincerely, we are so thankful…my family and I are almost just unbelievably thankful,” he said. “(Jerome) was a blue-collar soldier that gave everything and moved us along, So to me, that’s what it’s about. A lot of forgotten stories. So, if we can share a little bit of it or be a part of it, I think it’s incredible.”
The commemoration is a reminder that “freedom has a cost and that true friendship endures,”  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a letter to the event organizers.
“More than 80 years ago, the sons of Pennsylvania crossed an ocean to stand in defense of liberty and peace, forging a bond of courage and shared sacrifice. The soldiers of the 28th Infantry Division fought with extraordinary bravery, with some making the ultimate sacrifice,” Shapiro said. “The people of Gathemo have, across generations, honored the legacy of these brave men not only with gratitude, but with a deep and enduring partnership that continues to unite our communities. Pennsylvania is proud of the heritage of the 28th Infantry Division and of the shared history we hold with our friends in Gathemo.”
The ceremony is set to begin Saturday, June 7, at 5 a.m. EST and will be livestreamed on the Mike Pride Museum YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@grpicardie3945.

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)A year ago, Gov. Jeff Landry signed a bill into law that made Louisiana the first state in the country to reclassify pregnancy care drugs as controlled dangerous substances. Since then, the political assault on the medications has continued to ramp up on the state and national level.
The Louisiana law to reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol caused controversy, particularly when multiple medical professionals publicly criticized the measure saying the added burdens to accessing the medications could delay medical treatment in times of crisis. 
Misoprostol and mifepristone have been targeted because they are used in medication abortion, but both have multiple other uses. Misoprostol is used to prevent and treat postpartum hemorrhage. Since the state law went into effect in October, hospitals have changed how they store and dispense the drugs, locking them up in passcode-protected storage containers outside of labor and delivery rooms.

The New Orleans Health Department has been tracking complaints from health care providers and patients who have struggled with misoprostol access since October. The medical professionals and patients were provided anonymity to encourage feedback.
One doctor wrote they had trouble accessing the drug to provide to a patient going through a hysteroscopy, a medical procedure in which the doctor examines a woman’s uterus using a thin, lighted tube.
“I was unable to get misoprostol in pre-op for [a] patient undergoing hysteroscope,” the provider wrote. “Therefore [I] had to manually dilate [the] cervix multiple times causing unnecessary harm to the patient.”
Another doctor said they couldn’t complete a biopsy, so they prescribed misoprostol to a patient in order to try the procedure again after softening her cervix. The doctor included the patient’s diagnosis of abnormal bleeding on the prescription, and that the patient was not pregnant. The pharmacy refused to fill the prescription until the doctor got on the phone to confirm the medication was not being used to end a pregnancy. 
“This could lead to a delay in diagnosis of cancer,” the doctor wrote.
In another instance, a pharmacist refused to fill a prescription for misoprostol ahead of an IUD insertion, telling the patient “he thought she was going to use it for an abortion,” wrote the doctor. 
There were also multiple accounts of misoprostol being prescribed for miscarriages, but pharmacists delayed filling prescriptions until they spoke to the doctor on the phone. In one instance, the mother who miscarried filed a complaint with the city health department. 
“I was denied misoprostol, essentially leaving me with my dead baby inside of me even longer because the pharmacist said he couldn’t give it to me,” the mother wrote. “It was more horrific than it needed to be.”
Even among state lawmakers who approved the law, confusion reigns. 
At a Louisiana House committee hearing last month, Rep. Lauren Ventrella, R-Greenwell Springs, said that last year “we made it illegal to prescribe” mifepristone and misoprostol. However, both can still be legally prescribed by health care providers with the proper licensing for Schedule IV drugs. When the law reclassifying the medication passed, its supporters repeatedly stated they were not restricting access to the medication for people who needed it for reasons outside of abortion. 
When Ventrella misspoke, she was introducing House Bill 575, which would allow families to sue over suspected abortions. Attorney General Liz Murrill has referred to the law as “another tool in the toolbox” that could be used against out-of-state doctors who prescribe abortion medication to patients in Louisiana. 
Murrill is currently prosecuting at least two cases involving a New York doctor who allegedly prescribed medications to pregnant women in Louisiana. So far, New York’s shield laws, which protects abortion providers, have held up against states that have tried to prosecute doctors. 
Ventrella’s bill awaits Senate floor action with less than a week remaining in the legislative session.
Opponents of the reclassification of mifepristone and misoprostol have worried that, by labeling the drugs as controlled dangerous substances, it would confuse medical providers and the public as well as stigmatize medications that have been proven to be safe and effective. They are challenging the law, Act 246, in state court, and a judge ruled May 15 that the plaintiffs suing the state have a right to pursue their case. 
“Specifically, the judge agreed that the plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated the harm that the law is causing to their practice, and the patients that they serve, to be able to challenge the constitutionality of this law,” said Ellie Schilling, a New Orleans attorney representing the plaintiffs. 
The plaintiffs include the reproductive health advocacy group Lift Louisiana, the Birthmark Doula Collective and multiple women’s health advocates and Louisiana health care providers, including OB-GYNs, midwives and pharmacists.  
As the court fight plays out in Louisiana, another clash is occurring on the national stage. 
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has ordered the Food and Drug Administration to conduct a “complete review” on misoprostol and mifepristone. It comes in the wake of a far-right organization publishing a paper — one that is not peer-reviewed and many critics view as unscientific — claiming the drugs cause adverse medical effects. 
The far-right think tank, the Ethics and Public Policy Center, claimed almost 11% of women experienced a “serious adverse event” from the medications, but peer-reviewed clinical studies have shown an overall 0.5% rate of serious adverse events. Other research in the report also doesn’t hold up to fact-checking, and its authors did not reveal where they sourced the data that was cited.
“It’s deeply troubling that Secretary Kennedy is elevating junk-science to justify reopening mifepristone’s safety review, especially at the behest of anti-abortion political operatives,” said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of the Massachusetts Abortion Access Project, which provides medication abortion care to all 50 states via telemedicine. “I know firsthand that mifepristone’s safety is backed by decades of rigorous data. Rolling back access to mifepristone would be a disaster.”

After a pandemic-era pause, repayments on defaulted student loans restarted last month, and many borrowers are running into barriers. (Seth Wenig | The Associated Press)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.











These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.


– Celina Damian, California student loan servicing ombudsperson



Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
‘Can’t wait for Washington’
Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
Repayment
Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
‘Incentive to hike prices’
Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)MINNEAPOLIS – Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday said that communication between states and the federal government under the second Trump administration “is nonexistent,” opening the door to catastrophe in the case of a natural disaster or other emergency.
Walz, during an interview with Minnesota Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference, said that the Trump administration is unprepared for the next disaster — like another global pandemic — and that leaves states particularly vulnerable.
“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.
The Minnesota governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.
Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty.
Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.
He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray.
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography) David Kelly, a current leader in the House of Delegates and pastor from Tyler County, will take over as commissioner of the state’s troubled jails and correctional system.
He spent 20 years in law enforcement before serving in the Legislature, where the Republican chaired a committee on jails and prisons. Kelly championed raises for correctional officers during a staffing crisis that prompted a state of emergency from 2022 through last year.
“My passion is to get in there and see what we can do to build on what we’ve got to make it better,” said Kelly, 68.
West Virginia’s prison system is one of the deadliest in the country with an ongoing issue of overcrowding. The overpopulated jails can lead to safety and security issues, sometimes leading to people who are incarcerated sleeping in day rooms in the facility.
“The elephant in the room is the overcrowding, and so we’ve got to work on that,” Kelly said.
As of June 3, the regional jails were 425 over capacity of 4,265, according to a spokesperson for the state’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The prisons are 486 under capacity.
“West Virginia has one of the most overcrowded jail systems in the country. This leads to deplorable conditions like increased violence, lack of access to basic medical care and sanitation and degrading practices like requiring people to sleep on floors,” said Rusty Williams, advocacy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia. “We hope Commissioner Kelly will use his new position to bring a more compassionate and humane approach to managing this system.”
This year, state lawmakers passed several bills that lengthened sentences for crimes including drug dealing and fleeing from a police officer. It costs $35,000 per year for state prisoners.
“There are crimes that when they are committed, we need to make sure that the punishment [and] the sentencing fits the crime,” Kelly said. “I look forward to working with the legislature in the future and trying to come up with possible ways to deal with sentencing, to deal with the overcrowding.”
Lesley Nash is an attorney with Mountain State Justice, a nonprofit legal firm that sued WV DCR over the mental health care and medical care provided in 10 state regional jails.
She said the state over-incareates, often jailing individuals with substance abuse problems for minor property crimes. Sometimes individuals end up incarcerated after a family member called 911 seeking helping for substance abuse, Nash said.
“There are huge numbers of people that we have in jails and prisons who are in those facilities as a result of mental health or addiction issues,” Nash said. “What they need is mental health assistance.”
State improved jail staffing, other issues persist
Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Kelly’s appointment as commissioner of WV DCR on June 2. Lance Yardley had been serving as the acting commissioner.
“It’s hard to say no to the governor when he called you and asked you to join his team. I’m thankful that he did.” Kelly said.
The state has made headway in hiring correctional officers under the leadership of former DCR Commissioner Billy Marshall, who was recently appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Kelly praised Marshall’s work, saying he hopes to build on that momentum.
Lawmakers have increased salaries for uniformed officers and DCR offered special hiring rate increases. The state was able to remove National Guard members, who had been filling in as correctional officers, in 2024 after reaching full staffing levels.
But, other problems persist, and West Virginia is facing numerous allegations and lawsuits about jails conditions, including excessive use of force and insufficient medical care. A suit filed in May says “inadequate medical care” at Eastern Regional Jail in Martinsburg led to the death of a 25-year-old woman who had Type 1 diabetes along with a history of substance abuse.
  Southern Regional Jail and Correctional Facility in Beaver, W.Va. (Chris Jackson | West Virginia Watch)
In December, a federal court approved a more than $4 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit for inmates at Southern Regional Jail and Correctional Facility in Raleigh County who alleged deplorable conditions in the jail. The lawsuit was filed in 2023.
“I need to sit down with the team in Charleston and see where we are, and then talk with the governor and his folks and see if they’ve got any plans they want implemented, and then we’ll go from there,” Kelly said.
Webb called on Kelly to ensure the jails provide prompt access to quality health care, consistent and sanitary water and facilitate faster reentry programs.
Several counties are struggling to pay their jail bills, Kelly noted. West Virginia counties pay the state per inmate per day to house inmates at regional jails. In 2022, jail bills cost the state’s 55 counties a total of $45 million, with many local governments listing the charge as their largest annual expense. A 2023 bill meant to address county jail bill costs hasn’t solved the problem.
“I don’t know what the answer is right now for that. That is a problem. There are counties that just simply can’t pay,” Kelly said.
He will continue to pastor a church in Wetzel County while serving as DCR commissioner.
“My faith guides me every day,” he said.
Kelly, who was first elected in 2018, plans to resign from his seat in the House of Delegates late this month before he officially begins his role as commissioner. He is serving as deputy speaker in the House.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kelly.jpg,,,2025-06-06 06:06:12.742520

(Capital-Star photo by Vincent DiFonzo)Last month, pharmacists from across the state travelled to Harrisburg for an urgent meeting with lawmakers. Their goal was to communicate a simple message — pharmacies are closing at an alarming rate, eliminating one of the few places customers can receive free, unscheduled consultations with medical professionals. 
They warned they’re being driven out of business by middlemen in the pharmaceutical supply chain called pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. 
Lawmakers took aim at this problem last year by passing the Pharmacy Benefit Reform Act, which sought to decrease the costs of prescription drugs and regulate PBMs. The legislation was touted by Gov. Josh Shapiro as an example of successful bipartisan reform while he was being considered for the vice presidential nomination.
Nearly a year after the law’s passage, pharmacists say it has failed to prevent closures. Since January 2024, at least 200 pharmacies have closed across the state. Now, they’re asking lawmakers to act again.
“The current PBM system is aptly harming our local pharmacies, jeopardizing patient access to care and threatening the very fabric of our community health infrastructure,” Victoria Elliot, CEO of the Pennsylvania Pharmacist Association, told lawmakers during the meeting last month. 
What are PBMs and how do they impact Pa. pharmacies and patients?
Pharmacy benefit managers are companies hired by insurance providers to administer prescription drug benefits of a health plan. They negotiate drug prices, decide what drugs are covered under insurance plans and reimburse pharmacies for drugs dispensed. 
Theoretically, PBMs secure lower drug prices for patients by streamlining communication between insurance companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. Pharmacy advocates insist the opposite is true — that PBMs are raising drug costs and driving them out of business through anticompetitive practices that force them to dispense prescriptions at a loss. 
Prescription for trouble: Pennsylvania pharmacists say PBMs are driving pharmacy closures

The three largest PBMs — CVS Caremark, OptumRx and ExpressScripts — control about 80% of the market and are owned by companies that also own national pharmacy chains and insurance companies. That means pharmacies that don’t agree to accept the reimbursement rates they set are likely to lose customers whose insurance plans rely on them.
E. Michael Murphy, senior advisor for state government affairs at the American Pharmacists Association and assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at Ohio State University, says low dispensing and reimbursement fees paid to pharmacies by PBMs are a leading cause of closures.
“Oftentimes, when pharmacies dispense a medication for a patient, they’re taking a loss on that medication, either in the reimbursement for acquiring that medication from a wholesaler or in the professional dispensing fee,” Murphy said. “And unfortunately you can only do that for so long before the business model crumbles. That’s one of the big reasons that we’ve seen community pharmacies closing across the country.”
Murphy said community pharmacy closures not only hurt small business owners, but also impact the ability of patients to access medications as they have to travel further to pick up prescriptions.
“When a community pharmacy closes, it can have a pretty dramatic impact on the health outcomes of that community,” he said. “There’s concern that can disproportionately affect patients in more marginalized or socioeconomicly vulnerable communities.” 
Murphy voiced support for ensuring state agencies have the resources to enforce existing laws and regulate “anticompetitive” PBM practices.
Greg Lopes, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, a D.C.-based trade group that represents the country’s largest PBMs, says PBMs help, not harm, Pennsylvania pharmacies. 
“PBMs recognize that pharmacies provide access for patients to get drugs, so it makes no sense to blame PBMs for pharmacy closures in Pennsylvania,” said Lopes. “PBMs aren’t trying to put pharmacies out of business, in fact, PBMs are supporting community pharmacies in Pennsylvania through programs that increase reimbursement and advocating to allow them to expand the additional clinical services they can offer.”

He pointed to “customer preferences for online options and changing demographics,” as factors driving pharmacy closures. 
Pharmacists urge further action
PBM reforms passed with bipartisan support in last year’s Act 77, which expanded the Pennsylvania Insurance Department’s regulatory power and created new transparency requirements for PBMs operating in the state. But pharmacy advocates say the law didn’t go far enough, and pharmacies are still closing at an alarming rate. 
Rob Frankil, executive director of the Philadelphia Association of Retail Druggists told the Capital-Star that out of approximately 225 pharmacies represented by his organization, 12 have closed since January and 25 closed in 2024. He pointed to low reimbursement as the primary cause. 
“Eleven of the 12 pharmacies that my association lost this year are in Philadelphia,” he said. “They all went out of business because they’re not being paid enough for the prescriptions they’re filling.”
He wants legislation that addresses reimbursement rates directly. One proposal is to require PBMs to reimburse pharmacies based on the average national cost of the medication they’re dispensing, plus a fee set by the state that accounts for a pharmacist’s time and materials used. 
Neighboring West Virginia passed a similar law in 2021.
A spokesperson for Shapiro, asked if the governor would support further PBM reforms, responded with a quote from the governor’s February budget address, highlighting last year’s PBM reform law.
“We knew it was a problem that shady middlemen could jack up the cost of prescription drugs while driving our community pharmacies out of business,” the statement said. “So we came together to pass landmark reforms that bring transparency to how pharmacy benefit managers operate, keep more money in Pennsylvanians’ pockets, and protect the small and independent pharmacies we rely on in our communities.”
The primary sponsor of that PBM reform law, Rep. Jessica Benham (D-Allegheny), told the Capital-Star that further PBM reform is necessary, but said, “We are somewhat limited on the state level with what we are able to do.”
Benham added that understanding the full impact of Act 77 will take time. She noted the bill required the state Insurance Department to conduct a study on the impact on consumers and pharmacies of future legislation to set a standard dispensing fee of $10.49.
They will also study the impact of patient steering and spread pricing on prescription drug costs and pharmacy access. 
Patient steering is a practice in which PBMs drive customers to their preferred pharmacies, often owned by the same parent company as the PBM. Spread pricing occurs when a PBM pays one price for a drug and reimburses a pharmacy less, profiting off the difference.  
An Insurance Department spokesperson said the study requires “specialized expertise.” The department will procure a vendor “to assist with the development and implementation of the study,” but have not begun this process yet.
“We will have to wait for the results to then move forward on further legislation,” Benham said.
As it stands, a number of PBMs are contracted by individual Medicaid providers, and are allowed to set their own reimbursement policies. Frankil told lawmakers last month that dispensing fees can be as low as a dollar. A 2020 study commissioned by a community pharmacy advocacy group found the average cost of dispensing a prescription for a pharmacy is $12.40. 
One proposal Benham said she supports would have the Department of Human Services, which oversees state Medicaid, use a single PBM to administer Medicaid benefits, an action pharmacy advocates are demanding that has precedent in other states. 
In 2022, the Ohio Medicaid Department moved to a single PBM to administer Medicaid, with one entity overseeing prescriptions covered by Medicaid. This forced Medicaid managed care organizations to work with a single PBM contracted through the state’s Medicaid Department, rather than procuring their own.
A 2025 study found this move saved Ohio’s Medicaid Department $140 million, saved the state $333 million in administrative costs and allowed $700 million dispensing fees to be paid to pharmacies in the two years since its implementation. 
Murphy, an Ohio resident, praised this move.
“Oftentimes, when I talk to pharmacists in Ohio, they’ll say that Ohio Medicaid is the best and most stable source of revenue for their businesses, which is just indicative of how positive this program has rolled out,” he said.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Rhode Island has a major opportunity to modernize and reform its recycling system with two common-sense bills currently before the legislature.
H6207 sponsored by Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat, and S 996, sponsored by Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, would establish a modern Deposit Return System –  a.k.a. “A bottle bill” – and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for packaging. EPR essentially requires producers of packaging to fund a program for collecting and recycling discarded packaging to help minimize their environmental impact.
Together, these proven policies would reduce litter, cut costs for the consumer, and build a cleaner environment. 
As the legislative debate continues, it’s clear that momentum is growing for recycling reform — not just among environmental advocates and local leaders, but within the private sector as well. Environmental champions like Save the Bay and Clean Water Action strongly support these initiatives. And you might be surprised to learn that  the beverage industry does too. Many beverage companies see a combined bottle bill and EPR system as a smart, forward-looking solution to address flaws with the way we handle recycling. 
Rhode Island’s recycling rate is stuck at just 26%. In Providence, it’s worse — recycling rates hover in the single digits, and nearly 650 pounds of recyclables per household are rejected each year due to contamination. That adds up to over 121,000 tons of collected recyclable material per year that the city pays $1.14 million to dispose of in the Central Landfill in Johnston, which is projected to run out of room in about 20 years. This represents both wasted resources and missed economic opportunity.
We can — and must — do better. Leading beverage companies who are part of the Coalition for High Performance Recycling (CHPR) agree. 
A growing number of beverage companies are publicly endorsing recycling reform in Rhode Island. These companies understand there’s a clear business case for the industry to support and fund improved recycling systems. 
A reliable, domestic supply of recycled materials is essential for both short- and long-term success. Brands can no longer rely on volatile global markets, unstable geopolitics, or imported raw materials to meet their production needs.  
Companies need a steady, local stream of recycled material — so that each can and bottle can be recycled into new cans and bottles. 
Who belongs to CHPR ? Primo Brands — whose trusted brands include Poland Spring and Saratoga. Other participating beverage and bottling companies are Diageo North America,whose brands include Guinness and Johnnie Walker New Belgium Brewing Company; Niagara Bottling; and Red Bull.
As Primo Brands recently testified at the Rhode Island State House in support of a modern bottle bill and EPR, “we need a greater supply of recycled materials, and we need it to be domestic.” 










A growing number of beverage companies are publicly endorsing recycling reform in Rhode Island. These companies understand there’s a clear business case for the industry to support and fund improved recycling systems. 


The current domestic recycling system doesn’t get the job done. One reason is that curbside recyclables are lumped into one single, albeit convenient, system. That inevitably leads to contamination, which reduces the value of the recycled products and the ability to turn them into food grade material. Another problem is that people are not sufficiently educated and incentivized to recycle. 
A modern bottle bill with an extended producer responsibility policy together provides an environmental improvement strategy and improves consumer education and recycling. Plus, they’re smart, complementary business strategies that support stable, domestic supply chains that produce higher-quality recycled materials and help keep costs down for the consumer.  
Rhode Island can become a national model for high-performance recycling.  
By passing H6207 and S996 — a modern bottle bill plus EPR — the state can significantly reduce litter, pollution, and waste, protect its natural beauty and resources, and create a more circular, resilient, and sustainable economy and environment. 
We need to tune out the scare tactics and outdated talking points of industry opponents and support recycling reform for Rhode Island.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)The budget ax wielded by DOGE and the Trump administration fell on Job Corps last week, when the administration announced it was closing 99 of the program’s 123 centers across the country.
 Job Corps, which began as part of the War on Poverty in 1964, provides free education, job training and a place to live for low-income youth ages 16 to 24. The closings shutter three rural Kentucky locations that serve over 500 students: the Carl D. Perkins Job Corps Center in Prestonsburg, the Earle C. Clements Job Corps Academy in Morganfield and the Muhlenberg Job Corps Center in Greenville.
But why is Job Corps being terminated? Doing so harms the same “forgotten men and women of our country” that the administration says are its priority. Job Corps helps young people who are receiving public assistance or are homeless, in foster care, or qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. In 2017, 29% of the youth enrolling had a disability and 65% had left high school before earning a diploma. 
Trump shutdown of Job Corps will leave ‘big void’ in this rural Kentucky place

So is Job Corps being shuttered to “promote work?” Far from it. The Kentucky centers were putting students on paths to becoming welders, computer technicians, certified nursing assistants, pharmacy techs, culinary arts employees, automotive mechanics and more.
And just as importantly, Job Corps reaches those who face the biggest problems entering career-track employment. A recent report notes that Job Corps often draws from youth who have tried multiple times to earn a secondary or postsecondary credential but dropped out under the demands of low-wage jobs and financial, family or mental health challenges.
The program’s approach takes these students’ monumental barriers into account. It is typically a residential program, eliminating the worries of food, housing and transportation. It also offers small living stipends and health care, counseling services, life skills training, and post-program help in transitioning to employment or additional education.
Then maybe Job Corps is something our country just cannot afford? No one can say that with a straight face when Job Corps costs 0.02% of the federal budget while the administration is pushing tax cuts skewed to the wealthy that cost 400 times as much.
Neither can anyone credibly claim that the program does not work. The most rigorous study of Job Corps to date found that it helped improve employment, earnings and education outcomes. Not every hardship-facing young person comes out a roaring success, particularly in an economy that produces far too few living wage jobs. But it is easy to find testimonials of Job Corps graduates in Facebook posts:

“This place picked me up when I was broken. It gave me a reason to wake up in the morning. It gave me back the pieces of myself I thought I’d lost forever. I started to believe I could become someone,” said Jessica Williams, a current Job Corps student in Prestonsburg.
“My 21 year old son is on the autism spectrum. He is currently on Medicaid and is learning Information Technology (IT) at the Morganfield, KY Earle C. Clements Job Corps training center. He is approximately half-way through his education there … Just last week, we had discussed his plan to finish his IT program, enter into the AI/Robotics program and then obtain his advanced education … He has long wanted to work in Cyber Security, but he is now devastated,” said Dale K. Hart.
“Tearing down Job Corps, a place where you learn stability and free trades … is absolutely mind boggling. I was at Muhlenberg Job Corps Center from 2015-2016, I met amazing people from all walks of life, seen people who were on their very last strand of hope make something of themselves years later,” said Keeley Staples.

The young people in Job Corps, who have survived so many bumps in life, now face a new one. Many may lose hope and direction. Some will become homeless. And it is right to fear that cutting support for left-behind young people will further crowd our jails and juvenile detention centers and push up already obscene addiction rates.
It is important to ask why the administration is announcing these and other harmful cuts. But a more pressing question is for all of us: will we let them happen?

Allen Chesser (R-Nash) discusses a child welfare bill (Photo: Lynn Bonner)An expansive bill overhauling the child welfare system that aims to increase stability for children in foster care won approval from a Senate committee on Thursday.
House Bill 612 provides for increased oversight of local child welfare office decisions by the state Department of Health and Human Services. It sets out timeframes for court hearings on plans to move children in foster care to permanent homes. Courts would be allowed to authorize post-adoption contact agreements between biological and adoptive parents. 
Legislators have discussed comprehensive changes to child welfare and foster care laws for years. 
“It’s a long time coming,” Rep. Allen Chesser (R-Nash), one of the bill sponsors, told the Senate Health Committee during a Wednesday hearing. “I think it’s one of the most bipartisan issues we have.”
When they discussed the bill Wednesday, the Senate committee members heard concerns from a lawyer and adoptive parents that the bill would discourage infant adoptions.  
The bill gives a biological father up to three months after a child’s birth, when he is not married to the child’s mother, to acknowledge paternity or attempt to form a relationship with the child before his parental rights are terminated. If a possible father finds out that a woman has fraudulently concealed her pregnancy or a child’s birth, he would have up to 30 days after finding out to acknowledge paternity before his parental rights are terminated. 
“From an adoptive parent perspective, this bill is frankly terrifying,” said Natalie Carscadden, an adoptive parent. “Imagine the anxiety that comes when a person who’s never met or shown any interest in a child suddenly appears in requests for custody up to a three-month time span after that child is born. This would upset the status quo and put significantly more legal risk on potential adoptive families.”
In the committee discussion Thursday, Chesser referenced a court decision on a father’s right to act within a “timely manner.”
“What we are doing is defining what a timely manner means,” he said. 
The Senate combined the measure with three other bills that have passed the House:

House Bill 795, which extends financial assistance for guardians who are related to children who won’t be adopted or returned to their parents. Payments through the Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program could start when children are 10. Under current law, children have to be 14 or older. 
House Bill 162 would have cities and counties require criminal background checks for any person they plan to hire who would work with children. 
House Bill 182, which would allow judges to issue permanent “no contact” orders against people convicted of violent crimes.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4469-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-06 06:06:12.742520

Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are slamming the Republican spending plan moving through Congress, warning that tucked among its billion-dollar tax cuts for the wealthy is a dangerous gift to the gun industry that rolls back long-standing safety rules for firearm silencers.

Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are slamming the Republican spending plan moving through Congress, warning that tucked among its billion-dollar tax cuts for the wealthy is a dangerous gift to the gun industry that rolls back long-standing safety rules for firearm silencers.
In a blistering joint statement Thursday, the senators said the proposal would weaken gun laws that have been in place since 1934 by eliminating registration and ownership requirements for silencers, also known as suppressors — devices that muffle the sound of gunfire and make it harder for law enforcement to respond to active shooter situations.
“The Republican tax plan being pushed through Congress not only cuts critical services Virginians rely on in order to give huge tax breaks to billionaires,” Warner and Kaine said, “but it also makes our communities less safe by weakening gun safety measures on silencers.”
Though the change occupies just 12 lines in the nearly 400-page bill, the senators say its implications are severe. 
If passed, the bill would repeal the $200 tax on silencer purchases, wipe out federal registration requirements for the devices and deliver millions in savings to gun manufacturers. The suppressor tax, part of the National Firearms Act of 1934, has been a core part of federal gun law for nearly a century.
The two lawmakers pointed to the 2019 Virginia Beach mass shooting — where a gunman used a silencer to kill 12 people — as a grim example of what can happen when these devices are used. 
“Part of the reason that these registration and ownership requirements exist is because silencers, like the one that was used in the Virginia Beach mass shooting, make it harder for law enforcement to locate and respond to an active shooter,” they said.
Silencers are designed to reduce the sound, flash and recoil of a firearm, but their public safety risks have made them a focal point of debate. Law enforcement groups have long supported keeping suppressors regulated, arguing that they undermine gunshot detection technology and make it far more difficult to locate shooters in an emergency.
According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, 4.5 million suppressors were registered with the federal government by the end of 2024, including 113,046 in Virginia. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates repealing the tax would cost the federal government $1.4 billion over ten years.
But for gun rights groups, even this deregulation isn’t enough. 
The American Firearms Association called the move “nothing more than a crumb dropped from the King’s table,” and its Vice President Patrick Parsons said Republicans should go further by eliminating regulations on short-barrel rifles, abolishing the ATF and repealing the National Firearms Act altogether.
Warner and Kaine argue the silencer provision is just one piece of a broader bill they say would do massive harm to working families while lavishing the ultra-rich. 
They warn that the legislation would strip health insurance from more than 262,000 Virginians, cut food assistance to over 204,000 people, raise energy costs across the state, and threaten more than 20,000 Virginia jobs.
They also noted the bill would eliminate a program that allows Americans to file taxes for free, raise taxes on minimum-wage workers, and blow a $3.8 trillion hole in the federal deficit — all while handing the top 0.1% of earners an average tax cut of $188,000.
“Americans deserve to feel safe in their communities,” the senators said, vowing to push back against “this disastrous bill” when it reaches the Senate floor.

While the Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.
In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.
Shortly before his late-May death, U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Fairfax, expressed concern about the termination of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staffers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests. 
It was one of his final acts as a member of Congress before passing away following an extended battle with cancer. 
In his letter to the CDC’s acting director, Connolly said that “the elimination of staff responsible for facilitating FOIA strongly implies an effort by the administration to prevent the public from obtaining information about their government that they are entitled to request.”
The staff cuts come as FOIA officers at the Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, and other agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services were also let go. 
Connolly also pointed out that several outbreaks of infectious disease have been reported across the country. 
“Now more than ever, maintaining transparency about the operations of the broader HHS — and CDC in particular — is crucial to understanding the government’s capacity to respond to such crises.”
Some outbreaks are currently noted on CDC’s website, but with no FOIA-dedicated staff to handle records requests, it may be harder for journalists and citizens to seek further information that could aid public health.
 Former Richmond fire department employee under investigation for potential fraudulent spending

Records obtained by the Richmond Times-Dispatch show that a former Richmond Fire Department employee spent over $800,000 at a company registered to his home between 2017 and 2024. 
Reginald Thomas, a former analyst for RFD, used his city credit card, purchase orders and invoices to spend money at RPM Supply Co., LLC. The entity is registered to a house in Henrico County that he and his wife own. 
Though Richmond city officials did not say how much, if any, of the total was spent on legitimate products or services, they did confirm that he is no longer an employee. His conduct has since become the subject of two investigations — one by Richmond’s auditor and another by the city’s inspector general. 
The investigation into Thomas is among the latest actions the city has taken to address a history of funding issues tied to card misuse by employees. This spring, Mayor Danny Avula announced restrictions on employees’ use of purchasing cards for several months while leaders re-evaluate how employee spending is handled overall. Last year, the inspector general found that nearly $500,000 in RIchmond tax dollars were wasted or misused through use of employees’ cards. 
 
The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.


 Recidivism rates touted by Virginia state prison system, contributing factors not fully disclosed

Recently, Virginia’s Department of Corrections announced and celebrated low recidivism rates, but not mentioned in the agency’s news release was a note from the department’s research team suggesting the achievement was due to the effects of COVID-19 on Virginia’s court system. 
Recividism — when former prisoners reoffend and end up back in prison — is a metric law enforcement agencies often use  to measure the success of rehabilitation programs or other efforts to lower crime rates. Prison reform advocates and rehabilitation advocates also view these metrics as either calls to action or reasons to celebrate programs that may benefit  incarcerated people, their families, and the communities to which they return. 
The latest announcement from the state focuses on recidivism among former prisoners released between July 2020 and June 2021 and only examines people who returned to prison within three years of release — not those who were rearrested during the same time period, Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. 
About 17% of released prisoners landed back in prison, while 44% were rearrested, according to the report. 
While rearrests were higher, those numbers aren’t counted as recidivism. Because the state’s definition ties recidivism to reincarceration, it is influenced by how quickly courts deliver verdicts — and Virginia’s courts were under emergency orders that slowed proceedings until the summer of 2022. 
“Re-incarceration rates are lower during follow-up years impacted by COVID-19 due to court closures and sentencing delays,” the research team wrote in its report.
Kyle Gibson, a spokesperson for VADOC, acknowledged that recidivism rates were lower due to COVID-19, “but VADOC cannot conclusively say that the pandemic was the sole cause of the lower rates.”
Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking reelection this year, has emphasized on social media that the low recidivism rate supports his tough-on-crime approach as the state’s top lawyer. 
In a post to X, he said there are two approaches to lowering the rate: “hold violent repeat offenders accountable or let them out early.”
“For four years, I’ve fought to put violent criminals behind bars while leftist politicians demanded leniency and reduced sentences,” he added. “We see which approach works.”
While the recidivism rates have declined over the past decade, according to a Richmond Times-Dispatch analysis, the time frame that VADOC recently celebrated occurred prior to Miyares taking office. 
 Audit shows Roanoke spent $5 million over city’s general fund budget

Without city council approval, the city of Roanoke overspent by $5 million last year, WSLS reported. 
A recent audit of expenditures found that the city’s general fund exceeded the final budget.
“We are stewards of taxpayer dollars,” said newer council member Nick Hagen, who joined the city’s legislative body after the issues occurred. “They’re not ours — they’re the people’s.”
He suspected staff turnover might be part of the problem with lack of budget oversight. 
This is because the former city manager had stepped down, a successor was appointed, and a new city council took office.
The audit also revealed that much of the overspending came from the Children’s Services Act — which funds services for at-risk youth — and the city’s fire department, which faced rising overtime costs and implemented pay increases. 
Still, to ensure spending is justified and remains within budget, WSLS reported that the city claimed to be implementing reforms. There will be more frequent budget reviews going forward, new staff will be hired, and stricter internal protocols will be put in place.

(Ethan Miller/Getty Images)After a marathon day of floor votes, Senate Republican leadership tried multiple avenues to force a public hearing on a proposed red flag law, less than two weeks before the Maine Legislature is scheduled to adjourn. 
Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) attempted four maneuvers to force a public hearing for LD 1378, which was born out of a citizens initiative process. The proposal is already set to appear on the November ballot for voters to decide on. 
Red flag laws, formally known as extreme risk protection orders, are a mechanism to temporarily confiscate one’s guns if they are deemed to be a threat by law enforcement or their family members.
Arguing that they are obligated by state law to hold a hearing for the bill, Stewart put forth multiple proposals to waive the hearing requirement or have another body other than the Judiciary Committee hold it. When those attempts failed, Stewart proposed what he said was the only option left: adjourning the session early. 
The Maine Senate rejected all of the measures in party-line votes, with a few members absent. 
After a failed legislative attempt last year to pass a red flag law, the Maine Gun Safety Coalition collected more than 80,000 signatures in about two months in support of the initiative. 
The Legislature’s Judiciary Committee held a public hearing in April 2024 for a red flag bill amid criticisms of the state’s current yellow flag law, which has faced scrutiny after an independent commission found that it should have been triggered to remove firearms from Robert Card II, who perpetrated the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston.
In recent weeks, Republicans have raised questions about why the bill has not gotten a public hearing this session.
When Stewart previously asked about it on the chamber floor, Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) said the Judiciary Committee still had possession of the bill, essentially saying it is up to the committee to decide what to do with it next. 
Sen. Susan Bernard (R-Aroostook) said on the Senate floor Thursday night that she hopes she and the people of Maine “won’t be duped.”
Daughtry also argued the current legislative rules take precedence over requirements put in place by previous legislatures. She specifically cited a rule that says public hearings and work sessions must be arranged by the speaker of the House and Senate president. If they can’t agree, the committee is to decide with a majority vote.  
Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) said he was concerned that this decision was setting a “reckless precedent.”
“A ruling like that, which is within the prerogative of the chair to make, is deeply disturbing because it kicks in the teeth that notion of fundamental openness and transparency on which this Senate and this Legislature relies,” he said.

(Photo by Arshia Khan for Arkansas Advocate, June 2025)Building in some of Arkansas’ fastest-growing cities hit a wall last spring after the Arkansas Department of Health ceased approving any significant new projects.
Centerton and Highfill, two communities in the booming Northwest Arkansas region, grew by 7.2% and 15.2%, respectively, between July 1, 2023 and last July 1, according to the Census Bureau.
Both towns remain relatively small — just shy of 26,000 for Centerton and just under 3,000 for Highfill — but their exponential growth over the past three decades now poses a significant problem as an estimated 34 people move to the region every day: what to do with the sewage all those new residents and businesses produce.
That’s why the health department hasn’t approved a project in Centerton since May 2024. In a December letter, the department stated it would be “unable to approve any additional projects that will increase the flow of wastewater” to Decatur’s sewage treatment plant “until there is capacity available at the facility.”
As one developer said: “You’ll be looking at 1,000 open acres just primed for development, and you can’t do nothing with it because it has no infrastructure.”
The issue came into focus March 10 in a Centerton Utilities building conference. The presence of the Centerton and Decatur mayors at a water and wastewater planning meeting of Centeron’s Utilities Board highlighted the seriousness of the stakes.
Centerton doesn’t treat its own sewage. It sends it all to Decatur, population about 1,727, and therein lay the problem.
Decatur had plans to expand its wastewater plant’s capacity from 3.8 million gallons a day (MGD) to 5.25 MGD. Officials estimated that getting the health department to sign off on the plan would take six months or more, and with the specter of tariffs potentially doubling the projected cost, an already significant delay threatened to become even more drawn out.

That’s why Centerton’s officials were looking at other solutions. The first option, with a $5.7 million price tag, would involve diverting some of Centerton’s sewage to Bentonville. But as utilities board members acknowledged, there were questions about whether Bentonville’s mayor would be amenable to the idea. 
The second option involved linking to the Northwest Arkansas Conservation Authority (NACA) wastewater collection system. The cost: $14 million — $10 million for connection and capacity fees and $4 million for capital costs like pipe. That doesn’t cover the cost of actually treating the sewage.
“Water, sewer building, it’s a hot subject around here,” said Jeff Dehnhardt, director of Water & Wastewater Engineering with ESI, Centerton’s engineering consultant. “I think everywhere in the region is experiencing the impact of all of the growth in Northwest Arkansas, and none of it is free.” 
“The day of reckoning has come,” said utilities board member Robert Anderson.
 Out of mind

More than three decades ago, Northwest Arkansas leaders saw the proverbial writing on the wall and began preparing the region for its current growth.
The Northwest Arkansas Council, a nonprofit established in 1990 by business leaders like Sam Walton, Don Tyson and J.B. Hunt to help promote the region, tackled infrastructure priorities like a new airport, XNA, because fog-bound Drake Field affected business travel. 
Because many small towns struggled with adequate water supply, the Two-Ton Water System (aka the Benton/Washington Regional Public Water Authority) became another council priority. 
Interstate 49 was a priority because businesses needed to be able to transport goods in and out of the region. 
But wastewater was a few rungs down the ladder of priorities.
Water and wastewater systems “especially the pipeline systems … they’re out of sight, out of mind,” said Celine Hyer, co-author of the wastewater chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers’ 2025 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure. As a result, they’re not getting the money needed to refurbish or rehabilitate them “because nobody sees them,” she said. 
That’s part of the reason America’s wastewater infrastructure received a D+ in the report card, Hyer said.
But deficiencies and a lack of capacity underfoot begin to have effects aboveground.
 Wakeup call

Last fall, Northwest Arkansas Council CEO Nelson Peacock said he started hearing about a looming sewer system crisis from developers, city officials, businesses, the Arkansas Department of Health, and others. 
“That’s when we felt, ‘Wow, this is a little bit more than we saw.’ And so we need a regional approach,” he said.
“Every city, and every issue, has its own story of how and why it got there,” Peacock said. A master plan, which could take up to 24 months to complete, “is really the only way to help us get a handle on this and to help cities make the best decisions. Because all those decisions are going to impact others,” he said.

 Northwest Arkansas has been here before

In 2002, the region’s municipalities were facing pressure to expand water treatment plants and increase wastewater discharge to reduce phosphorus levels in the Illinois River and tributaries like Osage Creek. That prospect — coupled with 20-year growth projections showing the region’s population more than doubling, “run[ning] together to become like a regional metroplex” — was reason enough to look for solutions, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
Their solution? The Northwest Arkansas Conservation Authority, or NACA.
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette columnist Mike Masterson compared the authority to the development of Beaver Lake in the 1950s. Former 3rd District Congressman Jim Trimble “and other visionaries saw 70 years into the future when the Beaver Water District was formed to deal with the entire area’s projected water needs,” Masterson wrote. “Forming NACA is close to what occurred when the Beaver District was formed.”
The conservation authority was meant to encourage cities to pool their resources. At the time, area cities were considering as many as six new wastewater treatment plants in the Illinois River watershed (Fayetteville was the only one that had moved forward with a new plant, which opened in 2008). 
In the 1970s, the federal government offered grants for sewage plants with a regional focus. Those incentives went away during the Reagan years, but supporters could point to regional and local successes.
One was the Beaver Water District, which a Northwest Arkansas Conservation Authority organizer praised for “regionally allocating lake water to area towns and cities.”
When the conservation authority started up, Rogers and Springdale were the only members. By fall 2005, with talk of a regional treatment plant materializing, eight more municipalities had signed up: Bentonville, Bethel Heights, Cave Springs, Centerton, Highfill and Lowell in Benton County, and Elm Springs and Tontitown in Washington County.
But less than a week after the June 2009 groundbreaking, the Democrat-Gazette reported, Bentonville and Tontitown “will be the only cities initially served by Northwest Arkansas’ first regional sewer plant, and it’s likely to be a good while before others join the $68 million project.” 

Among the reasons: Rogers had finished an expansion of its own wastewater plant just two months before.
“NACA is way, way down the road,” said Mayor Perry Long of Lowell, which already sent its sewage to plants in Springdale and Rogers. 
Elm Springs and Cave Springs used septic-tank effluent pumps that still had plenty of capacity.
“We’re good for probably the next 20 years,” said Rene Langston, Springdale Water Utilities director.

  ‘No consequences’

Even though the NACA facility was “a very bold and good decision, there were no consequences” for the municipalities that pulled out, said Lane Crider, Beaver Water District CEO. 
  Lane Crider, CEO, Beaver Water District (Beaver Water District photo)
“I’m not gonna say [it was] a mistake, but you know, it was certainly something that has hampered the ultimate success and future development of that facility.”
George Spence, a member of the authority’s board from around 2003 to 2021, said coming together as NACA was a way to “take care of our own communities. But it was always going to be based on the individual cities wanting to come, not any kind of overriding authority to control that decision.”
Spence said he didn’t think a state-imposed regional plan would have worked “because you wouldn’t have had any political support. Nobody, nobody, nobody from the individual communities would have wanted to sign up for giving up their ability to control, to determine their future.”
Other pressures posed challenges to regional authority’s success. In early 2009, the EPA stated the plant could discharge no more than 0.1 milligram of phosphorus for each liter of treated sewage by 2012. The authority had been planning to build a plant that would discharge 10 times that amount into Osage Creek.
NACA’s plant was completed in 2010 in Highfill for $65 million with the capacity to treat 3.6 MGD.
Planners thought they’d need 80 MGD by 2060, but “you can’t go ahead and build that capacity because paying for it would start before that supply caught up to demand,” Spence said. They’d also have to consider the impact on rates, permit approval and accessing federal or state money, he said.
In 2017, the authority began exploring an expansion to double the plant’s capacity to 7.2 MGD, Plant Director Mike Neil said. A $55 million loan from the state was expected to cover the cost (plus the cost to fix a faulty pipeline). In 2022, the agency asked for an additional $20 million loan to cover rising building costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Neil said they hope to have the expansion completed by mid-summer, with a final cost of $80 million.
Even as smaller communities have begun to tie into the conservation authority’s system — Cave Springs linked up this spring; Highfill is about a month and a half out — the problem has been a lack of master plans that project the needs of the entire region.
“One of the big issues that all of the littler cities have is that there’s not a master plan,” Neil said. Smaller cities “never had to contend with anything like this before. There just hasn’t been a need for it.”
 ‘Plenty of capacity’

Centerton Utilities Director Malcolm Attwood said the impending lack of capacity from wastewater infrastructure had really only been on their radar “since early 2024.” 
Centerton’s 1.27 MGD should have been a drop in the bucket for Decatur’s 3.8 MGD plant to handle. But Decatur also receives sewage from the Simmons Foods poultry processing plant, an average 3.05 million gallons a day, according to the latest available data. That, coupled with population growth, means Decatur can’t take any more sewage.
“I think the previous director and our commission thought they had plenty of capacity in Decatur,” Attwood said. “We knew we were all growing. I just don’t think we knew at the rate they were growing, and what Simmons was going to be doing … that’s kind of how we got in this position.”
Not everything has ground to a standstill, however. With Bentonville facing its own water woes — and $103 million in infrastructure improvements, according to the Bentonville Bulletin — Centerton had opted to tie into NACA, Attwood said in late May. It’s now a matter of funding. 
“We’ve got to figure out how we’re gonna come up with the money, whether it’s increased rates, or get a bond, or both.” It’s possible they could use the one-to-one match offered by the recently signed Act 812, which created a state matching grant program for shovel-ready water and wastewater infrastructure projects, but he said he expected it to be “very competitive.”

 Future growth and wastewater infrastructure

The Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission is scheduled to meet Friday with city leaders from Bentonville, Centerton, Decatur, Gentry, Gravette and Highfill to discuss “future growth and wastewater infrastructure treatment planning in this part of Benton County.”
Planning Commission Executive Director Tim Conklin said the meeting is aimed at improving awareness and understanding. This becomes especially important as the smaller communities outside the larger cities absorb even more growth. Northwest Arkansas is projected to add 130,000 people between 2020 and 2030, compared to 100,000 in previous decades. Conklin noted that smaller communities like Pea Ridge and Highfill are seeing even higher growth rates, 17% and 15%, than Centerton. 
Communication matters more than ever, Conklin said, “because we can have very large national home builders show up and double the population of one of the small cities with one development.” 
“We don’t have one big central city that understands everything that’s happening within their community… we have multiple communities sharing the same infrastructure, and so people that own and operate and maintain that infrastructure need to have a really good understanding of what’s happening outside of their own city,” Conklin said.
Naturally, that brings up questions: Namely, who’s going to pay for the necessary infrastructure? And how fast will they be able to build it?
“Those are all very good questions,” Conklin said.  The commission is seeking a consultant to answer those questions over the next 18-24 months, he said. Once completed, the Northwest Arkansas Comprehensive Study of Wastewater Management and Needs in Benton and Washington counties will include:

Estimated costs of recommended capital improvements to accommodate projected employment and population growth, with a breakdown of responsibilities by city and/or utility over the next 25 years.
A prioritized implementation plan for wastewater improvements, including recommended public financing options.
Public presentations in multiple forums to communicate the region’s wastewater needs and priorities.

Asked how this might be different from previous regional efforts, including a similarly titled plan published in 1974, Conklin said, “When you get to the point of not being able to move forward with additional housing and additional employment growth, job creation, it has to. We’ll get together, and we will work together to figure that out.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Centerton-construction-aa-13-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-06 05:06:03.949955

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Medical experts are dismayed over a federal report’s claim that kids are overprescribed asthma medications, saying it minimizes how many lives the drugs save.
Safe treatment protocols for asthma management have been carefully studied over the years, said Dr. Perry Sheffield, a pediatrician and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
“The federal government actually has some really beautiful and clear guidelines and strategies, and things that are vetted by and carefully edited by many experts in the field,” said Sheffield, who co-directs a region of the federally funded Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units that serves New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Asthma affects more than 4.6 million American children, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s one of the most common long-term diseases in U.S. children.
The Make America Healthy Again Commission report released in late May, parts of which have been widely criticized, alleges that American children are on too much medication of various kinds, including asthma treatments.
Experts worry that the administration will set policy based on the assessment, dissuading insurers from covering asthma prescriptions. They also say that the report’s assertions could worsen disparities that affect children’s access to those medications and undermine years of research around the drugs.
Blue Cross Blue Shield now requires prior approval for severe asthma drugs in some states

The MAHA commission has until August to release a strategy based on the findings in the report.
Black and Indigenous children as well as those living in inner cities or in lower-income households are among those with the highest rates of asthma. Pollution disproportionately shrouds communities of color and can be a trigger that exacerbates the disease.
The report’s message could heighten those disparities, said Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, a University of Texas at Austin professor and a past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Section on Allergy and Immunology.
“One thing that has been very clear is that kids of color are less likely to be appropriately managed in terms of their asthma medication management,” she said. “So a message of overprescription that is simply not supported by the evidence also could potentially exacerbate already-existing racial and ethnic disparities in asthma that we have really not made much headway on.”
The commission’s claims
The report touches on childhood prediabetes, obesity and mental health. However, firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the CDC — weren’t mentioned.
The 70-page report from the commission, chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., claims four main issues are the drivers behind childhood chronic disease: poor diet, aggregation of environmental chemicals, lack of physical activity and chronic stress, and “overmedicalization.”
Matsui and other experts said the report’s use of that word is “problematic.”
“The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma — so, they have coughing, chest tightness, wheezing — that that is not really a disease,” said Matsui. “We know for a fact that that’s a disease, and we know that it is quite treatable, quite controllable, and that it has profound impacts on the child’s day-to-day life.”
Other scientists have similarly criticized the report, saying it makes sweeping and misleading generalizations about children’s health without sufficient evidence. The White House corrected the report after nonprofit news outlet NOTUS found that it cited studies that didn’t exist.











The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma … that that is not really a disease. We know for a fact that that's a disease.


– Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, University of Texas at Austin professor



When it comes to asthma, the report says, “Asthma controller prescriptions increased 30% from 1999-2008.” That sentence originally cited a broken link to a study from 2011; the link was later replaced. Controller meds include inhalers.
The MAHA report also claims that “There is evidence of overprescription of oral corticosteroids for mild cases of asthma.” The original version of the report listed estimated percentages of oral corticosteroids overuse, citing a nonexistent study. The wording was changed and the citation was later replaced with a link to a 2017 study by pediatric pulmonologist Dr. Harold Farber.
The study was not a randomized controlled trial, which increases reliability. Farber  told NOTUS that the report made an “overgeneralization” of his research. Stateline also reached out to Farber, whose public relations team declined an interview request.
Oral corticosteroids are liquid or tablet medications used to reduce inflammation for conditions including allergies, asthma, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. For asthma, they’re used to treat severe flare-up episodes. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America says the medications have been shown to reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and that while they do come with risk of side effects, they’re mostly used in acute flare-ups. And while rare, asthma-related deaths in kids do occur, and are often preventable.
“Asthma medications, including oral steroids, are lifesaving,” said Dr. Elizabeth Friedman, a pediatrician at Children’s Mercy Kansas City. “I believe that physicians, not politicians, are best equipped and most effectively trained to make the determination of whether or not these medications are needed for our patients.”
Friedman worries that federal characterizations of asthma meds will affect how state Medicaid agencies cover the drugs. When Medicaid coverage changed for a common prescribed inhaler last year, many of her Missouri Medicaid patients were suddenly without the drug. They ended up hospitalized, she said.
Friedman directs Region 7 of the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units, a network of experts that works to address reproductive and children’s environmental health issues. Region 7 provides outreach and education in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska.
She also said she’s concerned that the report is “making a broad, sweeping statement based on one epidemiologic study from one state.”
Increased use
An increase in inhaler prescriptions is not necessarily a bad thing, experts say. It’s a sign that kids are getting their medication.
There has been an increase in inhaler prescriptions, along with a corresponding decrease in the oral corticosteroids, which is what experts would want to see, said Chelsea Langer, bureau chief of the New Mexico Department of Health’s Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau. She said that means kids are “following their asthma action plans and taking the controller medications to prevent needing the relief or treatment [oral] meds.”
Trump has canceled environmental justice grants. Here’s what communities are losing.

Asthma prevalence has increased over the years, meaning more people need medication, noted Dr. Alan Baptist, division head of Allergy and Clinical Immunology at Henry Ford Health in Michigan.
He said that because steroid tablets come with risk of side effects, it is best to limit them.
But for kids without access to a regular pediatric provider or to health insurance that covers an inhaler, cost can be an obstacle, he said. Fluticasone propionate, an FDA-approved medicine for people 4 and older, costs on average $200 or more for one inhaler without insurance.
“What often happens with kids, and especially kids who are in Medicaid, or who are in an underserved or disadvantaged population, they are not given appropriate asthma controller medication,” said Baptist, who helped write federal guidelines for asthma treatment best practices as part of a National Institutes of Health committee.
Baptist noted that while he was glad to see pollution mentioned in the report as a danger for kids, it’s at odds with the recent cuts to environmental health grants that aimed to address such asthma triggers.
“They’re somewhat cherry-picking some of the data that they’re putting down,” he said. “It says the U.S. government is ‘committed to fostering radical transparency and gold-standard science’ to better understand the potential cumulative impacts of environmental exposure. If that’s what they’re saying, then they should be funding even greater studies that look at the effects.”
Dr. Priya Bansal, an Illinois pediatrician and past president of the Illinois Society of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, said she’s concerned the report doesn’t define mild, moderate or severe asthma to differentiate the different best-practice treatment plans.
Bansal also said she worries that federal officials’ characterization of an FDA-approved drug will lead to insurance companies refusing to cover inhalers or oral steroids for her patients who rely on them.
“I’m going to be worried about coverage for my asthmatics,” she said. “The question is, what’s the next move that they’re going to make? If they think that, are they going to now say, ‘Hey, we’re not going to cover inhalers for mild asthmatics’?”

It’s hard to fathom in a proposal that includes billions upon billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, but one of the most significant changes included in the massive budget bill approved by the U.S. House late last month was this: big cuts to the nation’s main anti-hunger program.
Under the legislation, millions of people would lose SNAP food assistance benefits. Meanwhile, states would be saddled with 14 billion dollars in new costs.
And the impacts will be felt in the stomachs of families across the nation.
As Raleigh-area Congresswoman Deborah Ross explained last week, in her district – one of the state’s more affluent ones  – 20,000 of her adult constituents will lose all of their SNAP benefits.
Statewide, a total of almost half a million people will lose benefits and the cuts will ripple through grocery stores and the economy as a whole.
The bottom line: Rep. Ross is right. The Republican budget will cause irreparable harm to the people of our state. All caring and thinking North Carolinians should support her effort to push back.

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)In a unanimous decision Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court has sided with an Ohio woman who claimed she was the victim of reverse discrimination by her employer.
The justices determined the lower courts improperly forced her to clear a higher burden of proof and sent the case back for further hearings.
How we got here
In 2019, after working at the Ohio Department of Youth Services for 15 years, Marlean Ames applied for a promotion. Instead, she claims her supervisors “conspired” to demote her and move her to a different facility.
The woman who got the job Ames wanted, and the man who took her old job both identify as LGBTQ+. Ames is straight.

In 2020, Ames filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming her supervisors discriminated against her on account of her sexual orientation. The district and appeals court both sided with the agency — Ames had not shown the “background circumstances” to demonstrate her bosses punished her because she was straight.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday rejected that background circumstances rule. Writing for the majority, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stated it “cannot be squared with the text of Title VII or our longstanding precedents. And nothing Ohio has said, in its brief or at oral argument, persuades us otherwise.”

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 holds that employers may not discriminate on the basis of “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” Importantly, Jackson wrote, the text draws no distinction between members of majority and minority groups.
“By establishing the same protections for every ‘individual’ — without regard to that individual’s membership in a minority or majority group — Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone,” Jackson wrote.
She added that the Circuit Court erred by rigidly enforcing an evidentiary standard, when court precedent holds there should be greater flexibility in proving discrimination cases.
Jackson noted Ohio “barely contests” the arguments Ames leveled against it. The state argued Ames’ Title VII claims would’ve failed even if they cleared the background circumstances test. But Jackson insisted that sits outside the scope of the case.
“We granted review to consider the validity of the ‘background circumstances’ rule, and we reject that rule for the reasons set forth above,” she wrote. “We leave it to the courts below to address any of Ohio’s remaining arguments on remand.”
Reactions
Following the ruling, both sides of the case portrayed it as a win. For Xiao Wang, a law school professor at the University of Virginia who represented Ames, that argument was straightforward.
“When Congress passed this law, it said, look, don’t discriminate,” Wang said, “don’t consider race, don’t consider religion, don’t consider sex, or some of these other characteristics.”
He argued the decision “reiterates and affirms” that message.
“If someone has a case, they’re subject to the same legal standards, and the same legal treatment as everyone else,” Wang argued.
Meanwhile Ohio Attorney General spokesman Dominic Binkley emphasized the fact that the Supreme Court didn’t decide the underlying discrimination claim.
“We are glad that the court agreed with what Ohio has said all along: ‘It is wrong to hold some litigants to a higher standard because of their protected characteristics.'”
Still, he said, “the court made clear that this case is not over,” referring to the opinion stating Ohio’s remaining arguments could be handled when they’re sent back to a lower court.
“We look forward to fully pressing those arguments as the case moves forward,” he said, “because the Ohio Department of Youth Services did not engage in unlawful discrimination.”
An Ohio Department of Youth Services spokesman declined to comment citing pending litigation.
As the case was considered by the Supreme Court, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund filed an amicus brief in the case, urging the court not to entertain Ames’ arguments. The LDF’s Assistant Counsel Avatara Smith-Carrington, warned the decision doesn’t shift the balance and grant majority groups some new advantage in court.
“Of course everyone is protected by Title VII,” she said in a statement. “However, there is a persisting legacy of discrimination targeting Black people and other historically marginalized groups that cannot be ignored.”
Equality Ohio downplayed the decision’s potential impact. In a statement, the group’s former legal director Maya Simek, cast it as a “technical and narrow correction.”
“What’s most important here is what the Court didn’t do,” she added. “It did not undercut or call into question the landmark Bostock decision, which affirms protections for LGBTQ+ people under federal employment law.”
Equality Ohio Executive Director Dwayne Steward insisted, “This ruling doesn’t roll back rights or erase hard-won protections. What it does is quietly reaffirm that Title VII means what it says: all workers are protected from discrimination.”
Drexel University Law Professor D. Wendy Greene has written extensively on anti-discrimination law and heads up the school’s Center for Law, Policy, and Social Action. She argued the most important factor going forward will be judicial perception.
When a judge believes racism is exceptional rather than commonplace, she said, workers of color often have to meet or exceed the evidence required by the “background circumstances test.” By the same token, if a judge believes “reverse discrimination” is the norm, litigants get greater leeway to make their case.
“These perceptions often shape judicial decision-making and the evidentiary burdens in intentional discrimination cases — with or without an express “background circumstances” evidentiary requirement,” she explained.

(Photo by PeopleImages/Getty Images)A proposal in the Ohio Senate’s budget would give additional funding to high-performing public school districts, ones typically in suburban and often wealthier areas.
Public school districts in Ohio are continuing to rally for more funding, which is why Scott DiMauro with the Ohio Education Association is fighting against the Senate’s newly proposed state budget.
“You have different public schools that are being, essentially, pitted against one another,” DiMauro said.
The senators increased the amount of money going to public schools from the House’s proposal.
The budget draft introduced by the Senate gives public schools about $100 million more than the House version. They follow most of the House’s proposed budget, which only gives schools about $226 million for school funding, but $550 million total. The Senate changed the funding “guarantee” amount. Currently, some districts have guarantees that a portion of their funding will not be reduced, even if their enrollment decreases.
Finance Chair Jerry Cirino (R-Kirtland) explained that this $100 million added back would only go to high-performing or “improving” districts.
“A new component has been added to recognize performance of the districts who have shown great progress or received a four or five-star rating in their last evaluation,” he said.
Schools with higher report card ratings, which are based on state testing, receive a funding boost from the state. Republicans say that this could increase the incentive for schools to do well.
“This was a necessary addition to the funding formula as we move forward and as we expect more and more out of our school districts,” the lawmaker said.
There are 68 schools with a five-star rating, according to data from the Department of Education and Workforce. Fifty-six are suburban, 25 are considered rural, and only one could be classified as a mix of suburban and urban (Steubenville City Schools).
Zooming in on Orange City Schools District, a five-star school, reveals that it has some of the wealthiest areas in Ohio, with median incomes exceeding $200,000 in Pepper Pike, Moreland Hills, and Hunting Valley. Orange also just passed its school levy in May.
All schools are facing financial challenges, DiMauro said, but noted that achieving a four- or five-star rating becomes that much harder when districts continue to be underfunded by the state.
The school districts for the 10 biggest cities in Ohio are all under four stars. Cleveland has three, Columbus has two and Cincinnati has 2.5.
“Rather than taking some money from an already underfunded system and reallocating it to districts that are already doing well and primarily serve higher-income students, why don’t we instead make sure that we are fully funding the formula and directing resources where they’re needed the most,” he said.
The budget will continue to be heard, and a final version will need to be agreed upon by the Senate and House by the end of June.

But an advocate for immigrants in the state said the mistake-riddled list should be cause for alarm.
It named 500 states, cities and counties that were allegedly not doing their duty in helping federal officials enforce immigration law. However, it didn’t say how.
The list included Warren County, northeast of Cincinnati, as a sanctuary county even though voters there went for Trump by a 65-33 margin on Nov. 5. The sheriff, Barry Riley, told WCPO television, “This report is wrong. A mistake has been made and incorrectly listed Warren County. We have reached out to representatives of the Department of Homeland Security to correct the issue.”
Warren County might have made it onto the Homeland Security list because in 2021, Lebanon, the county seat, attempted to ban abortion by declaring itself “a sanctuary for the unborn,” said Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. She said other jurisdictions were mistakenly placed on the list after declaring themselves sanctuaries for gun owners.
“It’s like they’ve got some intern with an AI program searching for the word ‘sanctuary’ and popping up a list of names of counties and cities,” Tramonte said. “They’re just sloppy.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXAlso drawing laughs is that the list spelled Ohio’s oldest major city “Cincinnatti” and a Kentucky county just over the river “Cambell.” instead of Campbell. Officials in both jurisdictions told WCPO that they weren’t violating any immigration laws.
The errors might be comical, but in context, they’re really terrifying, Tramonte said.
“They took the list down because it was full of errors, and this is the Department of Homeland Security,” she said. “They can’t even get their spelling right. Everybody was making fun of Secretary (Kristi) Noem because she couldn’t keep her purse safe, but this is another example. They can’t publish a list of examples of cities in the United States and spell them correctly? How can we trust them to keep us safe?”
In April, Noem’s purse, containing multiple IDs and thousands in cash, was stolen from a Washington, D.C. restaurant.
Noem has faced further criticism in her new role as head of the agency. 
Habeas corpus is a fundamental right that dates at least back to the Magna Carta of 1215. It says that detained people have a right to appear before a judge and challenge their detention.
In a May congressional hearing, Noem got it exactly backward, saying, habeas corpus is “a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country and suspend their rights,” the Associated Press reported.
Tramonte said the Ohio immigrants she talks to are terrified as the Trump administration seeks to squeeze “sanctuary” jurisdictions and deport ever more people — including hundreds of thousands who came legally. She said it’s deeply unfair that they’re trying to throw out people who came under a Biden-era program that allowed people to apply for asylum from outside the country. 
“We told them, ‘We don’t want you showing up at the border seeking asylum,’ even though that’s a perfectly legal process,” she said. “People in Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela said, ‘OK, I’ll find a sponsor in the United States, I’ll request advance permission from the United States government to come. I’ll fill out this form. My sponsor will show you all of their assets. They will promise to take care of me. I will not be a burden on the U.S. taxpayer. I’ll come in an airplane, pay for my own ticket and get a house and a job.”
Those using the program followed the rules and now they’re working and have kids in American schools, Tramonte said.
“And then Trump said, ‘You’ve got to go,'” she added. “If I’m from Haiti, what am I supposed to go back to? There’s no government.”
Tramonte urged people to try to put themselves in immigrants’ shoes.
“None of us did anything to earn the right to be born in the United States,” she said. “It was an accident that we were born here. I just feel like we need to have a bit of compassion for people who were born in countries that are in turmoil.”

(Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)If you talked to a college sports fan in Kansas over the past few years, you likely heard their frustrations: the transfer portal, 25-year-old quarterbacks still using COVID eligibility, the possibility of fading Blue Blood dynasties, conference realignment and student athletes getting paid more than their instructors.
This academic year seemed particularly sour and chaotic. 
To help me find context, I sat down with Mit Winter, a former college basketball player who now works as a Kansas-City area lawyer specializing in the legal issues of college sports. Winter has been named by legal groups and sports media outlets as a leading expert, especially in matters surrounding athlete compensation.
He also happens to be my friend, since our sons shared Leawood schools, athletic teams and neighborhood playgrounds. 
Below is a transcript of our conversation, edited for space and clarity.
Where do you feel like we are in terms of the seismic changes that have happened in college sports? Can you give me the 30,000 foot view?
For as long as college athletics had been around, with a few like exceptions and maybe like under-the-table payments, college athletes could not be paid beyond a valuable scholarship. Since July 1, 2021, college athletes have been able to receive the NIL compensation, so payment for the use of their name, image and likeness in connection with some activity. 
But that quickly morphed into payments that are called NIL payments but everyone knows the athletes are being paid to play a sport at a school
What’s supposed to happen in a month on July 1, is the schools are now just going to be directly paying the athletes NIL compensation.
Again, it’s still called NIL compensation, but really, in reality, they’re being paid to play their sport, right? They’re just calling it NIL compensation now because they don’t want them to be considered employees. So that’s really the biggest difference. Athletes are being recruited and enticed to come to a university with the promise of being paid beyond a scholarship.
Do you feel these last four years are coming to the end of a chapter on July 1? Do you feel like this is an interregnum period that’s ending?
Yeah, I would say it’s a transition. It’s another milestone, but it’s not going to be the ending place. But I don’t think that’s where ultimately it will land with schools paying NIL compensation to the athletes. I think eventually, at some point, we should be talking about — the highest level of football and basketball — probably some athletes are going to end up being employees.
What has been the reaction from the legislature in the state of Kansas to this? 
Kansas is unique because it’s one of a few states that has not passed any state law specific to college athlete NIL compensation. When California passed its law, a lot of other states started passing their own laws. Kansas has never passed one. There have been some bills introduced, but they’ve never passed one, which doesn’t mean that college athletes in Kansas cannot receive NIL compensation. 
You don’t need a state law. Kansas has been able to float along and change as things around the nation change, without having to have a (state) law. 
There have been some states where in 2020 or so, they passed a state law. They ended up being more restrictive than what was put in place by the NCAA eventually on July 1, 2021. Then they quickly either amended their law or repealed their state NIL law. So Kansas hasn’t had to deal with any of that, so they just had the flexibility to sit out there and not have any restrictions. 
How do you think we are going to remember these couple years of college athletics when we look back at it? What do you think is going to be the legacy of this moment?
I think people will probably look back at it and it’ll be a time when there’s the ultimate free market in college athletics. For the past four years, boosters have been able to pay athletes as much as they want in NIL compensation to attract them to their school. And right now we’re in this period where they’re trying to bring more regulation to it, and no one really knows how this regulation is going to go. 
I think people will look back at this time, the past four years, as the messy beginning of college athletes being paid for college sports, and there was not very much regulation. You could kind of do whatever you wanted. 
Now we’re moving into the more regulation space, and eventually we’ll get to real stability and more robust regulation.
And you think that robust regulation looks more like an employment model eventually? 
For some athletes, I think that’s where it will end up. In the NBA, NFL and lots of other pro sports, the regulatory structure exists and is not subject to antitrust law challenges because it was collectively bargained between the players associations under US law. 
When rules like that are collectively bargained, it makes an exemption from antitrust law. So that’s why you’re able to have things like salary caps, minimum salaries, maximum salaries, even the draft. All that stuff would otherwise violate antitrust law if it wasn’t collectively bargained between the players and leagues. 
So I think we’ll eventually end up with some sort of structure like that, at least in some college sports.  
I’m sure that you hear fans saying that this fan experience stinks. Do you think this is kind of a low point for the college sports fan experience? Do you predict that it’s gonna get even more messy? 
I think the biggest issue that fans have in college sports now is not necessarily the athletes are being paid. It’s about how easy it is for them to hop around from team to team.
What fans have the biggest issue with is they don’t know who’s going to be on their team from year to year. And as a college sports fan, a lot of people like to know a guy who would come in as a freshman, see him get better as a sophomore, junior, senior and graduate, and have their senior night. You got to know the players. 
Now, I think a lot of fans feel like players are just mercenaries looking at who’s going to pay them the most. They don’t have any loyalty to their school or even much connection to their schools, and the fans don’t feel like they get to know them.
You could have (rules about transferring) with a collective bargaining model. 
Or the other way to do some of this stuff — what the NCAA and conferences are trying to do now — is get Congress to pass a law that gives them an antitrust exemption, (to allow them to) put in rules (about transferring). 
How does the weather look for each of those things?
They’ve been trying to get Congress to pass a law for at least five, six years, and there hasn’t been much progress there. A bill’s never even gotten out of a committee. 
On the collective bargaining side, that’s still a ways off too, because under the current state of law, we have to have employees. And college athletes are not currently employees. And no university has stuck their neck out there to say we’re going to treat our athletes as employees.
In what ways do you feel like this current landscape is flawed or unjust at the moment?
There really needs to be some agent regulation in the college articles world. If you talk about NBA or NFL — to be an agent in those sports, you have to be registered with the players associations. You have to have certain minimum levels of education and pass certification tests, and you’re subjecting yourself to regulation by those players associations. In college athletics that does not exist. ‘
So there are lots of people who are now NIL agents who have zero experience as an agent. That doesn’t mean that necessarily they’re not good at what they do, but there are still some people out in the college sports agent world who don’t necessarily have the best interests of a lot of the athletes at heart. So I think that is potentially, like the biggest issue I see right now and then,
We were used to seeing powerhouse teams that were underwritten by generations of boosters that would hold up a particular college football program or college basketball program for decades. Now it seems easier to swoop in and install like an incredible set of players and all of a sudden they win. Do you think that has a corrosive effect? 
It has brought more parity college athletics, as you just described. There have been the “blue bloods” in college athletics, and they have had this built-in advantage, just because they have the historical success and capital and the boosters that provide financial support. They couldn’t pay players — at least not above board. 
For other schools that maybe didn’t have that historical capital, it was hard for them to compete. Well, now if they want to compete, they can just say, “All right, we’re going to pay you more than this other school even if they’re a blue blood.” 
So I think it creates more parity in terms of teams that have a chance to be competitive. 
I think we’ve seen some instances of schools that are blue bloods that have lost some of that built-in cache. You can say KU basketball the last two years.
Do you think (your children’s) college athletic experience would look distinguishably different from what your college athletic experience looked like?
Definitely a lot different. I think the biggest difference is just the continuity of your teammates. There were definitely a few kids at William and Mary who transferred out or transferred in on my team, but not at the level that you see now. 
I had the same roommate for four years in college with another guy on the basketball team. And lots of other teammates were there with me for four years or three years, if they were a year below me. We’re still friends to this day. 
The biggest difference is continuity. 
And then there definitely are some college athletes who are very focused on, “how much money can I make? Where’s the school that’s gonna pay me the most?” 
Everybody’s circumstances are different, and you can’t say you’re wrong for doing that. For a lot of people, being a college athlete is gonna be their most marketable time as an athlete and their time to monetize that. They are making a lot of money for universities and coaches and commissioners. So I can’t begrudge college athletes for thinking that way. 
So I can imagine a fan of college sports saying that we need to get lawyers and courts out of college sports. It just should be more pure than this. How would you respond to the argument that having courts and lawyers involved is only muddying everything.
I would say I agree with him. That’s why I’m an advocate of a model that has collective bargaining like you see in the pros. That’s the way to bring stability and certainty of the rules to college sports without all these lawsuits continuing to happen. I agree with the fans.
It’s just a question of how we can get there, and right now, a lot of people in college sports are just hoping that Congress helps them and not working on this other solution. So I think everyone’s on the same page with that sentiment — the fan’s sentiment. It’s just, how do we get to that place?

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXDamian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.














These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.


– Celina Damian, California student loan servicing ombudsperson






Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
 ‘Can’t wait for Washington’

Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
 Repayment

Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
 ‘Incentive to hike prices’

Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

Although the term didn’t come into common usage until the 21st century, DEI is best understood as the latest stage in a long American project. Its egalitarian principles are seen in America’s founding documents, and its roots lie in landmark 20th-century efforts such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act and affirmative action policies, as well as movements for racial justice, gender equity, disability rights, veterans and immigrants.
These movements sought to expand who gets to participate in economic, educational and civic life. DEI programs, in many ways, are their legacy.
Critics argue that DEI is antidemocratic, that it fosters ideological conformity and that it leads to discriminatory initiatives, which they say disadvantage white people and undermine meritocracy. Those defending DEI argue just the opposite: that it encourages critical thinking and promotes democracy − and that attacks on DEI amount to a retreat from long-standing civil rights law.
Yet missing from much of the debate is a crucial question: What are the tangible costs and benefits of DEI? Who benefits, who doesn’t, and what are the broader effects on society and the economy?
As a sociologist, I believe any productive conversation about DEI should be rooted in evidence, not ideology. So let’s look at the research.


	Who gains from DEI?    
In the corporate world, DEI initiatives are intended to promote diversity, and research consistently shows that diversity is good for business. Companies with more diverse teams tend to perform better across several key metrics, including revenue, profitability and worker satisfaction.
Businesses with diverse workforces also have an edge in innovation, recruitment and competitiveness, research shows. The general trend holds for many types of diversity, including age, race and ethnicity, and gender.
A focus on diversity can also offer profit opportunities for businesses seeking new markets. Two-thirds of American consumers consider diversity when making their shopping choices, a 2021 survey found. So-called “inclusive consumers” tend to be female, younger and more ethnically and racially diverse. Ignoring their values can be costly: When Target backed away from its DEI efforts, the resulting backlash contributed to a sales decline.
But DEI goes beyond corporate policy. At its core, it’s about expanding access to opportunities for groups historically excluded from full participation in American life. From this broader perspective, many 20th-century reforms can be seen as part of the DEI arc.
Consider higher education. Many elite U.S. universities refused to admit women until well into the 1960s and 1970s. Columbia, the last Ivy League university to go co-ed, started admitting women in 1982. Since the advent of affirmative action, women haven’t just closed the gender gap in higher education – they outpace men in college completion across all racial groups. DEI policies have particularly benefited women, especially white women, by expanding workforce access.
Similarly, the push to desegregate American universities was followed by an explosion in the number of Black college students – a number that has increased by 125% since the 1970s, twice the national rate. With college gates open to more people than ever, overall enrollment at U.S. colleges has quadrupled since 1965. While there are many reasons for this, expanding opportunity no doubt plays a role. And a better-educated population has had significant implications for productivity and economic growth.
The 1965 Immigration Act also exemplifies DEI’s impact. It abolished racial and national quotas, enabling the immigration of more diverse populations, including from Asia, Africa, southern and eastern Europe and Latin America. Many of these immigrants were highly educated, and their presence has boosted U.S. productivity and innovation.
Ultimately, the U.S. economy is more profitable and productive as a result of immigrants.


	What does DEI cost?    
While DEI generates returns for many businesses and institutions, it does come with costs. In 2020, corporate America spent an estimated US$7.5 billion on DEI programs. And in 2023, the federal government spent more than $100 million on DEI, including $38.7 million by the Department of Health and Human Services and another $86.5 million by the Department of Defense.
The government will no doubt be spending less on DEI in 2025. One of President Donald Trump’s first acts in his second term was to sign an executive order banning DEI practices in federal agencies – one of several anti-DEI executive orders currently facing legal challenges. More than 30 states have also introduced or enacted bills to limit or entirely restrict DEI in recent years. Central to many of these policies is the belief that diversity lowers standards, replacing meritocracy with mediocrity.
But a large body of research disputes this claim. For example, a 2023 McKinsey & Company report found that companies with higher levels of gender and ethnic diversity will likely financially outperform those with the least diversity by at least 39%. Similarly, concerns that DEI in science and technology education leads to lowering standards aren’t backed up by scholarship. Instead, scholars are increasingly pointing out that disparities in performance are linked to built-in biases in courses themselves.
That said, legal concerns about DEI are rising. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Department of Justice have recently warned employers that some DEI programs may violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Anecdotal evidence suggests that reverse discrimination claims, particularly from white men, are increasing, and legal experts expect the Supreme Court to lower the burden of proof needed by complainants for such cases.
The issue remains legally unsettled. But while the cases work their way through the courts, women and people of color will continue to shoulder much of the unpaid volunteer work that powers corporate DEI initiatives. This pattern raises important equity concerns within DEI itself.


	What lies ahead for DEI?    
People’s fears of DEI are partly rooted in demographic anxiety. Since the U.S. Census Bureau projected in 2008 that non-Hispanic white people would become a minority in the U.S by the year 2042, nationwide news coverage has amplified white fears of displacement.
Research indicates many white men experience this change as a crisis of identity and masculinity, particularly amid economic shifts such as the decline of blue-collar work. This perception aligns with research showing that white Americans are more likely to believe DEI policies disadvantage white men than white women.
At the same time, in spite of DEI initiatives, women and people of color are most likely to be underemployed and living in poverty regardless of how much education they attain. The gender wage gap remains stark: In 2023, women working full time earned a median weekly salary of $1,005 compared with $1,202 for men − just 83.6% of what men earned. Over a 40-year career, that adds up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost earnings. For Black and Latina women, the disparities are even worse, with one source estimating lifetime losses at $976,800 and $1.2 million, respectively.
Racism, too, carries an economic toll. A 2020 analysis from Citi found that systemic racism has cost the U.S. economy $16 trillion since 2000. The same analysis found that addressing these disparities could have boosted Black wages by $2.7 trillion, added up to $113 billion in lifetime earnings through higher college enrollment, and generated $13 trillion in business revenue, creating 6.1 million jobs annually.
In a moment of backlash and uncertainty, I believe DEI remains a vital if imperfect tool in the American experiment of inclusion. Rather than abandon it, the challenge now, from my perspective, is how to refine it: grounding efforts not in slogans or fear, but in fairness and evidence.

(Courtesy of NPPD)In February 2021, thousands of Nebraskans found themselves in the dark of rolling blackouts. A brutal polar vortex froze wind turbines, strained natural gas supplies and exposed serious weaknesses in our energy grid. However, even as multiple power sources failed, one remained steadfast — nuclear energy.
That moment was a wake-up call. We can no longer afford to treat energy policy as a matter of convenience or short-term cost. To avoid future blackouts and maintain affordable, resilient, firm and reliable power, Nebraska needs nuclear energy. Wind and solar are intermittent. Natural gas is a vital bridge fuel, but it is vulnerable to supply shocks in extreme weather. This is about building a reliable and resilient energy source that can deliver for Nebraska families, farmers and businesses when it counts.
Nuclear energy, which currently generates 17% of Nebraska’s power, brings unique strengths. It provides carbon-free baseload power that runs around the clock regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. During the 2021 deep freeze, Nebraska’s lone nuclear plant kept running at full strength while other sources faltered. The United Nations 2021 report, “Life Cycle Assessment of Electricity Generation Options,” shows that nuclear has the lowest overall impacts on human health and the environment by any measure and from any perspective.
The cost of new nuclear energy is within a penny per kilowatt-hour of other forms of new energy sources, including natural gas, wind and solar. Is that one cent too much to have a resilient, reliable power source for Nebraska?
We’ve seen what happens when nuclear gets overlooked. Omaha Public Power District’s Fort Calhoun plant and Nebraska Public Power District’s Cooper Nuclear Station accounted for about a quarter of Nebraska’s net generation capabilities before Fort Calhoun was shut down in 2016. The shut down was nearly two decades ahead of schedule, a casualty of market conditions that failed to account for long-term reliability and energy needs. Hundreds of skilled jobs were lost. Our energy safety net shrank.
And just a few years later, that decision looked shortsighted as the grid buckled under pressure. To avoid repeating that mistake, policymakers should ensure that energy markets properly value reliability and resilience.
As 26 House Republicans made clear in a late April letter to congressional leadership, protecting the federal nuclear production tax credit (PTC) is one way to do so. It has proven a huge help in incentivizing the development of nuclear power at a time when NPPD is exploring options. For Nebraska, the credit helps create and protect hundreds of high-paying, skilled jobs, generating local tax revenue and sustaining a stable source of affordable power.
Another step Congress could take is expanding investment incentives for next-generation technologies like small modular reactors (SMRs). These compact, scalable reactors can serve Nebraska’s rural areas and industrial parks where large traditional plants aren’t practical, offering flexibility and grid stability. Policies like the Advanced Nuclear Production Credit and bipartisan permitting reform proposals can help accelerate local deployment.
U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., has advocated for nuclear’s role in America’s energy future on the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee, where it helps Nebraska to have a voice in ensuring that our state’s long-term energy interests remain protected.
Nebraska’s energy future isn’t just about keeping the lights on. It’s about protecting lives during extreme weather, powering our farms and factories and anchoring high-skilled jobs in our communities. If we want to avoid another round of blackouts, we should encourage policies that keep every reliable tool in the toolbox — including nuclear.

A federal judge heard arguments this week on a Georgia law aimed at restricting social media use for minors and requiring Georgians to confirm their age before viewing adult websites.
Judge Amy Totenberg of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia announced at the Tuesday hearing that she will determine soon whether to hear more evidence regarding a lawsuit by a group called NetChoice to stop the law. NetChoice represents various internet-based services, including powerful businesses like Google and Meta, as well as smaller companies like online journal site Dreamwidth Studios. On the same day, a Florida judge blocked sections of a similar Florida law.
Children under the age of 16 would need parental consent to open social media accounts under the new Georgia law, which is set to go into effect July 1.
NetChoice filed a lawsuit in May seeking to prevent that from happening. The companies claim the rules violate young people’s First Amendment rights, as well as place unnecessary burdens on social media companies. Attorneys also argued the revised rules strip away some of the flexibility of parents monitoring what online sites their children are accessing.
Jeremy Maltz, an attorney representing NetChoice in the lawsuit, argued at Tuesday’s court hearing that many people using online websites affected by the Georgia law would consider it an invasion of privacy if they had to use sensitive information to create an account.
The plaintiffs argue that adults could face a burden if companies require them to potentially give companies driver licenses, banking or credit card information or use facial recognition software in order to access user-generated online sites.
Data breaches and other cyber security threats could be increased by the new age guidelines, Maltz said.
“We know people are going to have to provide some sort of information to access protected speech,” he said.
And despite the law exempting educational, public safety, and professional networking platforms, Martz said it would also create new verification hurdles even for innocuous sites such as college football and recipe message boards.
“This bill targets minors at the places where minors go to engage in free speech,” Maltz said.
Republican state lawmakers push for Georgia law to require proof of adulthood to view adult websites

Georgia lawmakers passed SB 351 in 2024 with bipartisan support. Logan Winkles, a state deputy attorney general, said that social media is designed to drive engagement and promote addiction, and the intent of legislators in passing the law was to protect children from adult bad actors online.
“Everyone agrees that social media poses some risk to children,” Winkles said.
NetChoice successfully overturned similar laws in Arkansas and Ohio after arguing they unfairly censored free speech on online platforms.
What’s my age again?
The bill requires social media companies to make commercially reasonable efforts to verify the age of their users, which can be done through methods including banking and credit card accounts, facial and fingerprint recognition software scanning.
The Age Verification Providers Association, which supports third-party age verification businesses, reports that about a dozen states have passed laws restricting or requiring parents to consent to minors accessing social media. In several states, including Arkansas, California and Ohio, court orders have been issued to block the provisions of the law.
As of May, the age verification group listed Georgia among the 24 states that have passed laws requiring age verification to access online pornography.
Opponents say such laws could create privacy concerns and prevent people from accessing constitutionally protected speech.
Winkles said at Tuesday’s hearing that legislators and Gov. Brian Kemp backed the law to protect more kids and teens from social media sites that lead to higher rates of bullying and mental health problems such as depression and that technology can estimate a person’s age without revealing their identity.
“What we know is there are many other ways to verify ID other than showing government ID,” Winkles said.
But Totenberg questioned the verification processes.
“It doesn’t seem very precise,” Totenberg said. “It’s a highly subjective standard and I’m not sure what it ultimately means.”
The law allows parents and guardians to file complaints with the attorney general office if they believe a company isn’t complying with age verification. Violations of the law may result in a fine of up to $2,500 per violation.
Pending U.S. Supreme Court age restriction ruling
On Tuesday, federal Judge Mark Walker of the northern district of Florida blocked sections of Florida’s law banning children under 14 from having social media accounts and requiring parents’ approval for teens as old as 16 while expressing concerns about social media’s adverse effects on children.
Georgia attorneys contend that the state’s new social media rules stand up to legal scrutiny and differ from states like Florida, which limited companies’ ability to control user-posted content. Right wing officials from several states have expressed concerns about social media companies blocking conservative viewpoints.
John Acevedo, an Emory University constitutional law professor, pointed out that when it’s pornography, there has been a legal history showing a legitimate interest in protecting children.
“Really, it’s not controversial to put an age requirement in, but the controversy is the manner in which the age requirement is implemented,” he said Wednesday. “Conversely, in social media there’s a controversy over whether we should even limit social media at all to any age group.”

Casper residents showed up in force to oppose a mining operation that they say could cause economic and recreational harm.
The post State board rejects renewal of contested gravel leases at base of Casper Mountain appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE —Prism Logistics suffered another blow Thursday to the company’s gravel mining plans near the base of Casper Mountain when the State Board of Land Commissioners voted not to renew six of the company’s leases in the area.
The denial comes after the Natrona County Commission voted two days earlier to advance a policy limiting heavy truck traffic on certain county roads, including Coates Road, the only way to access the lands Prism Logistics had leased.
Prism Logistics CEO Kyle True argued that county road blocks to the gravel operation violate the Wyoming Constitution. Besides battling to keep its leases, True and Prism are seeking a declaratory judgement in a lawsuit the company filed against Natrona County for using zoning regulations to halt its operations on state land. Natrona County Commissioner Dave North defended his elected board’s actions at Thursday’s meeting in Cheyenne.
The community’s reaction to the mining proposal, including the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance’s petition to block the pit, shows there are just some pieces of land that are important enough to people to merit protection, North said.

“I’m not saying that we need to know every lease that goes on, on every piece of state property, but there are some that are more critical to us and that is a prime example of that,” North said. “The number of people we have that utilize this for recreational purposes — there’s a lot of them.”
North made his case to the Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners, which includes Gov. Mark Gordon, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Treasurer Curt Meier and Auditor Kristi Racines. The board unanimously approved the leases in 2023 on a consent agenda without discussion, commissioners admitted in public meetings in 2024.
Racines made the motion to reject Prism’s request to renew six of the eight leases on the basis that Prism did not move forward in adequate time with licensing and permits from the Department of Environmental Quality and Office of State Lands and Investments. Gray and Degenfelder voted in favor of that motion.
Gordon, having already counted the votes necessary to deny the renewal, did not vote. The one dissenting voice, Meier, argued that the approximately 20,000 or so signatures on the petition to block the gravel operation were still a minority voice impeding what could be a great economic opportunity for the county and state.
“You figure maybe 20% or 25% of the people of Natrona County are making the decision, not only for Natrona County, but for the state,” Meier said. “Every time this board goes up against one, we know there’s two more coming. Converse County is going to pull the same stuff on wind. Niobrara County is going to pull the same stuff on wind.”
Turning away from these opportunities is going to keep poor communities poor, take away funding opportunities for public instruction and, all the while, pit neighbor against neighbor, Meier said.
“We have to think about Wyoming. We have to think that we have a culture here,” Meier said. “If we ignore who we are, we are destined to do the wrong thing again and again and again. I’d like to do the right thing together, but that’s not going to happen today.”

While red tape ultimately amounted to the final nail in the coffin for True’s hopes regarding his leases, Casper residents, mostly representatives of the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance, flooded the public comment period of the meeting with a laundry list of other environmental, cultural and health-related concerns.
Some opponents of the gravel pit, such as nearby landowner and former Casper City Engineer Jason Knopp, argued that any repair or mitigation work Prism may do after the fact to provide Coates Road residents with fresh water would be ineffective. For example, Knopp’s ranch relies on a trench to direct water flow to his ranching operation that would be cut off by the gravel pit.
“There’s absolutely not a way you could actually mine this to not change the contours or the flow of that water that go from point A to point B,” Knopp said. “It’s not really actually possible.”
Gray also raised questions over the company’s violation of a regulation stipulating that an industrial disturbance should be 300 feet from any water. True said that violation was remediated and shouldn’t be considered in the decision to renew the leases.

“It’s our position that there was no live water. We went out there and there were dry creek beds,” True said. “We were not within 300 feet, when we dug those test holes, of a stream. We went back after those allegations had been made, and we looked and conditions had changed and there was live water.”
An Office of State Lands and Investments field inspection found Prism dug one of its 18 exploratory,13-foot-deep holes within 167 feet of the flowing stream.
“OSLI considers activities that are contrary to a standard stipulation the Board hasconditioned a lease upon to be a default of the lease terms,” a board document stated.
However, when Prism was served a 30-day notice to remedy the violation or have its lease revoked, it appeared to have already done so.
Later during public comment, Coates Road area resident Paulette Bray said she drives over the creek twice a day for work and it is perennially full.
“The water flows all the time. It doesn’t matter if it’s winter or summer or spring, it is always flowing,” Bray said.
North added that violations now don’t bode well for compliance with regulations in the future.
“If you violate your exploration permit right off the bat — which is the most simple — then you’ve got other problems,” North said.
Another concern was the loss of recreational opportunities in the area. Maria Katherman, a biology and botany instructor at Casper College, praised the Coates Road area for its unique biology and utility as a giant hands-on teaching tool within a short drive of campus.
“I’ve had so many students come up to me in the grocery store or in town or whatever and they say, ‘You know, I still go back to those state sections,’ or they say, ‘I decided to be a biology major, and it wasn’t because of your lectures. It was from those times in the state sections out there,'” Katherman said.
Additional concerns, including how the churning up of soil would encourage noxious weed growth; how higher-altitude industrial activity would impact Casper Mountain views and how outdoor tourism might be dampened all contributed to a clear message from Casper that a gravel pit at that specific location is not welcome. There were no public comments in favor of the operation.
When the idea was raised to pursue a recreational land use lease on the state parcels, Treasurer Meir compared many of the residents’ concerns to ‘not in my backyard talk.’

Now that leases for six of the eight parcels have not been renewed, Casper residents have the opportunity to find another use for the area. Auditor Racines implored members of the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance to make their own proposal to the state before another interested party jumps at the chance.
“A gravel mine will not be the last thing proposed on this set of state lands,” Racines said.
Casper residents haven’t necessarily won anything and can’t call it a day, Rancines said, making a dusting-of-the-hands motion.
“I do think that the community of Casper, at least some of the folks in this room,  some of you very much understand state lands, have probably learned a lot through this process,” Rancines said. So residents should be aware, “anything could end up there.”
Because only six of the eight leases originally granted to Prism Logistics were approved in June 2023 — with the remaining two granted in October 2023 — there are still some areas near Coates Road that Prism has not yet lost.
Parties on both sides of the Casper gravel fight are awaiting rulings in two separate cases. Even if the judge comes back with a decision affirming the Natrona County commissioners’ actions, True has indicated he will likely appeal the decision to the Wyoming Supreme Court.

Yet here we are,","Connecticut environmentalists raised their reusable water bottles for a toast when Public Act 19-117 was passed six years ago, phasing out single-use plastic bags at checkouts.
The law was structured in two phases: a mandatory 10-cent charge on plastic bags from the summer of 2019 to 2021, and then an outright ban. The CT League of Conservation Voters called the passage “a bloody battle,” hard-won against opposition from retailers, the plastic lobby, and conservative lawmakers characterizing the ten cent charge as a tax.
In spite of the noise, the bill was ratified and became enshrined in the Connecticut General Statutes § 22a-246a(c): “On and after July 1, 2021, no owner or operator of a store shall provide or sell a single-use checkout bag to a customer.”
Here we are, nearly four years later, and I’m still offered a plastic bag nearly every time I visit an establishment that serves food.
So, what happened? 
For starters, the Governor’s Office suspended the bag fee between March and June of 2020 as a measure to protect retail workers from handling reusable bags during COVID-19. When the ban itself rolled around, the focus was on grocery store chains – and to their credit, it seems to have stuck with them. Although the law does not require reporting once the ban is in place, similar bans in New Jersey, Vermont, Philadelphia, Pa.; Portland, Ore.; and Santa Barbara, Calif., are estimated to save an average of 296 bags per person per year. Cumulative pressure from all the jurisdictions that have adopted bag bans across the country have surely influenced these large chains to comply.
The problem comes in with the smaller retailers, who don’t have strategists and compliance officers at their national headquarters planning for the ban. What I’ve experienced over the past years is that many have reverted back to using plastic bags – delis, bodegas, takeout establishments, etc. Of note, the law is clear in its definition of “store” that it applies to any retailer, regardless of size, that sells physical goods in Connecticut.
But to whom does it fall to enforce this law? During the two year phase-out that required store owners to charge a fee for plastic bags, retailers were required to report to the CT Department of Revenue Services (DRS). In that case, DRS was clearly the agency tasked with enforcement. They created a reporting form, published guidance, and even put up a Q&A on their website. But now that there is no longer money changing hands, DRS appears to be out of the equation. 
The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) or perhaps the Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) would be likely candidates to oversee this law — DEEP especially, given that the statute falls within the chapter on Environmental Protection. Yet both departments’ webpages remain silent on the issue.
The reason I bring this up instead of leaving well enough alone is the same reason so many environmental advocates fought for this ban in the first place. Plastic bags are a cancer so ubiquitous, we’ve forgotten how dangerous they are. So let’s talk about it. Here are three reasons we need to do something about single use plastic bags… again.
1) Public Health: When plastic products break down, they leave behind microplastics in our air, water, and food. The majority of humans and many, many animals – even those in remote environs – have microplastics in their system. These insidious particles are very poorly understood in terms of their impact on our health, but studies have found correlations to subfertility, organ damage, and cancer.
2) Wildlife: (*Note: the webpage linked in the next sentence contains disturbing imagery.) The well-documented harm that plastic pollution causes wildlife – from ingestion to entanglement – is exacerbated by rampant consumption of single-use bags. Moreover, because plastic is made from crude oil, enormous swaths of habitat become collateral damage, forcing animals into dangerous roadways or stressing them to the point of population decline. The Bureau of Land Management reports that over 12 million acres of public land are currently used for oil and gas drilling, in part to keep up with our addiction to plastic.
3) The waste crisis: Over 40% of waste produced in Connecticut is shipped out of state, because we have run out of room to bury or burn our trash. This capacity shortage has led to higher tipping fees (price per ton to get rid of waste), hauling costs, and greenhouse gas emissions. Connecticut desperately needs to cut its waste generation, either through source reduction (make less trash in the first place) or diversion (send it to be used for something other than burying or burning). It can be difficult to see the financial impact of these rising costs given that they are buried in our property taxes, but the truth is that the average fee to dispose of one ton of trash went from around $60 in 2010 to around $110 in 2024.
And here’s the microplastic in the wound – bag bans across the United States have been hugely effective in reducing waste, just like we promised. A 2024 research report found that “In the last 20 years, 12 states covering more than one-quarter of the U.S. population have prioritized reducing plastic waste by banning plastic bags.” The report states that in jurisdictions with bans, billions of plastic bags have been prevented from entering circulation (see pg. 17), plastic bag litter on beaches has gone down 33% – 50% (pg. 10), and one city even saw a 48% reduction of plastic bags in its residential waste stream (pg. 10). These stats have direct relationships to lower municipal costs and better environmental outcomes, as explained above.
I wish I had a clearer call to action to resolve this. Even if the Office of Legislative Research or one of the legal eagles at the state could clarify which agency is responsible for enforcement, I can already hear the canned response we would get: “Due to a lack of staff and resources, limited capacity is available to devote to enforcement.” 
And even if the law was perfectly enforced, the language itself contains loopholes – a single-use plastic bag is defined as having a thickness of 4 mil or less, which might explain why the small mom & pop grocery store down the street from me switched to sturdier single use plastic bags and continues to give them out for free.
For now, the best we can do is support the establishments that respect the ban, bring reusable bags everywhere we go, and contact state leadership about the lack of enforcement. Because this ban matters – for our wallets, for wildlife, and for the wellbeing of Connecticut.

We’re here. We’re fighting for you. And we’re not going anywhere.","When I first ran for office, I was one of only two openly gay members of the Connecticut General Assembly. Today, I’m proud to serve as co-chair of a growing LGBTQ+ Caucus, one that’s not only increasing in number but in impact.
That growth matters. Because while we gather this June to mark Pride Month, we do so at a time when LGBTQ+ rights, especially the rights of trans people, are under coordinated attack across the country. Under the current federal administration, we’ve seen efforts to erase LGBTQ+ history from classrooms, target trans youth in healthcare and sports, and target our identities to distract from real issues.

State Rep. Raghib Allie-Brennan
Connecticut has chosen a different path. We’re showing what it looks like when a state leads with dignity and action, not division.
This year, we passed bipartisan legislation that prohibits discrimination against LGBTQ+ residents in long-term care facilities, ensuring our elders can live openly and receive the care they deserve without hiding who they are. No one should be forced back into the closet just to access basic services.
We also protected funding for the LGBTQ+ Justice and Opportunity Network, which provides grants to LGBTQ+ nonprofit, healthcare, and advocacy organizations across the state. The network collaborates with local affinity groups and advocates to inform the legislature on the evolving needs of our community. I’m especially proud of this program, because it was the first bill I introduced and took to the House floor back in 2019.

But we didn’t stop there. In a year when states are criminalizing gender-affirming care and restricting access to abortion, we passed legislation to shield providers in Connecticut who offer this care. This sends a clear message: if you’re under attack in your home state, Connecticut will stand with you.
And while other states are banning books and threatening librarians, we’re doing the opposite. We advanced legislation to protect public libraries, librarians, and the freedom to access information without intimidation or censorship. We did this because defending free expression and the right to learn is foundational to a healthy democracy and to a truly inclusive society.
For me, Pride is deeply personal. I spent 18 years in the closet, raised by an immigrant father and an Irish Catholic mother. That combination came with its own set of challenges, but today, after many difficult conversations and a lot of growth, they’re two of my biggest supporters. I’m grateful for that, and I know not everyone is so fortunate.
And even within our own community, we don’t always get it right. I’m a gay man, I don’t know what it’s like to be trans or nonbinary, and sometimes I get it wrong. We all do. But we’ve got to give each other the space and grace to keep learning, and to keep showing up.
That’s true for allies, too. Allyship isn’t seasonal. It doesn’t stop at a pin, a post, or a parade. It’s about using your voice when it matters, especially when it’s uncomfortable. It’s about backing up your values with real action, not just words.
To every LGBTQ+ person across Connecticut and beyond, especially those feeling exhausted, afraid, or unseen right now, I want you to know: you’re not alone. We’re here. We’re fighting for you. And we’re not going anywhere.
We’ve come too far, and the stakes are too high, to go quiet now.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The “Downing Brothers” — Chicago firefighter twins known for their HGTV show on real estate investment — were in Omaha for a brief appearance and committed to an encore visit they hope will electrify local efforts aimed at boosting affordable housing.
In town to speak Thursday at a conference, Anthony and Anton Downing toured a few housing sites and visited with nonprofit leaders working in the industry.

During the event luncheon, they also clicked with Omaha’s Mayor-elect John Ewing Jr., a fellow first responder and affordable housing advocate who helped persuade them to return. 
Beckoned to the stage by Ewing, the twins in a sort of spontaneous moment agreed to come back and work with the Omaha Municipal Land Bank on a still-to-be-determined project.
“It’s important to shine a big light on government and nonprofit organizations whose work is in affordable housing,” Anthony said later, in explaining the decision.
“We’re connectors,” said Anton, who hopes the future project can arouse funding and other opportunities, including perhaps an Omaha role in one of their shows.
Omaha’s alliance with the Downing Brothers represented the kind of networking and relationship-building that conference organizers hoped for during the two-day Reignite2Unite development symposium, which aimed to provide emerging developers and others with tools and resources to turn vacant properties into community assets.
 Assurance from HUD head

Hosting the event that drew more than 250 people to the Marriott at the Capitol District was Omaha Municipal Land Bank, Spark CDI and Front Porch Investments. 
Workshops featured other national and local experts who shared tips on such topics as access to capital, innovative policies and construction that promote integrated and affordable housing, land banks and community land trusts.
Joe Mitchell, newly appointed administrator for the Great Plains four-state region of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which includes Nebraska, also spoke and assured the group that the Omaha HUD office was not slated for closure. He said he’d like to see developers have more access to funding and capital.
Big demand for affordable housing calls for big approach in suburban Nebraska

During the luncheon, Ewing — who moves into the mayor’s office Monday, after defeating three-term Mayor Jean Stothert in May — told the crowd he is a longtime supporter of affordable housing efforts, having served on boards such as Habitat for Humanity Omaha. The former Douglas County treasurer said homeownership is a priority issue he often talked about on the campaign trail and wants to promote as mayor. 
Ewing recalled the pride he, his siblings and parents felt when he was 15 years old and the family bought their first home. The initials carved into the cement by the Ewing kids remain nearly 50 years later at the house where his parents still live.
“That was one of the most motivating, inspiring things that happened in my life,” said Ewing, adding that homeownership offers hope.
The new mayor said he wants Omahans to have the opportunity to own homes.
“Not only does it inspire our young people, it allows families to build generational wealth,” he said.
He referred to something former Omaha City Councilwoman Brenda Council, who was in the audience, once told him: “To a young person without hope, consequences mean absolutely nothing.”
 Not a one and done situation

The Downings said they are unsure of the project they’ll help tackle in Omaha but said they are committed to a return. 
“This is not a one and done situation,” Anthony said.
The twin brothers, age 43, star on “Backyard Bar Wars,” on truTV. Raised on the south side of Chicago by a Bahamian mother and an African-American father, they headed to the Bahamas after their Omaha stay, where they are working on a housing project.

The brothers said they still fight fires in Chicago, and began real estate ventures after witnessing the need for community development while on that job. 
Through their “Homecoming with the Downing Brothers” podcast, TV and a comic-style super heroes book about real estate, they said they stir conversations about real estate investment that didn’t previously exist in many Black households.
During their talk at the conference, the Downings recommended that communities launch programs early, teaching young teens about investing and financial literacy. 
Leslie Smith, executive director of the Omaha Municipal Land Bank, said organizers chose the duo as keynote speakers because of their motivation and advice.
“They speak of a call for action — to galvanize resources available to us — and they do it from a practical lens,” Smith said.
 Award winners 

Several developers were recognized Thursday with awards:
Outstanding Emerging Developer: Ernesto and Penny Marquez of the Marquez Co., for their Pinkney Street Duplex rental project financed with a Spark Capital rehab loan. 
Community Impact Award: Omaha Economic Development Corp., for The Larimore at 3483 Larimore Ave. The 45-unit repurposed commercial building, aided by sources including public tax-increment financing and low-income housing tax credits, is for seniors that make 30% to 60% of the area’s median income.
Public-Private Partnership Award: Canopy South, Omaha Housing Authority and City of Omaha, for the first phase (92 units, mixed-income residential) of the Southside Terrace-Indian Hill Choice Neighborhoods Transformation Plan.
Community Advocate Award: Jeff Spiehs, an urban planner and real estate developer focused on community engagement. His involvement includes being a faculty member of Spark’s Developer Academy and ChangeMaker programs.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)It’s suddenly a very crowded race in the Democratic primary for Colorado’s most competitive congressional seat.
One day after Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young announced his bid, former teachers union president Amie Baca-Oehlert became the latest Democratic hopeful in the 8th Congressional District, a key battleground in the nationwide battle for control of the House of Representatives.
Baca-Oehlert, who served as president of the Colorado Education Association from 2018 to 2024, launched her campaign in front of a crowd of about 50 supporters Thursday evening at Adams City High School, where she got her first teaching job.

“When I look at Congress, I don’t see people like me,” Baca-Oehlert said. “I don’t see enough teachers, Latinos, moms, union members or middle class Americans. What I do see is a broken system, a system that caters to the wealthy and well-connected, where plenty of politicians are looking out for themselves and their billionaire donors.”
Drawn by an independent redistricting commission in 2021, the 8th District includes parts of Denver’s northern suburbs as well as more rural areas in southern Weld County. Four in 10 residents of the district are Latino.
The seat is currently held by U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican who unseated former Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo by a margin of fewer than 2,500 votes in the 2024 election. Despite representing one of the nation’s most evenly divided congressional districts, Evans has remained a steadfast supporter of President Donald Trump’s historically extreme anti-immigration agenda, his chaotic efforts to launch a global trade war and a sweeping GOP budget bill that would cut $625 billion from Medicaid.
“Nearly all of us are hurting right now, because of the fear, division and economic turmoil that Trump has created,” Baca-Oehlert said. “And Evans is literally standing by — standing beside his friends like Lauren Boebert, to promote this disastrous agenda, and not fight against it.”
Boebert, a staunch Trump supporter, is the Republican representative of Colorado’s 4th Congressional District.
Caraveo has launched a bid to win back her seat in 2026, joining a Democratic primary that also includes Young, state Reps. Manny Rutinel of Commerce City and Shannon Bird of Westminster.
Baca-Oehlert’s campaign launch featured endorsements from Adams County Commissioner Emma Pinter and former state Reps. Judy Solano and Joe Salazar.
“I know all the candidates that are running, I know all of them,” Solano told the crowd. “But Amy’s the one.”

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Senate approved a roughly $15.9 billion two-year state budget Thursday.
The Senate passed House Bill 1 — the budget — and House Bill 2 — accompanying legislation that adjusts policy necessary to implement the budget — on votes of 15-9 and 14-10, respectively. Leading up to the second vote, Democrats proposed a series of amendments to remove or curtail Republican priorities, such as the voucher-like education freedom account program, and provide funding for their priorities, such as the renewable energy fund. All the amendments were voted down by the Republican majority.
The Senate’s budget vote comes two months after the House passed its version of the budget. In April, the Republican-controlled House approved a roughly $15.5 billion budget. The Senate’s budget marks a more optimistic outlook and cuts state services less harshly, though it is a far cry from the larger budget Gov. Kelly Ayotte requested.
The House, pessimistic about how much revenue the state would receive from business tax revenues, made heavy reductions to state services. That includes entirely eliminating the Office of the Child Advocate, the Housing Appeals Board, the Commission for Human Rights, and the State Commission on Aging. In their budget, the Senate, which was slightly more bullish about tax revenues, restored those agencies, but reduced them to save money. For example, the House had laid off the entirety of the Office of Child Advocate’s staff of nine; the Senate restored the office, but eliminated four positions.
The Senate also rolled back the House’s layoffs in the Department of Corrections from 190 positions to 60 civilian positions, many of which are currently vacant. It also set aside more money to a settlement fund created in response to a massive abuse scandal at the state-run Youth Development Center, in which courts are compelling them to pay settlements to victims. The Senate also reversed a 3% cut to Medicaid reimbursement rates made by the House. However, there were some places where the Senate cut more deeply than the House, such as special education in public schools and $32 million of general “back of the budget” cuts that gives Ayotte’s administration the flexibility to decide where to cut.
The House and Senate are now set to enter a process called committees of conference, in which they’ll hash out the differences between their two budget proposals. They’ll have two weeks to merge their budget proposals into one before their deadline to send a budget to Ayotte’s desk. Ayotte, the state’s Republican governor, will then have the choice of whether to sign, veto, or allow the budget to pass without her signature.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SenateDebatingBudget-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 22:03:51.274349

Joseph Roemmich, most recently the warden of the Cibola County Correctional Center in Milan, New Mexico, will begin his service in South Dakota June 24.
“Joseph has extensive experience working in the corrections field in a variety of correctional and detention settings,” Secretary of Corrections Kellie Wasko said in a press release. “His work in all areas of security operations as a warden, assistant warden, chief of security, investigator, and officer will be valuable as he helps our corrections staff develop and incorporate modern correctional practices.”
Tumultuous period at penitentiary culminates in warden’s departure

Roemmich has been warden of the Milan facility for a little over a year. The jail is operated by CoreCivic, the for-profit company formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America. The company website says Roemmich joined the CoreCivic after several years serving in law enforcement in California.
The site says the company is “the nation’s largest owner of partnership correctional, detention and residential reentry facilities, and one of the largest prison operators in the United States.”
Milan is a village in western New Mexico with a population of about 2,500 people, located about 80 miles west of Albuquerque. The CoreCivic website says the Milan jail’s main customers are the U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Cibola County.
South Dakota DOC’s press release on Roemmich’s hiring says that in addition to his correctional service, he has 11 years of law enforcement experience.
“I look forward to working with penitentiary staff to help positively affect the safety and security of the staff, our offenders, and the people of South Dakota,” Roemmich said in the release.
DOC Director of Prison Operations Amber Pirraglia had been serving as interim warden of the penitentiary since the departure of Teresa Bittinger. 
Bittinger resigned near the end of a troubled year for the facility in Sioux Falls. March 2024 saw two rounds of unrest at the penitentiary, which followed the temporary shutdown of tablet-based communications between inmates and their families for an investigation the corrections department has never fully explained. Former Gov. Kristi Noem, now head of ICE for the Trump administration, said at the time that inmates had been using their tablets for “nefarious purposes.”
Private employers say they were pushed out of state prisons

Just before her departure, Bittinger oversaw a lockdown that lasted more than a month and saw prison officials tear down multiple sweat lodges on the prison grounds, a move that drew scrutiny from Oglala Sioux Tribal President Frank Star Comes Out.
Bittinger’s tenure also coincided with the controversial loss of Metal Craft Industries, a private company that spent more than 20 years employing maximum security inmates at a metal fabrication shop inside the penitentiary’s Jameson Annex. The company’s owners say they were forced out in spite of serving to better the lives of inmates by paying market wages – one of its former inmate employees paid off his restitution and had enough in the bank to put a down payment on a home upon his release – and by serving customers across the region. 
When asked about the situation by lawmakers in multiple hearings last year, DOC Secretary Wasko said the company had taken advantage of cheap inmate labor and accused Metal Craft of covering up contraband. 
Department of Corrections pledges to rebuild sweat lodges dismantled during prison lockdown

Bittinger, who resigned one day after a closed-door meeting with lawmakers, was the third penitentiary warden in fewer than three years. Former DOC administrator Doug Clark served as interim warden in 2021 before the state hired Dan Sullivan, who served less than two years before being replaced by Bittinger, who began as an interim warden and took the permanent position in April 2023.
The leaders began to rotate through after a Noem-initiated shakeup in 2021 led to the ouster of several long-serving prison administrators, including then-warden Darin Young.
Bittinger had served as warden of the entire penitentiary complex. Upon her departure, Sec. Wasko told the public she intended to hire separate wardens for the penitentiary and the Jamison Annex. The DOC has yet to name a Jameson warden. 
A prison construction workgroup voted in April to replace the penitentiary, which was built in 1881, but not the Jameson Annex, a separate building erected in the 1990s.
The group voted this week in Pierre to ditch the original site for that replacement, in rural Lincoln County near Harrisburg, to cap construction costs for a replacement prison at $600 million, and to study the feasibility of sites near Worthing, Mitchell, and on land near Sioux Falls already owned by the DOC.

Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, defends his bill to ban assault-style weapons during debate on the House floor on June 5, 2025. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island House of Representatives on Thursday approved much-anticipated legislation banning the sale and manufacturing of a range of semiautomatic weapons in Rhode Island starting in July 2026.
The 43-28 vote came after nearly five hours of debate and nine failed attempts by House Republicans to change the bill sponsored by Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat. All 10 Republicans voted against the bill, along with 17 Democrats and the chamber’s lone independent. 
“We have an obligation to protect the community we live in,” Knight said on the House floor. “Mass shootings are a real problem — it could happen here and we have a chance to minimize the chances.”



Who voted ‘no’
Twenty-three state representatives voted against the assault-style weapons ban bill.
Opponents included all 10 chamber Republicans: House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale, Richard Fascia, Marie Hopkins, George Nardone, Brian Newberry, Christopher Paplauskas, David Place, Robert Quattrocchi, Sherry Roberts and Paul Santucci
Another 17 Democrats also opposed the ban: Samuel Azzinaro, Jacquelyn Baginski, David Bennett, Stephen Casey, Gregory Costantino, Megan Cotter, Deborah Fellela, Brian Kennedy, Charlene Lima, Thomas Noret, William O’Brien, Ramon Perez, Robert Phillips, Earl Read, Patricia Serpa, and Joseph Solomon. Also opposed was Rep. Jon Brien, the only independent.



In introducing Knight’s legislation to the floor, House Judiciary Chairman Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, said the legislation is justified if just one life is saved by banning assault-style weapons.
“One of the things I learned as a prosecutor many years ago was there’s no undoing someone being dead,” Craven said. “There’s no retreat from that — dead is dead.”
But opponents argued the bill’s language is too broad and would not reduce gun violence. Many said it would criminalize responsible gun owners.
“This piece of legislation’s true goal, as evidenced by its language, is clouded at best and disingenuous at worst,” said Rep. Arthur Corvese, a North Providence Democrat. 
The legislation, which was already revised before advancing out of committee earlier this week, would prohibit the sale and manufacturing of assault-style shotguns, handguns, and rifles beginning July 1, 2026. Weapons are defined as any semiautomatic firearm that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least one attachment such as stocks, pistol grips, and barrel shrouds. Certain .22 caliber rimfire rifles and Olympic-style target pistols would still be allowed.
Assault-style firearms purchased before July 2026 would also be exempt from the legislation, along with weapons passed down through family.
Violators of the proposed ban would face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and forfeiting their assault-style weapons.
Gun owners could voluntarily register their weapons with police to receive a certificate of possession — a provision that has drawn the ire of opponents.
“If you are found to be in possession of one of these firearms and do not have this voluntary certificate you are handcuffed, you are printed, you are booked, you are arraigned, you go to pre-trial, you go to a trial,” said House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale, a Foster Republican. “After maybe two years you can provide proof you owned the firearm before July 1, 2026.”
Chippendale also argued that the bill’s language is unclear on where gun owners could use their grandfathered weapons, saying that it would bar hunting. Rep. Joseph McNamara, a Warwick Democrat, said weapons subject to the proposed ban are not meant for hunting.
“If you need an AK-47 to hunt ducks, maybe you should take up bowling,” he said.
House Republicans introduced nine floor amendments to address their issues with Knight’s bill, but each were rejected.
Democratic Reps. Mia Ackerman of Cumberland, John Edwards of Tiverton, Raymond Hull of Providence, and Alex Marszalkowski of Cumberland were not present for the vote. Rep. Kathleen Fogarty, a South Kingstown Democrat, voted by proxy in favor of the bill.
The policy now rests with the Senate for consideration. 
Companion legislation introduced by Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, has 23 additional sponsors, including Senate President Valarie Lawson. DiPalma’s bill was heard by the Senate Committee on Judiciary on May 14, where it remains under review.
Three Democrats who serve on the committee voiced opposition to the proposal during the initial hearing on DiPalma’s bill. Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat and federal firearms dealer, has also said he does not support  banning assault-style weapons as drafted. 
Knight’s changes have not swayed his stance, Ciccone said in an interview Thursday.
Lawson remains committed to seeing the proposal hit the Senate floor, chamber spokesperson Greg Paré said in an email.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s annual energy conference included visits from three of the Trump administration’s top officials, but it didn’t include any major developments on the financing of the proposed 800-mile trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline.
U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, traveled to the North Slope and to Anchorage this week during a visit that coincided with the fourth annual Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference.
Despite the conference’s name, oil and gas development took top billing, with all three officials saying that they hope to increase oil and gas production in Alaska under the direction of President Donald Trump.
“President Trump wants to see the flows through (the trans-Alaska Pipeline System) doubled,” Wright said during a speech on the North Slope this week. “The oil is here. The discoveries are here. If we free Alaska and the people here (from regulation), we’re going to more than double the oil flow through the pipeline and build the big, beautiful twin, the natural gas pipeline, from the North Slope.”
Despite the week’s enthusiasm for the Alaska Liquefied Natural Gas pipeline, better known as AKLNG, it still isn’t clear who will pay for it to get built.
The natural gas pipeline and associated processing plants are expected to cost $38.7 billion, but that estimate was published in 2020, and it predates inflation-driven and tariff-driven cost increases under the Biden and Trump presidencies.
Energy developer Glenfarne, which is pursuing AKLNG on behalf of the state, announced this week that 50 firms had formally expressed interest in AKLNG contracts worth more than $115 billion. 
Those contracts include possible supply agreements — people interested in selling things to AKLNG for construction — as well as possible investors.
An expression of interest isn’t a firm commitment, and no investors said this week that they will back the project. Officials from Japan, Korea and other nations — possible customers for Alaska gas — visited the state this week but made no announcements.
Taiwan’s state-run energy company, CPC, signed a non-binding agreement in March stating that it would buy liquefied natural gas from Alaska and invest in the project.
As currently envisioned, AKLNG would be constructed in two phases — the first would be a pipeline from the North Slope to Fairbanks and Southcentral Alaska for domestic, in-Alaska gas customers.
The second phase would involve facilities and equipment needed to export gas overseas.
Glenfarne is expected to announce a go/no-go final investment decision on the first phase by the end of the year.
Speaking to NBC reporters in Prudhoe Bay, Burgum said that the U.S. military could be a key customer for the first phase of the project.
“They’re ready to sign on to take an offtake agreement from this pipeline to get gas to our super strategic, important bases across Alaska,” he said on CNBC.
Actually signing a customer agreement could make financing easier to come by.
“If you get the commercial offtakers for the gas, financing is pretty straightforward,” Wright told CNBC. 
Legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden allows $30 billion in federally guaranteed loans for the project.
This week, Wright told reporters in Anchorage that the U.S. Energy Department could make additional loans available.
“They’re going to get details of the project to come together, but I think it’s quite likely that you will see loan guarantees provided by the loan program office at the Department of Energy to build the pipeline part of that project,” he said.
Under the Biden administration, the DOE’s Loan Programs Office grew into a major financier for green-energy projects. The Trump Administration has halted most of that work, and Wright suggested that it could be redirected to the natural gas pipeline.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A bipartisan group of lawmakers released on Thursday the final draft of their plan to cut $270 million over the next two years from programs that serve the elderly and disabled.
The two-year, approximately $17 billion compromise human services budget will cut future spending on nursing homes and home care programs, though it will raise pay for nursing home and home care workers. The bill largely avoids pushing costs on to county governments, which was a core piece of the House plan.
The Department of Human Services currently accounts for around one-third of the state budget, and spending is expected to rapidly grow in the coming years as the population ages and the cost of providing care increases. The majority of the agency’s budget goes toward Medical Assistance, Minnesota’s Medicaid program. 
Agreeing on a DHS budget was one of the biggest hurdles lawmakers needed to clear before they reconvene for a special session to pass the remaining budget bills.
Legislative leaders and Gov. Tim Walz are aiming to hold a special session on Saturday, but there’s been no official announcement, and they’ve missed self-imposed deadlines before. If they don’t finish the budget by the end of June, large parts of state government will shut down. Some state workers have already received furlough notices.
Throughout the legislative process, leaders agreed to target DHS for cuts, though both chambers passed very different plans. The DFL-backed Senate budget focused on reducing payments to nursing homes; the House version pushed costs onto counties while cutting spending on programs that provide care to people with disabilities.
The compromise budget bill makes the following cuts over the next two years: 

$186 million by capping inflation adjustments for long-term care waivers, which pay for in-home care for people with disabilities, at the federal urban inflation rate (CPI-U) or 4%.
$51 million from changes to “rate exceptions,” higher-than-usual payments for the care of people with extraordinary needs. The bill would create new limits on what is covered by the rate exception, and introduce new paperwork requirements. 
Around $46 million by putting tighter limits on what Medical Assistance covers for day and unit based services, which help people with disabilities maintain life skills and participate in a community and activities. It also would cut pay for caretakers when they are sleeping on an overnight supervision shift.
$41 million from nursing homes by making a series of changes to how patients are classified, removing an incentive to create more single-bed rooms and capping some inflation adjustments. 

It also generates more than $56 million in savings by increasing yearly fees paid to the state by nursing homes, and also increasing a reimbursement rate that corresponds to the fees, which pushes some costs onto the federal government.
The budget spends money on raises for nursing home and other care workers ($88 million) and on setting up a new licensing and oversight system for autism service providers ($11 million), some of which are under investigation by the FBI on suspicion of fraud.
The bill does not include a House proposal that would have shifted more than $150 million in costs to counties to pay for rate exceptions.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250507_0817-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-05 20:05:00.559029

The company plans to pay the $150,000 fine by June 20.Clark is not the first attorney general to go after the company. Last summer, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha filed a complaint against UPP Global LLC — Unified Parking Partners’ parent company — accusing it of “a pattern of unfair and deceptive conduct including charging customers fees disguised as a ‘tax,’ charging junk ‘service fees,’ failing to disclose parking rates until customers have already parked, and issuing ‘citations’ that mimic government-issued parking tickets and falsely threaten consequences from the Division of Motor Vehicles.”United Parking Partners has faced criticism from Vermonters for years. In 2017, Seven Days wrote a column about the company’s potentially deceptive ticketing practices.When reached for comment, United Parking Partners spokesperson Bev Drivin said, “UPP is committed to complying with all applicable local laws and regulations.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)LEAVENWORTH — A Kansas district court barred CoreCivic Wednesday from reopening its shuttered prison until the company goes through Leavenworth’s development process to receive a special use permit.
Judge John Bryant, Leavenworth County District Court, was unconvinced by arguments from CoreCivic attorneys that the company was grandfathered into the city’s zoning codes and did not need a special use permit to hold U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees.
He ruled in favor of the city of Leavenworth, which had asked for a temporary restraining order to stop the reopening of CoreCivic’s prison, the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
After nearly two hours of arguments in front of a courtroom packed with Leavenworth city officials and community activists, Bryant made an immediate ruling. He said his decision was not affected by CoreCivic’s history in the community, which has been openly criticized by former employees, inmates and residents, and in submitted court documents.
The request for a restraining order was a procedural issue, he said.
“The posture of this case is a little bit different in that the city has acted here because CoreCivic has stated its intent to ignore or not give any effect to the March ‘25 administrative decision,” Bryant said, referring to the city’s requirement that CoreCivic get a special use permit before reopening.
Bryant said that if CoreCivic disagreed, company attorneys could have gone through the Kansas judicial review process to argue zoning decisions. Such a move needed to be made within 30 days, he said, and CoreCivic did not take that action.
 What’s next?

“We are reviewing the court’s decision and considering next steps,” said CoreCivic spokesman Steve Owen in response to emailed questions. “We maintain the position that our facility, which we’ve operated for almost 30 years, does not require a special use permit to care for detainees in partnership with ICE. We look forward to presenting our arguments to the court.”
He did not answer questions about whether the company is housing any ICE detainees in Leavenworth or what is happening at the facility, which had a parking lot full of cars on Wednesday.
Leavenworth city manager Scott Peterson was pleased with the court’s decision. Although CoreCivic could continue litigation on the issue, he said the company was welcome to go through the city’s planning and zoning process to get a special use permit.
Joseph Hatley, attorney for Leavenworth, said the next step today would be writing the temporary restraining order and then circulating it to all parties.
“If we have a disagreement about it, the judge can resolve the disagreement, but essentially it will say they cannot house detainees without a special use permit,” he said.
 Three months

The typical special use permit process in Leavenworth takes about three months, Peterson said, in part to allow time to set up public hearings to allow Leavenworth area residents to have input.
In its motion to the court asking for the temporary restraining order, the city’s attorneys laid out significant issues they had when CoreCivic previously operated a prison in Leavenworth. The national private prison company operated the Leavenworth Detention Center from 1986 to 2021, when CoreCivic’s federal contract was not renewed.
The city opened its petition with quotes from a 2021 court transcript. U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson called CoreCivic’s Leavenworth prison a “hell hole.”
“All that’s going on there and causing trauma to everybody – guards are being traumatized. Guards have been almost killed. Detainees are being traumatized with assaults and batteries, and not long ago a detainee was killed. So I’m well aware of the situation at CoreCivic and very troubled by it as well,” Robinson said at the time.

In the petition, the city also noted the Leavenworth Police Department had issues with CoreCivic in the final years before the prison closed, citing roadblocks when investigating violent crimes within the facility, lack of planning for major crises such as riots or hostage situations and difficulty getting access.
The city’s special use permitting process would allow the city to set guidelines that would address those situations, Peterson said.
“Cities generally have broad abilities to impose additional requirements on a special use permit, so long as they are applicable to the use that we’re discussing,” he said. “Obviously, property owners are protected in some regards in that we can’t make outlandish requirements.”
If CoreCivic would disagree with city requirements, Peterson added, they could then access the judicial review process to argue those points.
CoreCivic had initially applied for a special use permit in March but withdrew that application. Peterson said the process had begun and CoreCivic and city officials were meeting.
“I would note that with internal conversations the city was having with CoreCivic, we were in agreement with the things the city was going to propose in terms of protecting the city services moving forward,” he said.
In the hearing, CoreCivic attorney Taylor Hausmann said the company withdrew from those proceedings because the city did not schedule a hearing within a 60-day period, as required.
“It became clear to CoreCivic that there was not a cooperative relationship happening there, and thus CoreCivic fell back on its position that it was not required to have it (the special use permit), and that this was not going to work, to move together cooperatively,” she said.
City officials are adamant that the city is not stalling the prison’s reopening.
“From the perspective of the city, this was never about stopping something from happening,” said David Waters, an attorney for the city. “This is about following the city’s rules and regulations and going through those processes, giving everybody the same fair hearing that we afford all special use permits.”
 Community concerns

Esmie Tseng, spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, attended the hearing. She was pleased the judge heard the city’s concerns but is worried about what will happen in the future.
“I think that’s the core of the case,” she said. “There is a lot of distrust. And CoreCivic definitely hammered very hard on past conduct should not be an indicator of future conduct, but I don’t think we have to rely on past conduct.
We have cases across the country of CoreCivic’s current conduct that sort of speak to concerns about local distress, about their business practices, about shortcuts,” Tseng said.

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana lawmakers are trying to change the state constitution to wrestle power away from the Civil Service Commission to eliminate state worker protections and allow for the quick firing of thousands of employees for any reason, creating fear among critics that some dismissals could be politically motivated.  
Senate Bill 8, sponsored by Sen. Jay Morris. R-West Monroe, is nearing final passage in the Louisiana Legislature, though voters will get the final say on a constitutional amendment on a ballot that could have significant consequences for how state government operates.
Morris’ proposal would give state lawmakers power that currently rests with the Civil Service Commission, a seven-member independent review panel that oversees the hiring and firing of 28,000 “classified” state workers. The commission hears complaints from classified employees and appeals from any who want to contest their dismissal or demotion, affording them due process when it comes to discipline and terminations. 
In an interview Tuesday, Morris said his bill would let lawmakers “unclassify” state employees, removing them from the oversight of the commission. An unclassified employee does not have Civil Service protections and can be fired “at will” for no reason. The bill’s current version would also apply to local civil service workers such as municipal police and firefighters, but Morris said he intends to change his measure to exclude them and restrict it to only state employees. 
“If you believe in democracy or republicanism — [because] we’re a republic — then the Legislature should have some ability to alter how our civil service system works,” Morris said. “Right now we can’t do anything because the constitution prevents it.”
Some Democrats have taken issue with the latest iteration of the ballot language in Morris’ bill because it doesn’t explicitly mention classified employees and could mislead voters into thinking the amendment doesn’t affect those state workers who are currently protected under Civil Service. When asked about the proposal following Tuesday’s meeting of the House Committee on Civil Law and Procedure, Rep. Wilford Carter, D-Lake Charles, said the ballot language doesn’t align with what’s in the bill.   
The ballot language states: “Do you support an amendment to allow the legislature to remove or add officers, positions, and employees to the unclassified civil service?”
Critics have pointed to other issues that have not been addressed or debated in any of the committee hearings on Morris’ proposal.
One of those is the vague use of the word “remove,” which could be interpreted to mean “fire” or “terminate,” said Peter Robins-Brown, who opposes the bill on behalf of Louisiana Progress, which advocates for low and middle-income people. He said lawmakers have not drafted any kind of companion measure that would establish statutes or regulations to implement the specific necessary changes.
“No one has really been paying attention to the details,” Robins-Brown said. “I’m not sure how the average voter will be able to figure it out, especially when the bill doesn’t have a statutory companion to prove the goal of this exercise.” 
Gov. Landry fails to remove civil service protections from 900 state jobs

Rep. Nicholas Muscarello, R-Hammond, who chairs the House Committee on Civil Law and Procedure, said the intent of the amendment is to give lawmakers the power to unclassify state employees, not fire employees. Hiring and terminating decisions would be left up to the executive branch, he said.
The Civil Service Commission, a nonpartisan entity, has taken a neutral position on Morris’ proposal. When asked about it Wednesday, commission administrators said they assume “remove” means the act of changing an employee’s classification status, but they pointed out the word is not actually defined in the bill.
State Civil Service Director Byron Decoteau said Morris’ civil service amendment amendment, if adopted, could technically allow lawmakers to simply “remove” an unclassified job position with no intention of classifying it, leaving a current employee in a limbo with neither a classified nor unclassified status.
Sherri Gregoire, Civil Service general counsel, said the lack of a clear definition invites different interpretations, including that the amendment gives lawmakers the power to remove governor’s staff members, and creates a situation that would certainly end up in court. 
The more likely course of events, if voters decide to approve the amendment, would be that the legislature designates all future hires as unclassified employees — a move that would eventually end the classified civil service system altogether, Gregoire said. The Civil Service Commission, itself, would still exist under the constitution but would effectively become pointless because it would no longer have anything to oversee.
“Eventually you won’t have any classified employees, so why do you need a commission?” Gregoire said.
Morris said he doesn’t yet have a vision for how lawmakers would exercise their new power if voters approve the amendment.   
Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has tried repeatedly to exert authority over the commission. In February, he tried unsuccessfully to revoke civil service classifications from 900 state jobs, mostly positions for engineers, shortly after President Donald Trump made a similar move at the federal level. The state Civil Service Commission rejected Landry’s request in a 4-2 decision in February. 
Because unclassified workers can be subject to political punishment and coercion, removing such a large number of engineers from the classified service could create ethical conflicts and unnecessary risks to the public, the commissioners said.
A similar version of Morris’ bill stalled on the House floor last year, but some Republicans who likely would have supported the bill were absent when the final vote took place. 
Morris’ bill is expected to earn final passage before the regular session ends June 12 and will be placed before voters on the Nov. 3, 2026, statewide election ballot.

(Screenshot from City of Boulder livestream)The man accused of attacking a group of demonstrators with incendiary devices on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall returned to court on Thursday, where prosecutors charged him with 118 criminal counts that could add up to a prison sentence of hundreds of years.
The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, appeared for a brief administrative hearing at the Boulder County Jail. A preliminary hearing in his state case was set for July 15.
Three victims in the attack remained hospitalized as of Thursday, Boulder officials said, while other victims met with law enforcement at the Boulder County Justice Center. Authorities have identified a total of 15 victims in the attack, some of whom experienced an attempted assault and did not sustain injuries.

Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said in a news conference following the hearing that the charges against the defendant include 14 counts of attempted murder with intent, and 14 counts of attempted murder with extreme indifference. Other charges include attempted assault, the use of an incendiary device and the attempted use of an incendiary device, as well as an animal cruelty charge for a dog that sustained injuries during the attack.
“The charges reflect the evidence that we have regarding this horrific attack that took place, and the seriousness of it,” Dougherty said.
The suspect allegedly told police that he targeted a demonstration on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall held by Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, because he wanted to “kill all Zionist people.”
He also faces a federal hate crime charge, and is set to make his first appearance in federal court on Friday. Additional federal charges are expected to follow.
Federal authorities say the suspect, a Colorado Springs resident, was living in the U.S. unlawfully after overstaying a visa that expired in 2023. A federal judge in Denver has temporarily blocked the deportation of his wife, Hayam El Gamal, and their five children, after the Department of Homeland Security announced that it had taken them into custody and was “processing (them) for removal proceedings from the U.S.”
Dougherty said that he was “absolutely committed” to fully prosecuting the defendant in the U.S.
“Obviously, making sure he remains in the country is a top priority, so that he can be fully prosecuted and held fully responsible,” Dougherty said. “And I know the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the Federal Bureau investigation and the Boulder Police Department — not to speak for them, but I think we’re all equally committed to that goal.”
Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said during Thursday’s press conference to expect enhanced security and a “very visible law enforcement presence” at Sunday’s Boulder Jewish Festival, which was planned long in advance of the attack and will take place on the same block of the Pearl Street Mall where it occurred.
“We are bringing in SWAT elements, we will have drones, we will have a lot of people there,” Redfearn said. “We want people to feel safe, we want people to feel at ease, and right now the best way we can do that is ensure that we have a large number of officers there to be ready to respond to anything.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Members of North Dakota law enforcement updated the public on new alerts that will go into effect Aug. 1 to help locate members of Native communities and other adults who are reported missing.
During the seventh annual Government-to-Government conference in Bismarck on Thursday, a member of the state Highway Patrol outlined how the feather and missing, endangered alerts will be added to the already established Amber, Silver and Blue Alert systems.
North Dakota Highway Patrol Lt. Jenna Clawson Huibregtse, special programs coordinator for safety and education for the department, said Feather Alerts will specifically be used for missing members of the indigenous community.
“The phone blast, as we call it, or when we wake you up at 3 a.m. on your cellphone, we try not to, but when someone’s life is in danger, we’re going to do it,” Clawson Huibregtse said. “That piece will only be used in abduction cases.”
She added website, social media, electronic billboards and media releases will be used in Feather Alert cases not involving abduction or threats of bodily harm.
“To get that word out, that’s the most important piece is galvanizing the public to help us find somebody,” she said. Once alerts are issued to the public, the person is usually found within a couple of hours, she said.
North Dakota tribes push for more autonomy amid federal cuts

Phil Packineau, public safety administrator for the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, said MHA has an emergency response agreement with state law enforcement to assist tribal law enforcement, if the need ever arises.
“We’ve identified numerous resources that we can bring to bear when there is somebody missing and that includes Highway Patrol,” Packineau said. He added Highway Patrol has been able to deploy its airplane with infrared capability within 45 minutes of being notified of a missing person.
He said of the 86 missing persons reports from tribal lands in North Dakota this year, 83 of those individuals have been found so far.
Packineau praised the tribal relationship with local and state law enforcement despite some tense times, like during the protests that erupted in 2016 and 2017 over the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in rural Morton County.
“Even after DAPL, and everything that kind of soured a little bit in the Standing Rock area, when we’ve had missing persons, we’ve called Morton County and they said they could gather six to seven deputies and send them down. It’s really that kind of a close relationship,” Packineau  said.
Clawson Huibregtse said a Missing, Endangered Persons Alert will also be added to the state’s system Aug. 1 that will focus on abducted individuals between 18 to 65 years old.
“Right now in the alert system from 18 years old to 65, if you are abducted or your life is in serious danger of bodily harm or death, there is not an alert type that serves you right now,” she said.
Clawson Huibregtse cited examples of Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, Dru Sjodin and Sherry Arnold who went missing over the last 25 years, but law enforcement did not have a direct alert message system to notify the public of their disappearances.
“So, it will now. The missing, endangered persons alert will do that,” she said.

She said the Amber Alert is used to notify the public when a child 17 years old or younger is abducted. Clawson Huibregtse added that about 90% of amber alerts in the state are issued to locate missing Native children. 
“That’s not just Native American kids that are on tribal lands, that’s across the state from Bismarck, Fargo, et cetera,” she said. “I always want to relay that statistic because it is kind of a staggering statistic because that is a really high representation in the amber alerts program.”
Silver Alerts, she said, are not just for missing people aged 65 and older, but also people with functional and mental impairment or developmental disabilities. 
Blue Alerts are issued to notify the public of a suspect search for a person who attempts, or succeeds, to injure, harm or kill a law enforcement officer, including federal and tribal officers.
House Bill 1535, sponsored by Rep. Jayme Davis, D-Rolette, created the new alerts and passed both legislative chambers with overwhelming support, 74-17 in the House and 45-1 in the Senate. The bill was signed into law by Gov. Kelly Armstrong on May 2. 
Rep. Christina Wolff, R-Minot, pushed back against the Feather Alert bill during debate on the House floor, saying too many alerts reduces their effectiveness. 
“This is a feel good bill that does not guarantee to help the situation, but will absolutely dilute the effectiveness of our current alert systems,” Wolff said on May 1.

DemasUnderfunded public schools continue to be a political football in the Michigan Legislature, but a new coalition announced Thursday has a potential solution: taxing wealthy Michiganders and using the money to pay for schools.
The coalition, Invest in MI Kids, is seeking to place a proposal on the November 2026 ballot that would change the Michigan Constitution’s flat tax rate of 4.25% for individuals earning more than $500,000 and couples earning more than $1 million, increasing that to a surcharge of 5% on their income in state taxes.
Invest in MI Kids noted in a news release that currently, average Michiganders – including the state’s own teachers – and billionaires pay the same rate.
The state’s schools are estimated to be underfunded at $4 billion to $5 billion annually, the coalition said. The ballot measure, which needs 600,000 signatures to be placed on the statewide ballot in the next election cycle, would direct new revenue to Michigan’s School Aid Fund and allow funding for things like career and technical education, attracting and retaining teachers, and reducing class sizes. That would have a positive impact on underfunded and underserved communities, the coalition added, with the revenue estimated to generate $1.7 billion annually for public K-12 schools.
Rachelle Crow-Hercher is director of the Michigan Education Justice Coalition and part of the Invest in MI Kids ballot committee. In an interview with Michigan Advance, she said that most people agree that Michigan’s education system needs to be fixed, but the main question she hears is whether that’s a funding or a policy fix.
“I think it’s a ‘both/and’ situation,” Crow-Hercher said. “We’re addressing the funding situation with this ballot initiative, but the other part of what we’re doing is we’re strapping our shoes on and going out to meet folks where they are and get their ideas for what they think we should change at the state level to make our schools better for all our kids.”
The coalition described the ballot initiative as an admittedly bold plan, one that could shore up existing “tax the rich” sentiments but could face headwinds from anti-tax and ultra-wealthy residents.
Crow-Hercher said the momentum behind making those ultra-wealthy individuals pay their fair share in taxes to fund things like education is strong enough to get the initiative over the finish line, but she also believes that Michganders realize that the Legislature has failed continually to address adequate funding for schools.
“Between those two things, my sense is Michiganders across the state, rural and urban, are sort of ready for this type of bold plan,” she said.
Molly Sweeney, organizing director of 482 Forward, said in a statement that Michigan’s flat tax system was designed to benefit wealthy residents, not working families.
“That’s why we’re coming together to rewrite the rules so those who aren’t paying what they owe in taxes finally chip in to support the services we all rely on – especially public education,” Sweeney said.
Charlie Cavell, an organizer with Fund MI Future, said it was a matter of fairness.
“When you include sales tax and other taxes, working and middle-class families in Michigan actually pay a higher percentage of their income in state taxes than the top 1%,” Cavell said in a statement. “That’s upside-down. Our ballot initiative will restore balance and ensure that those at the very top finally contribute to our schools and communities like the rest of us already do.”
The campaign is being backed by Michigan Education Justice Coalition, the American Federation of Teachers Michigan and dozens of grassroots organizations.
“We know that for years Michigan schools have been underfunded and students are feeling forgotten and unheard,” Christina Yarn, a senior at Heritage High School in Saginaw and a member of the Michigan Education Justice Coalition’s Youth Collective, said in a statement. “We have been suffering in schools that are falling apart, with little to no school transportation, schools that have poor water and air quality, where students aren’t safe in their own classes.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_0983-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 19:03:05.647330

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Though there were some rumblings, no one turned in petitions to challenge actions of the Maryland General Assembly via referendum this year, state elections officials say.
At least two laws, both focused on energy policy, were in the crosshairs this year.
One group — which registered itself as the Maryland Environment, Labor and Industry Coalition — planned to challenge the Next Generation Energy Act, and focus its campaign on trash incinerators, which will no longer receive a renewable energy subsidy under the law.
Another group, led primarily by Maryland farmers, started collecting signatures to challenge the Renewable Energy Certainty Act, which focuses on solar farm siting in the state.
But ultimately, neither group submitted signatures before the May 31 deadline, when they needed 20,053. To actually get on the ballot in 2026, groups would have needed to assemble about 60,000 signatures by June 30.
The lack of submissions means Maryland will go another year without a statewide referendum on the ballot. The last one was in 2012, when voters petitioned to get same-sex marriage on the ballot, and ultimately the electorate approved it.
This year, both groups had pushed for Gov. Wes Moore (D) to veto their bills, but he signed each during his final bill signing session of the year, on May 21.

With just 10 days until the deadline, a representative of the MELIC group said a formal signature campaign was unlikely.
But the farming community decided to throw the Hail Mary, and collected thousands of signatures in an attempt to hit the cutoff.
The solar bill essentially prohibits local governments from establishing zoning rules that preclude large solar fields, and sets uniform statewide standards for solar sites.
But farmers are particularly concerned by a provision that caps solar facilities to 5% of “priority preservation areas,” or agricultural land, in any one county. They argue the ceiling is too high, and could take too much farmland out of production. Many believe that no farmland should be used for solar panels whatsoever.
“While this cap is certainly better than nothing, it still leaves thousands of acres of farmland open to commercial solar development,” wrote Maryland Farm Bureau President Jamie Raley in a recent statement. “The result of this bill is concerning, but it only strengthens our resolve to keep fighting for Maryland’s farmland.”
Jay Falstad, a leader of the solar energy petition effort, said that his group amassed just under 20,000 signatures before they ran out of time. They estimated that they would have needed at least 23,000 to meet the state’s cutoff, because signatures are frequently tossed out for non-compliance with a strict set of state rules.
But Falstad, who is a founder of Farmers Alliance for Rural Maryland, or FARM, said that a State Board of Elections official initially informed him that he’d have until Monday, June 2 — the next business day after the May 31 deadline — to make the submission.
Falstad was shellshocked when officials reached out on May 30 to say he’d only have until midnight on the 31st. He’s confident he could have reached the cutoff number with a few extra days.
“We would have made the necessary number, had it not been for this accelerated timeline,” said Falstad, who is also the executive director of the Queen Anne’s County Conservation Association. “The momentum was on our side.”
Jared DeMarinis, Maryland’s state administrator of elections, said that the initial communication, allowing until June 2, was in error. While other state election deadlines, such as business contribution filings, can move to the next business day, the ballot petition filing deadline cannot move, under the state constitution, he said.
“When we found out of a mistake, we made sure that they were aware of it,” DeMarinis said. “It is in the Maryland constitution, so it’s not like it was hidden in any sort of fashion.”
Regardless of the outcome, Falstad said he was impressed by the strong response to the petition drive. Organizers received signatures from each Maryland county, he said, although the effort was focused in rural areas on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, as well as in Montgomery, Harford and Carroll counties, Falstad said.
Falstad himself collected signatures on the Eastern Shore at fairgrounds and ballfields, farm stores and local parks.
“We had people running from their car to the pavilion to sign the petition through rain and thunder,” Falstad said. “The level of commitment and dedication on the part of people that wanted to sign the petition was inspiring.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HEADSHOT-92-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 19:03:05.647330

The rift between the White River Valley Supervisory Union and the association reflects opposing views among school districts statewide about the role of supervisory unions and private schools in the public education system.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  A supervisory union’s break with the Vermont School Boards Association reveals statewide fault lines[...]","First Branch Unified District Board Chair Kathy Galluzzo during a board meeting in 2019. File photo by Dylan Kelley/White River Valley HeraldThe White River Valley Supervisory Union last week moved to withdraw its membership from the Vermont School Boards Association, highlighting deep divisions among the state’s school districts and supervisory unions over the trajectory of education reform.The White River board’s decision marks an overt break in unity with a prominent advocacy organization at a critical time for public education in Vermont.State lawmakers are working overtime to strike a deal on legislation that would lay the groundwork for major systemic reform in the coming months. House and Senate members were locked in strained negotiations last week, but leaders in both chambers, along with Gov. Phil Scott, said they were committed to working out a compromise on the bill, H.454, by June 16, when lawmakers are scheduled to reconvene for a vote.The Vermont School Board Association collects annual membership dues from every school district in the state and lobbies on behalf of its members. The supervisory union, a collection of six school districts that serves students from 10 central Vermont towns, was paying the association roughly $10,000 a year in membership dues, according to Kathy Galluzzo, chair of the supervisory union’s board.But in recent weeks, board members with the supervisory union questioned the association’s lobbying efforts. At a May 27 meeting, board members had strong words for the association’s support for legislation that would do away with supervisory unions.“They don’t believe in us, so they can’t lobby for us,” supervisory union board member Bill Edgerton said at the meeting.Leaders of the Vermont School Boards Association said the majority of the organization’s members support its position on supervisory unions.  In a press release announcing the decision, supervisory union board members said their withdrawal arose from disagreements around the association’s support for versions of H.454 that they said would result in “long bus rides for students, the dissolution of supervisory unions, no community involvement in decisions surrounding the future of rural schools, and no path to tax relief for Vermonters.”The statement went on to say that the association’s advocacy went “against the communities that WRVSU serves and the children they educate.” The White River Valley Supervisory Union is the first to break with the association, but it may not be the last.Districts within the Lamoille South, Twin Rivers and Great Rutland County supervisory unions have had similar discussions and plan to consider resolutions this month to suspend their dues or withdraw their membership, according to board meeting minutes and interviews with board members.In Windham County, board members with the Windham Southeast Supervisory District — one of two districts in the Windham Southeast Supervisory Union — voted on a resolution calling on the association to refrain from supporting legislation “not grounded in sound research or lacking clear fiscal impact modeling, especially on consequential issues like school governance and consolidation.”Timothy Maciel, a board member with the southern Vermont school district, in an interview said the board would consider suspending their dues to the association “if basic standards of democratic representation and accountability are not met.”“There’s really good folks in the VSBA,” he said. “But primarily, they have to represent our values and positions. If they aren’t representing those values, then we, in my opinion, shouldn’t continue with them.”READ MORE
Why supervisory unions?Vermont has 52 supervisory unions or supervisory districts — two different governing and administrative models for the state’s 119 school districts. State law only gives school districts the power to set budgets and to raise money through bonding. A supervisory union or supervisory district generally provides back office functions such as accounting and payroll and may oversee the provision of special education services and curriculum coordination, though their specific roles differ across the state.The supervisory union structure, which proliferated during the push for school district consolidation driven by Act 46, provides a unifying structure for school districts with vastly different operating structures — a way for them to share resources while maintaining independence.The White River Valley Supervisory Union is a particularly diverse example, with six districts following four different operating models. One of the school districts — the White River Union District, for the towns of Bethel and Royalton — operates all grades from pre-kindergarten through high school. Another, serving Granville and Hancock, operates none, and provides tuition to its resident students to the public and private schools they choose. Of the other four districts, two pay tuition and allow choice for middle school and high school for the towns of Rochester, Sharon and Stockbridge, while two provide tuition and choice just for high school for the towns of Chelsea, Strafford and Tunbridge. The school choice allowed in five of the six districts in the White River Valley Supervisory Union lets students attend private schools like the nearby Thetford Academy and Sharon Academy.Flor Diaz Smith, the president of the Vermont School Boards Association, said supervisory unions make it difficult to “have aligned outcomes and support for all our students.”“We’re trying to create coherence through this system,” she said.Complicating matters is the number of public school students that districts across the state are paying to send to private schools. There were around 3,500 students using public money for private school tuition in the 2022-23 school year — a small fraction of the almost 83,000 students educated in public school that same year, according to the Vermont Agency of Education.But that smaller group has played a big role in the education debate, and supervisory unions that allow students that publicly funded choice want to keep it that way.Galluzzo said that school choice is an important factor for her supervisory union, and the region’s independent schools provide educational options that are often closer to home for some families.“Families make that choice,” she said. “Kids find their fit in some of the independent schools for different reasons. I think more choice is better than less choice.”Scott’s education proposal, unveiled in January, would have eliminated the supervisory unions governance structure and instead established five regional districts of roughly 10,000 to 15,000 students each, except for the Champlain Valley region district, which was more than twice that size. In another change, the new districts’ board’s would have been empowered to designate certain private schools as “choice schools” available to all students in the larger district via lottery.Sue Ceglowski, the executive director of the Vermont School Boards Association, said during the White River Valley Supervisory Union Board’s meeting that the organization came out strongly against the governor’s plan.However, the association could not publicly support legislation that required the inclusion of supervisory unions because it was “paired with allowing for the continuation of a tuitioning system that provides continued access to independent schools,” she said.Ceglowski said most of the organization’s members supported its position on supervisory unions and that its stance was “based on resolutions that have been passed by our members.”In an interview, Diaz Smith also said there was “a lot of interest from the supervisory union advocates to stay with (school choice), to have everybody change but them, to have this system change around them.”“That is not collaborative,” she said. “That is not all coming to the table.”A rural school lobbyAfter their vote to leave the association, the White River Valley Supervisory Union Board voted during their May 27 meeting to shift the funds that would have gone to the Vermont School Board Association to the Rural Schools Community Alliance, an organization formed in January that has quickly emerged as an advocate and lobbying arm in the Statehouse for Vermont’s rural schools.The board in its press release said the alliance “has established itself as a strong ally, helping rural schools vocally oppose legislation that forces school closure.”“We were paying an entity to lobby for us, but they were lobbying for us to be closed,” Galluzzo said in an interview Thursday. “I think at this point in time, we need to put our money toward somebody in Montpelier that is going to fight for us.”As fears mount over the possible closure of small, rural schools, the White River Valley Supervisory Union and others have turned to the Rural Schools Community Alliance to advocate on their behalf as education reform has progressed this session.Since its formation in January, the alliance has grown to include more than 100 school districts in the state, according to Margaret MacLean, a steering committee member with the organization.She said the alliance sees supervisory unions “as essential structures for rural schools,” that offer more democratic representation and local control for smaller communities.MacLean and her organization have come out against Scott’s proposal for five regional districts, and said that consolidated structures won’t work “when you have towns that are distinct and separated by geography and mileage.”“We don’t see that as more efficient. We see that as less democratic,” she said. “Yes, democracy can sometimes be messy, but the benefits of it pay off in terms of engagement and involvement and community voice in support of schools.”Officials with the rural alliance and the school boards association have met and discussed their visions for Vermont’s public education system, both sides said. But disagreements remain between the two organizations over the efficacy of supervisory unions.“It’s not to be difficult. It’s not to be inflexible,” Diaz Smith said. “It’s just the data was not there to support supervisory unions.”Not everyone is on board with ditching the Vermont School Board Association. In Peacham, the school board will also take up a resolution to discuss reducing the amount of money they sent to the association.But Mark Clough, the district board’s chair and the vice chair of the school board association, said he’s “heard over and over again from a lot of districts and (supervisory unions) around the state that they really want tighter controls” of schools and districts under their purview.“The state feels, in general, that districts are the way to go, because it just provides more control to get costs and student outcomes in a better place than allowing it to just go off on its own with supervisory unions,” Clough said in an interview. “The (supervisory union) model, as good as it is for rural areas — and it does fit for some rural areas — it doesn’t fit for all regions.”Galluzzo left open the possibility of rejoining the association at some point in an interview. But at the May 27 meeting, board members with the supervisory union concluded they had no other choice but to withdraw their membership.Stacey Peters, the chair of the Granville-Hancock Unified School District, which is part of the supervisory union, said during the meeting last week she considered it a matter of “life or death” for the future of their schools.“You’re asking us to kind of sign away our livelihood here, and I think that that is not a simple difference of opinion,” she said at the meeting. “Being asked to pay for our own execution does not feel like a position that I think we should be supporting.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  A supervisory union’s break with the Vermont School Boards Association reveals statewide fault lines in education reform.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Kathy-Galluzzo-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-06-05 19:03:05.647330

Days after the Utah State Board of Education switched managers to run the program and the application portal closed, families are learning that they may have to apply again.
Odyssey, a New York-based technology company that won the bid in May to run the voucher program, announced Friday on its website that after reviewing the application data the outgoing administrator provided, it found that in many cases the information was incomplete, inconsistent, or lacked proper verification.

The company “will need to take additional steps to ensure accuracy, consistency, and compliance with the Utah Fits All law,” Odyssey officials wrote. They said those actions include re-running applications for families participating in the second year application cycle. 
“We understand that this may be frustrating, but we believe this is the best path forward to determine eligibility accurately,” company officials said.
The announcement comes after the Board of Education canceled early its multiyear contract with the program’s previous third-party manager ACE Scholarships, citing “convenience” reasons. The move was made possible by a 2025 bill that, among other changes to Utah Fits All, opened the door for a switch should the Board of Education need to change its current program administrator.

Odyssey officials said ACE Scholarships’ previous records make it impossible to determine students’ eligibility since those records only show a small percentage of second year applicants successfully completed their income verification — a step on their application that’s required by law. 
Those eligibility determinations will be delayed past the initial May 31 deadline, according to Odyssey. However, the company hasn’t set a new timeline for the new process.
Reconciling scholarship balances for current Utah Fits All participants is also underway, with “a large population for whom Odyssey cannot determine their current balance because there are thousands of pending reimbursements, receipts, and transactions, many of which were received by Odyssey as recently as May 29th.”
The company won’t authorize any additional spending until pending purchases undergo further analysis, according to its website. As of Thursday, Utah Fits All’s website listed June 30 as the last day to use 2024-2025 funds.



Let us know what you think...


 


Among the changes to Utah Fits All the Legislature approved this year is a 20% cap on extracurricular activities and physical education, in addition to tightened expense guidelines to explicitly prohibit the use of  scholarship money to pay for ski passes, furniture, musical instruments, apparel, and other uses.
While lawmakers approved more money to fund additional scholarships, bringing the total annual allocation for the program to $100 million, they also voted to reduce the amount some students could receive. This year, homeschooled children of ages 5 to 11 would have access to $4,000 a year, while those aged 12 to 18 years old could get up to $6,000. That’s down from the $8,000 that was allowed during the program’s first year.
Private school students are still eligible for $8,000 a year to help cover their tuition or other expenses.
Meanwhile, Utah Fits Alls is also facing other challenges that may threaten its existence. A 3rd District Court judge recently ruled the program to be unconstitutional, a win for the Utah Education Association, the state’s largest teacher union. 
The union sued the state for diverting “funds from already underfunded public schools,” union leaders said. They alleged the program violates the Utah Constitution, which explicitly says income tax revenue should be used to fund public education, among a few other limited uses. State leaders said they will appeal the decision to the Utah Supreme Court.
While the case plays out in court, the program will continue to operate.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)In addition to the right to minimum wage, agricultural workers in Maine may soon be protected from retaliation for talking about work conditions.
On Thursday, the Maine Senate cast a final enactment vote for LD 588, which would give agricultural employees the right to engage in certain concerted activity, which includes talking about wages, working conditions and other employment matters with other employees or the employer. 
The House of Representatives initially rejected the bill, but narrowly decided Wednesday to change course and join the upper chamber in passing the measure. It now goes to Gov. Janet Mills for final approval.
Opponents argued the bill is unnecessary and opens the door to unionization, which they said would be difficult for the agricultural industry given the seasonal nature of the work and other nuances. Sen. Scott Cyrway (R-Kennebec) said the proposal “just puts another layer of difficulty for farmers.”
However, Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor), who co-chairs the Labor Committee, said the bill only asks for “this very baseline concerted activity because we know unionization poses a lot of challenges.”
Earlier this week, the chambers also approved legislation that would give farmworkers the right to state minimum wage.

Jim Kofalt, a Wilton Republican, speaks in favor of Senate Bill 72, a parental rights bill passed by the House, June 5, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)The House and Senate passed a pair of parental rights bills Thursday, sending one to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk, as Republicans advanced a yearslong goal to strengthen parents’ control over public schools. 
Both bills, House Bill 10 and Senate Bill 72, would enumerate a number of powers parents have to request information from teachers about their children, including the courses they are taking, the materials being taught, and what their children are saying at school. 
The House passed another bill, Senate Bill 96, that would also require teachers and school employees to answer questions from parents, and could impose stiff penalties for teachers who don’t provide the information. Under that bill, a teacher or administrator could be investigated by the Department of Education for violations and face disciplinary sanctions by the department. Teachers found to have “willfully violated” the law would face a mandatory one-year suspension of their teaching license.
Republicans said the legislation is meant to establish a state policy that parents direct the upbringing of their children — not their schools. 
“Today, it’s time that we deliver on our promises to Granite Staters by affirming that parental rights are fundamental,” said Rep. Jim Kofalt, a Wilton Republican. 
But Democrats have denounced the bills, noting that they could force teachers to disclose information about students to their parents that the students do not want shared, such as their sexual orientation or gender identity, and remove supportive spaces for kids.
Rep. Peter Petrigno, a Milford Democrat, said SB 72 would destroy trust in schools and leave children who don’t feel safe sharing things with their parents with few options. Should they confide in teachers, those teachers might be compelled to share that information to parents who inquire, Petrigno said. 
“If troubled kids cannot talk with their parents for any reason, and they know they now cannot talk to their trusted adults at school, then where will they turn?” Petrigno said. 
But Republicans argued that in most cases, a child’s parent is the best person to receive sensitive information about their children, not a teacher.
“If I know that most parents are way more trustworthy than teachers like Pamela Smart, then I will vote to pass this bill as amended,” said Rep. Debra DeSimone, an Atkinson Republican, referring to a former high school employee convicted in 1991 for killing her husband. 
Republicans also pointed to provisions in two of the bills, HB 10 and HB 72, that allow teachers to withhold information to parents if they have “clear and convincing” evidence that the infringement upon parental rights is necessary to prevent the child from being abused.
Democrats denounced that language, noting that “clear and convincing” is a higher legal standard than is typically required to report a child to the Division for Children, Youth, and Families and arguing that it would effectively bar teachers from withholding information from parents even if they had suspicion that it could lead to abuse. RSA 169-C:29 currently requires any teacher, school staff member, or other professional who interacts with children to make a report to DCYF if they have “reason to suspect” abuse or neglect.
In regard to that exception, one of the bills that passed, SB 96, differs from the other two. While HB 10 and SB 72 require “clear and convincing” evidence of abuse for a teacher to opt not to share information with parents, SB 96 allows a teacher to refrain from giving the information “if a reasonably prudent person would believe that disclosure would result in abuse, abandonment, or neglect.”
But SB 96 allows the exception only if the child has been physically harmed or has been threatened to be harmed “of such a grave nature by the actions or inactions” of a parent that it justifies withholding information. The bill states the exception does not apply to “potential or actual psychological or emotional injury” that a parent imposes on a child upon learning information about their child. It does not apply to “emotions such as anger, disappointment, sadness, disapproval or other behaviors.” 
HB 10 passed the House and the Senate Thursday and will head to Ayotte in the coming weeks; SB 72 and SB 96 both passed the House but had not yet received a final green light from the Senate as of Thursday afternoon.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P6053828-Kofalt-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 19:03:05.647330

Tim Walz said Thursday Democrats need to take a broader approach to the states they are targeting during elections — which could mean further changes to the presidential nominating calendar.
Speaking with Minnesota Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference in Minneapolis, the 2024 vice presidential candidate tackled multiple topics related to President Donald Trump’s time in office. He also discussed ways for the Democratic Party to bounce back after significant Republican wins in 2024, including Trump’s win over his and Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign.
One of the major questions leading up to the 2028 presidential election season — especially for Iowa — is the Democratic presidential nominating calendar. Following issues in the 2020 Democratic caucuses and Democratic National Committee concerns about the accessibility of the caucus system, Iowa was booted from it’s longtime first-in-the-nation position in the Democratic nominating calendar in 2022, replaced by South Carolina.

When asked by Iowa Capital Dispatch Editor-in-Chief Kathie Obradovich which state should go first, Walz immediately quipped, “Minnesota.” But in a longer response, the Democratic governor said he believes Democrats should rotate which states kick off the nominating process each presidential election cycle — a process he said may not be popular in states that may not traditionally have held early contests, but could improve Democrats’ odds in elections.
He reflected on how in his 2024 run with Harris, winning the presidency came down to winning a handful of contested states.
“On the calendar, I think you can’t be too rigid,” Walz said. “And it was … I don’t know if the word is depressing, but going to the seven states over and over and over again, and recognizing that you could win a presidential election or lose one doing that — I think we’ve got to be broader.”
Iowa Democrats made changes to the caucus system, moving from in-person events to a mail-in presidential preference contest in 2024, but there is not any indication the DNC plans to reinstate Iowa as an early state in the next nominating cycle. However, Iowa and other states that were not a part of the early state lineup in 2024 will have a chance to take a top position in 2028. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart and other Iowa officials have said the DNC plans to revisit the calendar leading up to the next presidential election.
Though Iowa is still in the running, a potential blow was dealt to the state with Iowa Democrat Scott Brennan losing his longtime seat on the DNC Rules and Bylaws committee, the body overseeing the nominating calendar, the Des Moines Register reported.
Walz said he is not running as a Democratic presidential candidate, he has made visits to many of the traditional early states, including a May Democratic Party event in South Carolina and March event in Des Moines. He is not the only speculated 2028 Democratic presidential candidate to visit Iowa in recent months — former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, who won the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses, held an event in Cedar Rapids in May.
Walz is also not the only person who thinks changes Democratic presidential nominating calendar would serve the party well in future elections. Chris Cillizza, a political commentator who formerly worked for CNN, said during a Potluck Podcast episode Monday with members of the Iowa Writers’ Collaborative that it was “very clear” former President Joe Biden moved South Carolina to the front of the calendar in 2024 “because South Carolina and Jim Clyburn got him elected president” in 2020.
However, Biden ultimately was not the Democratic presidential candidate in 2024, Cillizza said, and recent Democratic losses for the presidency with Harris and Hillary Clinton in 2024 show states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania are crucial to winning the general election. He said he believes Iowa should go first because “if you’re if you’re a Democrat trying to solve your broader problems, I think Iowa going first would help, not hurt” in the fight to win Midwestern states.
He said he believes this strategy has been reflected with the potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidates visiting traditional early states like Iowa.
When I look at travel schedules now, they’re acting as though we’re back to the pre-Joe Biden nominating calendar — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina,” Cillizza said. “And I wouldn’t be surprised if it went back to that. I mean, look, I actually think there’s a case to be made.”
However, he said he is not sure about the DNC chair Ken Martin’s strategy heading into 2028. Martin, elected in February, is from Minnesota, which Cillizza said “probably helps a little bit in the case for the Midwest.”

(Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)While West Virginia employees prepare for their health insurance to take up more of their paychecks this summer, a special session may be coming in July — the same month those increases take effect — to deal with ongoing cost and sustainability challenges at the Public Employees Insurance Agency.
At the finance board’s regular meeting Thursday, Chairman Eric Householder said the agency has been working with Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s office as he prepares to call the special legislative session.
“I know currently … we are working providing data to the governor,” Householder said. “There’s been no decision on what to do, just providing data, having roundtable discussions. That’s all we’re doing right now.”
Householder said Morrisey tentatively intends to call a special session for PEIA in mid July.
Beginning in July, PEIA premiums are increasing by 14% for state employees and by 16% for local government employees. Out-of-pocket and copay costs will also go up. The agency will also raise premiums by 12% for retirees.
PEIA leaders have said that the rising cost of health care — particularly inflation on prescription GLP-1 drugs that treat obesity and diabetes — are a major driver of the rate increases.
Union leaders and state employees have repeatedly called on the Legislature to come up with a solution to PEIA’s rising costs, but the issue largely went unaddressed during the 2025 regular session.
Morrisey said in April that he plans to call a special session for PEIA, but he has not said how exactly the issue of increasing costs will be addressed..
“That was kicked down the road for many, many years,” the governor said in April. “I don’t intend to kick it down the road. We have to bring everyone together, all the stakeholders: listen, learn and then you’ll be seeing some activity.”
In a news release Thursday, leadership from the West Virginia Democratic Party blamed Morrisey for “falling to act” and letting “devastating” PEIA increases go into effect.
“Pay-Cut Patrick failed to take action to stabilize PEIA premiums,” Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin said in the statement. “So now, state employees, including law enforcement officers, school teachers, school service personnel, CPS workers, and retirees will soon be paying a price for his inaction. Morrisey had a choice — he could have fought to protect working West Virginians. Instead, he did what he always does: protect his political donors and let working families bear the burden.”
In an email Thursday, Morrisey spokesman Drew Galang said the governor has emphasized that the state “must address the inherited challenges facing PEIA and its long term sustainability.” He said Morrisey had “already indicated” that a special session to do so would occur in “mid to late July.”
Galang did not respond to an email asking to clarify when, publicly, the July timeframe had been set by Morrisey and no such references to it have been made clear in previous PEIA meetings or announcements prior to Thursday.
A spokeswoman for the House of Delegates and one for the state Senate said the governor has not formally told lawmakers the special session will be in July.
Dale Lee, president of the West Virginia Education Association, told Householder the discussions about PEIA solutions should include public employees and their representatives.
“The employees can’t be the ones providing all of this,” Lee said of the cost increases. “We have to have the Legislature. There has to be not only the Legislature but also the providers. That’s why I continue to ask that we all go back to the table and that we come up with a plan that people can agree on.”
Lee, who has repeatedly criticized state leaders for failing to act on the recommendations of a task force called by former Gov. Jim Justice after statewide teacher strikes in 2018 and 2019, said it’s important that the Legislature act upon a plan for PEIA this time.
“[It] never even got on a committee agenda,” he said of the recommendations. “That’s just disingenuous.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PEIA-sign-scaled-e1732553302111-1024x414.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 19:03:05.647330

Photo via Adobe StockNext week, Benningtonians might catch a glimpse of people suspended in midair, repelling from the state’s tallest manmade structure, as a crew works to clear away crumbling stone from the Bennington Battle Monument.Starting Monday, a group plans to scale the 306-foot obelisk to execute the next step in the state’s effort to restore and maintain the memorial to the Battle of Bennington.Spectators are welcome to gather below to watch the aerial feat of a safety inspection team as they repel and remove loose stone from the weather-worn monument, said Laura Trieschmann, the state’s historic preservation officer.The monument has become saturated with an estimated 66,000 gallons of water, causing cracks to form and debris to fall from the structure, Trieschmann said. The problem spans back decades.“Cracking of the stone occurred almost immediately upon construction,” Trieschmann said. “By the 1920s, we know from primary documentation that materials were falling off, and that was exacerbated by the ineffective and incomplete restoration efforts taken in the latter part of the 20th century.”This is the fourth annual effort to remove debris from the monument, and the cost of this year’s proactive maintenance is $72,000, Trieschmann said. The company the state Division for Historic Preservation contracts with, Vertical Access, has “already documented every crack and issue on the exterior of the monument,” she said.After years of deferred maintenance, the division’s study of the monument found that restoration would require at least $40 million. The price tag sparked debate over whether restoration of the state’s historic monument is worth the cost or whether other innovative plans should be considered to commemorate the Battle of Bennington.READ MORE
An idea to enclose the monument in copper, proposed by state Rep. Shawn Sweeney, D-Shelburne, gained attention in recent months, and Trieschmann said the division would study the impact and cost of the suggestion. The monument will close for the team to dislodge loose stone between June 9 and 12, but the site is set to reopen just in time for the annual Vermont Days, a weekend of free entry to all state parks.During its closure, Trieschmann said the division plans to erect a roadside historic marker to Seth Warner, a Vermonter and a member of the Green Mountain Boys who was crucial in the Battle of Hubbardton and the Battle of Bennington.Trieschmann said that the division’s maintenance plan and effort to monitor cracks and remove rubble is about the safety of guests, staff and residents who continue to visit the second tallest unreinforced masonry structure in the nation and a key symbol of Vermont’s Revolutionary past. “This is our greatest visited monument of the state’s historic sites, and we want to make sure that it remains open, but first and foremost is safety,” Trieschmann said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bennington Battle Monument to close for maintenance in midair.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bennington-Battle-Monument-1024x575.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 19:03:05.647330

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)A newly formed political committee is beginning a campaign to enshrine nonpartisan judicial elections in the state constitution, after a multitude of efforts by the Montana Legislature to attach party labels to judges failed.  
Pepper Peterson, the political director for Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges, said the goal of putting a constitutional initiative to voters in 2026 came after watching the repeated rebuffing of those actions during the session.
“I think the people of Montana can see the system here is fair,” Peterson told the Daily Montanan. “This is a common sense idea to have in our state constitution. Anything else is just raw partisanship, and I don’t think most Montanans are on that train.”
Throughout the 2025 session, legislators introduced more than a half-dozen bills aimed at allowing, or requiring, judicial candidates to declare a party label, a stated goal of Republican leaders in the Legislature and Gov. Greg Gianforte, who argue that the judicial branch is “nonpartisan in name only.”
One bill passed — House Bill 39, which allows political parties to donate to judicial candidates — but a majority failed to gain traction in at least one chamber. 
Five separate bills attempted to allow, or require, judges to run under a partisan label. Some bills would have only applied to the Montana Supreme Court, others would have included any judicial candidate, including district and municipal judges, and justices of the peace.
Lawmakers who supported those measures said that allowing candidates to align with a political party would bring transparency to the process and help educate voters. 
While a majority of lawmakers didn’t seem to have an appetite for changing the system, it was a point of discussion all the way until the final day, with Gianforte’s office considering adding the partisan judicial issue into an amendment of a spending bill.  
Despite the thwarted attempts to alter the judicial selection process, Republican leaders in the Senate said they had laid a foundation for future reform. 
“I think that judicial reform is critical, continuously. It’s important for our judges to have accountability. It’s important for preventative transparency, and what we did this session helps start that process,” said Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, during a press conference at the end of the session. 
But Peterson said seeing lawmakers pushing partisan judicial elections get “slapped down over and over and over again” set the stage for bringing the issue to the ballot box. 
“That’s what we anticipate the people to do as well. We’re going to put this in the Constitution, and we’re going to stop this,” he said. “The people are going to have to send this message very loud and very clear so that lawmakers know this is what Montanans want.”
Peterson is working with Ted Dick, a former executive director of the Montana Democratic Party more than a decade ago, on the ballot issue — the same team behind the successful ballot initiatives in 2020 designed to legalize adult use of recreational marijuana. 
Peterson said their experience on that campaign, as well as his decades of political work in the state on issues from coal mining to gun rights, make them the right group to bring forward the ballot initiative, despite not working on judicial issues during the session. 
“My career has been nonpartisan activism for the rights of citizens. I consider myself a civil rights activist over anything, whether that’s the rights of the 2nd amendment, 1st amendment, 4th amendment,” Peterson said. “I can get signatures and get this issue across the finish line … It’s a complicated process, there’s only a few people who are experts, and we’re some of them.”
To get the issue onto the ballot as a constitutional initiative in 2026, the committee must collect valid signatures representing 10% of votes cast for governor in the last election stateside, as well as 10% in at least 40 legislative districts. 
If the issue makes it onto the ballot, a simple majority of votes will enshrine it as a part of the state constitution. 
Two new laws passed by the Legislature make changes to the process for gathering signatures for ballot initiatives.  
Senate Bill 226, sponsored by Sen. Mike Cuffe, R-Eureka, requires signatures be submitted incrementally, rather than by a single deadline. 
House Bill 201, by Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, mandates that a paid signature gatherer must verbally disclose their first name, state where they legally reside, and position as a paid gatherer to anyone they approach. They must also wear a nametag with that information. 
Peterson said the committee intends to have “thousands of conversations” during the early stages of building out their campaign with lobbyists, special interest groups, and most importantly, citizens. 
“Polling done on this issue shows overwhelming support from Montanans for nonpartisan elections,” Peterson said. “I don’t think it’s our uphill battle to fight at all — I think it’s an uphill battle for the other side to convince people the system we have in place is flawed.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-06-05 19:03:05.647330

Mori Hosseini, chair of the UF Board of Trustees and a proponent of Ono,  defended the UF trustees’ decision to forward Ono to the BOG for final approval.
“Our Board of Trustees stands by the integrity of the search, the strength of the candidates it produced, and the principles that guided our work,” Hosseini said during a lengthy board meeting. “This outcome is deeply disappointing to our Board of Trustees.”
Ono was rejected by the Board of Governors in a 6-10 vote after he was questioned for hours about his conflicting stances on diversity, equity, and inclusion. The UF board voted unanimously in favor of Ono the week prior.

Had he received the job, Ono’s contract would have provided him about $3 million annually.
“We believe Dr. Ono was uniquely qualified to lead this university at this moment,” Hosseini continued. “The symbolism and substance of the sitting president of a university as prestigious as University of Michigan, choosing to come to University of Florida should not be lost. It was a powerful signal that Florida’s model for higher education grounded in merit, academic excellence, institutional neutrality, and accountability to students and taxpayers is earning the trust and interest of top team leaders across the country who are ready to advance this vision.”
The UF presidency is being filled on an interim basis by former President Kent Fuchs. The permanent job has been open since July, when former U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse resigned from the presidency.
“We will continue to pursue the kind of bold principle and forward thinking leadership that Gator nation deserves,” Hosseini concluded.

It may be slippery.
Water leaks flood the concrete path connecting the House and Senate office complexes, making for a slick trek.
Water is also eating away at the structural integrity of the roughly 85-year-old passageway between the John A. Cherberg and John L. O’Brien buildings, and could potentially damage the latter building because it is on the walkway’s downhill side.
This year, lawmakers earmarked $4 million in the state capital budget to essentially rebuild the tunnel.
“Without repairs, the entire tunnel will eventually fail,” the Department of Enterprise Services wrote in its request for money to make repairs.
Guy Bergstrom said it’s been a problem since he joined the House Democratic Caucus staff three decades ago.
“It’s always damp, if not a little river running through it,” he said. “You have to make the water drain away. That’s the whole damn ball game.”
The project will require excavating the tunnel and installing new waterproofing and external drainage. Reinforcing the structure will also be needed, the agency wrote in its budget request.

It will take about two years to finish. Site evaluation will begin in July. Design would come next, likely between November and next March. Digging would start after the 2026 legislative session, with construction expected to last until May 2027. 
The tunnel connects the basements of the two buildings. It is about 10 feet wide, 8 feet high, and a little under 150 feet long. It was built in the same period as the two buildings.
Cherberg houses offices of Democratic senators and Senate committee hearing rooms. It was completed in 1937 and originally named the Public Lands and Social Security Building. O’Brien is where most state representatives have offices. House committee rooms are located there, too. When it was completed in 1940, it was known as the Transportation Building.
The Department of Enterprise Services first noted damage to the concrete in 2011 and problems have significantly increased since, according to the department’s request.
Doing nothing, the agency memo concluded, “will result in a costly emergency response when the tunnel ultimately fails and threatens the life and health safety of legislators and their staff, the historic integrity of the West Capitol Campus, and continuity of government operations.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2806-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 18:04:23.424855

Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton has publicly called on Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell to rescind an executive order that requires city emergency personnel to report interactions with immigration officials within 24 hours.
“While Metro has refused to assist federal agents with ICE; they decided to escalate it by forcing all employees to act as big brother,” Sexton posted Thursday to the social media platform X.
“The time is now to rescind the big brother executive order and return to normal communications with state and federal authorities,” Sexton’s post read. Sexton tagged Tennessee Congressman Mark Green, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathon Skrmetti and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in his post.
Sexton’s post is the latest in a series of public criticisms in recent weeks targeting O’Connell, a Democrat who leads Tennessee’s most populous city, which also serves as the seat of the GOP-controlled General Assembly.
  Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton’s June 5 post on X.
Last week, Tennessee Republican Congressman Andy Ogles accused the mayor of obstructing the work of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, citing O’Connell’s public statements criticizing mass enforcement activities that swept up nearly 200 people in the heart of the city’s immigrant neighborhoods in early May.
Ogles’ Memorial Day press conference excoriating O’Connell was followed in short order by Trump Administration officials’ appearances on conservative television programs to denounce the mayor. 
White House “border czar” Tom Homan appeared on Fox News and threatened to “flood the zone” with immigration enforcement efforts in retaliation for O’Connell’s comments about the joint enforcement action between the Tennessee Highway Patrol and agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Then, Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs, accused O’Connell of “harboring” immigrants without legal status and “doxxing” immigration enforcement agents, in video of her appearance on Newsmax that was posted on the agency’s official X account. 
Last Thursday, two Republican-led U.S. House committees launched an inquiry into the response by Nashville’s mayor to federal immigration enforcement activities. 
A letter sent Thursday by the House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees demanded a series of documents from O’Connell by June 12. The letter accused the mayor of actions that  “threaten to chill immigration enforcement in the City of Nashville and Davidson County.”
The accusations against O’Connell center on the mayor’s public statements condemning the Nashville immigration sweeps – and a longstanding executive order requiring city departments to report interactions with immigration officials within three days.

“What’s clear today is that people who do not share our values of safety and community have the authority to cause deep community harm,” O’Connell said at the time. 
“Their approach is not our understanding of what a Nashville for all of us looks like, and we’re grateful to our community partners who make all of our residents feel welcome,” he said.
O’Connell also issued a revision to the existing executive order in early May, amid mass immigrant detainments in the city’s largely immigrant neighborhood of South Nashville, to require the reporting of interactions between city personnel and federal immigration officials take place within 24 hours.

The order requires all emergency and some non-emergency city agencies and officials to report these interactions to the Mayor’s Office of New and Indigenous Americans, a department created to foster civic participation.
That department posted a spreadsheet with summaries of the interactions on its website. 
The initial public posts identified three federal immigration officials by their full names, and one by her first name, posts that were inadvertent, the mayor’s office later said. 
“It is not the normal practice to include the names of individuals in EO30 (the executive order) reporting. Any names mistakenly included have been removed,” a statement from the mayor’s office last week said.
A request for comment from O’Connell’s office about Sexton’s remarks was not immediately returned Thursday.

Haaland, who is running as a Democratic candidate for governor, told attendees at a water summit 'the future of our communities depends on us using water wisely.' (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)While New Mexico faces threats from climate change, the Trump administration poses a much greater threat to the state’s water supplies, former U.S. Interior Secretary and 2025 Democratic primary gubernatorial candidate Deb Haaland said Thursday.
“Right now we face a much larger challenge,” she said during her keynote speech at a Santa Fe water conference. “The Trump administration is putting our progress at risk. Haaland listed the White House firings of federal staff; cancellations of grants to federal projects; and proposed budget reductions for water, public lands and tribal communities, as examples.
“Cuts, cuts, cuts — that’s all they do,” Haaland said. “When drought conditions strike, we need these systems to be resilient enough for us to rely on. Our future will count on us holding the line and leaders who can fight back.”
Haaland, in her signature white sneakers and a cornflower blue suit, addressed the crowd of about 100 attendees seated inside a committee room at the Roundhouse for a two-day water summit hosted by the City of Santa Fe.
Most of Haaland’s speech focused on the need for collaboration, conservation and working closer with tribal governments on water issues, as climate change has rapidly stressed the Colorado River and Rio Grande.
Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo, opened her speech with memories of hauling buckets for cooking and washing at her grandmother’s house in Mesita, saying the experience instilled a deep respect for water.
“We must manage the water resources with every community in mind collaboratively and above all, respect one another,” she said.
But further conservation will be needed, she said, such as additional watershed restoration, infrastructure needs and better metering and sustainability processes for aquifers.
“We need to modernize and expand groundwater management, our basins are long overdrawn, and we must be dedicated to managing this,” she said. “We must think in terms of generations and not budget years.”
Haaland said Pueblo and tribal involvement needs to be a priority, saying that her experience in negotiations on the Colorado River offered creative solutions such as the Gila River Tribe’s idea to float solar panels on canals to prevent water loss.
“I will say that bringing the tribes to the table was the best thing that we could have ever done, because they brought ideas. They brought generations of experience in water stewardship with them to the table,” she said.
Haaland took two questions from the audience. One asked about the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to refuse to hear the Apache Stronghold’s case to stop a copper mine from destroying Oak Flat, a sacred site.
She encouraged nonprofits to ask the tribal governments involved in the case for direction, and said it wasn’t under her power during her time in the U.S. Department of the Interior.
“I wasn’t able to do anything to stop that, and it’s regrettable that this has happened, but more of these things are going to happen during this administration,” she said. “I think it’s on all of us to be as strong as we can and fight back where and when we can.”
A second question from the audience asked about the “elephant in the room” of how she might approach water-intensive crops as governor.
She said the state needs to encourage research and development into technologies such as underground irrigation (often called deep-root irrigation).
“I feel very strongly that in order to save our agricultural tradition here in New Mexico that we really need to look at the ways that we can help move those things forward and assist farmers in implementing some of these techniques, buying equipment,” she said.
In February, Haaland announced her 2026 bid for governor. If elected, she would be the first Native American person to head the state government in its 113-year history. She is facing challengers including 2nd Judicial District Attorney Sam Bregman and Ken Miyagashima, the former mayor of Las Cruces, running as Democrats and Rio Rancho Mayor Greggory Hull running as a Republican.

(Photo by Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld lower court decisions barring counties from imposing safety standards on a pipeline subject to federal safety standards. 
The cases involved Summit Carbon Solutions, the company proposing to build a carbon sequestration pipeline through the state, and county supervisors from both Story and Shelby Counties. 
Summit sued the counties in 2022 for enacting ordinances that required county-specific setback requirements and other regulations the company argued were preempted by federal pipeline safety laws. 
A federal judge ruled in favor of Summit in Dec. 2023 and issued permanent injunctions, stopping the counties from enforcing the regulations, which would have impacted the carbon sequestration pipeline and other pipelines. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The county supervisors appealed the decision and presented oral arguments in November 2024 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The counties argued that local land use and zoning regulations are not “preempted standards” under the Pipeline Safety Act. 
Writing for the appeals court, U.S. Circuit Judge Duane Benton wrote held that the county ordinances “focus” on safety and “repeatedly” mention safety risks associated with the pipeline, which “undermines” the Pipeline Safety Act’s goal of preempting state regulations on safety. 
“This holding does not prohibit local governments from considering safety, nor prevent them from enacting all zoning ordinances, as the counties suggest,” Benton said in the opinion. “This court emphasizes the distinction between safety standards — which the PSA preempts — and safety considerations — which the PSA does not preempt.” 
The county ordinances also included emergency response requirements and abandonment provisions which the court ruled were also preempted by federal regulations. 
Circuit Judge Jane Kelly, however, dissented on those elements and wrote she does not believe that PSA preempts setback and abandonment provisions. Kelly said that while the counties’ setback requirements are “animated in part by safety considerations” they do not have the “direct and substantial” effect on safety that is reserved for federal regulation. 
Kelly also wrote that per her understanding, the Pipeline Safety Act “does not cover pipelines that have been abandoned” and therefore the Shelby County abandonment provision is not “expressly preempted.”
The court affirmed the lower court’s decision in both cases, but ordered the federal court for the Southern District of Iowa to reconsider an additional ordinance that’s at issue in the Story County case. 
Jason Craig, the attorney representing the counties, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision. 
Sabrina Zenor, on behalf of Summit Carbon Solutions, said the ruling “confirms” pipeline safety regulation set by the federal government and the Iowa Utilities Commission’s role in route and permit decisions. 
“This supports a consistent, lawful permitting process for critical infrastructure projects like ours,” Zenor said in a statement.

Ned Lamont describes his current thinking on seeking a third term. (Photo by Mark Pazniokas/CT Mirror)Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday that the challenges of navigating the economic uncertainties and political chaos generated by President Donald J. Trump only increase the chances he will seek a third term as governor of Connecticut in 2026.
“If you had asked me a year ago, I would have said, ‘No, I think the state’s on a good trajectory. We’ve stabilized things. We’re growing again. Time to pass the mantle,’” Lamont said.
He said he no longer is so eager to step aside.
“It’s also an incredibly complicated time right now, starting with all the uncertainty of Washington, the increased possibility of a recession,” Lamont said. “So, maybe a time where experience makes a difference. That’s a way of saying I’m thinking about it seriously.”
Lamont, 71, a self-described centrist Democrat, stopped well short of declaring his candidacy, but he gave his strongest indication to date of an inclination to seek another four-year term with Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz.
“I love the job,” he said. “I think we’ve had extraordinary progress compared to where we were, say, 10 years ago. I think Susan and I are a pretty good team.”
Lamont met with reporters in his Capitol office at midday, just 12 hours after the General Assembly reached its constitutional adjournment deadline of midnight Wednesday.
“We got some extraordinary folks and Democrats, and I work very closely with each and every one of them,” he said.
But sees himself with an edge.
“I think it’s executive experience, having sat in this chair for the last six and a half years, having been through the Trump administration, having been through COVID, having worked closely with the leadership on both sides of the aisle,” Lamont said.
He defended the granular details of the recently adopted budget and the broad strokes of his record as a governor overseeing a remarkable series of budget surpluses that have filled the state’s budget reserves and allowed the state to pay down unfunded pension debt.
With those surpluses has come pressure from the political left to address unmet needs, including low Medicaid reimbursement rates for medical providers. Lamont, they say, is too concerned with keeping spending within the state’s fiscal guardrails.
The criticism is not discouraging him as he finalizes a decision whether to run, he said.

“I’m a lot more inclined and interested in keeping going, keep this positive momentum going, than I was, say, six months or a year ago. That said, I still have some conversations to make. I put everything on hold during this last four or five months. We had a pretty tricky budget session to get through.”
The “tricky” part was finding ways to satisfy Democrats lawmakers within the constraints of spending caps.
“I think it’s an honestly balanced budget,” Lamont said, adding it’s based upon “a pretty conservative set of assumptions.”
The budget assumes that household income will grow about 4% annually over the next two years. But it also stretches Connecticut’s budget controls without breaking them legally.
The largest initiative, a new $220 million endowment to grow early education and child care services dramatically over the next decade, will be established outside of the formal budget and spending cap.
In doing so, the leaders of the Republican legislative minorities say Lamont is losing his credibility as a fiscal centrist, a theme the GOP will try to develop if Lamont runs.
“Fiscal moderation has officially left the state Capitol,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, proclaimed recently.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said, “This budget eviscerates all of our fiscal guardrails.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, smiled Wednesday when asked about the GOP efforts to define Lamont as a born-again, tax-and-spend liberal.
“The governor is being attacked by the left and the right, and so he’s probably here,” Ritter said, pointing to the center of the table. “And the answer is, always here.”
On Thursday, Lamont concurred: the political center is his comfort zone. He noted that Republicans regularly have claimed his two-year budgets were built on shaky foundations.

“‘You’re going to be in deficit within two years. You’re going to be raising taxes.’ Well, at six years later, stop crying wolf,” Lamont said.
Despite the off-budget spending on early childhood education, the governor estimated that at least $1.2 billion of this fiscal year’s $2.4 billion projected surplus still would be used to cover more unfunded pension liabilities
He reiterated his intention to veto a bill that would give jobless benefits to strikers, a source of tension with the Connecticut AFL-CIO. He also announced an intention to veto a bill sought by Republicans — and opposed both by the building trades unions and the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
The measure, House Bill 7004, is intended to give Plainfield, a small town in eastern Connecticut, the ability to hold a referendum over a proposed trash-to-energy plant and possibly influence the state Siting Council to block the project. He briefly deferred a question about the bill to a senior staff, who confirmed it indeed would be vetoed.
“I’m vetoing that,” Lamont said, laughing. “I just made that strong decision by myself.”
Lamont said he welcomed passage of a bill encouraging housing construction, though he had yet to finish reviewing it.
“We’re never going to get economic growth [and] keep it going if we don’t have a place for people to live, young people to live, workforce housing, getting our cities growing again,” he said.
Opponents in Fairfield County have urged him to veto the bill.
“I think there’s some red flags in it, and I know why it makes people nervous,” he said. “But it’s basically gross misrepresentation from the anti-growth people down there that are stirring people up. They’re saying it’s a big mandate. You’re gonna forcing me to build housing, you know, in my backyard, which is not what the strategy is at all. It’s trying to tell towns, you take the lead, you show us where you want that housing to go. It’s important for your community.”

Accounting for births and deaths, the net population gain from immigration in those years was about 4.4 million, CBO said.Across the country, state and local governments spent about $19.3 billion in goods and services for those immigrants, with costs concentrated on providing education and shelter, CBO estimated.The $9.2 billion direct net cost amounts to 0.3% of state and local spending, CBO said.“State and local governments saw both their tax revenues and their spending increase in 2023 as a result of the surge in immigration,” the CBO report said. “In CBO’s estimation, the increase in spending was greater than the increase in taxes.”In an alternative calculation, CBO estimated that when accounting for indirect effects — for example, increases in property taxes and economic activity, greater demand for government services — the surge led to a spending increase of $28.6 billion and increased revenue of $18.8 billion for state and local governments, netting a loss of roughly $9.8 billion.More than half of newly arrived immigrants resided in six states: California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas.CBO estimated that in 2023, about 550,000 children in public schools, or 1.1% of students, were immigrants who’d arrived since 2021. “In CBO’s estimation, the surge in immigration directly increased spending for public primary and secondary education by $5.7 billion, or 0.7 percent, in 2023,” according to the report.Those higher costs were “due to lower English proficiency among the surge population.”“Because recent immigrants are often English-language learners, they tend to need additional instructional and support services,” according to the report. “CBO estimates that those services cost state and local governments $1.2 billion in 2023.”Another high cost was shelter services, CBO found. Four states — New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Colorado — “spent a total of $3.3 billion to provide shelter and related services, including food and legal support, to the surge population in 2023,” according to the report.In 2021, the Biden administration dealt with the highest levels of migration at the southern border in 20 years. In an effort to ease the increase at the U.S.-Mexico border, several programs were created to allow migrants to obtain work permits or enter the country while their asylum cases were pending before immigration court.A nonpartisan New York think tank that studies domestic and international migration, the Center for Migration Studies, released a report that found the population of people in the United States without permanent legal status increased to by 2 million to 12.2 million by 2023, using the most recent Census Bureau American Community Survey data.",,,,2025-06-05 18:04:23.424855

Idaho will participate in the jail enforcement model under the 287(g) program, which allows ICE to delegate specific immigration officer functions to state and local law enforcement officers, according to a news release Gov. Brad Little issued Thursday. 
State officials said Idaho State Police will only be targeting and transporting people who have been convicted of a crime and are finishing their incarceration sentence. Instead of releasing the inmates to the community after they complete their sentence, they will be directly transported to ICE facilities in Idaho for detention, state officials said.

“Idaho is stepping up to help the Trump administration transport dangerous illegal alien criminals to ICE facilities instead of being released back into our communities,” Little said in a written statement. “These are people who have committed crimes such as domestic violence, robbery, driving under the influence, and other dangerous activities that threaten Idaho families. Idaho has taken many steps to increase our coordination with the Trump administration in the enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws, and I want to further strengthen our state’s partnership with President Trump to help address the national emergency posed by years of reckless border policies under the Biden-Harris administration.”
  Idaho State Police seeks funding to transport immigrants to deportation facilities 

Idaho State Police is seeking $300,000 in funding to pay for the transports, state officials said. The money would be used to provide up to 100 transports from Idaho jails or prisons to ICE facilities for deportation, such as the Jefferson County Detention Center in Rigby, state officials said. 
Idaho State Police will not be able to carry out any ICE transfers until the Idaho State Board of Examiners approves the funding request, which could occur as early as next week.

“I’m really encouraged to see Idaho making its communities safer by signing on with our 287(g) program,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said in a written statement. “You have to remember that we’re talking about criminals — and often, they won’t take an arrest sitting down — so when local jails are allowed to turn them over to ICE in a safe setting, we don’t need to send dozens of federal law enforcement officers into the public to make arrests. Partnerships like this one keep offenders out of communities and protect our families, friends and neighbors.”

The new Idaho State Police/ICE partnership essentially implements the transport aspects of House Bill 83, a Texas-style immigration bill that the Idaho Legislature passed and Little signed into law earlier this year. 
However, a judge temporarily blocked House Bill 83 from taking effect in March after ACLU of Idaho filed a lawsuit against the state, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Under the 287(g) program, ICE is allowed to partner with local law enforcement agencies and the state does not need to resolve the legal challenge over House Bill 83 before moving ahead with transporting people convicted of a crime to ICE detention centers for deportation, state officials said. 
Earlier this year, Little also issued an executive order that called for state agencies to continue collaborating with ICE and called on state agencies to consider formal procedures to assist with the enforcement of immigration law. 
Idaho State Police officials began discussing the partnership with ICE after Little issued the executive order in February, state officials said. 
It was not exactly clear how many people convicted of a crime in Idaho would be subject to transfer to ICE facilities for deportation under Idaho’s new partnership. However, state officials used the term “hundreds” several times and said that each of the up to 100 transports to ICE facilities would include multiple people.

AESC is now pausing construction. (Provided by Florence County Economic Development)A battery cell maker is pausing work on its manufacturing plant under construction in the Pee Dee, delaying its pledge of 1,600 new jobs for South Carolinians.
Envision Automotive Energy Supply Co. (AESC) announced the work stoppage Thursday, two years after breaking ground on the facility near Florence.
“AESC has informed the state of South Carolina and our local partners that due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” spokesman Brad Grantham said in a statement. “We anticipate being able to resume construction once circumstances stabilize.”
The Japanese-headquartered firm already has invested more than $1 billion into the Florence facility, Grantham said.
He said the company “fully intends to meet our commitments to invest $1.6 billion and create 1,600 jobs in the coming years,” but did not indicate what the new timeline might be. The company declined to provide further comment.
Gov. Henry McMaster, while speaking to reporters, pointed to uncertainty over rising tariffs enacted by the Trump Administration, as well provisions in Republicans’ massive bill on taxes and spending that could eliminate electric vehicle tax credits — both for people who purchase new or used electric vehicles and those that install EV charging stations at their homes or business.
“We hate to see that happen, but a pause is OK,” McMaster said.
“We’re just urging caution. Let things play out, because all of these changes are taking place,” the governor added. “We believe that give it some time and it’ll work out.”
Electric vehicle sales have continued to rise, both nationally and globally. Still, the speed of that growth has not met with early expectations.
Electric vehicle battery companies in SC among the latest to hit speed bumps

The lag has led to multiple setbacks for the fledgling industry, with canceled investments both nationally and in the Palmetto State, as well as automakers easing away from goals of going all-electric in favor of a mix of electric and plug-in hybrids. A repeal of consumer tax credits could further slow progress.
AESC’s pause comes just four months after the battery cell manufacturer pulled back on earlier plans to expand the plant beyond its original scope.
BMW contracted with AESC to produce battery cells for the German auto giant’s U.S. manufacturing facilities in the Upstate. The automaker has already invested $700 million dollars in its own battery plant in Woodruff, planning to place the cells it receives from AESC into the batteries it assembles there.
BMW spokesman Steve Wilson said those battery assembly plans are still on schedule to begin in 2026.
Between the initial announcement in 2022 and March 2024, AESC rolled out three separate rounds of investment and promises of jobs in Florence. In addition to supplying BMW’s Spartanburg County assembly plant, the company made plans for a second building the was supposed to produce battery cells for a BMW plant in Mexico.
But in February, AESC told the state the first factory would be enough to meet the demand for both of BMW’s facilities. It pulled out of plans for a second, $1.5 billion building, along with the 1,080 jobs that came with it.
In turn, South Carolina withdrew its offer of $111 million in state funding for that particular phase.
The incentives claw back was a rare move for the state. But even with the pull back, AESC’s remaining plant had still been on track to become the largest economic development deal in the Pee Dee region, according to the state Department of Commerce.
The remaining $121 million in bonds and $135 million in grants Commerce offered as an initial incentive to lure AESC to South Carolina are so far unaffected by the shutdown, Commerce spokeswoman Alex Clark.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Discussions about rising energy costs may have dominated this past Maryland General Assembly session. But even higher bills are on the way.
Beginning June 1, elevated rates took effect for utilities across Maryland, from Baltimore Gas & Electric to Delmarva Power and Pepco. The reasons go back to economics class: low supply and high demand. But who is to blame depends on who you ask.
Ratepayer advocates are quick to point the finger at PJM Interconnection, which operates the power grid in a 13-state region, including Maryland, for policies that have driven rates higher. They argue it has been slow to bring renewable energy projects online, constraining the supply, and it failed to account for skyrocketing demand from data centers.
PJM says it’s been warning of the impending supply crunch since “early 2023,” and that a combination of other market forces are at play — including climate change policy shuttering coal plants.
Years of market changes and policy choices have landed Maryland ratepayers in their current predicament, said Laurel Peltier, chair of the Maryland Energy Advocates Coalition, which focuses on low-income utility ratepayers.
“It’s like a teapot that’s been simmering — and it’s been simmering for a decade,” said Peltier, who is also an AARP Maryland utility advocate.
How much are my bills going up this time?
The exact amount of the increase differs depending on where you live. A report from the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, released last August, estimated that Delmarva Power households could see a $4 monthly increase, Pepco and SMECO customers could see a $14 increase and Potomac Edison customers could see an $18 increase.
BGE customers would fare the worst, with a $21 jump. But BGE ratepayers got some welcome news last week, when Maryland’s utility regulator, the Public Service Commission, ordered the utility company to spread out the increase, dulling the impact this summer, when bills will already be soaring due to higher energy use, and sharpening the impact in the fall, when bills are typically lower.

As a result, the increase will be $10 to $15 less than expected on customer’s bills from June through August. But from September through November, bills will be $10 to $15 higher than expected, according to Kathy Fueston, a spokesperson for the PSC.
But ultimately, BGE customers will pay the same total amount.
What’s the reason for this latest increase?
The story starts with PJM Interconnection, which runs an annual auction called the capacity market auction, which essentially ensures there is sufficient power during peak times.
Last year’s auction, which covers 2025, cleared at a record high price — an 800% increase compared to the year before, costing ratepayers a total of $14.7 billion in capacity costs, compared to $2.2 billion previously.
PJM blames the shutdown of costly coal and oil plants, and energy demands from data centers and the electrification of homes and cars, among other factors.
“These higher prices are the result of a loss in electricity supply caused primarily by decarbonization policies that have led to an uptick in generator retirements, coupled with an unprecedented spike in electricity demand due largely to the advancement of data centers to power artificial intelligence, the electrification of vehicles and heating systems, and the onshoring of U.S. manufacturing,” wrote Jeffrey Shields, a spokesman for PJM, in a statement.
But Maryland People’s Counsel David Lapp, who represents Maryland ratepayers, argued that PJM is “not being straightforward.”
He argues that power-hungry data centers, largely in Virginia, are the primary reason for the increase in demand. If it weren’t for those facilities, the demand, or load, on the PJM grid might not be increasing at all — even with the rise of EVs and electric heat pumps.




What can customers do to lower their own bills?
Laurel Peltier, who volunteers to provide energy advice to ratepayers in Baltimore, said her first suggestion is always for Marylanders to “know their numbers,” and check their latest utility bill, which often means heading online.
“If it’s telling you that you’re an outlier and you’re using a lot more energy than your neighbors – it’s true,” Peltier said.
Through Maryland’s EmPOWER program, which all customers already pay for with a line item on their utility bills, Marylanders can get a free “quick home energy check.”
“That right there sometimes can alert somebody,” Peltier said. “More than likely what it is, is you have a leaky house and you have an old HVAC system.”
BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos said the utility is also trying to advertise energy-saving methods for customers amid the higher rates, everything from the EmPOWER programs to using blinds to keep the sunshine from warming your home during the summer months.
“Our big thing right now is to make sure that customers are aware of ways to save energy,” he said.
Customers who are behind on bills, especially low-income ratepayers, may also be eligible for financial assistance, Alexopulos said.
“The big refrain here is, customers that are struggling to pay their bills, please contact us,” Alexopulos said. “We have these programs and we can help connect them with energy assistance.”
Whether it’s an old refrigerator sitting in the garage, or an energy-gobbling space heater (Peltier recommends an electric blanket instead), Peltier said customers need to think more carefully about their energy use amid climbing rates.
“Make this a priority. Find the low-hanging fruit,” Peltier said.




“Those load forecast changes are really driven by data-center growth,” Lapp said. “There has been very little growth in demand for quite some time, because of efficiency technologies. More efficient light bulbs, that sort of thing.”
It’s true that Maryland fossil fuel power plants are retiring, and this is impacting energy markets, Lapp said. But Lapp lays some of this blame at PJM’s feet.
Faced with a capacity shortage, PJM is requiring two fossil fuel power plants that were going to be retire this year, Talen Energy’s Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner, to keep operating through 2029. It will cost ratepayers about $145 million annually to keep coal-fired Brandon Shores running and $35 million annually for oil-powered Wagner.
But when it held its annual capacity auction in 2024, PJM did not include the output from the two Talen Energy plants in the mix. That caused prices for 2025 to go up: The Office of People’s Counsel estimates that costs rose $5 billion in the auction because of the exclusion of the two plants.
Since last summer’s auction, PJM has changed its policy, with the approval of federal regulators. The electricity generated from “reliability must-run agreements,” like the ones for Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner, must be included in the auction.
“Everyone knows that that’s not fair, to require customers to pay twice, and yet, that’s exactly what’s going to happen starting June 1,” Lapp said.
Emily Scarr, a senior adviser at Maryland PIRG who focuses on energy issues, said PJM also should have predicted that coal plants would retire, and it is responsible for planning adjustments to the electric grid accordingly.
“They say it’s a supply and demand imbalance. But what they don’t explain is: ‘Oh, we’re actually the ones who are in charge of controlling supply and demand, and we haven’t done our job,’” Scarr said.
Peltier, the low-income ratepayer advocate, worries about the customers who have been swept up in the recent price hikes, and are now behind on their bills. For instance, BGE recently reported that residential customers were a total of $171 million in arrears, compared to $97 million just last June. In a statement, BGE spokesman Nick Alexopulos cited cold temperatures in January and February 2025, which forced customers to use more energy to heat their homes.
But Republicans in the General Assembly say state policymakers are to blame for the supply shortage, and the resulting rate increases, which they attribute to the state’s policies to reduce carbon emissions. They note that all the state’s coal plants have announced plans to shut down in the years ahead.
“Maryland’s soaring electric rates are not a mystery — they’re a direct result of bad policy choices made by Democratic leaders,” wrote Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready in a recent statement.
“Their obsession with ‘green goals’ has come at the expense of energy reliability and affordability,” Ready wrote. “Now, plants they forced offline are still running because the grid can’t survive without them, and ratepayers are stuck paying hundreds of millions for that mistake.”
Lapp disagrees that Maryland policies played a role. Perhaps some of the blame could be chalked up to federal Clean Air Act policy requiring changes to how plants are operated, he said, but largely, it’s economics.
“Gas is a lot cheaper. Renewables don’t require fuel,” Lapp said. “So, there’s a reason why most of the PJM queue is wind and solar and battery.”
But a backlog in PJM’s queue for new power generation to come online has also influenced the supply curve, Scarr said.

“They’ve created this whole problem themselves, and if they just let clean energy connect, we wouldn’t be in this situation,” Scarr said.
A recent report predicted that Maryland ratepayers could save an average of $546 a year on their electric bills from 2025 to 2040 if PJM implements a laundry list of reforms to clear the bottleneck.
For its part, PJM argues that it is already making a number of reforms to the queue, including a new initiative to expedite “shovel-ready” projects.
In early May, PJM released the list of 51 projects it will expedite through the program, including 22 in Virginia and two in Maryland: a battery storage project in Harford County and an upgrade at a natural gas plant in Prince George’s County.
What happens next?
Lapp and the PSC, backed by 87 Maryland lawmakers, have asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to provide relief from rising rates, by overturning the $5 billion worth of auction costs associated with the Talen Energy deal.
“You just can recalculate the results of the auction, by counting the [Talen Energy] units,” Lapp said. “They could do that quickly.”
A FERC spokesperson declined to comment on when the commission might issue a ruling.
Lapp’s office asked FERC for expedited consideration before June 1. With a decision now coming later than that, Lapp said it’s possible that consumers could receive a future credit on their bills, if FERC rules in his favor.
All Maryland ratepayers are already due to receive a rebate on their utility bills next month. The rebate is estimated at $40 per household, though it depends on a customer’s electricity usage. A second payment is scheduled for January.










It’s like a teapot that's been simmering — and it's been simmering for a decade.

It comes from the Maryland General Assembly, which passed an energy reform package just before it adjourned in April. The total sum, about $200 million, is coming from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which is fueled by electricity generators, who submit “alternative compliance payments” when they do not purchase the required amount of renewable energy credits to comply with state law.
But the main thrust of the General Assembly’s energy reforms was increasing power generation and energy storage in the state, by creating streamlined permitting processes for both at the Maryland Public Service Commission. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have highlighted the fact that the state imports more power from other states than it generates within its borders.
Lapp questions whether increasing power generation in the state is needed, especially given that improvements are underway to transmission infrastructure, including to accommodate the eventual closure of Brandon Shores and Wagner.
“The fact that Maryland is a net importer, that’s nothing new, and it’s nothing to be alarmed about, especially because the amount that Maryland imports does not reflect a limitation on Maryland’s ability to generate energy,” he said. “It’s economics.”
He also wonders whether the legislature’s streamlined permitting process at the PSC is a big enough carrot to actually spur significant new power generators to set up shop in Maryland.
“Private companies, they already are able to build plants in Maryland, if the economics work out. So the question there is, does a little easier siting process — Does that change the economics?” Lapp said. “I’m not sure that it will.”

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)The U.S. government’s import taxes could significantly cut the amount of goods coming through New Mexico, and thereby reduce how much money the state government has to maintain its highways, the state transportation agency’s head economist told lawmakers on Thursday.
At the legislative Transportation Infrastructure Revenue Subcommittee’s first interim meeting since this year’s legislative session, New Mexico Department of Transportation Chief Economist Michael Morrison said the tariffs enacted by the Trump administration so far could impact revenues used to pay for road maintenance.
Making it more expensive to import and export goods could shrink the amount of imported goods into the country; reduce the number of commercial vehicles travelling through New Mexico to and from ports; and bring down commercial trucking and diesel fuel tax revenues, according to Morrison’s presentation to the committee.
Two major interstate highways, I-40 and I-10, carry goods from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach through New Mexico to Texas and other states to the east.
Morrison told the committee he expects a decrease of imports that travel through New Mexico between 3% and 11%, depending on the overall tariff rate. He said he is still developing an estimate for exports.
“Additionally, we expect to see some impacts on national income and New Mexico income that should have ripple effects in terms of lowering our consumption of all goods, which will also reduce weight-distance and diesel taxes,” Morrison told the committee. “There’s less consumption of all goods, less freight.”
That tracks with analysis released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which found that while Trump’s tariffs would decrease the federal government’s deficit, they would also shrink the U.S. economy overall and raise consumer costs.
Trump doubles tariffs on steel and aluminum

Rep. Rod Montoya (R-Farmington) told the committee he is incredulous about the tariffs’ potential impact, called Morrison’s presentation “vast speculation” and said he doesn’t think the tariffs will stay in place long-term.
“It’s interesting to me that we’re doing this level of handwringing over tariffs, when what we’ve seen is from the President going in like he does — and like in his books — negotiating as high as he possibly can, and then getting a deal, and then there’s disruption for a period of time, but then it normalizes.”
Part of why the tariffs haven’t yet resulted in increased prices and empty store shelves is because most retailers and importers planned ahead by rushing orders before the tariffs took effect, Morrison said.
A 20- to 40-day delay occurs as ships travel across the Pacific, so a decision made by importers now won’t show up in freight changes or on store shelves for up to a month or more, he said.
Long before the second Trump administration, the department has been doing less roadwork because its road maintenance budget has stayed flat while construction costs have increased, said Transportation Secretary Ricky Serna.
Money raised from state taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel, vehicle sales and commercial trucking taxes and fees goes into the State Road Fund, which pays for highway maintenance, according to legislative analysts. New construction is paid for using the General Fund, the state government’s largest pot of money.
Morrison projects the State Road Fund’s spending power will decline by 51% by 2050 due to inflation and increased construction costs, while road construction costs in the same period will increase by 160%. The cost of building new roads has tripled since 2003, according to his presentation.

“We’re not hinging the demise of the State Road Fund relative to construction costs on tariffs,” Serna said.
He said the department started shifting to buying American-made aluminum and steel during the Biden administration after the U.S. enacted the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes a provision requiring all iron, steel, manufactured products and construction materials used in some infrastructure projects to be produced domestically.
On Tuesday, Trump signed a directive doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%.
Also putting a strain on the department’s roadwork efforts was the Legislature’s failure to pass House Bill 145, which would have provided the state Transportation Commission with $1.5 billion in bonding authority to pay for major construction projects.
Serna said the bill would have covered New Mexico’s road construction needs for the next eight to 10 years.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-0709-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 18:04:23.424855

The symbolism, they hope, is the continued momentum around rebuilding the historic but largely abandoned downtown Jackson neighborhood.
Nonprofits 2C Mississippi, Farish Street Community of Shalom, and the city’s urban renewal group, Jackson Redevelopment Authority, held the groundbreaking for a new green space between Amite Street and James Meredith Drive. Organizers see the project as both a communal gathering place as well as a shelter and heat sponge.
“This is a historic moment on Farish Street,” said Dorothy Davis, executive director of the Farish Street Community of Shalom.

The groups first announced the green space project last year, building off a 2020 study they did identifying Jackson’s “heat islands,” or urban areas that are much hotter because they lack tree coverage and bodies of water. The study found that parts of downtown Jackson got up to 10 degrees hotter than outer parts of the city during the summer.
Davis said the project’s next phase will be tearing down brick walls and planting new grass and trees, which she said they’ll start in the next couple of weeks. Volunteers will continue to monitor temperatures over the next five years. Davis added they’ll hope to have a new stage built by early next year and then begin work on an amphitheater.
The groups are funding the project with a $1.5 million grant through the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service. 
The ceremony followed another groundbreaking in April for the Leonard Court project, which will rebuild 67 old homes into new affordable housing in the Farish Street Historical District. That project is set to finish by summer 2026. 
Christopher Pike, executive director of JRA, which owns and will continue to manage the space, said they’ll use the park to host events such as the neighborhood’s annual Juneteenth celebration.
“It’ll just be a park for people to come and hang out,” Pike said. “We’ve been talking to people about maybe doing yoga, that type of stuff. So it’ll be an activated space.
“Obviously there’s an environmental component, which is (tackling the) heat island, but there’s also the quality of life component because most communities you see that are really vibrant have these very activated green spaces.”

Pike teased other new projects in the works along Farish Street: in “eight to 12 months” Pike hopes to have another groundbreaking for the Soul City Market, which includes plans for a food hall, stand-alone restaurants, a Farish Street history museum, and loft apartments on the buildings’ second floors. Pike said the projects would together cost around $30 million, which JRA hopes to fund through both tax credits and rebates as well as private sources.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/05115849/Farish-Street-Green-Commons-1.jpg,,,2025-06-05 18:04:23.424855

(Getty Images)A coalition representing universities, environmental conservation nonprofits and more has released what it says is a roadmap to protecting and conserving waterways in the Ohio River basin.
The 96-page draft plan released Thursday details numerous challenges ranging from industrial and coal mining pollution to the proliferation of invasive species and extreme flooding driven by climate change. 
The report also calls for more funding for water infrastructure and water quality monitoring and for more collaboration among the federal government and local, tribal and state governments. 
Jordan Lubetkin, the senior director of Ohio River restoration at the National Wildlife Federation, during a Thursday press conference said trying to fix “serious and complex environmental problems across vast geographies” is hard, expensive and takes time. 
“This report is premised on a concept that has proven wildly successful in other parts of the country. That is namely, when local, state and tribal governments partner with the federal government to restore large landscapes, good things happen,” Luketkin said. 
The coalition points to coordinated efforts that have worked to restore waters and wetlands such as the Chesapeake Bay, the Everglades, the Great Lakes and Puget Sound as examples of what could be possible. Democratic U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Louisville introduced a bill last year, co-sponsored by Republican U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin of Southern Indiana, that sought to create a new federal office overseeing the restoration of the Ohio River basin. 
The plan was released by the Ohio River Basin Alliance, the University of Louisville’s Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute and the National Wildlife Federation but had contributions from hundreds of people across West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Illinois, Tennessee and other states. The plan also pulled feedback from community listening sessions in the Ohio River Basin over the course of 2022 and 2023. 
The problems facing waterways and wetlands across the 204,000 square miles of the Ohio River basin are multifold: Waterways have been altered through the digging of ditches, drainage of wetlands and construction of dams and levees. Wastewater, stormwater and drinking water infrastructure is complex, aging and failing. Pollution into waters comes from acid mine drainage, agriculture, fracking and other industries. 
Ted Smith, director of the Center for Healthy Air, Water and Soil at the University of Louisville’s Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, said hundreds of toxic Superfund sites in the Ohio River basin have yet to be fully remediated. 
“We’ve all experienced more extreme weather events, and here in Kentucky we’ve had regular, significant flooding, 100 year floods every few years,” Smith said. Not cleaning up those Superfund sites, he said, puts “the whole water system at significant risk every year.” 
“The future of the country is really going to hang on our ability to address the integrity of these water systems and do it in a way that’s going to work for generations to come,” Smith said.
Despite waters throughout Kentucky and the Ohio River basin already being impaired by pollution, Smith said he’s optimistic that “this is something that can be addressed.” 
The report also notes the need to strengthen and enforce water quality regulations. 
“The failure to update and enforce clean water protections threatens to not only undermine restoration progress (e.g., investing in wetland restoration while allowing wetlands to be filled and destroyed), but also jeopardizes public health, restricts outdoor recreation activities, and suppresses economic growth,” the report states. 
When asked how the current weakening of federal and state water quality regulations played a role in the coalition’s plan, Ohio River Basin Alliance chair Chris Lorentz said “regulations to couple with these recommendations are absolutely necessary.” 
“We’re focusing on showcasing the benefits that these investments will result in and hopefully gain stronger support for tighter regulations,” said Lorentz, a professor of biological sciences at Thomas More University in Northern Kentucky. 
Kentucky state lawmakers passed a law this year that significantly limited the state’s ability to regulate water pollution, and the Trump administration is looking at scaling back oversight of waters and wetlands under the Clean Water Act.
The coalition is seeking public comments on the draft plan through July 7.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2157326213-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 18:04:23.424855

Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday said that communication between states and the federal government under the second Trump administration “is nonexistent,” opening the door to catastrophe in the case of a natural disaster or other emergency.
Walz, during an interview with Minnesota Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference in Minneapolis, said that the Trump administration is unprepared for the next disaster — like another global pandemic — and that leaves states particularly vulnerable.
“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.

The Minnesota governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.
Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty.










The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic.


– Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz


Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.
He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray.
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”

(Larry Palmer/USFWS)Citing a population decline and degraded habitat, South Dakota officials have advanced a plan to halt beaver trapping in the Black Hills for two years.
The plan will block trapping during the 2025 and 2026 seasons in the Black Hills Fire Protection District. Trapping would remain open in the rest of the state. The state legislature’s Rules Review Committee will need to approve the moratorium. 
In 2012, biologists saw 60 food caches — piles of woody vegetation built by beavers for winter — in the Black Hills. By 2023, they recorded only 16. Beavers occupied 52% of Black Hills watersheds in 2012, but just 23% in 2023.
Rodent or riparian restorer: East-west views diverge as state considers beaver protections

Beavers once numbered in the thousands in the Black Hills and the millions nationwide, but their numbers began to decline with the onset of fur trapping by European settlers. Officials said habitat loss, not modern trapping, is to blame for current population declines. But they also said they don’t want trapping to contribute to the problem.
“The limiting factor is habitat degradation,” said John Kanta, section chief with the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks. 
Only one beaver trapping was reported in the Black Hills last season.
Without beaver dams, faster-flowing water cuts stream channels too deep for beavers to work with. Cattle also trample streambanks, leaving  fewer willow and aspen for beavers to feed on.
A closed trapping season will help protect the beavers that are being reintroduced, officials say. Game, Fish and Parks is working with the U.S. Forest Service and volunteer groups to restore habitat through tree planting and manmade dams, and nuisance beavers from urban areas are being relocated to the improved habitats.
“It’s a wonderful step,” said Hans Stephenson, owner of Dakota Angler & Outfitter in Rapid City and a volunteer for the restoration efforts.

Beaver dams raise the water table, slow water flow, and create habitat that supports everything from aquatic insects to the brown and rainbow trout favored by anglers, Stephenson said.
Alex Solem, senior wildlife biologist with Game, Fish and Parks, emphasized the broader ecological role beavers play. 
“Any time there’s beaver around, usually, it signals a really healthy ecosystem,” Solem said.
If more Black Hills streams had beaver dams, he said, floodplain soils would hold more water, support grazing, mitigate flooding and lessen the dangers of drought and wildfires.
In addition to the moratorium, officials adopted a new threshold-based framework to guide future decisions. Under that framework, trapping season would reopen if  beaver occupancy in monitored watersheds rose above 80%, Occupancy between 50% and 79% would open the door to resident-only, private-land trapping. Levels below 50%, like now, would trigger automatic closure.

Tim Walz speaks June 5, 2025, to a group of States Newsroom journalists meeting in Minneapolis.  (Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday said that communication between states and the federal government under the second Trump administration “is nonexistent,” opening the door to catastrophe in the case of a natural disaster or other emergency.
Walz, during an interview with Minnesota Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference in Minneapolis, said that the Trump administration is unprepared for the next disaster — like another global pandemic — and that leaves states particularly vulnerable.
“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.
The Minnesota governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.
Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty.
Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.
He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray.
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”

Teitelbaum, who now homeschools her children, said she used to be extremely involved in her child’s school — she was a member of the Parent Teacher Association, worked on a community garden project and developed a food-saving program. She even tried to bring in an FBI agent to teach the children cybersecurity. Eventually, she got frustrated. 
“ It’s not that I don’t want the schools to thrive, I just had to say, at what point do I need to say this is not the best environment for my kids to be in?” she said. 
Teitelbaum was one of a group of homeschooling parents who gathered at the state Capitol Wednesday, where lawmakers and advocates praised them for their successful advocacy against state regulations for homeschooling. They also warned that the battle was not yet won. 
“Homeschool freedom doesn’t mean rejecting traditional schools. It means recognizing that one size does not fit all,” said Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly. “We live in a society that champions diversity in almost every area, so why should education be any exception?”
[RELATED: In CT, homeschooling debate heats up as parents plan daily protests at Capitol]
Homeschooling has been a topic of intense debate in Hartford since the Office of the Child Advocate released a report in early May that found withdrawals of children from public schools for homeschooling had been used to hide abuse.
Out of an analysis of about 750 children over the age of 7 who were withdrawn to be homeschooled between 2021 and 2024, about a quarter were in families where there had been at least one report of abuse or neglect accepted by the Department of Children and Families. 
The child advocate recommended that homeschool families be required by law to provide annual documentation of enrollment and that the children be given an independent evaluation on their academic progress each year. 
The report’s release occurred shortly after a case came to light of a Waterbury man who escaped his home after allegedly being held captive by his stepmother for two decades. The man was reportedly withdrawn from public school at around age 11. 
But the parents and advocates said that case had nothing to do with homeschooling, and they pushed back against what they felt was “scapegoating” of their community. Instead, they alleged that the state of Connecticut had failed to properly investigate cases of child abuse. 
“ This pattern of failed police investigations into child abuse by state providers, followed by scapegoating innocent families, must stop. Our lawmakers have failed us on both sides. We urge them to change,” said Sheila Matthews, the co-founder of AbleChild, a nonprofit that advocates against the use of psychotropic medications for children. 
A wide demographic
Peter Wolfgang, the executive director of the Family Institute of Connecticut, said at the press conference Wednesday families who homeschool in Connecticut cut across a wide swath of beliefs, demographics and political parties. 
“ Homeschoolers are atheists, Christians, Democrats, Republicans, Black people, Hispanic people, white people, liberals, conservatives, independents. Every ethnic and socioeconomic group in the state of Connecticut that you can imagine includes within it people who homeschool. And so when you attack the right of parents to homeschool here in the state of Connecticut, you are attacking everybody,” said Wolfgang. 
Families who spoke with The Connecticut Mirror offered a variety of reasons that they decided to homeschool. Some, like Teitelbaum, referenced the coronavirus pandemic. Others cited their children’s struggles in public schools. Some said they disagreed with the public school philosophy. 
Teitelbaum told CT Mirror that one of her daughters had been struggling in school because of complications from Lyme disease, which left her exhausted. She described an incident in which a student wrote something inappropriate in her daughter’s yearbook, and she said the child was never disciplined. And she criticized what she saw as the school’s philosophy of teaching all students at the same level. She said she felt the school didn’t want the parents to be involved in their child’s education. 
Stamford Public Schools spokesperson Kathleen Steinberg said in an email that it was “understandable” that involved parents like Teitelbaum would feel disconnected from the school community during COVID, when access to buildings was limited. She said the student discipline issue, which was confidential, was “handled in accordance with the Board of Education’s discipline policy.” She further said the school worked hard to differentiate instruction based on children’s needs, and that they had developed a new curriculum with this goal in mind in the years since Teitelbaum had left.
Ashley Murcia, a mom of four children ages 12, 11, 7 and 10 months, said she’d always considered homeschooling. The pandemic was the final straw. She said she disagreed with the way in which Gov. Ned Lamont oversaw the coronavirus pandemic in the state, as well as the lack of discretion given to local towns. She also said she felt her local school administration’s view of a parent’s role didn’t match her own. 
“ It was communicated to me very clearly that the administration believed that they owned my child,” she told CT Mirror. 
Mary Owens, a Goshen resident, told CT Mirror that she had always wanted to homeschool her son, who is now 8.
“ He’s been reading since 3, so we know we’re doing something right,” Owens said. 
Owens said the biggest reward of homeschooling was being present for her son’s milestones. When her son learned to read, she said, she burst into tears, startling her son. She reassured him that they were “happy tears.” 
“That was my moment, that I would’ve missed if somebody else taught him,” she said. 
The right to choose
Christina Ghio, the acting child advocate, told CT Mirror in an email that the report’s recommendations were based not on one case, but on two separate reviews of data and individual cases — one in 2018 and one in 2025 — both of which “raised serious concerns.”
“While many people successfully homeschool their children, not every parent who withdraws their child for the stated purpose of homeschooling is, in fact, providing their child with an education. Worse, some take advantage of Connecticut’s complete lack of oversight to isolate children and abuse them,” Ghio said. 
The isolation and the state’s lack of regulation — specifically the lack of required follow-up after a parent informs a school that they’re removing a child for homeschooling — puts children at risk, Ghio said.
“We must address that reality, and we must meet the dual obligation that we have to children: to ensure that they receive an education and that they are safe,” she said. 
Peter Yazbak, spokesperson for the Department of Children and Families, said while homeschooling has been a factor in some cases that DCF has investigated, the department looks at situations on a case-by-case basis when determining whether a child has been neglected or abused. 
He said regardless of what type of school setting a child is in, family, neighbors or teachers who have a “reasonable suspicion” that a child is being abused or neglected should call the department. 
“We believe every parent has the right to choose the setting in which to educate their children. Removing a child from school to be homeschooled does not, in and of itself, constitute neglect,” Yazbak said.
Parents at Wednesday’s press conference, meanwhile, underscored the positive results they’d seen from homeschooling — like strengthened relationships within their families. 
“There is a bond and a connection that the children develop with each other and with me as their mother. That’s the kind of connectivity that stays with you after you leave home. And those are the kinds of bonds and deep ties that we’re really looking for,” Murcia said. 
Parents also praised the flexibility of letting children explore their interests and learn at their own pace. 
Katherine Prescott, a mother of seven children between the ages of 2 and 25, said she had to homeschool each of her children in a different way.
“We learn different ways, we have different interests, and we were created that way because we all have different jobs to do on this planet,” she said. “So when you shove them all into a box and educate them one way, you’re actually — with a wrecking ball — tearing down their destinies.” 
Prescott said that parents were the only ones who would devote themselves completely to their children’s success, and would do so for free. She also said she didn’t like the word “homeschool” — a phrase she said evoked the image of sitting at home — and suggested “life school” as a better term. 
“ This stuff is more applicable when you’re living life and learning it instead of being stuck in a room,” she said, adding that the amount of book work her children do is minor compared to more hands-on education. 
The state legislature chose not to pursue any changes to laws around homeschooling this year. But Republican lawmakers at the press conference warned that regulations could be coming in the future and pledged their support for the homeschoolers. 
Rep. Lezlye Zupkus, R-Prospect, ranking member on the Education Committee said she had heard the legislature might form a committee to look at homeschooling and that she had requested to be on it. 
At a press conference Wednesday morning, Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said he thought homeschooling would likely come up again during next year’s legislative session. He said whatever bills are brought forward, the public would be welcome to testify.
Rep. Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield, co-chair of the Education Committee, told CT Mirror Wednesday that no committee had been formed with the purpose of studying homeschooling, but she expected that lawmakers would talk with homeschooling agencies and other community leaders throughout the summer and fall in order to hear a range of perspectives on the topic.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9057-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 18:04:23.424855

SPRINGFIELD — Minutes before the clock hit midnight and the calendar flipped to June 1, the Illinois Senate advanced a much-watched legislative proposal to reform and fund public transportation in the Chicago area and prevent dire cuts to service.

But Chicago Democrat Sen. Ram Villivalam’s Hail Mary attempt to avoid cuts was downed short of the end zone as opposition mounted to the bill’s revenue plan, particularly its creation of a $1.50 package delivery fee in the state. The House declined to take up the transit funding bill, as the stroke of midnight meant the chamber required a three-fifths majority vote to advance any legislation that would take effect before June 2026.

Chicago’s public transit agencies are now entering an uncertain future. Public hearings on service cuts could begin this summer, but lawmakers say they are dedicated to finding solutions.

“The funding doesn't run out until Dec. 31 of this year,” House Speaker Chris Welch, D-Hillside, told Capitol News Illinois for the latest episode of the “Illinois Lawmakers” program. “We have time, so I think it's important to take our time and get it right.”

The transit agencies will each run out of pandemic relief funding at various points in 2026, creating deficits in their budgets if lawmakers don’t find new funding sources.

Meanwhile, Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, acknowledged he had reservations about the proposal’s revenue-generating measures, which include the delivery fee as well as a statewide tax on electric vehicle charging and the expansion of a Chicago tax on real estate transfers to the suburbs.

“Frankly, I don't like them all that much,” Harmon said of the revenue measures in an interview with Capitol News Illinois. “I wish there were better alternatives. But if you don't like them, come and tell us how you'd pay for it, because this is going to be expensive and most of the stakeholders seem to be worried about protecting or expanding their own power and having somebody else pay for it.”

The impending cliff

While there’s technically time before the funds run dry, transit agencies say they’re planning next year’s budgets now.

Regional Transportation Authority spokesperson Tina Fassett Smith said in a statement Sunday that agencies will move forward on evaluating their budgets based only on funding that the systems are “confident” they will receive in 2026. Right now, those budgets collectively contain a $771 million shortfall as pandemic relief funds expire.

Both the RTA and Chicago Transit Authority have meetings scheduled next week where talks will presumably focus on how the agencies will maintain a balanced budget in 2026. The RTA previously projected that if lawmakers fail to deliver funding, it would lead to thousands of layoffs and 40% service cuts.

Civic Federation President Joe Ferguson told Capitol News Illinois the end of October appears to be a clearer deadline for legislative action, because the agencies finalize budgets in November.

“This is a sooner-than-later exercise because the closer we get to the next budget cycles of the service boards themselves, the more that this gets driven by doom-and-gloom scenarios – which are correct scenarios – but they’re going to be an effort to drive the revenue imperatives without the reform imperatives,” Ferguson said.

The agencies are federally required to have public hearings before enacting service cuts.

Why reform failed

Both legislative chambers introduced separate plans late in the final week of May, which although similar in many ways, contained key differences showing lawmakers were still apart on a deal. The differences only became more magnified as labor organizations and suburban communities opposed a series of taxes designed to plug the funding shortfall.

That new funding proposal surfaced in the Senate on Saturday afternoon, hours before the legislature was scheduled to adjourn. The plan did away with proposed toll increases and a diversion of sales tax revenue away from collar county governments. Instead, it proposed the new statewide tax on deliveries, and kept a statewide tax on EV charging, as well as suburban taxes on real estate transfers and rideshares.

Lawmakers negotiating the bill had vowed “no funding without reforms,” a pledge they remain committed to, Villivalam told Capitol News Illinois, noting they should be tackled at the same time.

The two chambers are generally in agreement on transit reform, which includes giving new decision-making authority to the RTA to set fares and schedules and renaming the agency to “Northern Illinois Transit Authority.”

But when the adjournment deadline came, the House wasn’t prepared to take up a bill addressing funding even after months of negotiations, Rep. Eva-Dina Delgado, D-Chicago, who is leading transit reform for House Democrats, told Capitol News Illinois.

“We spent hours and hours and hours in negotiation, so our reform bills were very similar,” she said. “What we didn’t spend hours and hours and hours talking about was the revenue.”

Villivalam said the tax increases and other revenue solutions in his plan would raise $1.5 billion – enough to plug the budget hole and fund transit at a level that the RTA says would significantly improve public transportation. But House Democrats didn’t have time to review the funding options.

“Based on my conversations with members, they needed to know more,” Delgado said. “They needed to understand more and, you know, that is now my job is to make sure that whatever revenue plan we come up with, it’s communicated, and people understand what it is.”

Despite facing an uncertain future in the House, Villivalam said the Senate voted on the bill because “we believe in responsible governance, and we believe in avoiding 40% cuts to service and more than 3,000 workers getting layoff notices.”

Reaching a deal to stop cuts

With November being the next pressing deadline for action, lawmakers could return to Springfield for a special session this summer or wait until the annual fall veto session to act on transit reform.

Whenever the General Assembly reconvenes, they will need broader agreement, as the three-fifths vote requirement remains in effect through the calendar year. While the House could still send Villivalam’s bill to the governor’s desk, it passed the Senate on a 32-22 vote – short of three-fifths of the chamber. Several Democrats voted against the plan, foreshadowing the headwinds in the House.

Gov. JB Pritzker hasn’t expressed an opinion on the proposed taxes. He told reporters on Sunday he learned about the taxes at the same time Villivalam unveiled them to the public.

“We were not the leaders of that endeavor, but we were at the table, listening and helping whenever we were asked to,” Pritzker said. “And again, I think there's significant work that will need to be done over the summer and in the fall to make sure that it gets across.""

The tax increases were nonstarters for Republicans, who haven’t proposed their own funding plan – and Democrats don’t need their votes to reach a three-fifths majority.

“We need to look at things holistically and restructure rather than continuously adding more taxes to pay the bills,” House Minority Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, told Capitol News Illinois.

Senate Minority Leader John Curran, R-Downers Grove, told Capitol News Illinois lawmakers should not be depending so much on new taxes.

“We would put out a much more constrained proposal ... there'd be a little more skin in the game on efficiencies and fares, and then we would be coming to taxpayers last in that,” Curran said. “And, quite frankly, we'd be taking a more regional approach on that, and not a statewide approach.”

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)An analysis of Montana’s budget for the 2025-27 biennium showed a 2.1% increase over the previous biennium, the Legislative Fiscal Division reported this week. 
Some members of the state’s legislature said during the session the increase was double-digits, focusing specifically on the general fund, which House Appropriations Chair Llew Jones said was a misrepresentation of the budget.
“Sadly, members of Montana’s Freedom Caucus have been deliberately misleading constituents, citing as much as an 18% increase in our state budget by including General Fund spending from the previous session and transfers to other state funds in their calculations,” Jones said in a press release. “Instead, the total state budget will grow by just over 2% in the next two years, which we accomplished while also giving historic income and property tax cuts to Montana families and small businesses.”
Jones stated the calculations factored in “transfer of General Fund resources to special trusts and the distribution of significant income and property tax reductions” when coming to the 2.1% number. That growth rate is less than inflation, the release noted, an often repeated goal of Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte. 
Some Freedom Caucus members are skeptical about the calculations. Rep. Jerry Schillinger, R-Circle, said an effort had been made to cut certain items out of the budget toward the end of the session to “make it look better” and added that the money would still be spent anyway.
“I just haven’t verified their numbers yet, but I’m highly skeptical of what Representative Jones is talking about,” Schillinger told the Daily Montanan.
The fight over the budget was bitter during the session and a coalition of Democrats and Republicans pushed through the $16.6 billion spending package. Schillinger said some “big government” Republicans, instead of working with fellow conservatives, sought out Democrats to work with instead.
He said this has been happening for several sessions.
“It just came out more and more into the open this session,” Schillinger said.
He added that if the legislature had done its job, Gov. Gianforte, a Republican, wouldn’t have to be spending the time “vetoing all these bills.”
Not all spending bills have been signed or vetoed, meaning the calculations could change depending on spending, the Legislative Fiscal Division analysis stated. Schillinger said that it appeared likely the Governor would also be signing the mega-trust bill discussed heavily near the end of the session. 
HB 924, for example, was touted by Jones as critical money for housing, childcare, and disaster resiliency. It became a touch point for spending hawks in the legislature who repeatedly decried the spending.

Earlier Thursday, they approved Senate Bill 14, which institutes mandatory minimums for fentanyl possession. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire House of Representatives voted, 214-167, Thursday to pass Senate Bill 14, which creates mandatory minimums for fentanyl possession and reduces the penalty for people caught with psilocybin mushrooms.
If enacted, SB 14 would create mandatory minimum sentences for people convicted on fentanyl charges. That includes manufacturing, selling, transporting, or possessing the drug with the intent to sell. People convicted with 20 grams or more of the drug would face at least 3½ years in prison under the bill. People convicted with 50 or more grams would face no less than seven years. There is currently no minimum sentence under state law, which gives judges leeway to decide. There is, however, a maximum of 30 years on the first offense and life imprisonment for repeat offenders. The bill was previously approved by the Senate in February.
“The people asked us for law and order,” Rep. Terry Roy, a Deerfield Republican, said on the House floor. “Let’s give them law and order.”
One Republican lawmaker doubted the bill’s minimums would actually be impactful.
“Twenty grams plus of fentanyl possession is almost certainly gonna be prosecuted as a federal crime,” Rep. Kevin Verville, a Deerfield Republican, said. “The odds of the state actually using this bill when it becomes law is infinitesimally small in my opinion.”
The representative characterized the mandatory minimums as something being done for show.
“You can campaign on law and order on this,” Verville said. “In my opinion, that’s what this is.”
However, the bill was amended on the House floor to add a provision that aligns with one of Verville’s biggest priorities as a legislator. That provision reduces the penalty for possession of psilocybin, a psychedelic drug commonly known as magic mushrooms or shrooms. 
Under the amended bill, possession or use of less than three-quarters of an ounce of psilocybin would be a misdemeanor on first offense as opposed to a felony, which is currently state law under the Controlled Drug Act. Verville is the sponsor of another bill, House Bill 528, that would reduce the penalty to a simple violation. Verville and his colleagues have argued it’s less dangerous than other harder drugs and that it has medicinal benefits such as treatment for PTSD or migraines. 
HB 528 was approved by the House in March. Verville is a vocal proponent of fully legalizing psilocybin, though he has acknowledged he doesn’t believe he can convince enough of his colleagues of that, so he settled for this measure. Verville urged his colleagues to approve SB 14.
“What this bill now has in it is it has real psychedelic reform for the citizens of New Hampshire,” he said. “Compounds that help people beat alcoholism, opioid addiction, other drug addiction, depression, post-traumatic stress syndrome.”
Verville said SB 14 “finally ends a felony charge for simple possession for a small amount of psilocybin,” which he called “an excellent trade.” He also argued that the minimum sentences outlined by the bill were “fairly short.”
“The benefit of the psilocybin far outweighs — far outweighs — any mandatory minimums,” he said. “I’m begging you.”
Eight Democrats joined Republicans to pass the bill, while six Republicans bucked their party to vote against it. Most Democrats were opposed to the legislation.
“I want to be clear, SB 14, like several other bills, is not about crime,” Rep. Linda Harriott-Gathright, a Nashua Democrat, said.
Harriott-Gathright pointed out that fentanyl possession is already illegal and punished severely by law. She, and many of her Democratic colleagues, argued that mandatory minimums were ineffective at hindering crime.
“The question before us today is whether we think adopting mandatory minimums and maximums, an outdated one-size-fits-all solution, is going to be an effective use of taxpayer dollars to address the many substance issues in our state,” she continued. “The bottom line is that our country has already tried that approach. … We all know that it has failed.”
She said the bill “robs judges of their ability to fully consider all relevant facts and circumstances and “undermines basic principles of justice.” She also argued the psilocybin provision was “likely to vanish in committee of conference,” the process where House and Senate members negotiate the differences between their bills.
Because the bill was amended by the House, it will return to the Senate to be reconsidered. The Senate can now either accept the amendment, enter the committee of conference process to hash out its differences with the House, or reject the bill outright.
Enacting the mandatory minimums has been a priority for Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who publicly called on lawmakers to bring the legislation to her desk. A similar bill, Senate Bill 15, would’ve created even harsher minimum sentences for cases where a death was involved.

Tim Walz speaks with Minnesota Reformer Editor in Chief Patrick Coolican in front of States Newsroom leaders and reporters Thursday, June 5, 2025 at the Royal Sonesta in downtown Minneapolis. (Nicole Neri | Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday said that communication between states and the federal government under the second Trump administration “is nonexistent,” opening the door to catastrophe in the case of a natural disaster or other emergency.
Walz, during an interview with Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference in Minneapolis, said that the Trump administration is unprepared for the next disaster — like another global pandemic — and that leaves states particularly vulnerable.
“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.
The Minnesota governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.
Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty.
Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.
He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray.
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Federal prosecutors this month charged fewer people for allegedly trespassing on the newly established military base along New Mexico’s border with Mexico, according to a Source New Mexico review of federal court records.
Over the last two months or so, 570 people have been charged for “unauthorized entry” into what is now effectively a military base along the border, Source’s review shows. On April 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the transfer of land from the Bureau of Land Management to the military, effectively making the 180-mile border New Mexico shares with Mexico into an extended military base tied to Fort Huachuca in Arizona. 
Along with empowering the United States Army to patrol the border and temporarily detain people they found, the transfer exposed people arrested to a new criminal charge of unauthorized entry, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. The area transferred to the military is a little more than 400 square miles, minus state and private land, running roughly along the New Mexico Panhandle and south of Highway 9 before Hachita. 
Prosecutors announced the new type of criminal charge in late April and began filing charging documents soon after, with as many as 58 people facing the new misdemeanors in a single day in early May. 
But the charges quickly proved vulnerable to legal challenges based, partly, on whether people knew they were illegally entering a military base. The military has posted small warning signs in English and Spanish along the northern and southern borders of the so-called National Defense Area that entry is prohibited.
On May 14, a federal judge dismissed more than 100 of the charges, after federal public defenders raised the issue on behalf of their clients. 
The dismissals coincided with a one-day dip in the number of unauthorized entry charges being brought, according to Source’s review. The number of daily charges picked up again before beginning to decline early this month.
Since May 30, just 11 people have been charged with unauthorized entry, according to federal filings.
The reason for the decrease is unclear, including whether it’s because fewer people are crossing or whether federal prosecutors have changed their strategy. Tessa Duberry, a spokesperson for the office, did not respond to a request for comment on the decrease. 
In addition to the judge’s dismissals, the U.S. Attorney’s Office dismissed at least three of its own unauthorized entry charges due to confusion about where the boundaries of the NDA lie. 
Confusion reigns in New Mexico’s militarized border zone

Meanwhile, the Army has warned hunters and hikers that they could be prosecuted if they enter the area, but per an informal agreement, ranchers can drive past the signs without issue as they tend to cattle they graze on former BLM land they lease in the NDA.
Public defenders are also challenging the charge in a couple of individual cases, including one instance in which the charging documents suggest the arrestee was picked up in Arizona, and another involving a citizen of Uzbekistan who, her attorneys argue, didn’t read or speak English or Spanish and therefore couldn’t have known she was entering a restricted area. 
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM) this week questioned Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll in a Congressional committee hearing, saying widespread confusion exists about who can enter the area and “where the boundaries of this military zone actually start and where they end.”
Driscoll said the Army would work on improving signage and communication with people in the area and members of Congress. 
“The army is working incredibly hard with our soldiers to put out signage. We have taken it over recently,” he responded.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9645-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Passenger rail service between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth is expected to end on or before Oct. 1, transportation officials said Thursday.
The announcement comes after the Texas Legislature declined to continue funding for its share of the 206-mile route. 
The Heartland Flyer is jointly funded by Oklahoma and Texas.
The service, operated by Amtrak, was reestablished in 1999 after ending in 1979.
In a statement Thursday, Amtrak said the Heartland Flyer faces imminent suspension no later than Oct. 1 unless Texas secures its share of funding. 
A more specific suspension date is expected to be announced later.
“Reliable rail service provides a vital transportation option for residents and visitors alike, strengthening regional mobility, economic development, and tourism,” said Amtrak President Roger Harris. “With service that supports Texas’ continued economic growth and the region’s connectivity, sustaining the Heartland Flyer is essential to maintaining momentum and ensuring long term mobility in the region.”
The Heartland Flyer makes stops in Oklahoma City, Norman, Purcell, Pauls Valley, Ardmore, Gainesville and Fort Worth.
“The Heartland Flyer is key to ensuring Fort Worth’s continued success as a global destination and is central to the city’s tourism industry, business community, and thriving economy,” said Fort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker. “Fort Worth is the busiest Amtrak station in Texas – generating millions in economic impact annually – and as people continue to move to our region, travel reliability, mobility choices, and connectivity will be key to our competitiveness.”
Gainesville Mayor Tommy Moore said he believed a solution could be found to keep the service.
“I’ll keep fighting to make sure this critical service stays in place for years to come,” Moore said. 
Officials had been planning on extending the route into Newton, Kansas, to link to the Southwest Chief between Chicago and Los Angeles.
Suspension of the Heartland Flyer would impact expansion efforts, said a spokesman for the Kansas Department of Transportation.

(Screenshot from livestream)Arkansas PBS would lose $2.5 million in programming and operational funds if President Donald Trump’s desired cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting come to fruition, interim executive director Sanji Kumpuris told the network’s governing board at its quarterly meeting Thursday.
Trump’s Tuesday proposal calls on Congress to eliminate $1.1 billion from the entity that provides funding for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service. Lawmakers have 45 days from Tuesday to consider the request.
In the meantime, Kumpuris told the Arkansas PBS Commission, the agency should formulate a plan in case it loses 22% of its total funding.
“We will have to adjust and figure out what that means to us and tell you guys, ‘This is what it means as far as the services we offer without having that [money],’” Kumpuris said.
About half of the at-risk $2.5 million community service grant goes toward purchasing PBS programs to air, 30% of which is chosen by PBS’ national headquarters, and the other half covers operational expenses, such as running the public media network’s Conway studio and its statewide emergency weather alert system, Kumpuris said.
The commission has requested but not yet scheduled a meeting with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her senior staff “to discuss and brainstorm what the future of PBS is,” Chairman West Doss said.
“[Kumpuris] and staff have some ideas, but we felt like we might need to run it by the governor first,” Doss said.
Commissioners select interim Arkansas PBS director

The commission chose Kumpuris as interim executive director in May, succeeding Courtney Pledger. Kumpuris is Arkansas PBS’ education director and production director.
After an executive session, the commission voted Thursday to grant Kumpuris the minimum executive director salary of $155,000 as of July 1.
The network’s planned nationwide search for a permanent director is still getting underway, Doss said. The headhunting firms PBS’ national office has recommended are “too expensive for us right now,” but the network plans to advertise the job opening in “several national boards and publications,” he said.
“We’re not exactly sure how we’re going to handle it right now, but we’re still researching it,” Doss said.

Greg VanWoerkom (R-Norton Shores) raises concerns on delays in the rollout of a new state unemployment insurance system during a June 5, 2025 meeting of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on General Government. | Kyle DavidsonAs state agencies collaborate with contractors to craft a replacement to Michigan’s outdated unemployment insurance system, individuals overseeing the effort offered an update on their progress, with plans to begin rolling out the system before the end of the year.
The subject of those enhancements to the system were up for discussion Thursday before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on General Government.
Testifying before the committee was Brett Gleason, chief of staff with the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency, who noted the current system is more than 10 years old and has placed limits on the agency’s ability to adapt, support self-service, detect fraud and use data effectively.
The agency selected the tech and strategy consulting firm Deloitte to lead the project in November of 2022, with the project costs estimated at $78 million, according to a report from the Detroit Free Press. Work on the project launched in May 2023, with the first component of the project expected to go live on Sept. 30, 2024.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXDavid Parent, a managing partner of Deloitte, told the subcommittee on Thursday that while the project had faced challenges with management, scope and technology, the service for employers is expected to launch in December with the claimant side of the program rolling out in May 2026.
As of Tuesday, test cases in the new system were passing at a 97% rate, Parent said, with the part of the system set to go live in May logging an 88% pass rate, Parent said.
With the project set to launch 14 months later than initially promised, members of the committee pressed Parent and members of the Unemployment Insurance Agency and the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget on why the state requested an additional $20 million for the project despite the delays.
Gleason explained that the state pays roughly $2.5 million a month to maintain the old system, and that the costs for maintaining the old system had been higher than anticipated due to the project delays. As a result, the additional $20 million would be used to maintain the current system and to cover costs for independent verification and validation services on the new system.
With the Unemployment Insurance Agency paying out an estimated $8.5 billion in fraudulent claims during the COVID-19 pandemic, Rep. Greg VanWoerkom (R-Norton Shores) voiced concern, saying the delays had cost the state millions and put its unemployment safety net at risk.
Gleason said the state has pursued an aggressive timeline in crafting and implementing the new system, and that the project still fell within the four to six year timeline that is typical in putting new systems like this in place.
Laura Clark, the chief information office for DTMB, also noted the new system was expected to save the agency $5 million annually.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3038-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

Kim Reynolds, joined by lawmakers, business owners and Iowa Workforce Development staff, signed into law a bill reducing the taxable wage base for Iowa's unemployment insurance system at U.S. Erectors in Pleasant Hill June 5, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has signed into law a bill cutting the taxable wage base for Iowa’s unemployment insurance system, one of her goals from the 2025 legislative session.
The governor held a bill signing event Thursday for Senate File 607, at U.S. Erectors in Pleasant Hill, one of the businesses she said the new law is intended to help. The measure, which goes into effect July 1, will cut in half the taxable wage base used in collecting unemployment insurance taxes, from 66.7% to 33.4%. It also modifies employer contribution rates and excludes wages from the unemployment insurance system’s definition of “taxable wages” paid by employers when the employees work in another state in cases where reciprocity applies.
“It’s a signature piece of legislation, one of my top priorities this session, and a key part of our ongoing efforts make Iowa’s economy stronger, more competitive and built for the future,” Reynolds said.
Reynolds said the changes are “long overdue,” saying Iowa’s unemployment insurance taxes have “needlessly over-collected from our businesses” for years. With $1.95 billion in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, the governor said Iowa had the ninth largest unemployment trust fund in the country despite being 32nd in state population.
By lowering the amount employers pay into the fund, Reynolds said businesses are projected to save nearly a billion dollars over the next five years. U.S. Erectors, which hosted the event, is projected to keep $85,000 in the next year due to the change, she said.
Brad Churchill, CEO and co-founder of U.S. Erectors, thanked Reynolds for moving the measure forward, saying it “provides meaningful relief to employers across Iowa, while maintaining a full scope of benefits for employees for their time of need.”
“Early projections and estimates are that the bill would generate the savings of up to $800 million for businesses statewide,” Churchill said. “For companies like ours, those savings can be reinvested directly into our workforce through hiring, wage increases, purchasing of new equipment and expanding our facilities for growth.”
While supporters of the bill said the new law is correcting overpayments into the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, Democrats argued the change will mean less money is available to help Iowans when they lose their job, tying it during floor debate on the measure to other changes made to Iowa’s unemployment system in recent years.
Rep. Daniel Gosa, D-Davenport, said in a statement Thursday the change is providing more money to employers who cut jobs in Iowa.
“While Iowa families struggle and Iowa’s economy ranks dead last, Gov. Reynolds and Republican lawmakers are handing out a $1 billion tax break to big corporations, paid for by raiding funds meant for laid-off workers,” Gosa said. “In 2022, Iowa Republicans slashed unemployment from 26 weeks to 16. Now they’re handing out tax breaks to corporations that lay off workers and ship jobs overseas. Iowa workers shouldn’t be footing the bill for corporate tax breaks.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/reynolds6.5.1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

Ron DeSantis suspended Osceola County Sheriff Marcos Lopez from office on Thursday shortly after he was arrested on felony charges of racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier’s Office of Statewide Prosecution charged Lopez and four other individuals in a “massive Central Florida gambling operation,” according to a press release issued by the attorney general’s office.
“Initially engaging the operation for campaign contributions and personal payments, Sheriff Lopez played a multifaceted role in expanding and protecting this illegal enterprise, using his office to shield the enterprise from law enforcement,” the release said.
DeSantis has appointed Christopher Blackmon to take over the Osceola County Sheriff’s Department. Blackmon has been serving as the Central Region Chief for the Florida Highway Patrol since November 2023 , and before that served as a troop commander and major in the FHP. Between 2007-2016 he worked as a resident security agent for Major League Baseball, according to his LinkedIn account.
Lopez began serving in the Osceola County Sheriff’s Department in 2003 while he was still serving in the U.S. Navy Reserve. He rose up the ranks before ultimately being elected sheriff in 2020, becoming the first Hispanic in Osceola County to do so. A Democrat, he was re-elected last fall.
There had been scandals under Lopez’s tenure, including a 2022 sheriff deputies’ killing of a man who drove a car carrying two passengers accused of shoplifting $46 in pizza and Pokemon cards. A grand jury report later said the killing could have been avoided if not for their faulty judgement and their department’s “poorly crafted policies on the use of appropriate force in response to minor crimes,” the Orlando Sentinel reported.
Lopez also ended up agreeing to pay a $250 fine last December in a plea deal with then-State Attorney Andrew Bain for inadvertently posting a photo on social media of a crime victim who was a minor. That later led Bain to add Lopez’s name to his office’s Brady Identification System, which lists the names of law enforcement officers who have a history of misconduct.
The AG’s press release says a multi-agency investigation led by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and joined by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement began looking into Lopez and his associates starting in 2023. The investigation ultimately uncovered “a criminal organization operating an illegal gambling enterprise throughout Central Florida, particularly in Lake and Osceola Counties.”
Lopez and his associates ran a lottery, slot machines, and a “gambling house out of a business known as Fusion Social Club,” according to the charging document filed in Florida’s Fifth Judicial Circuit. The alleged criminal operation generated $21.6 million in profits, according to the AG’s office.
According to an official with the Lake County Jail, Lopez is being held without bond pending a June 30 arraignment.

Phil Murphy announces a plan to give ratepayers $100 minimum to defray a sudden, sharp increase in electricity prices in Newark on June 5, 2025. (Courtesy of the governor’s office)New Jersey will send ratepayers at least $100 to defray the impact of a steep rise in electricity prices that took effect this month, top Democrats announced Thursday.
The $430 million program, which is not yet approved by state energy regulators, would provide each of the state’s 3.9 million ratepayers with $100, with an additional $150 for low- and moderate-income residents.
“We’re taking this step today because the fact is the people of New Jersey are being battered by the rising cost of energy, and by the way, this is not unique to New Jersey,” Gov. Phil Murphy said at a press conference in Newark. “You can look all around the country right now, and certainly all around this region to see that we are not alone. Wholesale electricity prices are up multiples of what they were even a year ago today.”
Christine Guhl Sadovy, president of the state Board of Public Utilities, suggested residents enrolled in the state’s winter termination program would be eligible for the $150 payment. That program bars utility shutoffs between Nov. 15 and March 15.
Officials were deliberating a second $100 payment but had not reached a decision as of Thursday afternoon, Murphy said.
It was not immediately clear when or how the benefits would be paid. Murphy suggested they could come in September or October but cautioned that the timeline is hazy as the aid still needs approval from the Board of Public Utilities, whose next meeting is set for June 18.
Lawmakers’ announcement comes just days after electricity prices rose by roughly 20% at the start of June, pushed upward by the results of price-setting auctions held in July and February, and as hot weather pushed temperatures to roughly 90 degrees in much of the state Thursday.
It also comes as all 80 seats in the state Assembly — which Democrats control by a 52-28 majority — are on the ballot in the fall (the primaries are on Tuesday).
Funding for the payments would come from the state’s Clean Energy Fund, the state’s share of Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative money, and the Solar Alternative Compliance Payment, which is paid by electricity suppliers that are unable to meet the state’s renewables standard.
Some progressive groups took exception to the funding sources.
“We appreciate that the governor and lawmakers are taking seriously the strain high energy costs place on families, but how we deliver relief matters. Diverting funds from RGGI and the Clean Energy Fund risks weakening the very programs that lower long-term costs, strengthen our grid, and create local jobs,” said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst for New Jersey Policy Perspective.
The price of electricity rose sharply after being roughly level for more than a decade as supply tightened and demand shot upward, driven higher by power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers proposed throughout the footprint of PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey, 12 other states, and the District of Columbia.
Democrats have blamed PJM for the price spike, charging yearslong delays in its interconnection queue had depressed supply by leaving projects, including 79 in New Jersey, without a line into the grid.
“We in the Legislature have a tone of outrage that New Jersey is being held hostage,” Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) said.
Murphy said he and legislative leaders would meet with PJM CEO Manu Asthana next week.
Republicans have blamed the Murphy administration’s renewables-heavy energy plan and the sunsetting of some existing fossil fuel plants for the increases. They and some Democrats have said the state should pursue a more diverse energy mix to stall further price hikes.
“It simply delays the pain to avoid political fallout in an election year,” Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris), his chamber’s minority leader, said of the plan announced Thursday. “This is not relief, it’s a cover-up. Trenton Democrats are once again trying to deflect the consequences of their own failed energy policies.”
Legislators and regulators are considering other methods of reining in energy prices. The Board of Public Utilities is fielding proposals that could delay electricity price increases, leaving ratepayers with deferred balances they would be responsible for paying later.
Guhl-Sadovy declined to comment on the status of that proposal or the effect Thursday’s announcement would have on it.
In recent weeks, legislators have advanced bills that would change how state regulators set utilities’ profit margins, require they study data centers’ impact on energy rates, and create a new rate-setting process for data centers, among others.
“Like so many states across the country, we recognized early on that the rates would not be sustainable, more importantly, that they just certainly weren’t fair. That’s why we went to work,” said Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex).",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54569953460_0e5b86ab66_c.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

Wyoming approved the location anyway.,Mike Koshmrl,,,,,https://wyofile.com/state-biologists-warned-of-wildlife-conflicts-at-proposed-shooting-complex-site-wyoming-approved-the-location-anyway/,"

Crucial mule deer range and sage grouse core habitat caused wildlife managers to ask that the large commercial operation be relocated, but the requests, which haven’t been discussed publicly, have had little bearing on plans so far.
The post State biologists warned of wildlife conflicts at proposed shooting complex site. Wyoming approved the location anywa[...]","When a task force of lawmakers and appointed citizens decided last summer where best to locate a state-funded destination shooting facility, they chose a picturesque 3-square-mile tract of state land nestled into the Absaroka Range foothills. Their rationale, in part, was that the site evoked wild Wyoming. 
Rolling hills blanketed in sagebrush, the location is home to elk, mule deer, pronghorn and sage grouse, among other species. It boasts spectacular views of high peaks leading to the Yellowstone plateau and, off to the east, the Bighorn Basin. Bisected by Sulphur Creek, the site feels like it’s in the middle of nowhere despite being just an 8-mile drive from Cody. 
Those same attributes concerned Wyoming’s wildlife managers, according to an agency review of the proposal acquired by WyoFile through a Wyoming Public Records Act request. 
Seven days before the 12-member task force voted 8-4 in favor of the location, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department issued a memo that effectively recommended the complex go elsewhere. Specifically, Habitat Protection Supervisor Will Schultz asked that it be moved outside of “core” sage grouse habitat and “crucial” range for struggling mule deer, which exhibited “high use” of the site throughout the year according to GPS collar data. Pronghorn and elk also used the 2,036-acre property, which is slated for development into a world-class shooting operation, and is expected to draw gun enthusiasts from far and wide.

“Ground-disturbing activities and extensive human presence can result in the disturbance or displacement of wintering big game and loss of habitat, potentially impacting the viability of local populations,” stated the July 15, 2024 letter signed by Schultz.
One week later, the state agency’s concerns surfaced shortly before the task force voted.
“Is this cleared for that wildlife aspect?” Republican Rep. Pepper Ottman of Riverton asked her fellow members. “It looks to me as though that is still a concern. What would that look like, to alleviate that concern? I’m not sure. That is of grave concern.”
Nobody attempted to answer the questions.
‘Of grave concern’
Ottman, who’s no longer on the task force voted with the minority for the runner-up site, near Gillette. She told WyoFile in an interview that she asked about the wildlife concerns because she wanted to get ahead of them — and wants the Wyoming State Shooting Complex to be successful. 
“I’m going to support the decisions that were made,” Ottman said. 
No one other than Ottman, including the agency itself, raised Game and Fish’s wildlife concerns with the Cody site to the committee. Nor did the state agency’s review of the alternative Campbell County site, which detailed far fewer concerns with wildlife, make much of an appearance in the debate. Publicly, there has been little to no discussion about requests to avoid the crucial mule deer range and the Oregon Basin sage grouse core area, or of any other wildlife-friendly guidance that’s been issued for the Park County shooting complex site, where construction crews could break ground as soon as July.

Powell resident Greg Mayton, who spent 14 years working for Wyoming Game and Fish, said that the wildlife concerns were minimized because of a “top-down push” that has kept the agency’s Cody Region personnel muzzled. 
“It wouldn’t look good,” Mayton said, “if Game and Fish was against this site.”
WyoFile’s attempts to talk with regional personnel were not successful — an in-person inquiry at the Cody office in early May prompted a phone call from the agency’s Cheyenne headquarters.

An avid hunter, Mayton is among the few Park County residents who’ve spoken out against the shooting complex. The former aquatic invasive species biologist has spent ample time hunting elk and mule deer and looking for shed antlers on the selected state land, which abuts a much larger expanse of Bureau of Land Management property west of Highway 120 between Cody and Meeteetse. He feels local residents have to unfairly subsidize a commercial enterprise they might not want in the first place. 
“We have to pay for it three times,” Mayton said. “Through county money I’m paying to build the road, through Game and Fish dollars, and then through all the state tax dollars.” 
Wildlife managers were more forward about their concerns earlier in the Park County site-selection process, according to Andy Quick, a former Cody town councilor. 
“They were going to pursue a different area north of town [near Skull Creek] that was really a bad idea,” Quick said. “That was a designated elk partition area. The Game and Fish was a little more vocal about that one.” 
An event center associated with the Wyoming State Shooting Complex has been tentatively slated where the yellow star is located on this map. The large facility will include an information center, retail shop, ATV and firearm rental, administrative offices, classrooms, shooting area, archery and air rifle range and more. (Park County)

Like Mayton, Quick isn’t a fan of planned commercial operation, which the Wyoming Legislature funded to the tune of $10 million last session. The allocation required some last-minute maneuvering after the supplemental budget, which included funding for the complex, unexpectedly died. 
“It’s just going to fracture more habitat and it’s just one more step in the wrong direction, as far as I’m concerned,” Quick told WyoFile. “I think recreation and hunting are also going to lose out. I know that the state land can be managed as de facto private land, which is inherently a problem in and of itself.” 
“It’s just going to fracture more habitat and it’s just one more step in the wrong direction.”Andy quick
There’ve been several more visible scuffles of late over industrial and commercial use of state lands. Those include opposition to a gravel pit just outside of Casper, a lawsuit over a commercial wind farm in Converse County and a fight over a glamping operation at the foot of the Tetons that has spurred calls for reform and possibly legislation. 
The Wyoming State Shooting Complex has so far advanced with comparatively little controversy, at least in public. Quick, the former Cody town councilor, said that he was well in the minority among local elected officials. 
“I was probably the only one that was against it,” he said. 
A defense
Former Park County Commissioner Lee Livingston, who works as a big game outfitter, championed the project. He helped shepherd it through the county board, and was a part of the county working group that helped prepare a 241-page proposal pitching a complex south of Cody. Livingston told WyoFile in May that Game and Fish gave the location the “green light.”
“I think anywhere you go in Wyoming, you can call it habitat,” Livingston said. “Overall, I think it’s probably about the best location it can be in that Cody area.” 
Other project proponents made similar contentions. Nephi Cole, a Sheridan-based lobbyist for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said it’s hard to find a location in Wyoming that doesn’t have wildlife impacts. He also expressed hope that species would adjust to the gunfire, infrastructure and human activity likely soon to be added to the Absaroka foothills.
“Other large ranges, they’re typically fairly non-invasive, believe it or not, for wildlife,” Cole said. “They accustomize to it, they don’t view it as a hindrance. You end up getting deer, antelope and elk all over ranges, to the extent you have to move them for competitions to make sure that they’re not around targets.”

Baggs Republican Sen. Larry Hicks, whose 2023 legislation spearheaded state planning and funding for a Wyoming State Shooting Complex, said he has witnessed the harmony between wildlife and recreational shooting at Colorado’s Cameo Shooting Complex. 
“They got bighorn sheep, mule deer on the shooting range,” Hicks said. “Chukars all over the place.” 
Hicks expects something similar in Park County. Long-range shooting on the state site’s west end — there are plans for mile-long targets — are “probably going to have almost no impact” on wildlife, he said.   
“That’s not going to be an everyday, ongoing type of activity,” he said. “Seasonal use makes a difference. We can work around some of that just by event scheduling. We’ve got to put together a mitigation plan.”

Glenn Ross, who chairs the Wyoming State Shooting Complex Joint Powers Board, said that Wyoming’s concerns about wildlife impacts have been considered from the get-go and baked into the plans. 
“Our planning with our site has been making every attempt to be wildlife friendly,” Ross told WyoFile.  
Wildlife impacts, he said in a follow-up email, were a “primary consideration” in selecting the more southern Park County site before the local working group submitted its formal application to the state in June 2024. That proposal does include some wildlife-focused plans. 
For example, core sage grouse habitat, which covers about a square mile of the site, would receive “minimum development” to avoid exceeding the 5% threshold authorized by Wyoming’s policy for the embattled bird, which is particularly sensitive to noise.

Mule deer, whose designated “crucial” range covers almost the entire 2,036-acre site, would be accommodated by adjusting management west of a ridgeline during the winter, “minimizing the overall impact.” 
“Mule deer, although quite adaptive to human presence, still need areas of shelter and forage in the critical winter months,” Park County’s application stated.
Elk and pronghorn, meanwhile, would be encouraged to stick around. “Because having these species on site can be of tremendous value to our customers, the complex will recognize that value and work to operate the facility in harmony with these species,” the planning document reads. 
Next steps unclear
A month before a likely groundbreaking — Ross expects to receive the $10 million authorized by the Legislature in July — it’s unclear what actually will be required to minimize harm to wildlife along 3-plus square miles of the Absaroka front. 
Although wildlife managers’ site review of the Park County location is printed on Wyoming Game and Fish Department letterhead and addressed to an outside legislative task force, the document was described as “internal department correspondence” when it was conveyed to WyoFile via a records request. It’s not considered an “official project letter,” Game and Fish officials said. 
“We have not submitted any formal comments on the Cody shooting complex,” Wyoming Game and Fish Chief Warden Dan Smith told WyoFile. “And we haven’t been requested for any [comments].”
The Office of State Lands and Investments will decide whether Game and Fish formally comments, he said. 
“It’s up to them,” Smith said, “whether they request us to make comments on their project.”

Because the Wyoming State Shooting Complex is set to occupy state trust land, the permitting authority is the Office of State Lands and Investments. Its oversight board, the State Board of Land Commissioners, has already approved the Cody complex, according to Melissa DeFrantis, a public information officer for the state agency. 
“They’ve approved going forward with it,” DeFrantis said. “We will take the lease to them once it’s complete.” 
The State Board of Land Commissioners consists of Wyoming’s five statewide elected officials: Gov. Mark Gordon, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Treasurer Curt Meier and Auditor Kristi Racines.
Until the board approves the lease, the draft version and its contents — such as wildlife stipulations — are not considered public information, DeFrantis said.
“We don’t know what the negotiations may be,” she said. “A draft, it really wouldn’t benefit you right now.”

The Office of State Lands and Investments had a different interpretation of what triggers a formal Wyoming Game and Fish Department project letter. Those are typically prepared by default for state land leases, DeFrantis said. 
But DeFrantis also said she was unaware if Game and Fish would formally review the Wyoming State Shooting Complex’s lease near Cody. 
“I can’t say, I’m not drafting the lease,” she said. “But I can say that that’s generally the process, and I don’t know why we would avoid that.” 
The Office of State Lands and Investment’s lead on the project, Cody Booth, did not return a phone call requesting an interview. 
If Wyoming Game and Fish does proceed with a formal review and the requested stipulations mirror those in its existing site review, the Wyoming State Shooting Complex could be saddled with significant restrictions that inhibit its construction and operations.

Because the project isn’t being moved outside of the core sage grouse area, construction and development “should not occur” between March 15 and June 30 in that designated core habitat and within 2 miles of a nearby non-core area lek, according to Game and Fish’s existing guidance.
Furthermore, Game and Fish asked shooting complex proponents to develop “a noise mitigation plan” so gunfire doesn’t compromise an occupied core-area lek that’s three-quarters of a mile south of the complex.
“Research has indicated that the declines in male lek attendance in response to increased noise are immediate and sustained,” the state’s letter stated. “Further, sage grouse do not appear to habituate to increased noise levels over time.” 
Crucial year-round range used by the Upper Shoshone Mule Deer Herd could impact shooting complex operations even more if requested wildlife stipulations are heeded. The herd has struggled mightily: The estimated 6,850 deer in the herd fall more than 40% short of the herd’s 12,000-animal population target, according to Game and Fish’s latest assessment. 
Because the complex wasn’t relocated outside the “crucial” deer range, which overlapped almost the entire site, Game and Fish’s instruction was to “avoid ground-disturbing activities and extensive human presence” from Nov. 15 to April 30. Mule deer-friendly practices, in other words, could theoretically shutter the destination shooting complex nearly six months a year.

Tim Walz speaks with Minnesota Reformer Editor in Chief Patrick Coolican in front of States Newsroom leaders and reporters Thursday, June 5, 2025 at the Royal Sonesta in downtown Minneapolis. (Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday said that communication between states and the federal government under the second Trump administration “is nonexistent,” opening the door to catastrophe in the case of a natural disaster or other emergency.
Walz, during an interview with Minnesota Reformer editor Patrick Coolican at a States Newsroom conference in Minneapolis, said that the Trump administration is unprepared for the next disaster — like another global pandemic — and that leaves states particularly vulnerable.
“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.
The Minnesota governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.

Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty.
Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.
He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray.
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250605_0152-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

“The flow of information has been disrupted between the states and the federal government, and we just can’t get answers … No one is allowed to talk to us, and that’s really problematic,” Walz said.
The Minnesota governor said the silence from the feds differs from the first Trump administration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walz said then-Vice President Mike Pence would call him every few weeks to check in to see what he needed. He said he sensed Pence would call in “under the radar, so he didn’t draw anybody’s attention.”
“There were a lot of great people inside the first Trump administration that, in spite of the president, were doing good work,” Walz said.
Walz said one of his biggest fears is a cybersecurity attack. The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars for several cyber security initiatives and slashed jobs from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect the nation’s critical infrastructure.
Walz discussed the role of the states in opposing the Trump administration’s agenda — particularly on immigration — and the Democratic Party’s current malaise.
Minnesota is increasingly reliant on immigrants, who are needed to fill jobs being vacated by an aging workforce. “There’s not a cow in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” he said. Walz said Minnesota would not be commandeered into enforcing immigration law, which he said is a federal duty. 
Walz repeated a spiel he’s given around the country, including at a recent Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which has traditionally been early on the presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation that he is considering a presidential run.
He said he’s not running, but merely using his megaphone to help fill a vacuum left by a Democratic Party in disarray. 
The governor urged Democrats to figure out how to become the party of the working class again and said Democrats need to “fill all the lanes” in the media environment to reach voters.
“I still have come to the conclusion that Trump fills so much space that you’ve got to fill all these new spaces. Do I think if we would have gone on, you know, Joe Rogan, would we have won? I doubt that, but I also don’t think it hurts,” Walz said. “If your message is good, you want to get out there.”
Walz backed the 2005-06 idea of former DNC Chair Howard Dean and his “50 State Project,” which sought to reach voters in areas not traditionally associated with Democrats.
“We’re probably never going to win Idaho, but … you got to be out there for it,” Walz said.
Walz said Democrats should rotate where they hold the early primary to reach more voters, which may not endear him to Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the traditional early states that have long jealously guarded their first in the nation status.
When asked which state should be the first to hold the primary, Walz deadpanned “Minnesota.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250605_0152-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

Sarah Huckabee Sanders will travel to Europe this month for an overseas trade mission that will include stops in France and Switzerland, according to a Thursday press release from her office. 
Sanders’ trip, which is scheduled for June 14-19, will include appearances at a Paris Air Show panel hosted by the Aerospace Industries Association and a fireside chat organized by the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce. 
The governor’s first stop is Normandy to honor fallen soldiers, including U.S. Army Private Rodger D. Andrews whose remains were recently identified and will be laid to rest in Arkansas on June 9. 
She’ll continue on to the Paris Air Show to meet with aerospace and defense companies, and then to Switzerland to discuss “investing in Arkansas with several large corporations,” according to the release. 
“International trade missions are a great way to pitch Arkansas to companies that might not otherwise have our state on their radar and have a proven track record of bringing in jobs and investment,” Sanders said in a statement. 
The governor’s visit to the Farnborough International Airshow in England last summer helped secure Taber Extrusions’ $60 million, 70 job expansion in Russellville, according to the release. 
During her trip to the Paris Air Show in 2023, Sanders’ discussions helped facilitate Dassault Falcon Jet’s $100 million, 800 job expansion in Little Rock and RTX’s new $33 million manufacturing facility in East Camden, which was later expanded to a $63 million investment. 
The governor’s 2023 Paris trip also led to what became known as Lecterngate. A series of public information requests submitted that summer by a blogger investigating Sanders’ travel expenses revealed a state-issued credit card was used to purchase a $19,000 lectern and carrying case from a Virginia-based company with political ties to Sanders. 
The discovery prompted lawmakers to request an audit, which found several instances of “potential noncompliance” with state law. The report was sent to the Arkansas attorney general and Pulaski County’s prosecuting attorney, the latter of whom declined to pursue charges.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-05 20:34:06+00:00,Mississippi Today,New UMMC tool helps women on Medicaid find prenatal care and family planning,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/05/ummc-tool-helps-women-on-medicaid/,A new database created by the University of Mississippi Medical Center is designed to ease the health care search for women covered by Medicaid.,"At the University of Mississippi Medical Center, one researcher’s full-time job for the past nine months has been to find out which clinics around the state offer different kinds of women’s health care, and whether they accept various forms of Medicaid. 
The final result is a recently-launched database aimed at helping women locate the nearest clinic that can offer the care they need. The work that went into creating it highlights a pervasive problem: Even making an appointment can be a barrier that keeps women from improving their lives. 
“We Need to Talk” is a compilation of all Mississippi clinics offering prenatal care – specifying which ones also offer family planning, and whether they take Medicaid insurance, Medicaid waivers and see women whose Medicaid applications are pending. There is also a hotline designed to give additional support to anyone having questions or feeling overwhelmed about the process.
“Having gone through the work, it was remarkable. It wasn’t easy to figure out where you should go for care,” said Dr. Thomas Dobbs, former state health officer and dean of the John D. Bower School of Population Health at UMMC, who oversaw the project. “And that should be one of the most basic bits of information we have.”
The idea was born from the recent 900% increase in babies born with syphilis, Dobbs explained, which he called a “canary in a coal mine” signaling more danger to come.
An investigation into the epidemic showed that one of the driving factors was delayed prenatal care,  caused in large part by inaccessible information and concerns about cost, Dobbs said.
Finding reproductive and prenatal care can be difficult for several reasons. 
For one thing, there are many different kinds of clinics in Mississippi, making it hard for patients to know what to search for. The list includes federally qualified health centers, county health department clinics and private OB-GYNs. Another reason is that many clinics don’t specify online whether they take Medicaid, much less what their policy is on specific or temporary Medicaid coverage. Calling doesn’t always guarantee patients a comprehensive or accurate answer.
The new database is an initiative of UMMC’s Myrlie Evers-Williams Institute – housed in the Jackson Medical Mall – which is committed to eliminating health disparities by studying the intersection of health and social issues. The institute has a clinic on site that practices what’s called “social medicine,” a key element of eliminating those disparities, the institute’s executive director Victoria Gholar explained.

“If you have a patient who has asthma and they’re living in a situation where mold is in their environment, it will really be hard for them to get better,” Gholar said. “Or, if we have a patient who has to use an electronic (medical) device, and their electricity is no longer available because they weren’t able to take care of their utility bill, then we try to work with them and connect them to resources that might be able to help.”
The institute employs a wide range of professionals who work on health from a non-clinical standpoint, such as researchers, community engagers, social workers and registered dietitians. It hosts events like food drives and offers free support from budgeting strategies to meal preparation for those with conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure. 
Aside from knowing what to search for, finding clinics that accept Medicaid can also be complicated because Mississippi Medicaid eligibility is constantly changing for a woman based on her age and circumstance – what kinds of services she’s seeking, as well as whether she’s pregnant. 
Medicaid eligibility in Mississippi is among the strictest in the nation, with one exception – pregnant women. That means many low-income women only become eligible for Medicaid once pregnant. And since an application can take up to eight weeks to be processed, the chances that a woman in this situation will be able to use her newly-acquired Medicaid insurance in the first trimester are slim. 
A law that would cut out this interim period and allow low-income pregnant women to be immediately seen by a doctor passed the Legislature in 2024, but was never implemented because of legislative errors. The policy went back through the Legislature in 2025, passed overwhelmingly again, but is not yet in effect. 
Some doctors already see women whose Medicaid application is pending, and the UMMC tool specifies at which clinics that’s the case. 
Women of reproductive age seeking reproductive health care are also eligible for leniency in the typical Medicaid stipulations. These women can apply for a Medicaid family planning waiver, which allows them to access Medicaid for family planning purposes, even if they don’t qualify for general Medicaid coverage. 
The income requirement for pregnancy Medicaid and the family planning waiver is a household income of less than 194% of the federal poverty level, or about $2,500 for one person  in 2025. 
Dobbs, who has been the main point person on the project, said he hopes  the online database is one more resource improving health care accessibility and women’s health metrics in Mississippi. 
“This isn’t about getting patients to UMMC at all,” Dobbs said. “It’s about empowering patients to be able to get the care they need where they live.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/04120917/3X0A4199.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Acknowledging the uncertainty of how profound the federal funding cuts could be and the possibility of a recession, Florida legislative leaders want to set aside $1.5 billion over the next two fiscal years.
As Florida lawmakers continue meetings this week in Tallahassee to pass a budget after the process fell apart earlier in the year, Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez are touting the plan to bolster a $4.4 billion fund, called the Budget Stabilization Fund.
A dispute over the state budget, the only bill lawmakers must pass, caused the Legislature to extend the 60-day regular session, and lawmakers voted Thursday to extend their time to finish the budget until June 18. Although lawmakers agreed to spend $50 billion in general revenue the next fiscal year, they’re still working out the details of how that money will be spent.
The Legislature started advancing on Thursday a 2026 ballot amendment to increase the cap on how much money can sit in the BSF from 10% to 25% of revenue collections. At least 60% of voters will need to approve the proposed constitutional amendment, but lawmakers still plan to set aside $1.5 billion over the next two fiscal years in the meantime.
Anticipating the unexpected
Federal funding made up a third of the state budget last year, and Albritton told reporters Thursday that the state shouldn’t expect to receive the same level. His comments come as Congress considers hundreds of billions in cuts to Medicaid and food assistance over the next decade.
Medicaid cuts could rock state’s budget, provider pay, and the care being delivered

“Should we have the expectation that if the federal government is spending less to get their budget and their debt more under control, that we should be held harmless? I don’t think it works that way,” he said. “We’re the third-largest state in the country.”
Lawmakers want authorization to dip into the emergency reserves when revenue falls to the point that the BSF’s balance is more than 20% of net revenue going into the state’s primary general revenue fund to cover “critical state needs,” a term that hasn’t been defined. The last time the state withdrew money from the fund was during the Great Recession, according to a legislative analysis.
Meanwhile, Perez said the BSF serves as a way to prevent lawmakers from having to raise taxes in the future in case of a recession.
“None of us know what the future holds,” he said Thursday. “I think this is just a preparation of being prepared for the unexpected, and none of us know what the unexpected is, but we have a sample to look at in the 2000s when we had a recession. The state of Florida was not prepared for that recession.”
Regarding federal assistance during the Atlantic hurricane season, which started June 1, Perez said decisions at the state level would come as the federal government solidifies a plan. The federal fiscal year starts on Oct. 1.
“The federal government right now is somewhat of a moving target. I think we’re seeing decisions transpire in real time, not knowing all of the effects at the same moment. Us as a state, and I don’t just say us, I say that the Senate as well, will make decisions on how to deal with federal laws that are coming into play as they kind of come along,” he said.
Democrats view move as restricting future budgeting
But Democrats view the resolution to annually place $750 million aside in the BSF as tying the state’s hands to respond to economic downturns and current needs because accessing the fund is not as easy as spending money in the state’s normal reserves. Accessing the funds would take a two-thirds vote in each chamber.

House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell voted against the resolution to grow the BSF, saying the state needed to invest in stimulating the economy.
“You don’t get to talk about saving money for a rainy day when it’s still raining, and it’s already raining on the people in Florida,” she said.
Rich Templin, director of politics and public policy for the Florida AFL-CIO, likened the resolution to bolster the BSF to having to pay $1,000 rent and placing that money in a savings account instead.
“When we consider this joint resolution in the midst of this budgeting process that we are in, it seems that what we value is putting money into an account that may or may never be used as opposed to funding kids having access to healthcare, or education, or teacher salaries.”
Tax cuts and exemptions
Both Albritton and Perez say their plan to eliminate taxes on business rent coupled with $350 million in permanent sales tax exemptions will help Floridians save money. However, they haven’t reached an agreement on what items will be included in the sales tax exemptions and when.
Eliminating the tax for commercial leases, which is expected to cost $900 million, doesn’t translate to direct savings to the average person, but it would be good for the state as a whole, Albritton said.
“I’ll be the first one to say, of course, that doesn’t apply to everyone in every situation, but the fact of the matter is, nothing we do, nothing you do, is perfect, and nothing we do can be perfect for every single Floridian,” he said. “But in totality, when you are lowering what is a competitive disadvantage in Florida compared to other states, you’re doing good for Florida as a whole.”

The Senate voted in favor of two of these bills on Thursday. Others have already passed both chambers but still need to be funded.  
“As legislators, we consistently hear that one of the top issues on the minds of Maine people is access to safe, affordable housing,” Sen. Chip Curry (D-Belfast), co-chair of the Housing and Economic Development Committee, said during a press conference following Thursday’s votes. “That’s why our committee has been focused on two deeply connected challenges: how to build more housing in Maine, and just as urgently, how to protect the affordable housing we still have. It has become very clear to us that a critical component of this mission is protecting the residents of mobile home parks.”

The upper chamber voted 25-7 on Thursday to pass LD 1145 — after much discussion and a motion to table the measure failed. This bill would give a group of mobile home owners or a mobile home owners’ association the right of first refusal to purchase a mobile home park if the owner intends to sell. 
“This bill is about giving Mainers a fighting chance, a chance to protect their homes, a chance to protect their communities,” Sen. Tim Nangle (D-Cumberland) said on the floor.
Nangle’s father bought a mobile home park in Massachusetts and ran it as a community, with the philosophy “pay what you can and communicate,” Nangle said. 
Since his father died, he and his siblings have tried to keep that spirit alive, however they started getting calls from out-of-state private equity firms recently interested in purchasing. But Massachusetts has a right of first refusal law, so the park residents were afforded the time to purchase the park themselves. 
Last session, lawmakers passed a law that requires mobile home park owners to notify residents of their intent to sell and give them at least 60 days to make an offer.
“But it really didn’t go far enough,” Nangle said. “Right now, even if residents organize, raise the money and match or even exceed the offer, they can still be turned away with no explanation. The bill says, if you can match the offer, you have the right to pay.”
The version passed by the Senate was amended to include an emergency preamble, which was the version also passed by the majority of the Housing and Economic Development Committee. If enacted as an emergency, which will require the support of two-thirds of the Legislature, the bill would take effect immediately. 
Having the bill take effect sooner would be beneficial for the newly created Friendly Village Cooperative, said cooperative president Dawn Beaulieu, a 30-year resident of the park. Residents formed the cooperative after being notified in March that the park was for sale.
“[We] have since made a counteroffer to purchase the park,” Beaulieu said during the Thursday press conference. “As of today, we are still waiting for a response to that offer. Our livelihoods should not be in the hands of an out-of-state conglomerate that sees us not as a community, but as an investment. The legislation being considered here in Augusta will help us put our fate in our own hands.”
Whether other related bills become law will likely be a matter of funding priorities. 
Both chambers already backed LD 255, which would allocate $3 million in one-time funding to create the manufactured and mobile home park preservation and assistance program to help preserve parks as affordable housing and support residents in purchasing their parks.
However, it now sits on the appropriations table, where bills with fiscal notes that are backed by the full Legislature are placed to vie for remaining funds after the budget is set. 
To save affordable housing, states promote resident-owned mobile home parks

Though, the bill could still be funded in the two-year budget addition, which lawmakers have yet to set with less than two weeks remaining until their expected end date. 
That’s also the case for LD 554, which aims to encourage resident-owned communities through tax deductions. Another bill, LD 1768, which would amend the real estate transfer tax in an effort to protect mobile home parks, has also been backed by both chambers. But it would result in a decrease to state revenue and need a one-time appropriation so it may also land on the table.
On Wednesday, the Senate also passed LD 1016, which would establish the assistance program fund but also a fee to help with ongoing funding. The fee would be paid by certain park buyers equal to $10,000 for each lot in the community. 
“I want to be very clear, I have no intention to de-incentivize the purchase of these parks by everyone,” said Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln), the bill sponsor. “There are exceptions to this fee to state and municipal housing authorities, for resident owner cooperatives and for smaller businesses and individuals with net worths of less than $50 million.”
However, Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), who supported the minority committee report recommending against the bill’s passage, said he finds some of the carveouts troubling, specifically the one based on net worth. 
“It is treating people unfairly based on an arbitrary amount of money that that person or entity owns,” Bennett said. “I believe this is unconstitutional for that reason, although it’s very well intentioned.”

Ned Lamont said Thursday that economic uncertainties and political chaos only increase the chances that he will seek a third term.,"Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday that the challenges of navigating the economic uncertainties and political chaos generated by President Donald J. Trump only increase the chances he will seek a third term as governor of Connecticut in 2026.
“If you had asked me a year ago, I would have said, ‘No, I think the state’s on a good trajectory. We’ve stabilized things. We’re growing again. Time to pass the mantle,’” Lamont said. 
He said he no longer is so eager to step aside.
“It’s also an incredibly complicated time right now, starting with all the uncertainty of Washington, the increased possibility of a recession,” Lamont said. “So, maybe a time where experience makes a difference. That’s a way of saying I’m thinking about it seriously.”
Lamont, 71, a self-described centrist Democrat, stopped well short of declaring his candidacy, but he gave his strongest indication to date of an inclination to seek another four-year term with Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz.
“I love the job,” he said. “I think we’ve had extraordinary progress compared to where we were, say, 10 years ago. I think Susan and I are a pretty good team.”
Lamont met with reporters in his Capitol office at midday, just 12 hours after the General Assembly reached its constitutional adjournment deadline of midnight Wednesday.

The governor said the Democratic bench was well stocked if he didn’t run.
“We got some extraordinary folks and Democrats, and I work very closely with each and every one of them,” he said. 
But sees himself with an edge.
“I think it’s executive experience, having sat in this chair for the last six and a half years, having been through the Trump administration, having been through COVID, having worked closely with the leadership on both sides of the aisle,” Lamont said.
He defended the granular details of the recently adopted budget and the broad strokes of his record as a governor overseeing a remarkable series of budget surpluses that have filled the state’s budget reserves and allowed the state to pay down unfunded pension debt.
With those surpluses has come pressure from the political left to address unmet needs, including low Medicaid reimbursement rates for medical providers. Lamont, they say, is too concerned with keeping spending within the state’s fiscal guardrails.
The criticism is not discouraging him as he finalizes a decision whether to run, he said.
“I’m a lot more inclined and interested in keeping going, keep this positive momentum going, than I was, say, six months or a year ago. That said, I still have some conversations to make. I put everything on hold during this last four or five months. We had a pretty tricky budget session to get through.”
The “tricky” part was finding ways to satisfy Democrats lawmakers within the constraints of spending caps.
“I think it’s an honestly balanced budget,” Lamont said, adding it’s based upon “a pretty conservative set of assumptions.”
The budget assumes that household income will grow about 4% annually over the next two years. But it also stretches Connecticut’s budget controls without breaking them legally.
The largest initiative, a new $220 million endowment to grow early education and child care services dramatically over the next decade, will be established outside of the formal budget and spending cap.
In doing so, the leaders of the Republican legislative minorities say Lamont is losing his credibility as a fiscal centrist, a theme the GOP will try to develop if Lamont runs.
“Fiscal moderation has officially left the state Capitol,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, proclaimed recently.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said, “This budget eviscerates all of our fiscal guardrails.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, smiled Wednesday when asked about the GOP efforts to define Lamont as a born-again, tax-and-spend liberal.
“The governor is being attacked by the left and the right, and so he’s probably here,” Ritter said, pointing to the center of the table. “And the answer is, always here.”

On Thursday, Lamont concurred: the political center is his comfort zone. He noted that Republicans regularly have claimed his two-year budgets were built on shaky foundations.
“‘You’re going to be in deficit within two years. You’re going to be raising taxes.’ Well, at six years later, stop crying wolf,” Lamont said.
Despite the off-budget spending on early childhood education, the governor estimated that at least $1.2 billion of this fiscal year’s $2.4 billion projected surplus still would be used to cover more unfunded pension liabilities
He reiterated his intention to veto a bill that would give jobless benefits to strikers, a source of tension with the Connecticut AFL-CIO. He also announced an intention to veto a bill sought by Republicans — and opposed both by the building trades unions and the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
The measure, House Bill 7004, is intended to give Plainfield, a small town in eastern Connecticut, the ability to hold a referendum over a proposed trash-to-energy plant and possibly influence the state Siting Council to block the project. He briefly deferred a question about the bill to a senior staff, who confirmed it indeed would be vetoed.
“I’m vetoing that,” Lamont said, laughing. “I just made that strong decision by myself.”
Lamont said he welcomed passage of a bill encouraging housing construction, though he had yet to finish reviewing it.
“We’re never going to get economic growth [and] keep it going if we don’t have a place for people to live, young people to live, workforce housing, getting our cities growing again,” he said.
Opponents in Fairfield County have urged him to veto the bill.
“I think there’s some red flags in it, and I know why it makes people nervous,” he said. “But it’s basically gross misrepresentation from the anti-growth people down there that are stirring people up. They’re saying it’s a big mandate. You’re gonna forcing me to build housing, you know, in my backyard, which is not what the strategy is at all. It’s trying to tell towns, you take the lead, you show us where you want that housing to go. It’s important for your community.”

The program outlines certification requirements for health care providers and pharmacies to dispense mifepristone, plus paperwork that patients must sign.About 65% of abortions in Massachusetts in 2023 were medication abortions, according to the 64-page citizen petition Campbell co-filed Thursday.The FDA says REMS programs are used for drugs with “serious safety concerns to help ensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks.” Campbell’s office contends the mifepristone requirements impose “burdensome restrictions on access to medication abortion while not meaningfully improving patient safety, and that these restrictions severely impede patient access by reducing the number of prescribers and pharmacies authorized to dispense this FDA-approved medication.”“The Mifepristone REMS Program also imposes an undue burden on pregnant patients experiencing miscarriage and early pregnancy loss who seek treatment at emergency departments,” the petition says. “For instance, the administrative requirements imposed by the REMS can effectively discourage emergency departments from carrying mifepristone in their pharmacies.”Reduced access to mifepristone can particularly impact patients in rural and medically underserved areas, the petition added. The Democratic AGs teamed up in response to US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy recently instructing FDA Commissioner Martin Makary to pursue a “complete review” of mifepristone and labeling requirements.In response to the Trump administration, Beacon Hill lawmakers are escalating their focus on shoring up protections for reproductive and transgender care. A Sen. Cindy Friedman bill (S 2522) that’s gaining traction would tighten the 2022 abortion shield law, including by requiring hospitals to provide emergency abortion care and allowing provider practices, rather than specific prescriber names, to appear on medication abortion labels.The post AG pushes back on federal abortion medication restrictions appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/repro.webp?fit=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

Fuel shortages affected businesses like his in western Kansas and other Midwest states. (Submitted)TOPEKA — Multiple factors merged to create a fuel shortage affecting western Kansas and three other Midwest states, and one expert expects it to take months for fuel storage capacity to return to normal.
Brian Posler, executive director of Fuel True, said the complex system that maintains fuel stores to avoid shortages was hit by several unusual events this year. Fuel True is a nonprofit trade association representing Kansas fuel distributors and convenience stores. 
Although the storage tanks that hold as much as 500,000 gallons of fuel may take some time to replenish, Charlie Robinson, owner of Robinson Oil Co. in Garden City, is grateful fuel supplies at terminals started returning to normal last week.
Robinson’s company markets fuel, buying it from fuel terminals and then delivering it to the end user, typically smaller users such as farms and feedlots. Typically he buys fuel from the Scott City terminal located closest to his business. There also are terminals in McPherson, Salina and Concordia that serve western Kansas, which is the challenge, he said. 
“What accentuates our problem out here is the logistical distance between terminals,” he said. 
Beginning in March, nearby terminals began to have low or no supplies of diesel and eventually even regular gasoline, Robinson said. These last two months have been “absolutely unusual”during his 40 years in the oil business, he added.
“The Scott City terminal, we did not go there for six weeks to two months to get product. They had nothing to offer us up there,” Robinson said. “We pulled product out of Enid, Oklahoma, which would be about 250 miles, and then McPherson, which is a couple of hundred miles.”
Because of lines at the terminal as truckers waited to fill up, a driver who could usually get two loads of fuel in one day would only have time to get one because they’re only allowed to drive a certain amount of time before taking a break, Robinson said. 
To address that situation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration issued an emergency declaration in mid May for Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa, and then updated it May 23 to include South Dakota. The declaration temporarily lifts some regulations, such as how many hours a truck driver can be on the road before taking a mandatory break, so that motor carriers can better respond to the shortages. 
Truck drivers were spending hours waiting in line and needed flexibility in driving hours, which the emergency declaration offered, Posler said. The declaration only affects those drivers providing direct assistance supporting emergency relief efforts.
“Under normal circumstances, we have really important safety rules and drivers can only be behind the wheel a total of 11 hours (per day),” Posler said. “But if you are driving a great distance and then sitting in line for hours waiting your turn, all of a sudden you’re bumping against those hours of service really quickly.”
Posler said Gov. Laura Kelly originally made an emergency declaration for the state that lasted 14 days in the hopes the fuel situation would be alleviated. 
“It quickly became apparent that instead of that, shortages started getting farther and wider,” Posler said. He said distributors were going as far away as Amarillo and Denver to find fuel. 
There was either no fuel available or if it was, it was strictly allocated, often to big contracts for stores like Casey’s and Love’s, he said.  
Because it looked as though low supplies would continue, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration acted after Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa petitioned for a regional waiver. 
 
Slow recovery
“I am very impressed with how our members have navigated this environment over the last month or two, with as few fuel outages at gas stations that we have seen,” Posler said.
Distributors have delivered partial loads to different customers, adapting to billing everything separately instead of delivering a full load and billing as they normally do, he said. 
Recovery, though, is likely to take months. 
“They depleted the stores, which are maybe 500,000-gallon tanks, so those are not going to get replenished quickly and easily at a time of peak demand,” Posler said. 
Robinson pulled up a website that looks at supplies at terminals across the country. As of Thursday, the Scott City terminal is “borderline” on diesel fuel, but the Wichita area and Great Bend terminals have all products, he said. 
Enid, Oklahoma, though, has no diesel fuel, Robinson said. 
Buying patterns
Posler said numerous factors came together to create this year’s shortage. 
Farmers typically stock up on fuel in the fall because prices are sometimes lower and they can reduce tax liabilities, Posler said.
“This year, because of where prices were and the incoming change of administration, the word on the street is that a lot fewer farmers stocked up and then needed to buy in the spring,” he said. 
That shift, added to the usual annual surge in fuel use in the spring as more people are on the road, shifted demand patterns. 
 
Maintenance challenges
Kansas has three refineries and each one, at some point during the year, does what is called “turnaround,” Posler said. Normally, they operate year-round and 24 hours a day, but during turnaround, crews come into the refinery to perform annual maintenance. 
CHS Refinery in McPherson was undergoing its turnaround at the same time these other factors were affecting fuel supplies, Posler said. 
Repairs on the Magellan Pipeline, a 9,000-mile pipeline that crosses 14 states, also were taking longer than expected, he said.  
“ONEOK owns the Magellan pipeline,” Posler said. “The Magellan is a very important pipe that runs in the east-west direction in Kansas. ONEOK was doing stress testing and they found some repairs and blowouts that needed to be done, and the repairs are taking longer than anticipated.”
ONEOK spokesperson Charlsey Phillips said the company had completed routine maintenance and resumed operations on a segment of the company’s Kansas pipeline.
Refineries also shifted their fuel blends from winter to summer blends, Posler said, which can slow processes. Summer blends have less butane in them, making them less volatile. 
 
Strong infrastructure
Robinson’s company and customers were affected by the shortage, seeing increased freight costs. 
“It came at a cost,” he said, adding that he appreciated Posler’s work at Fuel True to reach out to the Kansas Corporation Commission and Kelly, who were all responsive.
“I would say, in general, we have a very strong infrastructure relative to other countries around the world,” Posler said. “Here in the Heartland, we’re fortunate that we have three refineries in our state, and we have more than one pipeline option that moves through the state. We are blessed compared to some states, under normal circumstances.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Charlie-Robinson-garden-city-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 17:09:22.686927

Tim Walz speaks with Minnesota Reformer Editor in Chief Patrick Coolican in front of States Newsroom leaders and reporters Thursday, June 5, 2025 at the Royal Sonesta in downtown Minneapolis.Gov. Tim Walz called Tuesday’s major law enforcement presence in south Minneapolis “chaotic” and said his Department of Public Safety had no advance notice. 
“I think any professional, especially in law enforcement or the military, tells you you do not want chaos,” Walz told a gathering of States Newsroom editors Thursday. 
On Tuesday, dozens of federal officers raided a taco restaurant in Minneapolis, drawing community members and activists in protest. The Minneapolis Police Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement were among those present. MPD only assisted with crowd control, Mayor Jacob Frey said. 
The operation has drawn widespread criticism from some local elected officials and Attorney General Keith Ellison for spreading fear in a community already on edge due to President Donald Trump’s aggressive use of deportation of immigrants, including some here legally. The incident has reupped an ongoing debate about the proper role of local police in immigration enforcement, though law enforcement officials say the operation wasn’t related to immigration. 
The operation was the first in Minnesota carried out by Trump’s Homeland Security Task Force. Frey said the raid was based on “a criminal search warrant for drugs and money laundering” unrelated to immigration enforcement. 
Walz said he was supportive of stopping possible criminal activity but criticized the lack of information he received and the way the operation was carried out. 
“I don’t see how anybody can think it’s a good situation to see a heavy militarized presence in a residential neighborhood,” Walz said. “We’ll follow the law federally, but we want to make sure that our folks are protected and that human dignity and due process is followed.”  
Ellison commented on the raid to States Newsroom reporters on Wednesday. 
“If they want to inflict fear, and they wanted to discourage cooperation, they achieved both those goals yesterday,” Ellison said. 
Walz also spoke more broadly about the need for immigrants in Minnesota amid low unemployment rates, addressing the crucial role immigrants play in the workforce. In 2023, foreign-born workers made up 10.9% of Minnesota’s labor force. 
“There’s not a cow being milked in Minnesota that’s not being milked by an immigrant,” Walz said.
Walz will be testifying before the House Oversight Committee on June 12 about Minnesota’s “sanctuary” immigration policies.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250605_0100-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-05 16:15:10.525344

Two adults resided at the home in the Bunker Hill Community Cooperative just south of Frazer’s Place diner off Route 12, according to officials.The identities of the occupants have not been released and no charges have been filed, although the matter remains under investigation, police said.Removed from the residence were a total of 165 animals, including 28 dogs, 14 cats, 11 guinea pigs, 40 sugar gliders, four rabbits and 68 birds, Windsor police said in an emailed news release Tuesday.Joining Windsor police in the operation were Windham County Humane Society, Lucy Mackenzie Humane Society, Humane Society of Chittenden County, Springfield Humane Society, along with a veterinarian, a wildlife removal specialist and animal control officers from the Brattleboro and Springfield, Vt.Also enlisted for advice were Humane World for Animals, Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, Vermont Fish & Wildlife, Windsor Fire Department and the town’s health officer, police said.“This turned out to be a very complex operation to put this together once police found out about it because of all the regulations involved,” Tom Marsh, Windsor town manager, said on Tuesday. “It required a pretty wide network and support from state agencies.A rescued guinea pig rests in a box of hay at the Lucy Mackenzie Humane Society in West Windsor on Wednesday, June 4. “They were really loved, it was just a sad situation,” executive director Jackie Stanley said of the animals who were surrendered.

(A sugar glider is a squirrel-size, tree-dwelling nocturnal marsupial).“The remarkable thing about this household was the multiple species. So the coordination of relocating them among all the shelters in Vermont and humane organizations was the huge effort,” she said.Stanley said the dogs are being evaluated in the same manner as any incoming potential pet and will be treated for parasites, vaccinated, spayed or neutered and “evaluated for behavior.” She said they could be ready for adoption in “one or two weeks.”Program coordinator Amy Woodman cleans out sugar glider cages at the Lucy Mackenzie Humane Society in West Windsor, on Wednesday, June 4. The shelter is working to find placements for the 12 nocturnal marsupials and they have already been in contact with several experienced sugar glider owners interested in adopting. “They’re very unique creatures,” Woodman said. Photo by Alex Driehaus/Valley News“We’ve already had inquiries about the sugar gliders,” Stanley said.Windsor police said the investigation began last April when they received a complaint “from a citizen” about “the number of animals living inside the residence and feared for the health of the occupants.”When police investigated, they found animals in cages in each of the rooms of the residence with some cages “stacked up on others” and all the animals located inside the residence, the Tuesday news release said.The occupants “cooperated with authorities and willingly allowed the removal of the animals,” police said.On-scene veterinarians assessed the animals prior to their removal and most “appeared to be in good overall health, with a few needing medical attention going forward.”The occupants are cooperating with the ongoing investigation, police said.Marsh said it does not appear that the residents were breeding animals to sell.“The intention was more: ‘We’re giving a home to these animals that don’t have a home,’ ” Marsh said.He likened the animals inside the residence to a “hoarding situation as opposed to a nefarious breeding operation.”“Unfortunately they thought they were doing something good and they weren’t,” Marsh said, adding “there’s a mental health aspect.”Windham County Humane Society posted on its Facebook page on Saturday that they took in 16 dogs and two “sphinx cats” from the Windsor rescue operation and that the next day one of the dogs gave birth to six puppies.Within days, some of the Windsor dogs had already found new forever homes, the Society announced, noting that they are “basking in the warm sunshine, happily romping around and napping together in the fresh air, and loving their newfound freedom from the cramped space they called home for too long.”The society launched a special fundraising campaign to help “create a happy ending to a hoarding case” with a goal of raising $5,000.By Tuesday afternoon, the Windham organization had raised $3,626 toward its goal.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Authorities relocate more than 160 animals from ‘hoarding’ situation in Windsor.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/animal-shelter-1.jpg,,,2025-06-05 16:15:10.525344

The D.C. region’s largest Salvadoran festival — and one of the area’s largest Latino heritage events — has been canceled due to fears surrounding immigration policies put on by the Trump administration.
Organizers for Salvadoreñisimo Festival told WTOP the annual event, which was set to take place at the Montgomery County Agricultural Fairgrounds in Gaithersburg, has been canceled for this year. It normally takes place in September around the time of Independence Day in El Salvador, Sept. 15, and Hispanic Heritage Month.
Organizers told WTOP they did not want to put those in the audience in danger of possible raids from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.
The event welcomes thousands of people for musical performances, comedic skits and food. The festival was set to celebrate its 20th anniversary this year.
The D.C. region is home to one of the largest Salvadoran populations in the country. The U.S. Census reports Salvadorans represents more than a quarter of the Latino population in Maryland and D.C.
Local outlet Telemundo 44 was the first to report the event’s cancellation.
Concerts and events around the country have been affected because of immigration policies being pushed by the Trump administration. In April, Michelada Fest — a two-day music festival in Chicago — was canceled after performers experienced issues with visas.

SPRINGFIELD – Gov. JB Pritzker got some of what he requested from the General Assembly in the area of higher education, but some of his biggest requests fell short.

Pritzker’s wins include a $10 million increase in need-based student financial aid and passage of a direct admission program to make it easier for eligible Illinois high school and community college students to apply to public universities.

But lawmakers did not approve the overall funding increase that Pritzker requested at the start of the session, settling on a 1% bump in their operational budgets instead of the 3% the governor proposed, Pritzker’s office, however, has said there are contingencies to provide an additional 2% in the event of significant cuts in federal funding.

They also did not pass other major higher education policy initiatives, including Pritzker’s plan to allow community colleges to offer four-year bachelor’s degrees in certain high-demand career fields, and a long-sought overhaul in the way Illinois funds its public universities.

“You don’t get everything done in one year,” Pritzker said during a post-session news conference when asked about several of his initiatives that failed to pass this year. “Sometimes they (lawmakers) spend two years, four years, six years, trying to get something big done.”

Community college proposal

In his State of the State address in February, Pritzker called for allowing community colleges to offer baccalaureate degrees as a way of expanding access to those programs, especially for older, nontraditional students who may not live close to a four-year university.

“With lower tuition rates and a greater presence across the state — especially in rural areas — community colleges provide the flexibility and affordability students need,” Pritzker told the General Assembly. “This is a consumer-driven, student-centered proposal that will help fill the needs of regional employers in high-need sectors and create a pathway to stable, quality jobs for more Illinoisans.”

In the legislature, however, the proposal ran into stiff opposition from several sources, including universities that  said the plan lacked sufficient safeguards to prevent community colleges from offering duplicative programs that would siphon prospective students away from their campuses.

Amid that opposition, House Bill 3717, which was carried by Rep. Tracy Katz-Muhl, D-Northbrook, failed to advance out of a key committee before a mid-session deadline in March. And even after amendments were negotiated that led to universities dropping their opposition and the bill was reassigned to a different committee, it still failed to gain enough traction to advance to the House floor.

That was mainly due to opposition from the Legislative Black Caucus, whose members said it still posed a threat to the three universities in Illinois that serve primarily Black and Latino students — Chicago State University; Governors State University, and Northeastern Illinois University — which are all located in the Chicago metropolitan area alongside multiple community colleges.

“Chicago State is hemorrhaging,” Rep. Curtis Tarver, D-Chicago, said during a May 23 House Executive Committee hearing. “And you all, as an administration, are handing them Band-Aids and they need stitches. And then you come in and you provide a bill that's going to be even worse for them, with 11 community colleges within 25 miles of them. And I'm saying as we sit here that the Black Caucus has an issue with the bill.”

Funding overhaul

Another proposal that failed to advance  called for establishing a new formula for funding public universities.

House Bill 1581 and its companion Senate Bill 13, known as the Adequate and Equitable Public University Funding Act, called for establishing a funding structure like the Evidence-Based Funding formula used for K-12 education.

That formula would use objective standards to determine an adequate level of funding for each university. The bills then called for adding as much as $1.7 billion in new funding for universities over the next 10-15 years, with most of the funding going toward schools furthest away from their adequacy target.

The proposal grew out of a commission formed in 2021 within the Illinois Board of Higher Education. That commission worked for nearly three years to develop a proposal and issued its report and recommendations to the General Assembly in March 2024.

Under the proposed formula, Western Illinois University in Macomb would have earned top priority for new funding because it is currently funded at only 46% of its adequacy target. Northeastern Illinois University and Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville, at 47% of adequacy, would have been next in line.

But the state’s flagship institution, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, currently at 89% of adequacy, would rank at the bottom of the priority list. For that reason, the U of I System opposed the plan.

“The University of Illinois System is absolutely dedicated to expanding equitable access, enhancing student success and promoting statewide economic growth,” Nick Jones, executive vice president and vice president of academic affairs for the U of I System, told a Senate committee in April. “The proposed legislation penalizes institutions that provide the most support for underrepresented and rural students while failing to ensure long-term access.”

Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, D-Westchester, who sponsored the Senate bill and was a cochair of the study commission, said she was disappointed it did not pass this year, but vowed working for a more equitable funding formula.

“While it is far past time to pass an equitable funding model, I am reminded that many of the comprehensive plans I’ve passed have taken years of research, input and negotiations,” she said in an email statement. “This legislation is no different.”

Robin Steans, president of the education advocacy group Advance Illinois, who also served on the commission, said in a separate statement that she expects lawmakers to continue discussing the bill over the summer. Action could come during the fall veto session or early in the 2026 regular session, she said.

“Eventual adoption of the Adequate & Equitable Funding bill represents a significant change, one that requires new investment by our state in what remains the surest path to greater mobility and opportunity for Illinois families,” she said. “The questions and comments made during legislative committee meetings indicate that Illinois lawmakers get that, and powerful testimony from the state’s university leaders drove home the urgency of this issue.”

Kevin Stitt on Thursday announced the launch of new security protocols for major events developed by the Secure Oklahoma NOW advisory council.  
The guidelines were crafted over five months by a 12-member advisory council who are “subject matter experts” on emergency preparedness and response. The tool is currently available online for use in planning large events and in case emergency response is needed. 
  Tim Tipton, commissioner of the Department of Public Safety, explains the new safety guidelines for Oklahoma events developed by an advisory council. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)
Oklahoma Commissioner of Public Safety Tim Tipton said having this set of standards will help to prevent emergency events and allow for proper responses. 
“Prevention is always our primary goal, but then we also have to be prepared for response,” he said. “If that bad thing happens, then how do we respond? How do we mitigate the amount of damage or harm or hurt that our citizens might be affected by?” 
The guidelines are a “living document” that will change as threats and technology evolve, Tipton said. 
“It’s one of those deals that there’s really no room for failure on our part, we’ve got to make this work every time,” he said. 
The nine-page guide creates a rating system based on various factors at an event like attendance, venue, traffic and event type. Recommendations for steps to take are offered based on an event’s rating, with resources provided to implement the guidelines. 
The council is made up of Oklahoma’s public safety, law enforcement, emergency management and counterterrorism officials who helped craft the recommendations. 
Stitt established the council with an executive order Jan. 13 following an attack on Bourbon Street in New Orleans on New Year’s Day that killed 14 people. 
“We’re just seeing some of these kind of attacks happen,” he said. “And as we look forward to the big events here in Oklahoma, I just want to make sure that that as Oklahoma, we’re as well prepared as we can to address it in these threats. So tonight, we have the Oklahoma City Thunder game coming up and then we’re going to have a championship parade, hopefully, in a couple of weeks. And so the whole world’s going to be looking at our city.”
Local officials will have a better understanding of what state resources are available to them, Stitt said, including threat assessments from the Oklahoma Counter Terrorism Intelligence Center and a drone response team from the state Department of Public Safety. 
Both Stitt and Tipton encouraged Oklahomans to use the Protect OK app to report concerning or suspicious activity. Submissions to the app are constantly monitored, Tipton said.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Both chambers of the Maine Legislature advanced a version of a bill that would make it easier for school staff to restrain and seclude students, weakening a law passed in 2021 restricting the use of practices that experts say cause lasting trauma.
Maine has historically led the country in its use of these practices, which include physically immobilizing students and placing them in small rooms, with educators predominantly using them on students with disabilities. Restraint and seclusion practices have been used more than 22,000 times in Maine in some years, and the real number is even higher, since many large districts do not submit their data to the state despite reporting being required by the 2021 law. 
This year, citing increased issues with student behavior, some teachers and administrators pushed to relax the restrictions. 
‘It broke him, and it broke me’: Parents, educators describe trauma from restraint and seclusion

Despite disability rights advocates sounding the alarm at the public hearing for the bill, lawmakers in both the Maine House of Representatives and the Senate voted to pass LD 1248. 
“While most states are looking at bills this session that provide greater protections for students and more resources for educators, Maine is one of the few states that is looking to roll back protections for students,” said Ben Jones, director of legal and policy initiatives for Lives in the Balance, a Maine-based national nonprofit that offers training for schools on how to move away from restraint and seclusion.“It is a serious disappointment.”
Under Maine law, restraint and seclusion are only supposed to be used in case of emergencies, where the student’s behavior poses “imminent risk of serious physical injury” to themselves or others. The original proposal changed that to risk of injury after some educators said they interpreted the law to mean they couldn’t use these practices to prevent a potentially dangerous situation unless a teacher could be injured severely enough to seek outside medical care. 
“Staff are being hit, they’re being bit, but it doesn’t meet the threshold of serious imminent danger, because a 5-year-old isn’t going to [cause] an injury that requires medical care,” said Gardiner-area Superintendent Patricia Hopkins during the April 23 public hearing.
The amended version of the bill defines “serious physical injury” to mean “any impairment of the physical condition of a person, whether self-inflicted or inflicted by someone else, that requires a medical practitioner, including, but not limited to, a school nurse, to evaluate or treat the person.” This definition was already included in Chapter 33, the Maine Department of Education rules governing restraint and seclusion.
Another aspect of the bill allows educators to move students without their consent without having to document the incident as a restraint.
Atlee Reilly of Disability Rights Maine told lawmakers at the work session for LD 1248 that if the bill passes, schools will no longer have to report these kinds of incidents where staff forcibly move students, which he explained will likely mean the number of documented restraints could decrease.
“What we’re going to do is take a whole class of stuff — like the physical management of students that I think most people would look at and say, that child’s being restrained — and say it’s no longer restraint,” Reilly said.
He added, “It doesn’t mean that people are going to be putting their hands on kids less.”
Jones said these changes “were conjured up by schools’ lawyers who will surely use the new language as legal cover to protect schools, not kids.”

U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman granted a temporary block on the agency’s cancellation of grants and early discharge of corps members, but only for the states that sued the administration in April. Connecticut was among them. 
The federal lawsuit, filed by Democratic state officials across the country, accused President Donald Trump’s cost-cutting efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency of reneging on grants funded through the AmeriCorps State and National program, which was budgeted $557 million in congressionally approved funding this year.
Boardman also said all AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps members that were discharged from their service terms early should be reinstated, if they are willing and able to return.
[RELATED: CT AmeriCorps programs shut down by Trump administration cuts]
But Boardman allowed the 30-year-old federal agency for volunteer service to proceed with its reduction in force, denying the states’ request to restore the majority of staff that were put on administrative leave in April. The agency employs more than 500 full-time federal workers and has an operating budget of roughly $1 billion.
AmeriCorps did not immediately respond to request for comment. The Department of Justice declined to comment.
In a statement Thursday, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said, “The work that AmeriCorps members and senior volunteers do in Connecticut to keep food pantries running, tutor children, assist homebound seniors, and support our veterans is vital, and the Trump administration’s attempt to dismantle it was both cruel and lawless. This victory will allow AmeriCorps workers to continue to serve some of Connecticut’s most vulnerable residents.”
The 30-year-old agency created to facilitate volunteer service across the country oversees several programs that dispatch hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of people to serve in communities.
It sends roughly 200,000 corps members across the country as part of its service programs. Most corps members get a living stipend during their service and become eligible for funding for future education expenses or to apply for certain student loans.
As part of the AmeriCorps State and National grant program, state volunteer commissions distributed more than $177 million in formula-based distributions, as well as $370 million in competitive grants that supported nearly 35,000 corps members serving at 300 organizations, according to announcements last year.
Notices of grants being terminated were sent late on a Friday in April, explaining “the award no longer effectuates agency priorities” and directing grantees to immediately shut down the projects, according to a copy reviewed by The Associated Press.
The states that sued the administration said those extensive and immediate cancellations did not provide the legally required notice and comment period. They said the result would be severely curtailed services and programs for vulnerable populations since states and organizations could not fill the funding void.
AmeriCorps argued in court filings that a temporary block on the agency’s actions as the lawsuit proceeds would disrupt efforts to comply with Trump’s executive order creating DOGE and to “act as responsible stewards of public funds,” according to court filings.
Despite bipartisan support, AmeriCorps has long been a target of critics who decry bloat, inefficiencies and misuse of funds.
“President Trump has the legal right to restore accountability to the entire Executive Branch,” Anna Kelly, White House deputy press secretary, previously said in a statement after the lawsuit was filed.
Connecticut filed the lawsuit along with officials in Maryland, Delaware, California, Colorado, Arizona, Washington, DC, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

On Wednesday, members of the Michigan Senate Health Policy Committee met to discuss the U.S. House of Representatives’ recently passed spending bill that would slice $535 billion from the federal program over the next 10 years.
Testifying before the Democratic-controlled Michigan Senate committee were members of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, hospital officials and federally qualified health care providers.
Meghan Groen, senior deputy director of health services with the MDHHS, said one in four Michigan residents rely on Medicaid and that a significant portion of those recipients live in rural areas.
The U.S. House proposal to cap and eliminate provider taxes would cost Michigan around $525 million, Groen said, and the proposed work requirements in the federal spending bill could lead to a $155 million implementation cost with less coverage provided. Groen noted that nearly 500,000 people could face coverage loss.

One of the benefits of Michigan expanding Medicaid coverage many years ago was that health insurance could be provided to more low-income residents and reduced the financial burdens on hospitals. Eliminating the Medicaid expansion could lead to increased emergency room visits and higher health care costs overall.
“The Healthy Michigan plan involves about 750,000 Michiganders. At this point, it succeeded in exactly what it was intended to do,” Groen said. “It prevents people from going into bankruptcy and medical debt, because someone in their family got sick. Uninsured people don’t stop getting sick. They wait until they’re sicker, and then they go to an emergency room. They go with a higher level of care, where it’s more expensive to serve them, and their acuity, or how sick they are, is more intense at that time, so it costs more.”
If they don’t have money to pay that bill, Groen said, it gets left unpaid, and the providers have uncompensated care. She said the cost for everybody in the community goes up everybody who goes into that provider.
Sen. Sylvia Santana (D-Detroit) wondered about the work requirements, noting that the Institute of Health Policy and Innovation has said that 49% of Michiganders who fall into that category are already working.
Groen said the state does not have an exact number of how many in that population were actually working, but she suspected it would be most recipients. Adding the proposed requirements would lead to a lot of extra communication about recipients go on to comply with the requirement, which also say they needed to be working the month before they applied.
“It might be a little confusing for an individual who’s like, ‘great, I just got a job, I’ll apply for Medicaid,’ and then to get that determination letter [saying] that they, in fact, do not meet the requirements is going to be very confusing for people who are just reaching out, getting a job, and trying to make sure they have health care for themselves and their family,” Groen said. “We are very concerned about both what the compliance looks like for individuals who are working and individuals who are not.”
Also testifying was Katie O’Neal, a mother from Ypsilanti, who extolled how Medicaid helped her child get lifesaving care and without going through the rigors of dealing with the modern health insurance industry.
O’Neal’s son, Nathan, who came to their family through the foster care system, was born 11-weeks premature. He was eligible for Medicaid due to his inclusion in foster care. Shortly after he arrived as a member of the O’Neal family, Nathan became ill with RSV, a common respiratory virus that can have serious consequences for infants and older adults. It was later discovered that he had a stenosis, or narrowing, of his lower airway, requiring a tracheostomy.
All of that care was covered by Medicaid, O’Neal said, which was a blessing. Years later, Nathan’s airway needed to be reconstructed. A two-week intensive care unit hospital stay was necessary at a cost of more than $100,000. That procedure and follow up appointments were all covered by Medicaid.
He lives a pretty stable life now, despite a resurgence in complications from the reconstructive surgery, which is rare. Four procedures have commenced since late last summer, and each of those procedures were covered by Medicaid.
But future surgeries and complications could be harrowing if congressional Republicans’ cuts to Medicaid take hold.
“I have anxiety about the outcome and his life after surgery. I worry how first grade will go, and I wonder if we will ever escape this cycle of airway procedures,” O’Neal said. “But I don’t have to worry about convincing my insurance company that it’s necessary. Medicaid has been there for us at every turn, and now there’s a public debate about whether families like mine should still have this kind of support with Medicaid.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 16:15:10.525344

Gov. Spencer Cox on Thursday appointed John Deeds, an attorney specializing in state and local taxes, to succeed longtime Commissioner Michael Cragun, who has served on the commission since 2009. 
“John knows how to navigate complex tax issues and keep things grounded in common sense,” Cox said in a news release. “He brings the kind of practical expertise and steady leadership that will benefit both taxpayers and the commission.”
The Utah State Tax Commission is a body that oversees the administration and enforcement of Utah’s tax laws. It consists of four members, and is currently led by longtime Commission Chair John Valentine. Deeds — if his appointment is confirmed by the Utah Senate — will join Commissioners Rebecca Rockwell and Jennifer Fresques. Commissioners are appointed to four-year terms. 
Cragun will be leaving his seat on June 30, Valentine told Utah News Dispatch on Thursday. No other information was provided about Cragun’s departure, and when pressed, Valentine said, “he’s just not ready to make any public announcements at this time.” Cragun served 16 years on the commission totaling four four-year terms. He wasn’t re-appointed after his latest term expired.

Valentine praised Deeds as a “very capable tax attorney,” and he said his fellow tax commissioners are “very, very excited to have him come onto the commission and bring the expertise he can bring.” 
Deeds is currently a partner at the law firm Crapo | Deeds PLLC where he represents individuals and businesses in a wide variety of state and local tax matters. He’s been an attorney for more than 15 years, and through his career, he’s helped craft tax policy, according to an alum bio on the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics website. 
Deeds also served as a law clerk in the Utah Attorney General’s Office’s Tax and Revenue division, where he represented the Utah State Tax Commission in tax litigation and compliance issues. 
“It’s an honor to be appointed, and I’m excited to serve the people of this great state,” Deeds said in a prepared statement. “I’m committed to upholding the tax laws in a fair and impartial manner.
Deeds earned his Master of Laws in Taxation from Georgetown University Law Center. He also holds a Juris Doctor from the University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law and dual bachelor’s degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Utah.
As a member of the Utah State Bar Tax section, Deeds “frequently presents at national tax conferences and contributes to leading industry publications,” the governor’s office said in Thursday’s release. 
Deeds and his wife Jane Deeds live in Farmington with their five children. 
His appointment will be subject to confirmation by the Utah Senate. A date for that vote has not yet been scheduled.

(Amy Bushatz/Mat-Su Sentinel)PALMER – The residential Job Corps center in Palmer will remain open for now, with students continuing classes following a court order issued by a federal judge Wednesday.
U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter in New York issued the temporary restraining order as part of a lawsuit alleging that a Department of Labor directive to shut down the program is illegal.
The restraining order blocks the government from removing Job Corps students, terminating jobs, or halting the contracts that operate about 100 Job Corps centers nationwide. Any shutdown must first gain approval from Congress, the order states. The program is currently funded through June 2026, Job Corps officials said.
A hearing in the case is scheduled for June 17 in New York, according to the court order. The suit was filed Monday by the National Job Corps Association, several Job Corps contractors and a student enrolled at a Job Corps center in New York.
The U.S. Department of Labor announced a nationwide “pause” for the program last week, effectively ordering an end to all operations. Students were to be sent home, staff laid off and centers closed by the end of the month, according to the announcement.
The Don Young Job Corps Center in Palmer opened in 1994 and currently serves 160 students between the ages of 16 and 24, most of whom live on the 19-acre campus. About 80% of the program’s students come from rural Alaska villages, where no similar educational programs are available, officials there said. Job Corps students earn high school diplomas, receive technical training or both.
The Palmer program employs about 110 people and is operated under a contract with the Chugach Corp, officials said. It is the only Job Corps location in Alaska.
The Labor Department said it wants to halt the program because it is expensive to operate at about $80,000 per student and has a low graduation rate.
Officials at the Palmer center said their location costs about $37,000 per student and had a completion rate of about 70% last year. The Chugach contract is valued at about $9 million annually, they said.

Free.,Congressional Hispanic Caucus to keep pressure on immigration detention following arrests,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congressional-hispanic-caucus-keep-pressure-immigration-detention-following-arrests,,"WASHINGTON — Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus pledged Thursday to make more visits to immigration detention centers across the country to carry out oversight of the Trump administration’s crackdown.The members detailed their visits to various detention centers over last week’s recess. Many people they visited in those centers were arrested while attending their court hearings or had no criminal record, they said.“What we and our colleagues witnessed was the system being used to punish people simply for being an immigrant, and we all know that cruelty is the point with this president,” said New York Democratic Rep. Nydia Velázquez.Continued oversight of immigration detention centers will only become more important, members of the all-Democrat caucus said, if congressional Republicans succeed in passing a massive tax and spending bill that would increase immigration enforcement funding by billions, including for detention centers.Republicans are moving ahead with a legislative procedure known as reconciliation to fulfill President Donald Trump’s priorities without needing 60 votes in the U.S. Senate.The vow to continue with oversight at detention centers comes after three congressional Democrats said they were accosted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials at a New Jersey detention center last month. That incident ended with the Newark Mayor Ras Baraka arrested, and Rep. LaMonica McIver facing federal charges. The charges against Baraka were dismissed about two weeks later.“We will not succumb to any intimidation tactics,” CHC Chair Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York said. “We will continue to comply with our duty to have oversight of these detention centers, and we will visit them within the parameters of the law.”Members of Congress are allowed to conduct oversight visits at any Department of Homeland Security facility that detains immigrants, without prior notice, under provisions of an appropriations law.Collateral arrestsWashington state Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, slammed the Trump administration’s expansion of government contracts with private prison companies to detain migrants.“It is critically important that we members of Congress continue to investigate what are supposed to be civil detention centers, but instead operate as private for-profit prisons with substandard medical care and they make billions of dollars … in contracts from this administration detaining people of all legal statuses,” Jayapal said. The detention center in New Jersey reopened this year and ICE awarded GEO Group Inc. with a $1 billion contract to run the facility.Jayapal said when she conducted an oversight visit at the Tacoma, Washington, Northwest ICE Processing Center, which was formerly known as the Northwest Detention Center, over the recess, some of the people being detained were caught up in immigration enforcement raids targeting other people. Such immigration arrests are known as collateral arrests.She said one woman she spoke to who was detained had been in the country for more than 20 years, but did not have a permanent legal status.“She was swept up in a raid at the workplace, and she was detained less than a week before she was going to get married to a U.S. citizen,” Jayapal said.She said another person she talked to was a man who had been in the U.S. for 31 years and is a permanent legal resident.“These are not the so-called worst of the worst that Trump kept saying he was going to go after,” Jayapal said. “These are simply people who love this country, who have been in this country for decades, who are married to U.S. citizens and have U.S. citizen children, and do not understand why the country they love would be doing this to them.”Democratic Rep. Lou Correa of California, said that he’s come across immigrants in detention centers who were arrested while attending their court hearings.“These individuals are following the law, showing up … to court hearings, and they're having their removal cases dismissed,” he said. “Immediately as they walk out of that courtroom, they are rearrested and put into what is called an expedited removal process … to quickly get them out of the country.”",,,,2025-06-05 16:15:10.525344

U.S. District Judge Dana Christensen presided over the case.
Kevin Andrew Bacon, 51, pleaded guilty in January to conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine.
According to a Wednesday U.S Attorney’s office press release, law enforcement officers began investigating a drug trafficking ring operating around Butte in June 2022.  According to court documents, agents allegedly discovered a conspiracy operating in part by sending drugs through the U.S. Postal Service from California to Montana. Several members of the drug trafficking ring operated out of a residence in Whitehall, according to court filings.
The investigation led to the arrest of several conspirators in early January 2023, and the seizure of approximately 13 pounds of meth. On Feb 23, 2023, law enforcement located a package sent from California to “Kevin Bacon” in Manhattan. Law enforcement searched the package and located 873.5 grams of actual methamphetamine inside.
Bacon was arrested on Feb 28, 2023, when he arrived at the Manhattan post office to retrieve the package. He told investigators he had a friend in Whitehall who sold drugs and had asked Bacon to receive a package, which Bacon knew contained meth, to his P.O Box.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Lowney prosecuted the case.
The investigation was conducted by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Homeland Security Investigations, Gallatin County Sheriff’s Office and Montana Division of Criminal Investigation.

In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a Catholic Charities organization in Wisconsin doesn’t have to take part in the Wisconsin unemployment insurance (UI) system.
The ruling overturns a 4-3 Wisconsin Supreme Court decision issued in March 2024 that declared the work of Catholic Charities Bureau Inc. of the Superior Diocese of the Catholic Church doesn’t get a pass from Wisconsin’s UI law on religious grounds.
The Wisconsin ruling, written by Justice Anne Walsh Bradley, declared that the Catholic Charities work is “secular in nature” and that the agency and its subsidiary organizations that took part in the case “are not operated primarily for religious purposes” as defined in the UI law’s religious exemption.

In Thursday’s ruling, Justice Sonya Sotomayor wrote for the Court that arguments the Wisconsin high court majority made amounted to making preferences of one religious denomination over another.
Her ruling noted that the church offers its own unemployment compensation program for laid-off workers and dismissed the suggestion that the organizations were “more likely to leave their employees without unemployment benefits.”
The Wisconsin ruling held that the agencies’ work was not religious in nature because they didn’t attempt to preach the Catholic faith to participants and did not serve only Catholics.
“Petitioners’ Catholic faith, however, bars them from satisfying those criteria,” Sotomayor wrote. The ruling quoted from the dissent by Justice Rebecca Bradley in the Wisconsin decision.
“Wisconsin’s exemption,” Sotomayor wrote, “as interpreted by its Supreme Court, thus grants a denominational preference by explicitly differentiating between religions based on theological practices. Indeed, petitioners’ eligibility for the exemption ultimately turns on inherently religious choices (namely, whether to proselytize or serve only co-religionists).”
The Wisconsin UI law exempts all churches, church conventions or church associations “without differentiating between employees actually involved in religious works” and those who are not, Sotomayor wrote.
Justice Clarence Thomas, while joining in the unanimous opinion, wrote a separate concurrence stating that because the Wisconsin ruling did not defer to the Bishop of Superior’s assertion that Catholic Charities and its affiliates are “an arm of the Diocese, the Wisconsin Supreme Court violated the church autonomy doctrine.”
In a separate concurrence  Justice Ketanji Brown  Jackson signaled how states could ensure that nonprofit employees of religiously associated organizations are covered by UI — by focusing on the work involved rather than its underlying motivations to determine who is and who is not exempt.
When the federal law was revised in 1970 to include nonprofit employees in state UI programs, Congress exempted certain church-affiliated employees. The goal, Jackson wrote, was to avoid the state getting involved in a dispute “over the sufficiency of a fired employee’s prayers or the accuracy of their scriptural teaching.”
The intent of Congress was to exempt “a narrow category of church-affiliated entities” that could produce such an entanglement “precisely because their work involves preparing individuals for religious life,” Jackson wrote.
She concluded: “It is perfectly consistent with the opinion the Court hands down today for States to align their [federally-based] religious-purposes exemptions with Congress’s true focus.”

The June 4 notice, first reported by The Public’s Radio, was obtained by Rhode Island Current Thursday. The two-page letter from Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, offers little information about the basis for the investigation.
“Our investigation is based on information that Rhode Island may be engaged in employment practices regarding its affirmative action program governing state government employment under state law that discriminate based on race, national origin, or other protected characteristics in violation of Title VII,” Dhillon wrote.  
“Accordingly, the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division has authorized a full investigation to determine whether Rhode Island is engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination as set forth above.”
Attorney General Peter Neronha also appeared caught off-guard by the notice of the probe.
“The Office is still reviewing, as the subjects and focus of their investigation are unclear,” Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, said in an email Thursday. “We will share more information when we are able.”
Dhillon wrote that the investigation does not mean the DOJ has reached a conclusion or determination of violations of federal anti-discrimination protections.
Gov. Dan McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Thursday.

The Senate on Thursday passed LD 957 with a 19-13 vote, after the House did so one day prior without a roll call. 
The bill would require the Maine Department of Education to convene a volunteer advisory committee to collect information and prepare materials to teach this history. It would also require the department to develop a process to enable schools to conduct internal audits of their curriculum to ensure the history is being adequately and accurately taught. 
Though, with a one-time cost of $15,000 for the department to convene the advisory group and prepare teaching materials, the legislation is expected to be placed on the appropriations table. 
Bills that land on this table, which is managed by the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee that sets the budget, have already passed the full Legislature with initial votes. However, if they don’t have a specific funding source, they have to vie for remaining unappropriated money.
Essentially, that’s everything being voted through with a fiscal note because lawmakers are still drafting what will be in the next two year budget plan. 
This bill is one of several being considered this session to ensure diverse histories are taught in Maine schools, though the other bills seek to make sure already required curricula are actually being taught. 
Lawmakers revisit bills to ensure diverse histories are taught in Maine schools

Maine has required Wabanaki and African American studies to be taught in schools since 2001 and 2021, respectively. 
But, school districts have failed to consistently and appropriately include Wabanaki studies in their curricula, according to a 2022 report, and many caution African American studies could see the same fate without additional resources and accountability measures. 
Last year, two separate bills were combined into one that proposed establishing a commission on Wabanaki and African American studies but that legislation died without final action. This idea is back for consideration this session with distinct bills. 
LD 1474, sponsored by Rep. Laurie Osher (D-Orono), would permanently establish a Wabanaki studies specialist in the Maine Department of Education to ensure the standards are being met.
LD 1202, sponsored by Talbot Ross, would create the African American Studies Advisory Council to serve as a resource for educators, schools and the Department of Education to ensure the implementation of the curricula in accordance with existing state law. 
Neither bills have received floor votes so far. 
Another bill, LD 339, that sought to pilot a Wabanaki-centered curriculum for Wabanaki children attending public schools has been rejected by both chambers and is now effectively dead.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/American-History-2-1024x686.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 15:14:54.150245

(File photo by Getty Images)Continuing to provide grocery assistance to more than half a million South Carolinians could cost the state upwards of $100 million annually under proposed changes to the federal program.
For the last half-century, the federal government has fully funded benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. But Republicans’ massive bill on taxes and spending, as passed by the U.S. House, would require states to pay a portion of those benefits starting in 2028, plus a greater share of what it costs to administer the program.
While the U.S. Senate is likely to make changes to what’s dubbed the “big, beautiful bill,” advocates worry about major cuts to the 61-year program and what that would mean to the families who rely on it.
U.S. House Republican plan would force states to pay for a portion of SNAP benefits

“I can’t imagine the state is even closely prepared for all this,” said Sue Berkowitz, director of the Appleseed Legal Justice Center.
If the House plan holds, the Palmetto State’s total cost could triple, or in the worst-case scenario, increase elevenfold to $370 million.
What changes
That’s because it bases states’ share of the cost on how well they distribute benefits correctly: States with an error rate of 6% or less would be responsible for paying 5%. Those with an error rate higher than 10% would have to pay one-quarter of the cost.
And the latest data puts South Carolina in the latter category. In 2023, the state’s error rate was a whopping 22.6%, the fourth-worst in the nation, overwhelmingly due to overpayments.
State officials say that’s an anomaly.
Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, South Carolina’s error rate was historically in the lowest category. That changed in 2022, when the state’s error rate went to 9% amid changes to the SNAP program during the global pandemic. Then it shot up in 2023.
After a re-training of staff, the state Department of Social Services expects a big drop in the 2024 error rate, which should be released next month.
Can SC afford it?
The chief budget writer of the South Carolina House said the state has the money to continue the program, as long as the error rate returns to pre-pandemic levels. Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister pointed to hefty surpluses in tax collections in recent years as an example of the state’s fiscal health.
SC legislators get extra $1B to spend as budget negotiations begin

The budget that takes effect July 1 includes $1.2 billion placed in reserves. About $500 million more is unspent and available following an update in revenue estimates last month.
The question is whether funding for the food program will stand up against other budget priorities in the years to come, said Bannister, R-Greenville.
Rep. Bill Herbkersman was less certain of South Carolina’s ability to pay.
The Bluffton Republican chaired the subcommittee that oversees the budget for South Carolina’s child welfare and social services agency for many years. He does not think the state can guarantee it will have the funding every year to keep the program going on a recurring basis.
In total, the federal government provides South Carolinians $1.3 billion in annual benefits for groceries, according to the latest figures.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which heads the SNAP program, and the state split the $66 million bill for administrative costs.
What frustrates Herbkersman the most are the overhead costs just to operate the program — three-quarters of which South Carolina will have to pay under the proposed changes.
“As a taxpayer, I’m incensed by that,” he said.
As for payment errors, those can occur from miscalculations in a household’s expenses and families struggling to provide the necessary documents updating their income in the case of a job change or loss, according to the USDA.
According to state officials, the federal government calculates the error rate by checking a small sample of beneficiaries.
DSS also has struggled to process applications for benefits within the 30-day window allowed under federal regulations. The USDA put the state on notice last year, both for timeliness and for not properly informing people of denied benefits.
As millions wait on food stamp approvals, feds tell states to speed it up

To address that, DSS started making much-needed upgrades to its technology. The agency has set aside about half of the $74 million it needs to replace equipment that’s as much as five decades old.
Those upgrades “will significantly improve the state’s ability to process applications in a timely manner,” according to an agency statement.
Rising demand
But the fundamental issue is a rise in the need, according to DSS.
South Carolina, like many other states, has seen the weekly application volume for SNAP benefits rise substantially — 7,000 applications for benefits each week on average, a nearly 50% increase over pre-COVID numbers.
As of last September, one in nine South Carolinians were receiving SNAP benefits. More than half went to families with children, while more than one-third went to families with an elderly or disabled adult, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Lee Patterson has seen that firsthand as Richland County Library’s social work director who helps people fill out applications. She’s not sure why more people are applying for aid, but she suspects it’s closely tied to the rising cost of housing.
“The first bill people usually pay is the rent,” she said. “When the price of housing goes up, then the ability to pay for food goes down.”
Applicants who aren’t elderly or disabled can deduct only $672 from their income when calculating whether they qualify for food benefits. Meanwhile, the median cost of rent and utilities in South Carolina is nearly double that, according to U.S. Census data.
Patterson and her team have the experience to help smooth the way for people seeking aid. But for those applying on their own, especially for the first time, it can be tricky.
For example, when it comes to proving income changes, applicants often have to go back to a former employer and ask for documentation that shows they no longer work for that company. Those employers don’t always respond, and in some cases may have closed entirely, Patterson said.
A second pain point for applicants can be waiting for a phone interview with DSS staff, which the federal government requires for benefits. South Carolina was allowed to waive those interviews during the pandemic, likely contributing to the state’s increased error rate, but they resumed in July 2023.
The call volume for these interviews is often high, and it’s not uncommon for an applicant to wait on hold for an hour. The library has a phone available for applicants to use. If they don’t get through, they may have to return multiple days in a row to complete their interview, Patterson said.
What’s next?
Advocates expect changes to the U.S. House proposal, as several key Republicans in the Senate have publicly opposed shifting food benefit costs to states. Negotiations are expected to continue into next week, Politico reported, with the goal of passing the bill by July 4.
The final plan remains to be seen.
The executive director of Foodshare South Carolina is concerned about what might ultimately happen to other SNAP-related programs.
Omme-Salma Rahemtullah said she relies heavily on the state-funded program known as Healthy Bucks, which provides additional money for SNAP recipients to purchase fruits and vegetables. They can use these benefits at farmers markets. Or they can get a box of produce worth $20 from Foodshare.
Rahemtullah worries that if the state has to spend more on general SNAP benefits, there may be less available to keep Healthy Bucks operating.
Healthy Bucks began as a pilot in six counties in 2014. It’s since expanded to all 46 counties, according to the state Department of Social Services. In 2023, the Legislature provided an additional $5 million to the agency to further expand the program.
Beyond upping the cost to states, the federal proposal also expands requirements for SNAP recipients.
Under existing rules, people under 55 who can work — what the government calls “able-bodied adults” — are limited to three months of food benefits over a three-year period unless they can prove they work, volunteer or attend job training at least 80 hours each month, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The proposal would expand those rules by a decade — to people under 65 and, for parents of school-age children, they would be exempt if their children are younger than 8, rather than 18.
“As less money comes into the state from the federal level, the state will have to find ways to make that up for a lot of things,” said Berkowitz, the Appleseed advocate. “I just hope feeding people will be a priority.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/grocery-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 15:14:54.150245

With regard to their total nursing staff, eight of Iowa’s 410 nursing homes were staffed at least 40% below the level that was expected, based on residents’ acuity levels, during the fourth quarter of 2024. That marks a slight improvement from the 11 homes that fell into that category during the third quarter of the year.
The data also shows that among the 50 states, Iowa continues to rank in the middle of the pack, with staffing levels that average roughly 20% below expectations.

The data is reported by the facilities themselves to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and is then analyzed and published by the nonprofit Long Term Care Community Coalition. The coalition’s analysis shows that in late 2024, just over 90% of all nursing homes across the country were staffed below the level expected based on their residents’ needs.
In Iowa, the homes that provided the lowest number of total nursing staff hours per resident, per day, are scattered among both rural and urban counties. Among the 12 lowest-ranked Iowa homes, six are operated by the same company — Care Initiatives of West Des Moines.
The 12 homes, and their deviation from the expected hours per resident, per day, for all nursing staff were:
Fonda Specialty Care, Pocahontas County: 47.7% below expected levels.
Mount Ayr Health Care Center, Ringgold County: 43.9% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest-ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 44.3% below expected levels.
Accura Healthcare of Marshalltown, Marshall County: 43.5% below expected levels.
Kingsley Specialty Care, Plymouth County, 42.8% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 40% below expected levels.
Bettendorf Health Care Center, Scott County: 42.8% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest-ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 43.8% below expected levels.
Avoca Specialty Care, Pottawattamie County: 42.2% below expected levels.
Lyon Specialty Care, Lyon County: 41.4% below expected levels.
Panora Specialty Care, Guthrie County: 40.5% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest-ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 42.8% below expected levels.
Northgate Care Center, Allamakee County: 39.9% below expected levels.
The Ivy at Davenport, Scott County: 39.1% below expected levels.
Aspire of Perry, Dallas County: 39.1% below expected levels. This facility also was among the lowest-ranked facilities in the third quarter of 2024, when total nurse staffing was 43.1% below expected levels.
Belle Plaine Specialty Care, Benton County: 39.1% below expected levels.
Fewer hours by registered nurses 
The analysis also shows that many nursing homes continue to rely on lesser skilled certified nursing aides, rather than registered nurses, to provide much of the care – with many homes falling far below the recommended level of staffing by registered nurses.
In Iowa, 12 nursing homes provided at least 60% fewer staffing hours by registered nurses than recommended. The Iowa facilities that deviated the most from the expected number of registered-nurse hours per resident, per day, during the fourth quarter of 2024 were:
Nora Springs Care Center, Floyd County: 76.9% below expected levels.
Garden View Care Center, Page County: 75.6% below expected levels.
Crystal Heights Care Center, Mahaska County: 69.7% below expected levels.
Caring Acres Nursing and Rehab Center, Cass County: 69.4% below expected levels.

Silver Oak Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, Linn County: 61.3% below expected levels.
Colonial Manors of Columbus Community, Louisa County: 60.2% below expected levels.
Congress questions staffing mandates
The staffing data shows U.S. nursing homes, on average, delivered 3.75 hours of nursing care per resident, per day – which is significantly below the 4.95 hours that would be expected based on residents’ acuity levels.
The expected staffing levels that are used as a benchmark in the analysis are calculated using an evidence-based, case-mix adjustment methodology that accounts for the specific care needs of residents within each specific care facility, using data provided by the facilities themselves.
“The significant staffing shortfall is more than just a statistic,” said Richard Mollot, LTCCC’s executive director, “it reflects the daily reality of thousands of vulnerable residents enduring avoidable pain and neglect simply because too many nursing homes are not being held accountable for meeting even basic care standards.”
The average U.S. nursing home provided 3.75 total nurse staff hours per resident day in the fourth quarter – almost the same level as the 3.73 hours reported in the third quarter.
In addition to showing that just over 90% of nursing homes are reporting staffing levels below their expected levels, the analysis indicates the median nursing home fell 24.9% short of expected total staffing levels and 42.3% short of expected staffing levels for registered nurses.
The analysis also found that more than a third of all care facilities — 36% of the total – reported no presence of a medical director, despite federal requirements that a medical director oversee the quality of clinical care provided in every facility.
As in the third quarter of 2024, only two states — Alaska and Oregon — met or exceeded their expected staffing levels, while North Dakota (-4.1%) ranked fourth in staffing adequacy, narrowly missing its expected target.
The states with the worst average staffing levels in both the third and fourth quarters of 2024 included Illinois, Texas, Missouri, Georgia, New Mexico and Indiana.
Congress is currently considering proposals that would require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to delay, until January 2035, enforcement of new minimum staffing standards for nursing homes.

The Arkansas Board of Corrections filed a lawsuit in Pulaski County Circuit Court on Dec. 14, 2023 against Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the secretary of state and Arkansas Department of Corrections, challenging the constitutionality of Act 185 and 659 of 2023.
Act 185 requires the secretary of corrections to serve at the pleasure of the governor rather than the board, while Act 659 alters the reporting structure for the directors of the Division of Correction and Division of Community Correction, requiring them to serve at the pleasure of the secretary rather than the board. 
The board argued the laws violate Amendment 33 of the Arkansas Constitution, which protects the power of constitutional boards like the board of corrections from “usurpation by the Governor or the General Assembly, or both,” according to Thursday’s ruling. 
Arkansas judge sides with prison board in dispute with governor, corrections secretary

A circuit court judge granted a preliminary injunction in January 2024, which Attorney General Tim Griffin appealed. 
The Supreme Court’s ruling Thursday dismissed the state’s motion to send the case back to the circuit court, order the preliminary injunction vacated and the case dismissed as moot.
The high court also dismissed a motion to disqualify the corrections board’s attorney from further participation in proceedings before the court. 
In its motion to remand, the state argues the controversy ended when the board fired former Corrections Secretary Joe Profiri. The firing was part of a dispute between the board and the executive branch that started in late 2023 over who controls the state’s prison system.
The board’s refusal in November 2023 to approve a request to increase prison capacity by 500 beds prompted harsh public criticism from Griffin and Sanders. The board responded by hiring an outside attorney the following month to represent it in employment matters. 
Because Profiri was fired prior to the entry of the preliminary injunction, the lower court’s finding of irreparable harm was erroneous, the state argued. The board said it wasn’t seeking court confirmation of its right to fire Profiri, but relief from the legislation regarding the board’s authority under Amendment 33. 
Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Karen Baker said she agreed with the board’s assertion that Profiri’s termination doesn’t resolve the ultimate question of whether the board controls the secretary or division directors, and therefore the dispute is not specific to the individual holding the secretary’s office. 
“The Board’s complaint concerns the Challenged Legislation and the resulting changes to the Board’s supervisory authority. This dispute exists notwithstanding the individual who holds the Secretary position and is not personal to Secretary Profiri,” Baker wrote. “Further, because this case presents an existing legal controversy, it is not moot. Therefore, we deny appellants’ motion to remand.”


Let us know what you think...




The state also filed a motion to disqualify the legal counsel obtained by the corrections board, arguing the firm was obtained illegally. The board didn’t follow state law for securing outside counsel, and the board did not have the “authority to hire special counsel because the Board is not a constitutional officer,” the attorney general’s motion argued.
The circuit court denied this motion, explaining that “the Board is a constitutionally created board, making its members constitutional officers” who therefore had the legal authority to hire special counsel.  
The attorney general typically represents state agencies, but state law gives constitutional officers the ability to hire outside counsel when they disagree with the attorney general over a constitutional provision.
In dismissing this motion, Baker notes the board correctly points out that “an order denying a motion to disqualify adversary’s counsel in a civil proceeding is not an appealable final order.”
“As a general rule, an appeal from an interlocutory decision brings up for review only the decision from which the appeal was taken, here, the granting of an injunction,” Baker wrote. The motion to disqualify the attorney is outside the scope of the Supreme Court’s review of the preliminary injunction, she said.
The high court majority affirmed the lower court’s issuance of an injunction because its “findings that there would be irreparable harm were not clearly erroneous.” 
The crux of the lawsuit, Baker wrote, is whether the board retains ultimate authority over the corrections secretary and directors or whether the challenged legislation constitutionally transfers that power to the governor and corrections secretary. 
“The evidence presented to the circuit court demonstrates that, in the absence of the injunction, the dispute will be ongoing until the constitutionality of the Challenged Legislation is resolved,” Baker said. “This, coupled with appellants’ failure to even argue their likelihood of success on the merits, leaves us with little choice under our deferential standard of review. 
“We hold that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the Board demonstrated that irreparable harm would result in the absence of the requested preliminary injunction, and we affirm,” she added. 
Arkansas Supreme Court sends AG’s FOIA lawsuit against prison board back to circuit court

Special Justices Troy Braswell and Bud Cummins joined in the decision. Associate Justice Barbara Webb concurred in part and dissented in part. Associate Justice Shawn Womack dissented. Associate Justices Cody Hiland and Nicholas Bronni, both of whom were appointed by the governor, did not participate. 
Webb wrote that she agreed with the majority that the matter is not moot because Profiri’s termination doesn’t resolve the question of whether Acts 185 and 659 of 2023 are unconstitutional. She also agreed that it’s not appropriate to disqualify the board’s counsel at this time. 
However, she argues the board “failed to demonstrate irreparable harm” and the circuit court therefore erred in enjoining the challenged acts. 
“The crux of the Board’s claim for irreparable harm was Secretary Profiri’s alleged acts of insubordination, which were directly attributable to Act 185 requiring the Secretary to serve at the pleasure of the Governor rather than the Board,” Webb wrote. “This harm is not irreparable…By definition, if a secretary may be terminated and his actions undone, then it cannot be said that any harm resulting therefrom is ‘irreparable.’”
In his dissenting opinion, Womack argues the court must vacate the preliminary injunction and dismiss the lawsuit because sovereign immunity bars the board’s lawsuit against the governor, corrections secretary and Department of Corrections. 
Sovereign immunity, which Womack cites often in court opinions, is the legal doctrine that the state cannot be sued in its own courts.
“Even if that was not so, the Board would still lose because it failed to show irreparable harm — a necessary element to establish entitlement to a preliminary injunction,” Womack wrote “Therefore, I also join the other dissenting opinion in this case.”
Regarding the issue of the disqualification of the board’s “potentially illegally retained counsel, I again remind citizens of this state of their ability to protect themselves ‘against the enforcement of any illegal exactions whatever,’” he said.

Michael now works in a small-town hospital in Canada. KFF Health News and NPR granted him anonymity because of fears he might face reprisal from the Trump administration if he returns to the U.S. He said he feels some guilt that he did not stay to resist the Trump agenda but is assured in his decision to leave. Too much of America has simply grown too comfortable with violence and cruelty, he said.
“Part of being a physician is being kind to people who are in their weakest place,” Michael said. “And I feel like our country is devolving to really step on people who are weak and vulnerable.”
Michael is among a new wave of doctors who are leaving the United States to escape the Trump administration. In the months since Trump was reelected and returned to the White House, American doctors have shown skyrocketing interest in becoming licensed in Canada, where dozens more than normal have already been cleared to practice, according to Canadian licensing officials and recruiting businesses.
The Medical Council of Canada said in an email statement that the number of American doctors creating accounts on physiciansapply.ca, which is “typically the first step” to being licensed in Canada, has increased more than 750% over the past seven months compared with the same time period last year — from 71 applicants to 615. Separately, medical licensing organizations in Canada’s most populous provinces reported a rise in Americans either applying for or receiving Canadian licenses, with at least some doctors disclosing they were moving specifically because of Trump.
“The doctors that we are talking to are embarrassed to say they’re Americans,” said John Philpott, CEO of CanAm Physician Recruiting, which recruits doctors into Canada. “They state that right out of the gate: ‘I have to leave this country. It is not what it used to be.’”
Canada, which has universal publicly funded health care, has long been an option for U.S.-trained doctors seeking an alternative to the American health care system. While it was once more difficult for American doctors to practice in Canada due to discrepancies in medical education standards, Canadian provinces have relaxed some licensing regulations in recent years, and some are expediting licensing for U.S.-trained physicians.
In mere months, the Trump administration has jeopardized the economy with tariffs, ignored court orders and due process, and threatened the sovereignty of U.S. allies, including Canada. The administration has also taken steps that may unnerve doctors specifically, including appointing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead federal health agencies, shifting money away from pandemic preparedness, discouraging gender-affirming care, demonizing fluoride, and supporting deep cuts to Medicaid.
The Trump administration did not provide any comment for this article. When asked to respond to doctors’ leaving the U.S. for Canada, White House spokesperson Kush Desai asked whether KFF Health News knew the precise number of doctors and their “citizenship status,” then provided no further comment. KFF Health News did not have or provide this information.
Philpott, who founded CanAm Physician Recruiting in the 1990s, said the cross-border movement of American and Canadian doctors has for decades ebbed and flowed in reaction to political and economic fluctuations, but that the pull toward Canada has never been as strong as now.
Philpott said CanAm had seen a 65% increase in American doctors looking for Canadian jobs from January to April, and that the company has been contacted by as many as 15 American doctors a day.
Rohini Patel, a CanAm recruiter and doctor, said some consider pay cuts to move quickly.
“They’re ready to move to Canada tomorrow,” she said. “They are not concerned about what their income is.”
The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which handles licensing in Canada’s most populous province, said in a statement that it registered 116 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of 2025 — an increase of at least 50% over the prior two quarters. Ontario also received license applications from about 260 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of this year, the organization said.
British Columbia, another populous province, saw a surge of licensure applications from U.S.-trained doctors after Election Day, according to an email statement from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia. The statement also said the organization licensed 28 such doctors in the fiscal year that ended in February — triple the total of the prior year.
Quebec’s College of Physicians said applications from U.S.-trained doctors have increased, along with the number of Canadian doctors returning from America to practice within the province, but it did not provide specifics. In a statement, the organization said some applicants were trying to get permitted to practice in Canada “specifically because of the actual presidential administration.”
Michael, the physician who moved to Canada this year, said he had long been wary of what he described as escalating right-ring political rhetoric and unchecked gun violence in the United States, the latter of which he witnessed firsthand during a decade working in American emergency rooms.
Michael said he began considering the move as Trump was running for reelection in 2020. His breaking point came on Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob of Trump supporters besieged the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the election of Joe Biden as president.
“Civil discourse was falling apart,” he said. “I had a conversation with my family about how Biden was going to be a one-term president and we were still headed in a direction of being increasingly radicalized toward the right and an acceptance of vigilantism.”
It then took about a year for Michael to become licensed in Canada, then longer for him to finalize his job and move, he said. While the licensing process was “not difficult,” he said, it did require him to obtain certified documents from his medical school and residency program.
“The process wasn’t any harder than getting your first license in the United States, which is also very bureaucratic,” Michael said. “The difference is, I think most people practicing in the U.S. have got so much administrative fatigue that they don’t want to go through that process again.”
Michael said he now receives near-daily emails or texts from American doctors who are seeking advice about moving to Canada.
This desire to leave has also been striking to Hippocratic Adventures, a small business that helps American doctors practice medicine in other countries.
The company was co-founded by Ashwini Bapat, a Yale-educated doctor who moved to Portugal in 2020 in part because she was “terrified that Trump would win again.” For years, Hippocratic Adventures catered to physicians with wanderlust, guiding them through the bureaucracy of getting licensed in foreign nations or conducting telemedicine from afar, Bapat said.
But after Trump was reelected, customers were no longer seeking grand travels across the globe, Bapat said. Now they were searching for the nearest emergency exit, she said.
“Previously it had been about adventure,” Bapat said. “But the biggest spike that we saw, for sure, hands down, was when Trump won reelection in November. And then Inauguration Day. And basically every single day since then.”
At least one Canadian province is actively marketing itself to American doctors.
Doctors Manitoba, which represents physicians in the rural province that struggles with one of Canada’s worst doctor shortages, launched a recruiting campaign after the election to capitalize on Trump and the rise of far-right politics in the U.S.
The campaign focuses on Florida and North and South Dakota and advertises “zero political interference in physician patient relationship” as a selling point.
Alison Carleton, a family medicine doctor who moved from Iowa to Manitoba in 2017, said she left to escape the daily grind of America’s for-profit health care system and because she was appalled that Trump was elected the first time.
Carleton said she now runs a small-town clinic with low stress, less paperwork, and no fear of burying her patients in medical debt.
She dropped her American citizenship last year.
“People I know have said, ‘You left just in time,’” Carleton said. “I tell people, ‘I know. When are you going to move?’”

(Photo courtesy the Maryland Department of the Environment)A 2,000-gallon diesel spill from tanks on the Johns Hopkins Hospital campus in East Baltimore that contaminated a portion of the Baltimore harbor had been contained as of Thursday morning, officials say.
The fuel traveled about 1.3 miles through the city’s storm drains after Wednesday’s spill and emptied into the Patapsco River near Harbor East, officials said at a Thursday morning news conference.
Officials from city, state and federal agencies responded to the spill Wednesday afternoon and overnight, which caused an odor in the surrounding area, and turned the water red, thanks to a dye in the oil.
With about 600 feet of booms, the spill was contained to a marina area about 150 yards wide and 200 yards long, near the South Central Avenue Bridge, where a number of sailboats and other watercraft are moored.

“This has been a robust and a truly collective effort,” said Gov. Wes Moore (D), who responded to the scene in Baltimore early  Thursday. “We have seen over 100 personnel literally work through the night to make sure that we had this situation under control and contained.”
A third-party vendor was delivering the diesel to the hospital when the spill occurred, read a statement from Liz Vandendriessche, a Hopkins spokesperson. The fuel was being pumped into two tanks, which supply power for backup generators at the hospital, but they were overfilled, leading to the spill.
Hopkins officials reported the leak at about 11 a.m. Wednesday, initially calling it a “contained 200 gallon diesel spill,” according to a news release from Moore’s office.
But by 1 p.m., Baltimore City fire officials were responding to a 911 call reporting a fuel spill at a Harbor East marina. First responders from the city, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the U.S. Coast Guard “very, very rapidly” deployed a boom to contain the contamination, said Baltimore Fire Chief James Wallace.
“Those actions taken by those three agencies have really reduced the footprint of this incident,” Wallace said. “This could have been far, far worse than what it was.”
At 6:48 p.m. Wednesday, Hopkins modified its report, indicating that it was a 2,000-gallon uncontained spill, according to the governor’s office.
“We immediately notified the Maryland Department of Environment of the overflow while continuing to investigate, and we proactively reached out again to MDE as we learned more about the estimated overflow volume,” said Vandendriessche. “We also are actively working with local, state and federal authorities to support the response in the Baltimore Inner Harbor.”
As of Thursday morning, officials were flushing the storm drains to force the rest of the diesel out of the underground pipes and into the containment area in the harbor, Wallace said. From there, the contaminated water could be pumped into a 4,000-gallon pump truck.

“We need to push the product down, push it down to the harbor, where we have skimmers, where we have capability to capture and retain product,” Wallace said. “So, that’s the operation right now. This operation will continue through a majority of the day.”
State officials found about a dozen geese that had been covered in oil, which were captured and taken in by a wildlife rehabilitator, said Geoffrey Donahue, director of Emergency Preparedness and Response at the Maryland Department of the Environment.
Baltimore City Mayor Brandon Scott said that city officials were evaluating the city’s storm drain system to ensure the flushing effort succeeded.
“They have the capability to look at that by GIS mapping, but we also had them physically going and popping manholes, because nothing beats being able to see it — or in this case, see it and smell it — with your own eyes, ears and nose,” Scott said.
Emergency response teams were preparing Thursday for the possibility of rain in the days ahead, particularly Friday afternoon, which could flood the storm drains with runoff and complicate the effort to flush the system in a controlled manner.
“Should this happen, and rain come behind it, we’re going to lose control — in the worst case scenario,” Wallace said. “But right now, as I said, we’re absolutely on schedule.”

More than 300 students and staff prepare for plug to be pulled on Wind River Job Corps, severing path to certifications, high school diplomas and driver’s licenses. 
The post Wyoming students ‘devastated’ after federal decree upends Riverton trade school appeared first on WyoFile .","RIVERTON—What began as a trickle soon turned into a flood of people streaming out of the Wind River Job Corps. More than 100 students and staff walked off the campus Wednesday afternoon to raise awareness of their plight: that Wyoming’s only Job Corps center will soon be shuttered by federal decree. 
The students were predominantly young men, and most had dropped out of high school. Some had made mistakes, finding themselves in trouble with the law. Others had gotten mixed up with drugs, lived on the streets and served prison time. Some, feeling aimless, just wanted to find purpose. 
All had found promise here at Wind River Job Corps, a trade school that offers paths to high school diplomas, driver’s licenses and certifications in fields like welding and truck driving. 
Igor Bool grew up in Ukraine and was adopted by a Gillette family when he was 13. As a teenager, he said, he made bad choices. Bool, now 17, came to Wind River Job Corps “to start a life and start making better choices … and find a career that could potentially lead me to a life of success.”
The center, which employs roughly 150 people and currently serves 178 students, was thrown into chaos when the U.S. Department of Labor announced last week it would pause operations at contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide. The decision aligns with President Donald Trump’s budget proposal and “reflects the Administration’s commitment to ensure federal workforce investments deliver meaningful results for both students and taxpayers,” the announcement read. 
For Wyoming’s only Job Corps center the news has disrupted career tracks and left employees and students reeling. Staff have spent the past week scrambling to prepare for an abrupt closure date of June 23, and fear the loss will leave many students to fend for themselves with zero resources. 
“Our kids are just devastated,” said Wind River Job Corps administrator Jerri Prejean. “It’s so sad.”

Bool just arrived at the center in April. He is nearly finished with the online high school program to earn his diploma but won’t be able to start his training in petroleum. Though disappointed by the news, Bool showed resilience beyond his years. 
“I was kind of disappointed because I have no place to go, so I thought they were just gonna put me back on the streets,” he said. “But it is what it is. I can only control myself and my choices and what I’m gonna do, I cannot control the situation because it’s out of my hands. So I just gotta stay positive.”
Not everyone was as upbeat. 
Jamie Maloid, 25, is one of the lucky ones. Having arrived at Job Corps in 2023, he just graduated after finishing his certifications in the petroleum program. He plans to move to Greeley and start a career. 
“For the other people that aren’t finished, I feel bad,” Maloid said. “I kind of feel like just taking that opportunity away from them that I was able to gain is heartbreaking.”
Incidents, budget
Job Corps is a 61-year-old federal program that offers free career training for low-income young adults. Funded by Congress, the program seeks to teach young people the academic and vocational skills they need to secure meaningful and lasting employment. The program was created in 1964 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty.
Wind River Job Corps is a comparatively new center. The campus opened in 2015, north of Riverton, to much fanfare with dignitaries attending the grand opening and touting the economic boost promised by its first-of-its-kind petroleum technician training program.
It includes classrooms, hands-on training facilities and dorms. Students come from around the country to attend the program, including from Wyoming and the nearby Wind River Indian Reservation. Through the program, they can obtain their driver’s licence, high school diploma and career preparation in one of 10 trades — from carpentry to electrical work and heavy equipment mechanics.

Once they get their certifications, Prejean said, staff ushers them through a transition phase to ensure the student has job placement, an apprenticeship, college, military or advanced training. Wind River Job Corps even pays to fly the students to where their next life stage will take place. 
“I try to do job placement with students around our community,” Prejean said, noting that she works with local companies like Bechtel Construction to funnel skilled workers into Wyoming positions. 
Some 75% of Wind River Job Corps students graduate, she said. “Of those, 85% go to a job trade match. You don’t even have those kinds of numbers from college.”
The success of Riverton’s center does not match a national narrative cited in the closure decree, Prejean said.
In April, the Department of Labor released the Job Corps Transparency Report, which analyzed the financial performance and operational costs of the most recently available metrics from program year 2023. According to that report, the national program’s average graduation rate is less than 40%, and it costs $80,000 per student per year. Job Corps also has faced significant financial challenges under its current operating structure, the DOL release said, including a $140 million deficit in 2024.   
Those findings spurred the DOL to pause the program. It halted contracts to its 99 contract-operated centers, which will impact an estimated 25,000 students. 
“A startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve,” Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a release about the pause.

The narrative painted in that report — which used data from the end of the COVID-19 pandemic — is incongruous with Wind River Job Corps, Prejean said. It has clear benefits to students, local businesses that need skilled workers and the 150 employees who are residents of Fremont County, she said. 
Due to DOL’s mandate, Wind River staff are anticipating a closing day of June 23 unless some overriding action occurs. The outcome of the federal budget bill, officially called the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,” could also impact the program. The bill passed the U.S. House last week and must still clear the Senate. 
“All students will be connected with the resources they need to succeed as this transition takes place,” the DOL said in its release. 
At Wind River, however, staff and students did not see it that way. 
Uncertainty
In the final weeks before the anticipated closing, staff are racing to secure job placements and obtain diplomas for the students. But for students and staff, the future beyond that is a question mark. 
Jaden Flowers, 23, didn’t finish high school in Los Angeles, where he grew up. He had a child at age 15 and his mom was sick, he said, so school wasn’t a priority. He migrated to Colorado after that, and was unhoused and unable to find a job this spring when he discovered Job Corps.

He’s only been in Riverton for two months and said it’s been a great experience. He is trying to get as many petroleum certifications as possible before June 23, he said, so at least he’ll have some leverage for finding a job. In terms of a plan, however, he hasn’t figured that out. 
“I don’t really have nowhere to go, so it’s just back to where I left off,” he said. 
That’s a common story, he added. 
“It’s a mess. It’s crazy how they’re just kicking us out, with nothing, no place to go,” Flowers said. Wind River Job Corps teachers are doing everything they can to help, he added. “They are really trying.” 
Joshuwa Begley, 25, is nearly finished with the program. He arrived two years ago, looking for a change from his life of meaningless jobs and substance abuse, he said. It worked. 
“I changed my life,” he said. “I am a year sober from all the drugs I used to do.”
He earned his high school diploma at Job Corps and just needs to pass a final test to complete his heavy truck driving program.

Begley had intended to stay in the area and had found a job with a local construction business. But because he won’t receive the completion money promised to him in the Job Corps contract and he doesn’t have a place to live, he said, he is instead going back to Georgia where he’ll move in with his grandmother. 
“It just kind of sucks,” Begley said. “All my hard work is going down the drain.”
Junior Chapa, 21, was incarcerated for two years in prison in Texas. When he got out, his probation officer suggested Job Corps. 
“So I came here to better myself, get my high school and my trade and stuff like that,” he said. He intended to obtain heavy truck driving and petroleum-related certifications. “This was like my only option to do better.”
He isn’t sure what he’ll do now, he said. 
Employees are also reeling, said Samantha March, who works in human resources. Many staffers have come to her seeking answers, she said Wednesday, pausing as she choked up. “And we don’t have any to give.” 
Another employee, Kathy, who declined to give her last name, said she worked all weekend trying to help students. 
The closure is profoundly unfortunate, she said. “We may not be 100% successful with every student that comes here, but we have changed enough lives that it is 100% worth it.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Early 2027 could be when Rhode Island’s two casinos finally go smoke free under a compromise brokered by the Senate’s new majority leader.
Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, told Rhode Island Current Thursday that legislation will likely come before the Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming next week. The long-awaited proposal ends a loophole that has allowed Bally’s Lincoln and Tiverton casinos to avoid the state’s indoor smoking ban.
“This took a lot of time meeting with Bally’s and the union representing the people there,” Ciccone said in an interview
But Patti Doyle, a Bally’s spokesperson, said it’s not a done deal.
“Conversations between Bally’s and other stakeholders are ongoing,” Doyle said in an email.
Ciccone has long opposed banning smoking at the two casinos, saying he believes it would cost visitors, and revenue. He initially sought to negotiate an agreement between the Providence-based casino giant and its union workers to expand existing non-smoking areas at the Lincoln facility. But union officials opposed any deals that kept smoke inside, Ciccone said.
Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley said in an interview Thursday that workers were willing to find common ground, but their goal was always to get smoking out of the state’s two casinos.
“It’s not good for them, it’s not good for the customers, it’s not good for the state,” Crowley said.
So Ciccone instead focused on what Bally’s could stomach in the effort to end smoking. That led to his last-minute filing of a bill, submitted on May 23, to raise the cap on marketing reimbursements the company receives from the Rhode Island Lottery — a measure the Senate approved 32-4 on Tuesday despite objections from state regulators.
While seemingly unrelated to the smoking debate, the marketing measure intends to help Bally’s offset any revenue losses from a smoking ban. The company has projected an annual loss of $20 million, Doyle previously said.
Should the revised legislation be approved by the General Assembly, Ciccone said the ban would take effect January 2027. The original companion bills introduced by Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski and Rep. Teresa Tanzi, both South Kingstown Democrats, called for smoking inside the state’s casinos to cease immediately upon the governor’s signature.
Sosnowski did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Tanzi questioned why the Senate would consider allowing employees to work within the smoke for an additional 18 months.
“These workers deserve to have a smoke-free environment now,” she said in an interview. “I look forward to understanding the justification of the 18-month delay.”
But Crowley called Ciccone’s proposed date “a big win” for Bally’s workers, who have spent years urging lawmakers to end smoking at casinos. The proposal was among the top legislative priorities this year for the AFL-CIO, which commissioned a poll in February suggesting nearly 7 in 10 survey respondents “strongly” or “somewhat” supported a smoking ban.
Legislative leaders also appear on board. Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi is one of 10 co-sponsors listed on the latest edition of Tanzi’s bill, which has the backing of 55 of the chamber’s 75 members. Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, has stated she personally supports a smoking ban.

Senate rolls the dice on more online betting vendors 
New compromise struck on the smoking ban comes a day after the Senate voted 30-3 in support of Ciccone’s bill to open Rhode Island’s online sports betting industry to new vendors, ending International Game Technology (IGT) PLC’s five-year monopoly over the state’s digital sportsbook.
Democratic Sens. Dawn Euer of Newport, Tiara Mack of Providence, and Linda Ujifusa of Portsmouth voted against the legislation.
The bill as approved in a revised form bars the Rhode Island Lottery from extending IGT’s contract beyond Jan. 31, 2026, even though the company’s deal to operate the Sportsbook RI app runs through November of that year. Ciccone said Thursday that the change was made to align with the Lottery’s plans to issue a request for information on expansion in the first quarter of 2026.
A Lottery-commissioned report by Spectrum Gaming Group recommended adding four to six new online sports betting vendors, but only if the state makes itself more attractive to popular companies like DraftKings and FanDuel.
Spectrum found that companies may not be interested in expanding to Rhode Island due to its 51% tax on operators’ revenues — tied with New York and New Hampshire for the steepest in the country.
Lottery Director Mark Furcolo wrote to the Senate Committee on Gaming and Labor on April 30 that the legislation could violate regulators’ constitutional authority to renew gaming contracts. Furcolo also had concerns with the economic feasibility of expanding to five vendors.
“The bill now addresses our primary concerns but does not eliminate the constitutional issue raised in the letter,” Paul Grimaldi, a spokesperson for the Lottery, said in an email Thursday.
Ciccone’s bill now heads to the House for consideration. Companion legislation sponsored by Rep. Matthew Dawson, an East Providence Democrat, remains held for further study following its initial May 1 hearing before the House Committee on Finance.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is term-limited and announced he will run for Colorado governor in 2026. The Democrat has joined a growing number of legal challenges to Trump administration policies. 
Other Democrats running for attorney general include Secretary of State Jena Griswold, Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty, former speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Crisanta Duran and worker and consumer rights attorney David Seligman. Conner Pennington is the only Republican candidate to file paperwork in the race so far.
Doshi’s campaign website says she will focus on defending Colorado from actions from the Trump administration, fighting for a fair economy and protecting Colorado’s rights, values and public safety. 
“Right now, the rule of law is under attack by those who have abandoned patriotism for power. Colorado’s next Attorney General must have a proven record of taking on the toughest fights — and winning,” Doshi said. “I’ve taken on powerful executives in boardrooms and corrupt officials in government, and I’m ready to defend the rights and freedoms of every Coloradan.”
The attorney general heads the Colorado Department of Law and oversees enforcement of consumer protection and antitrust laws, defends state laws in legal challenges, and advocates for law enforcement and community safety.  
Primary elections to decide party nominees for state offices will be held in June 2026.

“The President’s budget will greatly endanger wild horses and burros,” Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat from Nevada, said in a statement to the Current. “I am deeply concerned by how these cuts will impact the care of these beloved creatures. Even more worrying is the omission of the long-standing provision against horse slaughter.”
The proposal, horse and burro advocates note, mirrors Trump’s 2017 budget, which initially called for a 30% cut to the program’s funding and the elimination of protections against slaughter. Congress restored the protections against killing the animals and augmented funding.
“Typically, the president’s appropriations bill contains a provision prohibiting horse slaughter. The Trump budget bill does not have this provision, opening the door to animals being sold off for slaughter,” said Dick Cooper, a spokesman for Titus.

The budget proposal is straight from the pages of Project 2025, the ultra-conservative manifesto of which Trump once claimed ignorance, but has since adopted de facto as a blueprint for his policies.
“What is happening to these once-proud beasts of burden is neither compassionate nor humane, and what these animals are doing to federal lands and fragile ecosystems is unacceptable,” says Project 2025, which asserted “the uncontrolled growth of wild horses and burros poses an existential threat to public lands.”
More than half of the nation’s wild horses, estimated between 70,000 and 95,000, are in Nevada, notes Project 2025. “Congress must enact laws permitting the BLM to dispose humanely of these animals.”
The policy is an “attack on animal welfare and America’s public lands,” according to American Wild Horse Conservation (AWHC), a wild horse advocacy organization.
“This budget would be a bullet to the head of America’s wild horses if passed by Congress,” said Suzanne Roy, executive director of AWHC. “Slaughter is a barbaric solution to a fundamentally broken federal program.”
The current program is focused on what critics contend are inhumane roundups that end in the warehousing of the creatures in government holding facilities.
A better solution, say horse advocates, is increasing fertility control efforts and restoring habitat.
Last month, Titus announced the formation of the Wild Horse Congressional Caucus, “to encourage federal policies for more humane treatment of wild horses and burros,” according to a news release.
Days later, Titus and 82 members of Congress urged a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee to craft legislation requiring the BLM to spend at least 10% of the Wild Horse and Burro program’s $140 million budget on fertility control in additional herd management areas.
Utah horseman concludes 6,000-mile ride through 25 states to spotlight the wild horse crisis

“The letter included several requests but notably included language maintaining the prohibition on the sale or adoption of healthy wild horses and burros that results in their destruction,” Titus said in a news release.
Titus has opposed the BLM’s use of aircraft in roundups. The U.S. has paid helicopter companies $57.4 million for roundups since 2006, according to Titus, a process she has attempted to ban.
“Scientific research has shown that more humane and cost-effective alternatives, like fertility control, are equally effective in controlling equine populations,” according to the May statement from Titus announcing the Wild Horse caucus. “The BLM’s Wild Horse and Burro Program, however, currently spends less than four percent of its budget on these methods.”
Diverse interests, ranging from cattle ranchers to animal activists, have called for vast reductions to wild horse populations, which they contend are three times the number public lands can accommodate.
“The greatest threat to our wild horses and burros and our public lands right now isn’t the BLM, it’s not cattle, ranching or mining interests. It’s not animal advocates. It’s climate change and the new reality is fast settling in,” Stephanie Boyles Griffin, the chief scientist of the Humane Society of the United States’ (now Humane World for Animals’) wildlife protection department,  told Reuters in 2021.
Americans, deeply divided on a plethora of topics, are on common ground when it comes to wild horses, says AWHC, which commissioned a 2017 poll that revealed 83% of Trump voters supported protecting wild horses and burros from slaughter, compared with 77% of Hillary Clinton’s supporters.
“After decades of costly and ineffective roundups, the BLM now stockpiles more wild horses in government pens than remain free on the range,” said Roy in a news release. “Americans deserve a better federal plan that  genuinely tackles off-range holding issues without resorting to slaughter.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-05 18:10:12+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT municipal camp bills, proposed after Bethany scandal, expire",Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/05/bethany-ct-scandal-camp-licensure-bill/,Proposed regulations spurred by a child sex abuse scandal at a Bethany camp will not come to pass after session ended without a vote on them.,"Some lawmakers’ attempts to pass two bills spurred by a child sex abuse scandal at a town-run camp in Bethany came to an end at midnight on Wednesday when the legislative session came to a close. 
Senate Bill 6, which would have required camps operated by towns and cities across Connecticut to be regulated by the state, had received support in the Senate, but efforts to move that forward came to an unceremonious end when the House failed to take it up on the last day of the session. House Bill 6952, which would have required a more limited set of safety measures for those camps, was never voted on by either chamber.
“It’s very unfortunate, disappointing,” Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Bethany, told The Connecticut Mirror on the Senate floor Wednesday night. “I hope that we’ll get the chance to try again next year.”
Cabrera said he thinks that confusion over S.B. 6 and its impact stood in its way. In addition to other unrelated provisions on food assistance, disconnected youth and the Early Start program, that bill would have required municipal camps to be licensed by the Office of Early Childhood in the same way that private camps are. 
Municipalities overwhelmingly voiced opposition to the legislation, citing concerns about the financial impact of complying with regulations like ratios of bathrooms to the number of campers. They said that such changes could close camps and shut low-income families out of an inexpensive child care option in the summer months. Advocates argued that these concerns were overblown and that it was possible to get to a middle ground that would have assured the safety of campers with only modest increases in cost.
The bill gained traction after a scathing report was released on May 15 that detailed the findings of an internal investigation into how the town of Bethany and its first selectwoman, Paula Cofrancesco, handled allegations of sexual abuse by an employee who worked with children at the local school and in the town-run summer camp. 
After Cofrancesco learned of those allegations, the report found that she deceived Bethany residents and failed to protect local children from an alleged abuser — then resisted efforts to make those programs safer. More than a year later, no arrest had been made despite findings by experts at the Yale Child Advocacy Center and the state Department of Children and Families that the allegations were credible, and in that time an additional victim alleges she was abused.
The report also found that Bethany’s Parks and Recreation Department was poorly run. According to the report, the department “had no filing or record-keeping system, written safety policies, or documented training protocols for its staff.” 
According to an interview in the report with Cofrancesco’s assistant, no background checks were conducted until 2024. 
Cofrancesco was among the voices of opposition back in 2023 when the legislature took up a similar bill that attempted to create oversight for town camps. At the time, she argued that municipal camps already received enough oversight, including from elected leaders like herself.
Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, who is co-chair of the Committee on Children, had championed the bill’s passage on the Senate floor. She said that licensing municipal camps is an equity issue, because many low-income families rely on town camps and should be able to count on them to be checked for safety, on par with the way the state regulates private camps.
Maher said she believes there is a pathway forward to come to an agreement in the future and had hoped to carve out a middle ground that would have satisfied the concerns of municipalities. She had hoped to develop a task force to bring stakeholders to the table to discuss the best path forward.
“The most important thing to me is that municipal camps are taking care of our children, that our children are safe, that parents know that their child is safe in the summer,” she said. “Most parents drop their kids off and have no idea that they are not licensed and there’s no oversight except through the municipality. So, we want to make sure that there’s first aid training, that there’s mandated reporter training, that they have staffing ratios that make sense that keep kids safe.”
H.B. 6952 was an attempt to carve out a more modest set of regulations based on safety concerns. That bill would have required prospective employees age 18 and older to submit to comprehensive background checks, which many municipal camps say that they already do but which is not required by the state. It would also have required at least one staff member over the age of 18 for every 12 children, mandatory reporter training for leadership, and that such programs, because they are exempt from camp licensing, would not be allowed to call themselves “camps.” 
Many municipal Parks and Recreation departments took issue with the bills. In written testimony, Stephanie Crane, the recreation director for Bolton, said the S.B. 6 “could result in reduced program registrations, the loss of high school employees, and potentially force the closure of many recreational programs due to staffing shortages.”
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, also spoke out in opposition to the bill on the Senate floor. 
“I think it’s a great thing that you want to feel better, but I can tell you that you are not going to protect children with a piece of legislation that will not stop someone from putting hands on children,” Osten said on the Senate floor. “The only thing that stops people from putting hands on children is to put them in jail, to incarcerate those people, to make sure they stay there a really long time. And when they get out to follow them and make sure they get the treatment they can. And our bills today don’t address that issue.” 
Rep. Mary Welander, D-Orange, said she hoped to come to the table next year, and was encouraged by testimony submitted by municipal camps.
“The good news is that through the public hearing we did learn that the overwhelming majority, if not the entirety of municipal camps are already doing the vast majority of what was being asked for,” she said.
Welander said that while background checks would not have prevented the Bethany case, since that counselor did not yet have a record at the time of the alleged abuse, the internal investigation did raise concerns and questions about what else could be done to prevent a similar case in the future. 
“It’s not just about background checks, it’s also about best practices,” she said, emphasizing that there should be measures in place to ensure that concerning behavior is addressed, “and that the people that work with the children are taught to recognize the signs that something might be going on that is unacceptable.”
But for Acting Child Advocate Christina Ghio, background checks are still the major focus. 
“From our perspective the core of the issue is that background checking, so I hope there is a way to make sure that, at a minimum, we can get background checks for all of those settings even if we can’t get full licensure.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_1001_SR_Bethany_015-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

As part of police accountability measures passed in 2021, the Legislature required law enforcement agencies to report to the state Criminal Justice Training Commission when officers leave the department for any reason, use force that results in death or serious injury, are charged with a crime or are found to commit certain misconduct.
The law also required departments to continue investigations even if an officer resigns before the probe is finished.
This is meant to ensure “bad-apple” officers who should lose their state certification don’t slip through the cracks. Losing those credentials blocks officers from working as police in the state, even if they quit their job to evade formal discipline.
The Criminal Justice Training Commission suspected agencies weren’t reporting misconduct as they should have. So it requested the state auditor’s office look into compliance.
Officials see the resulting audits as a teaching moment on the new reporting requirements. The objective is to increase public trust and improve transparency.
“This isn’t like a gotcha, it’s not a punishment,” said Kimberly Bliss, the commission’s assistant director focused on certification. “This is an educational piece for us to make sure that agencies across the board learn what they’re supposed to be doing.”
Last month, Bliss and Michael Huynh, from the state auditor’s office, led a presentation on the audits at the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs conference in Spokane. Afterward, police officials told Bliss they realized they hadn’t reported correctly.
The first two new audits, of the Renton and Des Moines police departments, both showed missteps.
After reviewing department records, auditors found Des Moines didn’t report three of four sustained misconduct allegations. That conduct included violations of the state’s controversial pursuit law that lawmakers later rolled back, wrongful use of a Taser and improper handling of drug evidence.
Des Moines Police Chief Ted Boe blamed the lack of reporting on the law being unclear. For example, while some parts of the statute are more specific, one provision says officers can be decertified for failing “to meet the ethical and professional standards required of a peace officer or corrections officer.”
In response, the Criminal Justice Training Commission agreed to develop guidance on what conduct falls under that umbrella.
Des Moines also notified the state training commission of all officers who had left, but four of those notices came well after the 15-day window in the law.
Meanwhile, in Renton, auditors found the department didn’t report that two officers were involved in a use of force incident in 2022 until learning of the audit. The chief said this was an oversight.
Renton also was a little late on reporting two officer separations.
For both departments, the auditor’s office recommended outlining the reporting process in agency policy.
“One thing we found was that one person would be responsible for notifications, and if they didn’t do it, no one knew,” said Huynh, a program manager with the auditor’s office.
Police accountability advocates see failing to comply with the law as a symptom of a systemic problem.
“This is not an oversight. It’s a pattern. A culture. One where data is withheld, timelines are ignored, and truth is treated like a suggestion,” Nickeia Hunter, whose brother was killed by police, said in an email. “Until truth is demanded and enforced, we will remain stuck in a cycle where transparency is performative and justice is optional.”
Next up for these new state audits are the Kitsap County Sheriff’s Office and the police wing of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. Auditors will continue looking into a pair of agencies at a time indefinitely.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/police-cars-night-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

Renee Erickson, second from left, a Wichita Republican who leads the Kansas Legislature's school finance task force, said Kansas should retain use of high school graduation statistics to measure student achievement despite criticism it was unclear earning the diploma meant students were prepared for college or the workforce. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Legislature's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — Disagreement exists on the Kansas Legislature’s task force reworking the state’s public school finance formula about the importance of high school graduation rate as a measure of student success.
A member of the task force pointed to alleged manipulation of student records at Wichita Southeast High School as evidence of why a district’s annual graduation rate shouldn’t be viewed as a significant metric, while others defended graduation rates as an evaluation tool when determining whether districts prepared students for the workplace or college.
Rep. Kristey Williams, an Augusta Republican, said the Wichita school district had touted a 5.1 percentage point surge in its graduation rate in 2024 to 84.3%. Wichita Southeast’s graduation rate climbed 12.5 percentage points in 2024 to a record-high 86.3%.
Southeast’s principal was replaced last week amid reports of suspected grade fixing that may have been associated with helping students meet graduation requirements.
“I wouldn’t use graduation rates,” said Williams, who didn’t see a meaningful correlation between graduation rate and student success. “If we want to baby sit, that’s one thing. If we want to have a safe place for them, that’s one thing. But that doesn’t mean you’re learning anything.”
Frank Harwood, a deputy commissioner of the Kansas State Department of Education, said one potential incident of administrative misconduct shouldn’t justify dismissal of graduation rates as a means of measuring school districts.
“When you look at any industry, including the Legislature, there are bad actors,” he said. “It doesn’t mean you should throw out that metric all together. I’m not saying graduation rate is the best indicator, but I think it is an indicator that we can’t just ignore.”
The Kansas State Board of Education made elevating the state’s high school graduation rate a feature in its “Kansans Can” agenda and in terms of school district accreditation. The state board’s graduation-rate goal was set at 95%.
Kansas’ adjusted cohort graduation rate, which tracked student graduation within four years and took into account transfers, has ranged from 86% to 89% during the past decade.
In 2022-2023, more than 90 of the state’s 287 school districts graduated 100% of students. Twenty school districts had graduation rates below 80% during that academic year. The Wichita district’s graduation rate was at 79.2% during that period, while the Kansas City, Kansas, district came in at 73.4%.
Sen. Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican serving as chairwoman of the Legislature’s school-finance task force, said Kansas should continue to include graduation rate in a set of evaluation metrics. She said the state needed to develop a definition of what a high school diploma revealed about students.
Erickson said employers had reported a high school diploma didn’t guarantee a quality worker. University or college officials indicated high school graduates didn’t necessarily have skills to succeed in higher education, she said.
“I have post-secondary folks in my office frequently and they’re saying, ‘They’re not prepared for our level of work,'” the senator said. “I’m not blaming. I’m just telling you, if you can’t acknowledge that, we’ve got a problem.”
Task force member Pat Pettey, a Democratic senator from Kansas City, Kansas, said it would be folly to drop the graduation rate as an indicator of a school district’s ability to prepare students for the future.
“I still am a strong supporter of graduation rates because having a high school diploma is a key to opening the first door to get a job. I don’t believe it is the key, but if they don’t have that they’re not on a trajectory to be economically successful,” Pettey said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Renee-Erickson-education-task-force.png,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.

When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.










These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.


– Celina Damian, California student loan servicing ombudsperson


Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
‘Can’t wait for Washington’
Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.

Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
Repayment
Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.

“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
‘Incentive to hike prices’
Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

Potholes deepen in Fairbanks, washed-out culverts block salmon in the Mat-Su, and rural communities from Ketchikan to Kotzebue are left waiting on repairs that may never come. A trip on the Kenai Peninsula leaves your teeth rattling and your fishing poles clanking in the back of your rig. Our state’s transportation system is in a state of disrepair.  
And yet the state is poised to spend at least half a billion dollars building a second bridge across one of Alaska’s most ecologically significant and beloved wetlands: the Mendenhall Wetlands in Juneau. 
The proposed Juneau-Douglas Second Crossing – termed the Juneau Douglas North Crossing by DOWL, the engineering firm contracted to assess and build this structure – is being marketed as a strategy to reduce commute times, link the Douglas Island communities to emergency services, and promote development. But even if these reasons are held up under scrutiny – and none of them are as simple as they sound – the second bridge comes at a staggering cost estimated between $290-450 million. In a time when Alaska faces over $2 billion in deferred maintenance on existing roads and bridges, we must ask: Is this the best use of public funds? 
Juneau has already developed more than 40% of its wetlands. In a state where habitat loss is often distant and gradual, the proposed Second Crossing represents an immediate and irreversible threat to an intact, high-value ecosystem. Once roads and bridges fragment this landscape, the consequences – disrupted migration, habitat degradation, declining fish and bird populations— are permanent.  
A Highway to Nowhere?
The Juneau Douglas Second Crossing’s installation bill could exceed half a billion dollars, which doesn’t include annual maintenance costs. That’s money that could fix existing infrastructure all over the state, such as roads that rural Alaskans use to access schools, groceries, medical care, and subsistence hunting and fishing grounds. Project funds could also easily maintain the bridge that currently exists between Douglas Island and the Juneau mainland.  
Unlike these lifeline routes, the Second Crossing is a convenience project, not a necessity. Juneau’s population is gradually shrinking. The most cost-efficient second bridges would shave only a few miles off driving time from the existing bridge. The roads and bridges in place today are not failing. This is a solution in search of a problem, and it comes at a cost that all Alaskans would bear. 
 A Wetland of Global Significance

This project just doesn’t pencil out and is not fiscally responsible. The Mendenhall Wetlands are one of the most ecologically important habitats in Alaska, recognized globally as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by the National Audubon Society. A 5,000-acre ecosystem provides essential habitat for millions of migratory birds traveling the Pacific Flyway each year—including sandpipers, dowitchers, plovers, and waterfowl. These wetlands are also a critical nursery for salmon and trout, with rich tidal channels that shelter juvenile fish before they head to sea. The Mendenhall Wetlands have been called the Heart of Juneau. 
It’s not just birdwatchers and fishers who value the space. The Mendenhall State Game Refuge was designated in 1976 by the Alaska State Legislature. It was in part designated so hunters could pursue waterfowl and have an accessible place to hunt. In 2023, the Alaska Department of Fish & Game added over a dozen anadromous fish to the Anadromous Waters Catalog (AWC) fish streams after surveying the wetlands. A total of 230 species of birds have been documented within the wetlands – that’s 69% of the 335 bird species for all of Southeast Alaska – including 36 different waterfowl species, according to Audubon Alaska. The Mendenhall Wetlands support one of Southeast Alaska’s most popular and accessible waterfowl hunting areas, drawing hunters from across the region each fall and over 1800 annual local resident hunters (ADF&G). 
For many, it’s a tradition passed down through generations, a place where families hunt ducks and geese on public lands, some just minutes from their homes.  
 The Opportunity Cost

Building this road means more than just the loss of habitat. It means lost opportunities elsewhere. Alaska’s existing road system is aging and underfunded. Major corridors in the Interior and Southcentral suffer from poor drainage and frost damage. Coastal communities face landslide risks and storm-damaged causeways. Ferry service remains unreliable for many Southeast residents. Every dollar spent on a vanity project like the Second Crossing is a dollar not spent on infrastructure Alaskans actually rely on. 
Let’s be clear: this is not a NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) issue. It’s a matter of statewide priorities. From Cold Bay to Prudhoe, we all have a stake in how limited public funds are used. Do we choose to invest in maintenance, safety, and real community needs, or spend lavishly on speculative development that benefits a few, while costing us all? 
 A Smarter Path Forward

Alaska doesn’t need another expensive, new road project. What we need is leadership that respects our budget, our wildlife, and our way of life. Preserving the Mendenhall Wetlands as a globally important ecosystem, a rich fish and wildlife habitat, and a cornerstone of Southeast Alaska’s outdoor traditions is not just the right thing to do—it’s the smart thing. 
Let’s repair what is broken. Let’s protect what is working. And let’s leave the Mendenhall Wetlands wild for the generations of Alaskans yet to come, like nature, and the state legislature intended.

DemasElectronic theft of benefits and unauthorized use of food assistance cards is costing Michiganders millions if not billions of dollars in fraud, supporters of legislation to require a photo and a signature on Michigan Bridge cards said during a Thursday meeting of the state House Government Operations Committee.
Rep. Jason Woolford (R-Howell), sponsor of House Bill 4515, told lawmakers Thursday that Michigan has seen instances of organized crime stealing people’s Electronic Benefits Transfer, or EBT, data to drain people’s SNAP, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, benefits which are informally known as food stamps. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXA May statement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture said SNAP benefit fraud efforts have  “dramatically” increased in recent years through card skimming and cloning efforts. And as President Donald Trump’s administration has zeroed in on cracking down on bad actors stealing food assistance dollars from those who need them, Judicial Officer of the United States Department of Agriculture John Walk said these crimes hurt Americans on multiple levels.
“These are truly sick and depraved individuals who are stealing food from low-income Americans for their own profit,” Walk said in May. “It is especially disturbing when international criminal organizations siphon tax dollars away from SNAP beneficiaries to fund their own illicit activities.”
Woolford’s bill would require those using Michigan’s food assistance card, known as the Bridge Card, to have their photograph and signature appear on the card.
The bill isn’t meant to inconvenience anyone in need of food assistance in Michigan more than the inconvenience many Michiganders face when getting a photo for a driver’s license, passport, or a Costco membership card, Woolford said. And although the nonpartisan House Fiscal Agency places estimates of implementing photo and signature requirements at between $1.5 million to $4.5 million annually, based on other states that have done so, Woolford said the change could save taxpayers billions in fraud.
“That’s my concern, that the amount of money we’re losing here, money that quite honestly could go to other people that are being denied benefits or that we don’t have the money to take care of because of the waste, fraud and abuse,” Woolford said.
In the House Fiscal Agency’s analysis of the bill, savings to Michigan as a result of reduced fraud are indeterminate and likely negligible. Regardless of whose image would appear on a card, in order for whole families to benefit from food assistance, federal rules mandate that states can’t hinder members of a household from permitted purchases, so anyone with the pin number can make a purchase regardless of the image on the card, the analysis said.
On Thursday, Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford Township) said during his law enforcement career prior to joining the Legislature, he saw frequent fraudulent use of food assistance cards. At the same time, when considering concerns that having to get a photo taken would place an undue burden on recipients, Harris said he’d be interested in seeing if the bill could be further fleshed out to allow images already in the Michigan Department of State’s database for state IDs to be used for Bridge Cards.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_1257-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

(Screenshot from National Archives film)Shaun Nadolny is finally making the trip from Wisconsin to visit his great-uncle’s grave in the Brittany American Cemetery in France.  
Last in a two-part series on Pennsylvania’s 28th Division and a new memorial to soldiers who were killed in the fight to liberate Gathemo, France. Read the first part here.

Tradition holds that for visiting family members, staff will place moistened sand on the engraving on the marker for Jerome Nadolny, who was killed in the fierce fighting around Gathemo, a small village in Normandy, using a wet sponge. The process brings the name out on the marble Latin cross, so it can easily be seen from 15 to 20 feet away.

An American and French flag – standing about knee high – will be placed in front of the grave. Traditionally, the U.S. marker is symbolically on the right side – as if it were in the soldier’s right hand and facing home. The French will be on the left – always toward inland territory.
Then, he and his cousin, Kurt, will travel to Gathemo, where nine soldiers of the 28th Division, including three from Pennsylvania, lost their lives as the Allies pushed inland from the beaches of Normany to liberate Europe. 
They’ll be the sole American relatives of the fallen soldiers who will be on hand for a ceremony Saturday honoring their sacrifice during the fight for the town 81 summers ago. The gathering will include the dedication of a plaque and memorial and a renaming of a street in honor of the 28th Division, a Pennsylvania National Guard unit before the war. The trip is the culmination of an improbable sequence of events that began when Nadolny went in search of the war history of a long-lost great-uncle. Nadolny admits to feeling a little pressure, because he doesn’t want to let his family down or any of the other families. 
“I know it’s going to be a heavy experience for me personally. I wish I could share this with my dad,” he said. “It was on my bucket list to just go to that cemetery, but now to actually go to the cemetery? It’s obviously a trip of a lifetime, right?“
Gathemo today
Visitors to Normandy will notice Allied flags – American, British, and Canadian – hanging not just on poles, but in windows and on doors in village after village. This isn’t just a phenomenon that happens in the typical tourist areas around the landing beaches or landmarks made famous in the 1962 movie, The Longest Day, or the HBO miniseries, Band of Brothers.
The Battle of Normandy stretched beyond what happened on June 6, 1944. Allied troops applied relentless pressure in an effort to push the German occupiers back.
The clash lasted for more than two months, as it became a war of attrition. Allied troops had to constantly resupply the front lines, while the enemy dealt with losses – in terms of men and machines – it simply couldn’t replace
In the end, the Allies suffered 210,000 casualties,while the Germans dealt with losses of 400,000 men. 
Town and after town touched by the Battle of Normandy has its own monuments or historical markers to pilots whose downed aircraft crashed nearby, soldiers who died in their streets or units that helped liberate them.
In Periers for example, The Four Braves memorial honors the 90th Infantry Division — which liberated the town as part of Operation Cobra. This was a piece of the successful U.S. breakout — which played a big role in the rapid collapse of the Germans’ defense in Normandy.
Two Pennsylvanians who lost  their lives — Private 2nd Class Andrew J. Speese III of Philadelphia and Sgt. Tullio Micaloni of Oneida — are immortalized as part of the memorial.

One tour group recounted how in the town of La Haye du Puits, a man noticed they were Americans. He hurried home and later found the group at a restaurant eating lunch. He excitedly, in French, described what it was like as a boy in the summer of 1944 to see his home liberated.  
As his story was translated, he pulled a piece of silk parachute from his jacket — given to him by a U.S. soldier. He simply wanted to share his gratitude for the sacrifice made by the Allies.
Even in 2025, people in Normandy’s villages and towns still think there is history to be acknowledged and a debt owed.
Gathemo, with a population of 267, will join the others Saturday, with a permanent “thank you.” 
Over several days in early August, 1944, the 28th attacked German troops occupying the town.
Progress was slow, measured in a few hundred yards at times, but by the afternoon Aug. 10, the 28th had liberated Gathemo. The division’s losses were nine men killed, including three from Pennsylvania, and an estimated 235 wounded.

– – From The Bloody Patch: A True Story of the Daring 28th Infantry Division 



The 77-day Battle of Normandy came to an end on Aug. 19, after tens of thousands of German troopers were captured when the Falaise pocket was closed by Allied troops.
A mere 10 days after that, the men of the 28th Division were in Paris, taking part in the liberation day parade through the city. 
Located nearly 90 minutes from the English Channel and Omaha Beach, Mayor Christelle Errard describes Gathemo as having all the hallmarks of a quaint Norman community – a bakery, a bar, gift shops and five farms. 
The church, destroyed in the fight, was rebuilt after the war and features a pointed bell tower. According to the mayor, the granite used for the altar and the cross came from Gathemo’s quarries.

‘There are no words strong enough’ 
The town’s role in the Allied push to encircle and destroy part of the German Army in the final weeks and days of the clash has largely been forgotten – overshadowed by the fight in Mortain and Saint-Lambert-sur-Dives, among others. Errard became mayor of Gathemo in July of 2020 and has lived in the community for a decade. She was born in another historically significant part of France – Verdun. It’s the site of one the longest and most ferocious battles of the First World War.  
“We have a mission in our world: to listen to our history, to transcribe it, so as not to forget Our duty to remember is here. And the witnesses of this period will soon all be gone. I also understood that many don’t want to share what they experienced,” she wrote in an email exchange using Google Translate to go from French to English. “My father never spoke about this period when he was 6-years-old, yet four years ago, on his deathbed, he relived the scenes he had witnessed.”

Now, she said, it’s Gathemo’s turn to pay tribute to the young Americans who fought to liberate Europe. 
“Many returned home with physical and mental injuries, but many, like Pvt. Nadolny, did not return to their families,” Errard wrote. “My son will be 23 in June, the same age Pvt. Nadolny was when he lost his life in Gathemo, for Gathemo. I cannot remain indifferent. The tribute is small, but I hope it is the beginning of another story for Gathemo and all the people who will stop and pay their respects at this memorial.”
The monument with the names of the nine men killed will be located close to the back of the church in Gathemo. It will be on a granite stone with an M1 helmet featuring the division logo placed on top. A plaque honoring the entire division will be dedicated, and a street will be renamed in honor of the 28th Division, which, according to unit lore was nicknamed the “Bloody Bucket” by the Germans because of the red keystone patches worn on their uniforms. 
The Mike Pride Museum in Normandy covered the 1,800 Euro price tag.
“Dear American friends, there are no words strong enough to express our gratitude and respect,” Errard said. “I would like to say BRAVO and THANK YOU.”
Two men who were just children at the time of the battle will be on hand for the ceremony – 87-year-old Guy Lelandais and 80-year-old Michele Golonde. 
Errard says for Lelandais, whose cousin was killed by an exploding shell in front of his eyes, preserving the history of the liberation of his hometown has been a lifelong passion. He has – collecteding testimonies from around the region.

Galonde was just six months old when the 28th Division pushed the Germans out of Gathemo, hiding in a cellar with his family, according to Gerrard. His older sister was in front of the baby carriage he was in when a shell exploded – wounding her in the leg, which left her permanently disabled.  But as fate would have it, she likely saved Galonde’s life because of where she was standing. 
Nadolny plans to have dinner with the mayor and hopes to shake Lelandais’ hand and ask him what he remembers about the fight to free the town. 
“I mean sincerely, we are so thankful…my family and I are almost just unbelievably thankful,” he said. “(Jerome) was a blue-collar soldier that gave everything and moved us along, So to me, that’s what it’s about. A lot of forgotten stories. So, if we can share a little bit of it or be a part of it, I think it’s incredible.”
The commemoration is a reminder that “freedom has a cost and that true friendship endures,”  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a letter to the event organizers.
“More than 80 years ago, the sons of Pennsylvania crossed an ocean to stand in defense of liberty and peace, forging a bond of courage and shared sacrifice. The soldiers of the 28th Infantry Division fought with extraordinary bravery, with some making the ultimate sacrifice,” Shapiro said. “The people of Gathemo have, across generations, honored the legacy of these brave men not only with gratitude, but with a deep and enduring partnership that continues to unite our communities. Pennsylvania is proud of the heritage of the 28th Infantry Division and of the shared history we hold with our friends in Gathemo.”
The ceremony is set to begin Saturday, June 7, at 5 a.m. EST and will be livestreamed on the Mike Pride Museum YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@grpicardie3945.

Some question the precedent that sets.,"Earlier this year, Margaret Joyce was charged alongside four other individuals with abusing Bridgeport’s absentee ballot system during the city’s 2023 Democratic mayoral primary.
And this week, the 46-year-old was cited again by state election enforcement officials — this time for violating the state’s absentee ballot laws during a 2024 re-do election between Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim and his Democratic challenger John Gomes.
According to State Election Enforcement Commission staff, Joyce told state investigators that she was compensated during those 2024 elections for the sole purpose of soliciting absentee votes — which is a violation of state law. They said she also admitted to taking possession of at least one voters’ absentee ballot ahead of those contests, which is a felony in Connecticut.
But Joyce, who is now homeless and living out of her car, is unlikely to face any consequence for the actions she took during the 2024 elections, which were held after Ganim’s victory in 2023 was overturned in court due to widespread allegations of absentee ballot fraud.
The SEEC staff recommended the commission settle the case against Joyce — who is already facing nine felony charges tied to the 2023 election — and issue Joyce a fine of $1,000 for what they described as an “egregious” violation of state law.
But the SEEC also acknowledged that Joyce was unlikely to pay that fine because of her financial circumstances. They said she will qualify to have the fine waived because she is considered indigent.  
Joyce previously told investigators with the Connecticut Chief State’s Attorneys office that she worked for Ganim in 2023 and 2024 and was paid by his campaign. 
Joyce could not be reached for comment for this story. Her attorney, Robert Koetsch, did not return a call to his office.
Ganim did not respond to an email that was sent to a spokesperson for his office.
Members of the SEEC ultimately voted to settle the case against Joyce. But before they did, two of the commissioners openly questioned what type of precedent they were setting, and what message it might send to candidates who are running for political office in the future.
Stephen Penny, chairman of the SEEC, specifically asked what would prevent Ganim or any other political candidate from hiring low-income individuals to repeatedly violate the state’s absentee ballot laws.
“What is there in this process that would discourage candidates for the office of the mayor for the city of Bridgeport from putting indigent people in this position, over and over and over again?” Penny asked. 
Gregory Piecuch, another commissioner, made a similar point, and suggested that the SEEC needs to start investigating the candidates and treasurers paying campaign workers who mishandle absentee ballots.
“What we have seen, particularly since COVID, is a proliferation in the use of absentee ballots by campaigns,” Piecuch said. “…The use of absentee ballots has grown, and so too has the ability of folks to be acting in concert and perhaps using the indigent as a way to escape liability.” 
“That is something that we are going to have to take a much closer look at going forward,” Piecuch added.
William Smith, an attorney for the SEEC, explained to the commission that the case against Joyce, which included video footage of her allegedly picking up an absentee ballot at a voter’s house, was one of more than 30 investigations stemming from the election contests between Ganim and Gomes in 2023 and 2024.
According to Smith, Michael Brandi, the SEEC’s former director, made the decision to focus those cases on the individual campaign operatives who were allegedly mishandling absentee ballots. Smith said that is why Ganim and his campaign team were not investigated as part of the complaint that was filed against Joyce.  
Brandi, who retired earlier this year, did not respond to phone call for this story. 
“Based on the former executive director’s strategy, we were focused on the participants who were actually on the ground, knocking on doors,” Smith told the commission. 
It’s not just members of the SEEC, however, who are starting to question why it is largely campaign operatives who are being hit with fines and criminal charges in Bridgeport.
People involved in election cases in Bridgeport and attorneys for some of the defendants who are currently facing charges are also critical of the fact that campaign directors and political candidates who benefited from the alleged absentee ballot fraud are not being investigated and criminally prosecuted. 
Ken Krayeske, who is representing Nilsa Heredia, another low-level campaign worker who was charged with mishandling absentee ballots during Ganim’s 2019 election, said the string of alleged election fraud that has taken place in Bridgeport is unlikely to end if the people at the top are not held accountable.
“Why isn’t the person who benefited from these schemes in 2019 and 2023 a defendant here,” Krayeske said, referring to Ganim. “It is a crime to solicit someone to go out and take absentee ballots.”
Krayeske said it will be deeply unfair if people like Joyce and his client, who lives in P.T. Barnum Apartments, a public housing facility, are convicted of felonies, while the individuals who hired them and paid them are left unscathed. He said he would consider that selective prosecution.
Prena Rao, an attorney who led a civil lawsuit challenging Ganim’s primary victory in 2019, said the trial in that case highlighted the instructions that many lower-level campaign operatives receive during many Bridgeport elections. 
Rao, who grew up in Bridgeport, said there is clearly evidence in some of the ongoing criminal cases that the people accused of illegally collecting absentee ballots were also being paid by campaigns.
“I don’t think that justice will be done until the folks involved in orchestrating this process and giving people directives and issuing checks and payments also face consequences,” Rao said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bridgeport-complaint-video.png,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma City federal judge this week placed an indefinite ban on enforcement of a state law criminalizing undocumented immigrants living in Oklahoma.
The decision from U.S. District Judge Bernard Jones extends the two-week hold he implemented for House Bill 4156 on May 20 to last until he makes a final ruling on a lawsuit challenging the statute. 
HB 4156, enacted last year, created the state crime of “impermissible occupation,” threatening fines and jail time for immigrants living in Oklahoma without legal residency.
Past rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court and judges across the country have made clear that immigration enforcement is the federal government’s responsibility, not an individual state’s, Jones wrote in his decision issued Tuesday. Federal law preempts state laws on the issue, rendering Oklahoma’s new statute unenforceable, the judge decided.
“In the end, that is why H.B. 4156 must fail — not to excuse unlawful presence or shield criminal conduct, but because it is what the Constitution demands,” Jones wrote.
Oklahoma still has the power to prosecute U.S. citizens and noncitizens alike for crimes that might stem from unlawful immigration, the judge said.
Attorney General Gentner Drummond had contended HB 4156 helps law enforcement stop drug trafficking and other crimes. Drummond called Jones’ previous two-week hold “outrageous,” “perverse” and “contrary to the rule of law.”

“The attorney general is committed to ensuring the state has the agency to protect Oklahomans,” Drummond’s spokesperson, Phil Bacharach, said Thursday. “HB 4156 is a commonsense and necessary law and Oklahoma must be able to enforce it.” 
Jones blocked enforcement of the law for nine months last year after former President Joe Biden’s Administration filed a lawsuit. The ban lifted when President Donald Trump withdrew Biden’s case.
Two undocumented residents of Oklahoma and two immigrant-focused organizations based in the state refiled the lawsuit last month, contending HB 4156 is unconstitutional.
Attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Tulsa law firm Rivas & Associates are representing the plaintiffs.
“Once again, the court has made it clear that the state of Oklahoma may not enforce HB 4156 while our litigation proceeds,” ACLU of Oklahoma legal director Megan Lambert said. “People who are immigrants join the long American tradition of coming here in search of a better life and the freedom and opportunity we offer. Anti-immigrant policies do not represent our state, and we are grateful for the relief this provides while we continue to fight for the rights and safety of Oklahoma’s immigrant communities.”

“Neither the University of Florida nor the Board of Governors, nor (Santa) Ono would have been in this position,” had HB 1321 been in effect before the presidential search, Perez said during a media availability.
Representatives voted 104-8 on that bill this session, which would have repealed the public records exemption on applicants for presidencies at state colleges and universities. The Senate companion bill,  SB 1726, cleared all its committees of reference, but the full Senate never considered it.
Back to the drawing board: UF presidential finalist nixed for conflicting DEI stances

The State University System Board of Governors rejected University of Michigan President Santa Ono during the final phase of the presidential search process this week. The 6-10 vote against Ono followed hours of questions about his conflicting stances on diversity, equity, and inclusion. He was unanimously approved by UF trustees the week before.
“All of the deficiencies that Ono had prior to the presidential search coming to a conclusion, and eventually going before the BOG would have been discovered,” Perez said. “It was not discovered because no one knew that Ono was the one that was going to be nominated, unanimously approved, and sent to the BOG.” 
  Speaker Daniel Perez via Florida House
 The House sponsor of the bill, Rep. Michelle Salzman, said the measure was about “transparency, term limiting bureaucrats, and good governance.” Gov. Ron DeSantis said the bill, which included a provision prohibiting his office’s involvement in searches, would “kneecap our ability to hold higher ed accountable.”
Speaker voted for secrecy
The law that put secrets in the dark once had the support of Perez.
State law, since the signing of SB 520 in 2022, requires university presidential searches to be conducted outside the public eye, none of the applicants known to the public unless part of the “shortlist” of finalists unveiled in the final phases, and the finalist(s) must be approved by the chair of the Board of Governors. That bill passed the House 86-26, with Perez voting in favor.
“What many fought back on was that the BOG chair had to have the veto power. Well, he had the veto power. He never used it. And then here we are with a presidential candidate for a major university, flagship university for the state of Florida, in a very embarrassing moment for the entire state of Florida, something that should have been avoided, could have been avoided,” Perez said. 
UF has twice, consecutively, named a sole finalist despite the “shortlist” language in law.
Perez said the school will have a problem trying to find a president now that the “process is flawed.”

Senate president wishy-washy
Opponents of the House proposal have said keeping searches confidential initially prevents a candidate’s current employer from discovering their employee is applying for a new job. That, in turn, encourages more candidates to apply.
Senate President Ben Albritton doesn’t see the issue as clearly as Perez.
Albritton replied to Perez’s comments in his own media availability held about an hour after Perez’s.
“I’m not sure it would have” avoided Ono’s rejection, Albritton said.

“One way to look at it would be that way. Another way to look at it would say that the system worked.”
Albritton added: “I applaud the Speaker and the House for taking it head on. It’s a complicated situation. Let’s keep talking about it.”
The Legislature is not poised to address policy issues unrelated to the budget in the final days of its extended session.
“Are there some circumstances where it would be better to have multiple [finalists]? Maybe. Are there some circumstances you’re better off to have one? Maybe,” Albritton said. “I’m not going to give you something definitive at this point.”
Perez said he hopes changes can come before any more searches fail.
“The House tried for this to never happen. Yet we were the only ones that believed in that policy. I still believe in that policy,” Perez said. “Hopefully, now that we have seen this example come to fruition and become a reality, unfortunately, we can now once again have that consideration and that conversation of the policy that the House passed.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Senate President Valarie Lawson quietly recused herself from two labor bills decided Wednesday. The reason: She’s awaiting the advice of a state ethics panel on conflicts of interest with her job as head of one of the state’s two largest teachers unions.
Despite Lawson’s abstention, two union-backed bills secured approval with decisive majorities of the 37-member chamber. One would extend organizing rights to university graduate students; the other enhances information-sharing about union members between their employers and local bargaining units.
As the end of session looms, with hundreds of bills expected to be considered by both chambers in the final weeks, it’s still unclear when and whether Lawson should be participating in discussions and decisions that overlap with her day job as president of the National Education Association of Rhode Island.
Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, was elected Senate president on April 29, filling the opening left after the death of former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio. She requested an advisory opinion from the Rhode Island Ethics Commission on May 23, according to a letter obtained by Rhode Island Current. The commission, which last met on May 20, has not set a date to consider a recommendation from its staff on Lawson’s request.
Lawson in the letter referred to a June 2024 ethics recommendation, when she was majority leader, determining that she could still vote on a swath of proposed changes to the state pension system despite being a retired teacher and head of the teachers union. The ethics panel concluded that Lawson would not benefit from the proposed changes any more than the 68,000 retirees and active state workers and teachers, including 400 of her co-workers at the state teachers’ union.
Lawson sought to distinguish between actual conflicts of interest, rooted in financial gain, and a “subjective perception of bias” — the latter of which is not addressed by the state ethics code.
“The Code of Ethics does not address perceived general biases, political views or personal opinions unless they intersect with financial interests,” Lawson wrote. “This is intentional as the Code of Ethics may not infringe upon either legislative or executive powers.”
Lawson also pledged in the letter to recuse herself from any discussions and votes on bills related to pension benefits that would affect her “rights or entitlements as a participant in the state’s Pension system.”
Her letter does not mention potential conflicts on labor bills, including the two she abstained from Wednesday.
‘What happens behind closed doors?’
Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson, downplayed Lawson’s recusals.
“In any part-time legislature, most members will have full-time jobs as well, and it is inevitable that potential conflicts will arise,” Pare said in an emailed response Thursday. “The members of the Senate recuse themselves in these situations. Throughout her tenure in the Senate, President Lawson has recused out of an abundance of caution when a potential conflict arises, and she did so yesterday as well.”
The precautionary measure did not put Sen. Ana Quezada at ease. Quezada, a Providence Democrat, did not vote for Lawson for Senate president because she worried over the conflicts of interest with her union job.
“For me, it is still a concern,” Quezada said in an interview Thursday. “Even if she recuses herself from voting on the floor, what happens behind closed doors?”
Indeed, it was behind-the-scenes negotiations, not public votes, that prompted the first Senate president, East Providence Democrat, Billy Irons, to resign. Irons abruptly left the leadership post at the end of his first year, in 2003, amid news reports he accepted payouts from insurance companies in exchange for defeating legislation the industry opposed.  
“Recusing from a vote is only part of the actions as Senate president,” John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island, said. “Lawson is also the person who decides if a committee can move forward with a vote on the legislation.”
Exercising caution might sound like the best choice amid uncertainty. But her constituents, and the 12,000 teachers she leads, could lose out if she recuses herself unnecessarily, too.
This was the conclusion of a pair of Brown University professors in a paper in the 2024 Roger Williams University Law Review in examining non-judicial recusals from 2006 to 2018.
“Recusing might make political sense,” the authors stated. “Stepping aside makes it impossible for political opponents to claim that voting was improper. But this is where the phrase ‘out of an abundance of caution’ falls apart. That phrase implies that there are no costs to recusing, just possible benefits. But there are real costs—direct and indirect—to this kind of ‘abundance of caution.’ The direct cost of legislative recusal is the disenfranchisement of constituents.”
Without an ethics opinion on the bills up for a vote Wednesday, it’s unclear whether Lawson could have participated in the decisions.










Recusing from a vote is only part of the actions as Senate president. Lawson is also the person who decides if a committee can move forward with a vote on the legislation.


–  John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island


Marion acknowledged the timing of the state ethics reviews and meetings – typically once per month — made it difficult for Lawson to get timely advice in the end-of-session scramble.
But the proposals themselves were introduced on Jan. 31, giving Lawson ample time to ask for more general input from the ethics panel. Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone requested an advisory opinion from the Ethics Commission on his ability to discuss and vote on gun-related legislation immediately after he was elected the Senate’s no. 2. The commission approved its staff recommendation at its May 20 meeting.
Lawson waited more than three weeks after she was tapped as president to ask for an ethics opinion. 
“It’s surprising given the scrutiny on her dual roles that she isn’t doing more publicly to make sure that she’s getting sound advice on what she can and can’t do in her role as Senate president,” Marion said. “The next few weeks are going to highlight that challenge.”
Companion legislation in the House to Ciccone’s bill expanding organizing rights to college graduate students remains held in committee following an initial Feb. 12 hearing. The House Committee on Labor is scheduled to vote Thursday night on a companion to the other union bill, requiring regular updates from union employers to the local bargaining units.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi remained noncommittal when asked for comment Thursday, only saying that both bills were “under consideration.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)LINCOLN — A new vacancy on the three-member Nebraska Liquor Control Commission came at the request of Gov. Jim Pillen, which the former commissioner in that seat said happened because the governor wanted more “cannabis experience” on the regulatory board.
Former Commissioner Harry Hoch, Jr., speaking with the Nebraska Examiner, confirmed this week that he was told he would not be reappointed to another six-year term to the Liquor Control Commission after his term expired May 24. Hoch said he had put in a request to be reappointed but withdrew it after talking with Dave Lopez, Pillen’s chief of staff, so his last day was May 24.

Hoch said the “nice” conversation with Lopez “basically boiled down to [that] I wasn’t going to be reappointed, because the governor wanted to get more cannabis experience in my seat.”
“There was no Hanky Panky there. It’s all above board,” Hoch said of his resignation, adding that he parted ways with the executive branch officials, “basically friends still.”
Medical cannabis duties
Under a ballot measure approved by about 67% of voters in November, the three members of the Liquor Control Commission also jointly serve on the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission.

Pillen’s two new at-large appointees to the medical cannabis board were confirmed by the Nebraska Legislature last week. The commission’s first meeting is Monday at 3 p.m.
“If you think about it, the three Liquor Control commissioners were put on the cannabis board just because it was a convenient way,” Hoch said.
In his resignation email, dated May 20, Hoch said it was “a pleasure to be able to serve and use my 40 years of industry knowledge” during his six years on the Liquor Control Commission.
Hoch represented Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, which consists of Saunders County, Douglas County and western Sarpy County.

The resignation had nothing to do with the later action to suspend without pay the Liquor Commission’s executive director — an employee of the commission — one day after a federal search warrant was carried out on the commission, Hoch said.
The former commissioner said he did not know those “goings on.” Authorities have shared no other information about that investigation.
There has been no public announcement or call for applications for the 2nd District Liquor Commission vacancy. There was no announcement or call for applications for the Medical Cannabis Commission as of March 31, either. Pillen made the six-year appointments April 24.
Applications for open appointments to boards and commissions are available here.
‘A role even more critical’
In a May 20 email exchange between Lopez and Hoch, Lopez said the Governor’s Office would put out a statement recognizing Hoch’s service and look for another way that the former commissioner could serve. It’s unclear whether any statement was sent about Hoch.
“As discussed, I will personally see to identifying several possibilities for continued state-appointed service that will befit your experience, wisdom and stature,” Lopez wrote to Hoch. “I cannot overstate how valuable it is to have good people willing to serve in appointed positions, and candidly, I am hopeful we can engage you in a role even more critical than LCC is presently.”

Pillen confirmed in an interview this week with the Examiner that he directed the call for Hoch’s resignation, as he believes serving at the “pleasure of the governor” means appointing someone when a term expires, though he was grateful for Hoch’s work.
Hoch was appointed by former Gov. Pete Ricketts. Pillen accepted Hoch’s resignation May 21.
Asked if Pillen had a reason for Hoch’s resignation, the governor said: “No, just time.”
A spokesperson for the governor declined to comment on the pending appointment process beyond a previous comment that the vacancy would be filled “in due course.”
‘Important we get it right’
Pillen reiterated that he also always supported medical cannabis but does not support a “leak” to recreational marijuana — ”no way, shape or form.” He previously said access to medical cannabis should only come after U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.
Pillen committed to taking the medical cannabis duties seriously while protecting kids.
“We’re gonna do it, fulfill the will of the people as quickly as possible,” Pillen said.
He then pointed to the “be quick, but don’t hurry” phrase popularized by former American basketball Coach John Wooden and added: “This is important we get it right.”

(NCDPI Screengrab)When Kimberly Jones was selected as the 2023-24 North Carolina Teacher of the Year she earned a two-year appointment to the State Board of Education. This week, as the veteran Chapel Hill English teacher attended her final meeting in that leadership capacity, she challenged both the board and state legislators to invest more in public schools.
Jones urged the State Board of Education on Thursday to stay grounded in the constitutional mandate to provide every North Carolina child with a sound basic education.

“Be wary of oversimplified solutions to complex challenges,” Jones advised. “Invest not only in outcomes, but in the conditions that produce them — teacher retention, culturally relevant pedagogy, instructional materials that reflect diverse experiences and perspectives and learning environments that allow our students to feel safe, both physically and emotionally.”
During her time on the board, the Trump administration’s U.S. Department of Education has sought to block diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs nationwide. Jones cautioned her colleagues to never confuse neutrality with justice.
“Please make equity, access, or whatever synonym meets the current criteria to guide your compass, even when that path is hard to navigate. The very future of our democracy and our society depends on how courageously you continue to steward this responsibility,” Jones said.
As Newsline has previously reported, this legislative session state Republican lawmakers have advanced multiple proposals to eliminate DEI from all corners of the public sector — government, higher education and K-12 education.
At the same time, the North Carolina House has passed legislation that would promote “wholesome” content for students, but that critics have derided as an invitation to censorship. The bill would require the State Board of Education to maintain a database of all banned media across the state with annual updates.
Jones reminded the board that reading and inquiry are not a nuisance, but rather an engine of learning.
“In my classroom, we use complex questions to feel reading, research, and rigorous dialogue to build empathy and to strengthen civic understanding,” she said. “I believe students of every background and every region of our state deserve access to such curricula. Ones that affirm their identity, reflect their communities, inspire their best efforts, and invite them into meaningful conversations about the world they are inheriting and shaping.”
Jones, a high school English and AP African American studies and Holocaust educator, said students should be encouraged to explore not just what was said or written, but why it mattered.
For legislators who will be working on a compromise budget in the weeks ahead, Jones urged improved funding for schools and better respect for educators.
“Public education cannot be reimagined if it is consistently underfunded, undermined, or politicized,” she said. “If we are to recruit and retain a diverse, highly qualified, and effective workforce, then we must offer more than praise. We must offer respect, autonomy, and trust.”

Jones said her classroom colleagues simply deserve more.
“We need competitive teacher pay that honors both experience and expertise. We need sustainable investments in student mental health because no curriculum is effective in a crisis. We need clean modern school buildings, not just in select counties but in every community.”
The House budget proposes to increase new teacher pay from $41,000 a year to $48,000 for the next school year but offers little to more experienced teachers. The Senate budget offers average raises of 2.3% in FY 25-26 with a $3,000 bonus spread out over two years. The two sides are reportedly far apart from reaching a consensus.
Beyond the classroom, Jones said lawmakers should acknowledge those behind the scenes — cafeteria workers, bus drivers, and those willing to pitch in to maintain the grounds and buildings when the needs surpass the resources.
For parents and community advocates, Jones encouraged them to visit a classroom, become a mentor, vote in their local school board elections, and ask their local school district leaders what they’re doing to serve the most marginalized students.
Jones said it’s important to understand that not every student learns the same way, and not every parent’s experience with their school is universal.
“In public schools, there are no applications for admission. There are no filters to whom we serve. We don’t select who enters our classrooms, but every day we get the unparalleled opportunity to shape and influence what kind of person leaves our classrooms.”
Jones said that during challenging times she reflects on a proverb which holds that children are born with their hands closed because that’s where their gifts and talents lie.
“As they grow, their hands begin to open so they can share those talents with the world. At its most essential level, education is not about what we put into young people. It’s about what we pull out of them,” she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NC-State-Board-of-Education-June2025.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

The travel ban applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
The policy change restricts entry for citizens of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and do not hold a valid visa.
The policy takes effect Monday at 12:01 a.m. and does not have an end date.
Here’s what to know about the new rules:
How Trump justified the ban
Since returning to the White House, Trump has launched an unprecedented campaign of immigration enforcement that has pushed the limits of executive power and clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him.
The travel ban results from a Jan. 20 executive order Trump issued requiring the departments of State and Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence to compile a report on “hostile attitudes” toward the U.S.
The aim is to “protect its citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes,” the administration said.
In a video released on social media, Trump tied the new ban to a terror attack Sunday in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. The suspect in the attack is from Egypt, a country that is not on Trump’s restricted list. The Department of Homeland Security says he overstayed a tourist visa.
Who is exempt from the ban
1. Lawful residents: green card holders, citizens of designated countries who have obtained legal residency in the U.S.;
2. Dual citizens: U.S. citizens who also have citizenship of one of the banned countries;
3. Some athletes: athletes and their coaches traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup, Olympics or other major sporting event as determined by the U.S. secretary of state;
4. Afghans who worked for the U.S. government or its allies in Afghanistan and are holders of Afghan Special Immigrant Visas;
5. Iranians belonging to an ethnic or religious minority who are fleeing prosecution;
6. Certain foreign national employees of the U.S. government who have served abroad for at least 15 years and their spouses and children;
7. Refugees: Those who were granted asylum or admitted to the U.S. as refugees before the ban entered into force;
8. Individuals with U.S. family members who apply for visas in connection to their spouses, children or parents;
9. Diplomats and foreign government officials on official visits;
10. Those transiting the U.S. to the U.N. headquarters solely for official business related to the U.N.;
11. Representatives of international organizations and NATO on official visits in the U.S.;
12. Children adopted by U.S. citizens.
Which countries are affected
Trump said nationals of countries included in the ban pose “terrorism-related” and “public-safety” risks, as well as risks of overstaying their visas. He also said some of these countries had “deficient” screening and vetting or have historically refused to take back their own citizens.
His findings rely extensively on an annual Homeland Security report of visa overstays of tourists, business visitors and students who arrive by air and sea, singling out countries with high percentages of remaining after their visas expired.
“We don’t want them,” Trump said.
The inclusion of Afghanistan angered some supporters who have worked to resettle its people. The ban makes exceptions for Afghans on Special Immigrant Visas, generally people who worked most closely with the U.S. government during the two-decade war there.
The list can be changed, the administration said in a document circulated Wednesday evening, if authorities of designated countries make “material improvements” to their own rules and procedures. New countries can be added “as threats emerge around the world.”
Early reactions to the ban
International aid groups and refugee resettlement organizations roundly condemned the new ban.
“This policy is not about national security — it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,” said Abby Maxman, president of Oxfam America.
The African Union Commission expressed concern Thursday about the “the potential negative impact” of the ban on educational exchanges, business ties and broader diplomatic relations.
“The African Union Commission respectfully calls upon the U.S. administration to consider adopting a more consultative approach and to engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned,” the commission said in a statement.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, called the order “unnecessary, overbroad and ideologically motivated.”
How the ban is different from 2017
During his first term, Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries including Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.
It was one of the most chaotic and confusing moments of his young presidency. Travelers from those nations were either barred from getting on their flights to the U.S. or detained at U.S. airports after they landed. They included students and faculty, as well as businesspeople, tourists and people visiting friends and family.
The order, often referred to as the “Muslim ban” or the “travel ban,” was retooled amid legal challenges until a version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.
The ban affected various categories of travelers and immigrants from Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Syria and Libya, plus North Koreans and some Venezuelan government officials and their families.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25156397352976-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

[…]","A St. Louis Metro Police car outside Carnahan Courthouse in downtown St. Louis (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).A St. Louis civil rights law firm filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging the state takeover of the St. Louis police as unconstitutional.
ArchCity Defenders filed the lawsuit in Cole County circuit court on behalf of two St. Louis city residents, Jamala Rogers and Mike Milton. The state and Attorney General Andrew Bailey are the defendants.
The lawsuit seeks to overturn provisions of a bill Gov. Mike Kehoe signed into law in March, which put the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department under a state board instead of local control. The law, reversing a statewide vote from 2012 that put the board under local control, was needed, supporters said, to address high crime rates.
With Kehoe’s signature, St. Louis joined Kansas City as the only major metropolitan police force in the country under control of a state board rather than local officials. 
The plaintiffs argue the law violates two parts of the state constitution: the prohibition on unfunded state mandates and on special laws targeting a particular locality.
The law will “subject the city to an unfunded mandate that diverts resources away from needed programs to prevent crime, overturns the democratic vote of the people with no rational basis to believe it will help increase public safety,” the lawsuit states, “and will derail any progress that has been made in reducing the level of violence and improving law enforcement community relations.”
The bill established a floor for the police budget in St. Louis, setting a minimum portion of  general revenue funds that must be used for police each year, rising to 25% in 2028. 
Previously, there was no minimum funding requirement for the St. Louis city police, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit argues the city will need to either reallocate money from other programs and services or raise taxes. 
The two St. Louis city residents named as plaintiffs are activists who have advocated for policies to reduce poverty, prevent violence and increase community trust in law enforcement, according to the lawsuit.
Those plaintiffs believe that the “policies they are advocating for and the programs they implement will increase public safety,” the lawsuit states, but that “funding and support for those policies are now in jeopardy because of the state takeover law.”
The city charter also requires pay parity between police officers and firefighters and emergency medical personnel, meaning that if the state board increases police officers’ salaries, the city will be under the increased strain of matching those salaries. 
“There will be even less funds available for the city to implement holistic, poverty-reducing programs that have a proven effect on increasing public safety in the region,” the lawsuit states.
Under the state’s Hancock Amendment, the state is forbidden from imposing unfunded mandates on local governments.
The second component of the lawsuit argues the law is unconstitutional because it violates the prohibition against the legislature enacting certain local or special laws. It argues the law regulates the affairs of St. Louis when a general state law could be made applicable to it. 
“The state has no rational basis for imposing minimum police department funding requirements only on the city of St. Louis and excluding other municipalities from those requirements,” the lawsuit states.
The plaintiffs ask the court to declare the state takeover provisions invalid under the constitution, and sever them from the rest of the wide-ranging crime bill in which they were passed.
The bill restored the governing system that controlled the police department from 1861 until the 2012 vote. 
The bill was passed despite the 2012 vote, and “despite the City’s robust funding of the police department at the expense of other needs, and despite the falling crime rate in the city of St. Louis,” the lawsuit states. The plaintiffs argue that the city has struggled to fund services like affordable housing and violence prevention services, which could reduce crime, while providing “steady funding” for the police department. 
The Board of Police Commissioners has six members — the mayor of St. Louis and five people appointed by the governor and subject to state Senate confirmation. 
The bill passed on party-line votes in the House and Senate earlier this year, with Democrats opposed.

Opponents argued it was racist because Black Democrats held the major offices in St. Louis at the time of passage and is unneeded because crime is decreasing. Senate Democrats filibustered the bill, winning additions of provisions banning the shackling of pregnant prisoners, establishing a fund for exonerated prisoners to receive restitution from the state and limiting what jails and prisons can charge inmates for phone calls.
Critics point to statistics showing a drop in violent crime in St. Louis under local leadership. They say Kansas City has fared no better despite being under state control since the 1930s.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)The Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives announced Thursday that it has filed a lawsuit against Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson for her alleged failure to comply with a subpoena issued by the chair of the chamber’s oversight body.
The complaint, House of Representatives v. Benson, filed in the Michigan Court of Claims on Wednesday, follows the House Oversight Committee’s request for election training materials from Benson and her office, which resulted in a subpoena.
House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township) last month asked the full chamber to hold Benson in civil contempt for her alleged failure to provide the materials, which the House moved as a resolution later that day.
Now, the chamber’s Republicans have sued Benson seeking a declaratory judgment holding that the House issued a valid subpoena to which the secretary of state must comply. That lawsuit also seeks an injunction prohibiting Benson or the Michigan Department of State from modifying relevant records in the initial request.
A request for comment from the department or Benson was not immediately returned. Benson however in a press conference when the House held her in contempt said the move was a political stunt and that if they wanted to go to court, she would see them in court.
In a statement, DeBoyer said his commitment to bringing accountability to Lansing wasn’t lip service. 
“After going years without legislative oversight, Benson has clearly grown comfortable operating independent of the other, co-equal branches of government,” DeBoyer said. “For months, we have tried to get her cooperation through requests, then accommodating offers, and then legal demands. Her continued defiance now brings us to the courtroom, where we will continue to diligently work to deliver government transparency for the people of Michigan.”
DeBoyer added that all government officials, regardless of their title, each of them have a responsibility to uphold their constitutional duties and adhere to the law.
“Yet, Jocelyn Benson, one of the most powerful office holders in Michigan, must instead be brought to court and forced to comply with Michigan statute,” DeBoyer said. “We will not let her disregard for the law keep us from delivering results to the people we represent.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AMR_0051-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees (Brandon Bell/Getty Images).More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.
Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
 GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
 Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
 Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.

Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.



Hunger in North Carolina

In a recent interview with NC Newsline, Amy Beros, the President and CEO of the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina, which serves an array of urban and rural counties, said her agency is already struggling to cope with rising demand and expects that proposed cuts in Washington will worsen the situation.
“In the past three years, just in our 34 counties that we serve, hunger has increased by over 150,000 people,” Beros said. “We’re seeing it worse than we saw at the height of the pandemic. It’s the worst than we’ve seen in nearly two decades, and unfortunately, with the decisions that are being made at the state level and federal level right now, we anticipate that that need is going to rise drastically with the proposed cuts.”
–Rob Schofield



Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.










The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.


– Marsha Keene, CEO of the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in Missouri


In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
‘I’d probably close the doors’
The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.

But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.
For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.

Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.

In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
‘It’s time to sound the alarm’
Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

SPRINGFIELD – While Illinois State Police has long investigated child sex crimes, a new measure would explicitly name addressing internet crimes against children as a core mission of its criminal division.

House Bill 2586, also called Alicia’s Law, would add to the current 13 missions of the Illinois State Police Department of Criminal Investigations. It passed both chambers of the Illinois General Assembly unanimously in late May.

The bill is named after Alicia Kozak, a survivor of and advocate against online crimes against children, who was at the center of the first nationally known case of child grooming and abduction in 2002. At age 13, Kozak was abducted from her home after months of online grooming by a 38-year-old man, who took her across state lines and chained her in a basement, where she was sexually assaulted and tortured for four days. The perpetrator livestreamed Kozak’s abuse, which was quickly reported to the FBI by a viewer, aiding in Kozak’s release.

“I’ve spent the last 25 years sharing my story and presenting to audiences about online safety and advocating for critical change. And through my work, I’ve heard so many heartbreaking ‘if only’ stories, ‘if only we had known sooner’ or ‘if only we could have stopped it,’” Kozak said in an interview. “Now, with Alicia’s Law in Illinois, Illinois children are safer.”

If signed by the governor, Illinois will be the 13th state to adopt a variation of Alicia’s Law. In most states that have passed a version of the law, it allows states to create a task force to investigate internet crimes against children. Illinois already has such a task force that was created in 2004, although it’s currently under the attorney general’s office.

Illinois’ task force coordinates the AG’s office with state law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute child exploitation cases. During an October 2021 news conference, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said his office managed over 5,100 cyber tips the year prior, an increase of over 2,000 since 2018. Raoul said he expected that number to continue to grow, in part due to increased reporting and awareness by social media and apps.

Illinois State Police Director Brendan Kelly said although ISP has become “much more engaged” in cases involving internet crimes against children in recent years, he said he believes it needs to be explicitly stated in statute that investigating those types of cases is one of ISP’s core duties.

Through talks with Kozak about the issue, Kelly said ISP drafted the bill and spearheaded efforts to get it passed during this year’s legislative session.

“We believe that this is something that is critical, this is important and that is essential to what our values are as the Illinois State Police,” Kelly said. “Making sure that this is a legal, permanent function of our agency is something that I think needed to be done because we want to make sure that these efforts are sustained over time.”

Kozak agreed.

“Before the law, investigating crimes against children in Illinois wasn’t really a legal obligation, it was something Illinois state police would choose to do when resources allowed,” Kozak said. “And now, with Alicia’s Law, it’s a permanent responsibility, it’s no longer optional.”

Kelly Armstrong on Thursday appointed a Minot attorney to a judgeship in the North Central Judicial District covering Burke, Mountrail and Ward counties.
The appointment of Steven Lautt is effective Aug. 4. The judgeship is chambered in Minot. 
Lautt, a Minot native, has been with the Minot law firm of Pringle and Herigstad since 2012. He is the general counsel for several regional agriculture and telecommunications cooperatives and a statewide nonprofit organization, according to a news release from the governor’s office. 
Lautt earned his bachelor’s degree from Tabor College in Kansas, and his law degree in 2012 from the Washburn University School of Law in Kansas. He is a former president of the Ward County Bar Association and current president of the North Dakota Association for Justice. Lautt serves on the board of directors of the Minot-based Northern Plains Children’s Advocacy Center.
The North Central Judicial District judgeship became vacant June 1 with the retirement of Judge Douglas Mattson, who was first elected as judge in 2002.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)TOPEKA — Kansas measles cases rose to 71 and were found in 11 counties in south-central and southwest Kansas, the state reported Wednesday.
Sixty-nine cases are associated with the outbreak in southwest Kansas, where three hospitalizations have also been reported, according to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment dashboard.
Counties where measles have been reported are Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray, Haskell, Kiowa, Morton, Pawnee, Reno, Sedgwick and Stevens. Gray has the most cases with 25 and is part of what is considered the outbreak, in which transmission is connected to other cases within an area. Sedgwick and Reno counties are outside the outbreak area, and the two cases there have been connected to international travel, the Sedgwick County Health Department website said.
County health departments continue to hold vaccine clinics. The Sedgwick County Health Department has one scheduled from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at the Evergreen Recreation Center, 2700 N. Woodland, Wichita.
In data updated Wednesday, KDHE indicated 57 cases were in children ages birth to 17 years, with the remaining 13 in people ages 18 to 64 years. Among the 69 cases associated with the outbreak, 58 were in unvaccinated people, one person was not age-appropriately vaccinated, five people were age-appropriately vaccinated, three people had vaccination statuses that could not be verified and two were pending verification.
Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection prevention and control at the University of Kansas Health System, said in a previous story that fully vaccinated people can get the disease but typically have fewer complications and overall less severity of illness. With one dose of the vaccine, people have 93% protection from measles, and after two doses, 97% protection, he said.

The stakes could not be higher—this is a matter of life and death. 
To say that Waterbury’s handling by Prospect Medical, who bought the hospital for $31.8 million in 2016, has been poor would be an understatement. Senator Chris Murphy has called it an outright “abomination.” The private equity model of Prospect has destroyed any hope of the hospital doing what it should: provide good, accessible healthcare to those in the area. 

Gray West
My first exposure to the issues with Waterbury Hospital occurred in Waterbury at the Brookside Housing Cooperatives, a local complex of housing cooperatives. Alex Kolokotronis, the Director for Naugatuck Valley Project, while guiding a tour of the cooperatives made it clear that “at the end of the day it affects everyone in the area.” 
The city of Waterbury, with a population of 114,990, should not have to depend on a hospital whose owners look to maximize profits instead of providing the basic healthcare necessities. The for-profit ownership model of hospitals, exemplified by Prospect Medical’s handling of Waterbury Hospital, endangers public health and must be stopped. 
Waterbury was first opened in 1890 with just 30 beds available and has expanded since to 357 licensed beds. Waterbury has a Cardiology, Orthopedic Surgery, a Surgical Innovation Center, and a Family Birthing Center, and it offers an extensive array of additional services. On paper, Waterbury sounds like a thriving, well-funded, and modern hospital. The issue: private-equity ownership. 
Since Waterbury Hospital was bought by Prospect Medical, there have been extensive issues of ownership and mismanagement that all are rooted in the private equity model of Prospect. The model? Initially infuse hospitals with large amounts of funding, then saddle the hospitals with massive amounts of debt, cut staff, cut supplies and investments, maximize profits before selling or declaring bankruptcy. That is exactly what Prospect has done. 
Prospect came into the Waterbury ownership with the promise of “turning around [the] financially challenged hospital.” It was seen as just that, a possible salvation for a faltering hospital. A 2024 investigation by state health inspectors was “concerned that the ICU is often inappropriately staffed” and that Waterbury was “not providing quality patient care.” 
Sarah Campell, a former nurse at Waterbury, spoke with the CT Insider. She painted a devastatingly bleak portrait of Waterbury. She reported water leaks, broken beds, inoperable computers, a lack of cell service, and plumbing issues. It would then make sense that Prospect was issued a $60,000 fine for health code violations that same year. 
Prospect followed the private equity playbook with chilling precision. In January, Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, having milked profits from people just looking for good healthcare. When I say milked, I mean the fact that Prospect owes Waterbury roughly $22 million in unpaid city taxes. This bankruptcy filing ripples far beyond Waterbury, threatening Prospect’s other Connecticut hospitals, Manchester Memorial and Rockville General as well. Hospitals are not hedge funds. People’s health is not an asset class. Waterbury should have been treated like a place of care, not a business deal. 
Yale New Haven Health (YNHH) reached a deal to buy all three hospitals in 2022 with a settled amount of $435 million dollars. However, this quickly fell through due to a series of lawsuits and counter-lawsuits between the two groups over the true value of the assets. YNHH and the overarching healthcare system allege that once the $435 million dollar settlement was reached and signed, Prospect began to neglect the properties, decreasing the overall value of purchasing for YNHH. With reports of neglecting to pay rent and the denial by Prospect to provide YNHH with an audit, a spokesperson reported, “The lawsuit filed by Prospect is a clear attempt to shift attention away from the for-profit, California-based company’s mismanagement of their Connecticut facilities and neglect of the communities who entrusted them with their care.” 
Monetarily the for-profit private equity was successful for Prospect. The issue is that this model comes at the risk and expense of real people, with real issues, and real health to take care of. The truth seems to be that Prospect did not and does not care about this when it comes to the monetary value of their stakeholders and investors. 
Something must be done about Waterbury, Manchester Memorial, and Rockville General as soon as possible. Terms of settlement and discussion need to be moved away from money and look at the real thing being discussed, which is the lives of people. The lives of people who actually depend on the services and care of these hospitals. No person should enter a hospital and worry about the quality of service, lack of staffing, or be boarded in an ER for a full day before being seen. 
Connecticut lawmakers are taking action this session with House Bill 7067 calling for an expedited timeline for acquisition of bankrupt hospitals and Senate Bill 1507, a proposal to flat out ban private equity ownership of hospitals. 
Waterbury’s story shows what happens when healthcare becomes a profit machine instead of a public good. It should be treated as such and used as a lesson for healthcare across America. Prospect’s structure harming everyday citizens is not a uniquely Waterbury issue, it is one that can be seen across the United States. It’s time to put an end to the era of profit-first healthcare. People’s lives—not private equity returns—must come first.

Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder.Georgia’s state Senate will have a new face when lawmakers return to work next year, and seven people are vying to be the one posing for photos under the Gold Dome when the dust settles.
  Former Sen. Brandon Beach. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The spot opened in this off-year election after Alpharetta Republican Sen. Brandon Beach stepped down following his appointment to serve as U.S. Treasurer under President Donald Trump.
Election Day is scheduled for Aug. 26.
Senate District 21 includes much of Cherokee County and some of north Fulton County. With seven candidates on the ballot, it’s likely that none will win an outright majority, and the most probable outcome is a runoff between the top two vote getters regardless of their party. The runoff is planned for Sept. 23.
Beach has been a stalwart ally to Trump – he was a leader in backing the false idea that the 2020 election was rigged and in pushing back against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ criminal case against Trump – and his former district rewarded him for his devotion.
Beach, who had served in the Senate since 2013, won just over 70% of the vote against his Democratic opponents in 2024 and 2018, the only times he faced a challenge from the other party. In 2024, Beach slightly outperformed Trump in the district, earning 81,481 votes, good for just over 70%, compared with Trump’s 78,544, or about 66.5%, according to data from the Georgia Secretary of State’s office analyzed by the Georgia Recorder.
So it’s no surprise that six of the seven Senate hopefuls are running as Republicans. Five of them came to Canton Monday for a forum hosted by the conservative Americans for Prosperity and answered questions about their commitment to principles like smaller government and lower taxes.
Policy-wise, there was not a whole lot of space between the candidates at the forum. Each said they support legislation expanding school vouchers, reducing or eliminating the state income tax and reducing government regulations – though the candidates did express some disagreement on accomplishing those goals.
Lance Calvert
  Lance Calvert. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Lance Calvert is the founder and owner of a Canton-based maintenance and repair business for retail and restaurants who says he wants to help repair the country.
“God’s going to fix this country, but he’s got some people that he needs to participate with him. Trump got this thing started, whether he knew or not to begin with. But there’s a lot of people who’ve been called forward, and they’re going to answer the call, we’re gonna do this. We’re going to turn this country around.”
While some candidates proposed a gradual approach to reducing the state income tax, suggesting a state equivalent to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, Calvert advocated for a quick and direct approach.
“Eliminate it. We’ve got the money,” he said.
Income taxes account for about half of state funds, according to the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, with sales taxes making up the second largest revenue source at about a quarter.
Stephanie Donegan
  Stephanie Donegan. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Stephanie Donegan, an entrepreneur and business strategist, said she’s seen the effects of rising prices for things like health insurance and will support conservative fiscal policies she says will help people keep more of their income.
“I love Georgia, I love the people of Georgia, and what I’ve been seeing is that what the people in Georgia have been asking for and need, we have not been getting. I truly believe I am that person who can do it. I can clearly sit up here among a group of amazing men, but men nonetheless, and still have a voice,” she said.”
Responding to a question about outreach to Latino voters, Donegan, who is Black, said Republicans have not done enough to reach minority voters.
“If we’re not careful, we’re going to become a blue state,” she said. “We are purple. We have a lot of people moving in here from blue states, from Philadelphia, New York, California, and if we don’t get people to understand that they have a place in this party and why they should vote for these conservative values, we’re going to lose this state, and that’s going to be a shame.”
Brice Futch
  Brice Futch. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Brice Futch, a Cherokee County firefighter, said he’ll push for expansive conservative policies, including replacing the state income tax with a consumption tax on goods and services purchased as well as expanding Georgia’s school voucher program.
“I believe the next step is ESAs, education savings accounts,” he said. “With that, the full amount of money that is given to the student over the life of the student would be loaded on a debit card. Parents would take their debit card and go to the education institution of their choice. If they decided they want to homeschool, they could also use that for homeschool curriculum as well. I also think it needs to apply to local funding and not just state funding.”
Georgia’s current school voucher program is available to students in low performing schools and provides funds based on the state’s share of the cost to educate that student, with the local share of the money staying in the local district.
Though Monday’s discussion centered on economic policies, Futch also pledged to be a strong voice on cultural issues.
“I believe you have to look at broader moral values,” he said. “If you want somebody that’s going to stand up and introduce legislation to outlaw puberty blockers in 2026, I’m your guy.”
A ban on the drugs that doctors prescribe to some transgender youths to delay the onset of puberty has been proposed but hasn’t passed. Georgia prohibits gender affirming surgeries and hormone treatments for transgender minors.
Steve West
  Steve West. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Steve West, the CEO of a metal fabrication company, stepped down from a seat on the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners to run for the seat.
“I want to run for the state Senate so I can go down to represent our district and cut taxes, bring business in, keep Georgia the best place to work, the best place to do business. You can tell I’m one that doesn’t speak very well. But I love the county. I love District 21. I’ve been a life-long resident of this district.”
West, who was first elected to the commission in 2014, said he may not be the slickest orator, but he says he has a record of serving the community and proposed ending the state film tax credit.
“I’m not the guy that wants to have his picture put in the paper every day. I want to be the one that goes down and fights for District 21 on the issues that we’re talking about tonight,” he said. “I want to go down and look at doing away with funding Hollywood and putting that money back into the income tax. Take away the income tax, quit funding Hollywood. Let’s look at deregulation so we can get projects done.”
Brian Will
  Brian Will. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Brian Will, an entrepreneur and author, resigned from a seat on the Alpharetta City Council to seek a place in the Senate.
For a Republican candidate, Will took several unorthodox positions on popular conservative programs, including the school voucher program and eliminating the state income tax.
In each case, Will supported the concept but found fault with how state leaders implemented them.
He said he supports the voucher project but said not enough people can take advantage of it and fully funding it would be too expensive. He said eliminating the state income tax and instituting a consumption tax would harm low-income Georgians who spend a greater portion of what they earn.
“This is why we need Georgia DOGE. We’ve got to go find out where the money went, who got it, for what, and how much, and then start cutting what we’re spending and come back and lowering the taxes.”
Will also had different ideas on the bill sometimes billed as Georgia DOGE, the Red Tape Rollback Act supported by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, which passed the Senate this year but stalled in the House. He argued the proposal would create more red tape.
“Simply put, we have 150,000 rules and regulations in the state of Georgia. We have 100 different agencies. Each agency is going to be required to go through every single one of those rules to determine if that rule costs more than $3 billion to implement over a five-year period. Now I’ve done math on this. I’ve done some research on it. It’ll take us about four years to get through every single rule to figure out if it’s a good rule that doesn’t cost money. The problem now is that the clock starts again. We have to do this every four years.”
Jason Dickerson
One Republican candidate qualified with the Georgia Secretary of State’s office to appear on the ballot but did not participate in Monday’s forum.
Jason Dickerson did not respond to a request for comment, but according to his qualifying documents, Dickerson is a Cherokee County investment manager. On his campaign website, he describes himself as “A conservative Republican businessman – not a typical politician.”
Debra Shigley
  Debra Shigley. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Attorney Debra Shigley is the sole Democrat in the race, who announced her candidacy last month. Last year, Shigley challenged the powerful House Speaker Pro Tem, Milton Republican Jan Jones, but lost by about 62% to 48%.
Members of her party are likely hoping that a crowded Republican field will split the conservative vote and put her into a runoff at a time when turnout could be low and Democrats are riled up to vote.
In a phone call, Shigley said voters in the district are not happy with what they are seeing from the government and she’s hoping to convince them she can help be a part of the solution.
“I know what it’s like to be a hardworking Georgian raising a family and wanting to make sure that they have every opportunity in front of them. I have been raising my kids here in the district and I never thought I would get into this arena, but as a mom, as a lawyer, as a small business owner, I just felt I could not stay on the sidelines because what we’re seeing here in our own community as well as in the state and even in our country is not going in the right direction, and something’s got to change.”

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, is stepping down from her leadership role at the end of the month. 
Russo has served as minority leader since January 2022 and she will continue to serve as state representative until her term ends on Dec. 31, 2026. She made the announcement to her caucus Thursday morning.

“Serving as the Ohio House Minority leader for the last three and a half years has been an incredible honor,” she said in a statement. “It has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding positions I’ve had the privilege to hold.”
Russo was first elected as state representative in November 2018, flipping a previously held Republican seat. She worked in health policy for more than 20 years before entering politics. Russo ran for Congress in 2021, but lost to U.S. Rep. Mike Carey 58% to 42%. 
“Every strong leader knows the importance of a thoughtful transition,” she said in a statement. “At the beginning of this session, I communicated to members that I wanted to remain in leadership through the important state operating budget negotiations.”
Heading into the legislative summer break and the rest of the General Assembly session, however, she said it “is important that I give the next leadership team ample time to thoughtfully and carefully plan how to navigate our caucus priorities after this budget cycle and to continue building our effort to pick up more seats for Democrats in the Ohio House in 2026.”  
Russo also said she wants to focus on her family, policy work and serving her district. 
“My son just graduated high school, and I look forward to spending the summer with him and my family preparing to send him off to college,” said Russo, who has three children. “Any decisions regarding my political future, will come at a later time.”
Russo is term-limited in the House and has been tight-lipped about her future plans. 
During her time as minority leader, Russo has been forced to navigate a Republican supermajority. 
“Over the last few years, my colleagues and I have stood strong in the face of attacks on our most basic rights and values, and despite tough odds we were successful in standing up for all Ohioans,” Russo said.
Ohio Democrats secured a couple of major victories in 2023 — voting down an effort that would have made it harder to pass constitutional amendments, and voting to enshrine abortion and reproductive rights in the state’s constitution. 
Russo’s announcement comes the same month Ohio Democratic Party Chair Liz Walters announced her plan to step down. So far, Dr. Amy Acton is the only Democratic candidate who has announced they are running for governor in 2026. Republican Vivek Ramaswamy is running for governor and Ohio Lieutenant Governor Jim Tressel is considering running. 
Ohio Supreme Court Judge Jennifer Brunner is the only Democrat in statewide office in Ohio.
“During her time as minority leader, Leader Russo has led Ohio House Democrats in fighting back against threats to our democracy, working to pass legislation that benefits Ohio families, and even picked up democratic seats during a difficult election cycle,” Walters said in a statement. “In an extremely difficult legislature, she has found countless ways to deliver for Ohioans.”
Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie J. Antonio, D-Lakewood, said she enjoyed working with Russo. 
“Leader Russo has been a dedicated advocate for working-class Ohioans and a fighter for fairness and justice in our state,” Antonio said in a statement. “I am confident that her voice will remain critical in shaping Ohio’s future, and I look forward to working with the next leader who will inherit the strong foundation she built in the House.”

(Photo credit: Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)House Speaker Daniel Perez said Thursday the chamber will try again next year to pass a repeal of the “free kill” statute following Gov. Ron DeSantis’ veto of the proposal.
DeSantis on May 29 vetoed the Legislature’s attempt to remove the bar on parents of adult children and the adult children of single parents from suing hospitals and physicians for non-economic damages for the deaths of loved ones. The governor said repealing “free kill” would increase health care costs for Floridians and make it harder to keep physicians in the state.
“Of course, the governor has in his right the power to veto this bill, and he chose to do so,” Perez told reporters. “I disagree with the veto, and we will be bringing that bill back next year for a continued conversation.”
Lawmakers passed HB 6017 with bipartisan support. Repealing the ban on suits to recover non-economic damages is one of the perennial arguments in Tallahassee, as business interests and medical groups oppose the move.
Perez said he remains opposed to placing caps on the pain-and-suffering damages, which is something that DeSantis said could make him support the repeal in the future, along with caps on attorneys’ fees. The family members barred from suing for pain-and-suffering damages can recover economic damages, such as lost wages, medical bills, and funeral costs.
“I don’t think that we should determine how much a person’s life is worth when someone negligently ended it,” Perez said.
The Senate also rejected a bid to cap the damages at $1 million on April 30. Florida, for now, remains the only state banning the recovery of pain-and-suffering damages for parents of adult children and adult children of single parents.

The family members barred from suing for pain-and-suffering damages can recover economic damages, such as lost wages, medical bills, and funeral costs.
“I don’t think that we should determine how much a person’s life is worth when someone negligently ended it,” Perez said.
The Senate also rejected a bid to cap the damages at $1 million on April 30. Florida, for now, remains the only state banning the recovery of pain-and-suffering damages for parents of adult children and adult children of single parents.
Disappointing decision
Florida Justice Association President Todd Michaels said the decision to not override the governor’s veto is disappointing, noting that 93% of the Legislature voted for the bill.
“The Governor’s veto and call for caps in all medical malpractice cases fails to consider victims and instead gives us the green light to negligent medical providers and limits their accountability when they hurt or kill other people. The safety of all Floridians will suffer,” he said in a prepared statement. ” The continuation of this unjust law in Florida means insurance companies’ discriminatory practice to ensure that victims are unable to achieve justice or accountability when a bad doctor kills their parents or child. It  means that a lack of accountability, and therefore a lack of safety, continue.”

Lawmakers appropriated $312 million to purchase the facility from The GEO Group.
The state expects to take over the facility July 25.
The Board of Corrections must approve it.
“This move not only strengthens our public safety infrastructure, but also reflects our commitment to better outcomes for staff, inmates and the people of Oklahoma,” said Steven Harpe, Oklahoma Department of Corrections director, in a statement.
Built in 1998, the facility houses about 2,100 Oklahoma offenders, said Kay Thompson, a Department of Corrections spokeswoman.
The facility has medium security beds and a protective custody unit, she said.
The purchase price includes 560 acres, the buildings and equipment, Thompson said.
Current Lawton Correctional Facility employees will be offered employment after the successful completion of a background and drug test, Thompson said.
Some lawmakers were critical of the decision to purchase the prison, saying they were not told about it until the last minute.
Oklahoma used to rely on private prisons in Texas to house offenders before companies began building in Oklahoma.

,DC,2025-06-05 15:15:03+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump opens investigation into Biden autopen use,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-opens-investigation-biden-autopen-use,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump late Wednesday ordered the White House legal counsel and U.S. attorney general to investigate when Biden administration staff used an autopen to sign the former president’s name on official documents, alleging that Biden might not have known or approved of their actions.The inquiry represents an escalation in Trump’s animosity toward and legal action against former President Joe Biden, who vehemently denies the allegations that he didn’t know what executive orders or pardons were signed during his term.Trump has repeatedly suggested that Biden wasn’t fully cognizant during the end of his administration. Similar concerns were reported on by dozens of news organizations following Biden’s answers and behavior during a debate in June 2024.Biden’s apparent confusion during some of the debate raised alarm bells among fellow Democrats and eventually led him to withdraw from his reelection campaign, later endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris.Trump’s memorandum alleges “Biden's aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline and assert Article II authority.“This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history. The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden's signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.” The memo stated that if Biden staff used an autopen, a mechanical device that mimics a person’s signature, “to conceal this incapacity, while taking radical executive actions all in his name, that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions undertaken in Biden's name.”Trump said Thursday during an appearance in the Oval Office that he hadn’t discovered any evidence that Biden aides violated the law.“No, but I've uncovered the human mind,” Trump said. “I was in a debate with the human mind and I didn't think he knew what the hell he was doing. So it's one of those things, one of those problems. We can't ever allow that to happen to our country.”  Biden released a written statement rejecting the claims Trump laid out in the memo, arguing the investigation “is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid and raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.”“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations,” Biden wrote. “Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.""",,,,2025-06-05 14:12:26.966485

The utility, which provides electricity to most of Nevada, is asking state regulators to approve a revenue increase of $215.7 million that could hike  rates by 9% in Southern Nevada. It’s also asking to increase shareholder return on equity from 9.5% to 10.25%; level the playing field between rooftop solar and conventional ratepayers; and save low-income Southern Nevadans about $20 a month by eliminating their basic service charge.
“NV Energy is acting like it’s so benevolent,” Las Vegan Angel DeFazio told the Current of the proposed elimination of the service charge for customers earning less than 150% of the federal poverty level. “They’re not the good guys. They’re passing it on to us. They’re just redistributing the cost.” 
But representatives of charitable groups and veterans organizations that receive grants from NV Energy voiced support for the rate hike, as did the Asian Chamber of Commerce and Latin Chamber of Commerce. 
“My business community relies on energy, relies on being able to open their doors and conduct business. That takes an investment. That takes reliability. That is NV Energy,” said Peter Guzman, president of the Latin Chamber of Commerce. 
Guzman said he was not asked by NV Energy to speak on its behalf. The utility’s spokesperson did not respond when asked if NV Energy solicited support from the organizations. 
Longtime gaming executive and former acting UNLV president Don Snyder, who is currently chairman of the United Way Board of Directors, defended the utility’s bid to raise rates. Snyder said the non-profit touches one in four Nevadans through a variety of services. 
“We are uniquely positioned to understand the needs of our community, particularly our low income individuals and families,” Snyder told PUC Commissioner Tammy Cordova, who is presiding over NV Energy’s rate hike request. Snyder added United Way has a “longstanding partnership” with NV Energy, its employees,  and its foundation, which “provides financial grants supporting utility assistance for our low income senior citizens.” 
Others contend now is no time to raise the cost of electricity. 
Dr. Mary House, co-founder of Caring, Helping & Restoring Lives (CHR), urged the commission to hold NV Energy accountable for energy policies that she says disproportionately affect low-income individuals and families.
“They’re sacrificing necessary medicines just to pay their bills. They’re limiting how much they spend on groceries just to pay their bills,” House said, adding many of the families her organization serves pay a disproportionate share of their income toward electricity. 
House added that she has taken steps to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and increase energy efficiency. “But many households, the ones who I represent, don’t have the means to even make those changes.” 
House also encouraged the utility to fully refund overpayments of at least $17 million the utility assessed against some 70,000 customers in multi-family units over a 20-year span.  
Angela Hollimen moved to Las Vegas in 2018. The retiree said although she lives with family, making ends meet remains a struggle. 
“Since I moved here, I’ve noticed that everything’s been going up,” she said, adding her family has taken all the recommended steps to reduce energy costs. “Were doing what we’re supposed to do, and questioning whether we should have moved here.” 
Tracy Puckett, another retiree, said she “saved and saved” to install a $30,000 rooftop solar array on her home. NV Energy’s efforts to tweak its net metering formula will cost her and other solar customers more, extend the time it takes to recoup their investment, and deter more ratepayers from going solar. “I want my investment to mean something.”
The utility’s request to impose peak usage rates on customers drew protests from ratepayers who say the scheme penalizes working people who are not home to run appliances during hours when the system faces less demand. 
A customer using 5 kWh would pay $27 more per month, while a customer using 6 kWh would pay $38 more per month, according to data provided by Advanced Energy United, a trade group that represents renewable energy providers. 
Total usage during the monthly billing period would be irrelevant.
Should the PUC turn down the proposal for a peak demand rate, NV Energy wants to increase the basic service charge in Southern Nevada from $18.50 to $24, far less than the projected increase of maximum demand charges. 
The proposed changes “reflect the company and its shareholders’ best interests and not its customers’,” Julia Hubbard of Solar United Neighbors (SUN), an organization dedicated to educating ratepayers, said at the consumer session. “When someone goes solar, they are not just saving on future utility bills. They are adding infrastructure to the grid on their dime.”
“This proposal doesn’t account for their recent mismanagement of customer classifications, resulting in millions of dollars in overcharges, or lack of real progress on their transportation electrification plan and their community solar program,” Hubbard said, adding the utility, charged with constructing 120 electric vehicle charging stations, has completed 40. 
Hubbard said NV Energy’s plan to change the way it calculates net metering by calculating excess energy returned to the grid every 15 minutes rather than monthly, would reduce the value of rooftop solar and disincentivize investment in “a powerful tool that Nevada residents can use to lighten their energy burden while contributing to statewide goals.” 
The change is expected to increase monthly bills for rooftop solar customers by about $11 a month, and would affect customers who apply for net metering after Oct. 1 of this year. 
The move would delay return on investment for homeowners who install rooftop solar in the future, Hubbard said. 
“People are struggling to pay their energy bills,” she said. “This is not the time to raise rates.” 
The PUC will hold hearings on NV Energy’s rate hike request in September. If approved, the changes would go into effect in April 2026.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/D4983C29-B5B1-4344-BDEC-BCAF52B32D8C-1024x589.png,,,2025-06-05 11:08:15.310363

The library relies on the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) for about half of its annual funding.
The money helps pay for things like interlibrary loans, professional development for librarians across South Dakota, summer reading program support and public access to paid educational databases.
Access to that funding was called into question twice over the last six months. First, Former Gov. Kristi Noem released a budget plan that slashed state funding for the library to a level too low to meet the federal match necessary to secure IMLS funding.
State lawmakers returned enough money to the library in their final budget in March to maintain access to the grants, but an executive order to gut IMLS from President Trump threw the South Dakota State Library’s future into question again.

Money for the grants is congressionally appropriated, but advocates worried that IMLS staff cuts caused by the Trump order would make it impossible for the federal agency to process grant applications.
In the face of that uncertainty, the State Library announced a suspension of the courier service that delivers books from library to library through interlibrary loans. Without a courier service, local libraries would’ve needed to mail materials ordered through interlibrary loan.
State Librarian George Seamon got good news in late spring. He told the South Dakota Library Board of a notice from IMLS on the state’s federal grant on April 24.
It was to be the board’s last meeting. Lawmakers dissolved the citizen-led advisory group and cut three positions from the State Library as part of the compromise deal to save it. Seamon told the board during the April meeting that the departing employees had new jobs.
He also said the state had received half its IMLS money, and that securing the other half was contingent on answers to some follow-up questions from IMLS on how the dollars would be spent.
Nancy Van Der Weide, spokeswoman for the state Department of Education, confirmed this week that the remainder of federal funding has now been secured. The state library is an arm of the state Department of Education.
The interlibrary loan courier service will resume June 1, she wrote in an email to South Dakota Searchlight.
The future of funding on the federal side beyond this year is unclear, however. Congress appropriates IMLS funding in periodic increments, most recently in 2018. Congress faces a choice of whether to re-up IMLS funding beyond 2025.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-05 14:56:11+00:00,CT Mirror,"Despite key bills’ passage, legislative session ends on sour note",Ginny Monk and Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/05/ct-legislative-session-ends/,"A number of bills passed in the waning hours of CT's 2025 legislative session, but many more died, and there were a few twists along the way.","Although the General Assembly closed out the session with hugs, cheers and applause, it was tinged with a sour note after a dispute among Democrats over a few lines in the state budget that allow the state to take financial oversight of Ansonia.
Republicans, displeased that the lines targeting Ansonia had been included in the budget, moved to undo them by amending an unrelated bill.
Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, voted alongside Republicans, and the amendment passed with Ritter’s support, 80-70.
But victory was fleeting. The move prompted a filibuster from one Democrat on the newly amended bill, a rare move from the majority party. 
Rep. Kara Rochelle, D-Ansonia, who was in favor of the state takeover, made clear that she planning to kill the amended bill by speaking until the midnight adjournment.
The tactic worked — legislators moved on, and the bill died without a vote.
The budget provision was an unwelcome surprise to the city’s Republican mayor, David Cassetti.
Rochelle has been a critic of Cassetti and his management of the city. The pair long have feuded.
“She brought a personal gripe to Hartford. She’s entitled to have that gripe, but I think she shouldn’t have used the process to try to get even with her mayor,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. 
Candelora called the surprise effort to force state oversight on Ansonia “the most egregious abuse that I’ve ever seen in this building.”
Ritter said he regretted the inclusion of the Ansonia language in the budget: It should have been a separate bill subjected to a public hearing, and the unsuccessful 11th-hour fight to strip it took up time that could have been used to pass other bills.
Ritter said he voted with Republicans to uphold his end of a deal to pass other bills important to his caucus. 
“Culture’s important,” Ritter said.
Rochelle offered no regrets.
“I encourage everyone to look at what’s happening with the finances of Ansonia,” she said. “That’s all I’m going to say tonight.”
Despite the Ansonia disruption, the House and Senate passed most of the day Wednesday easily, with most of the priority legislation they planned to move forward this session already approved. They spent hours debating the bonding bill, which passed the Senate in the afternoon. The Senate also gave the final nod of approval to a climate change bill.
Other than those, the day passed with mostly smaller bills. Lawmakers slowed down in the late hours. Less than an hour before midnight, the House was waiting for the Senate to send bills downstairs and announced Little League wins in their districts, teenagers getting driver’s licenses and interns’ future plans.

The Senate then passed dozens of bills in the last few minutes of the night on a consent calendar.
In the last few weeks of the six-month session, lawmakers have passed an omnibus housing bill, legislation to cut down on energy costs, a bill to improve early child care and education and reforms to Connecticut’s special education cost sharing system.
After weeks of negotiations with Gov. Ned Lamont’s office that included a since-rejected proposal to draft a one-year budget for the first time since the 1990s, lawmakers passed the biennial budget Tuesday.
Democratic leadership told members they were happy with the work accomplished this session.
“I think that we have a strong record of achievement in this session, but there is more work to do. This is an extraordinary year,” said Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney, D-New Haven, in his closing remarks.

Still, thousands of bills died after committee passage. Democrats have already hinted at topics they’d like to work on again when the Connecticut General Assembly is next scheduled to convene in February. Looney said first on his list is a bill that expands services for children’s behavioral health.
The possibility of a special session remains, depending on the federal budget from Washington. If federal funds to Connecticut are cut, particularly for human services and health care, lawmakers may have to gather to adjust the budget. Looney told members it seemed likely he’d see them again in a few months for those adjustments.
Lamont has a few weeks to sign bills into law and is expected to veto at least one — a bill that would offer benefits to striking workers. He’s already signed several bills into law.
The governor visited the House of Representatives and Senate just before 9 p.m. Wednesday to chat with lawmakers and received a standing ovation. He told members of the media afterward that he was ultimately happy with how the budget negotiations turned out.

“Look what we did on child care,” Lamont said outside the House chambers. “Look what we did on special ed. Look at the investments we made that’ll make a big difference for our towns and cities for years to come.”
Drama in the Senate chambers
On the third floor, Lamont walked into a drama over whether the Senate would call a vote on a bill sought by Republicans and opposed by the building trades and the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
The measure, House Bill 7004, is intended to give Plainfield, a small town in eastern Connecticut, the ability to hold a referendum over a proposed trash-to-energy plant. 
A negative referendum vote would not kill plan, but it would be a factor that the state Siting Council must consider, said Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton.
Business in the Senate stopped Wednesday night while legislators talked over whether the bill would get a vote, as demanded by the Senate Republican minority. Without a vote, the GOP threatened to halt business by filibuster.
“This is a top Republican priority,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield.
The House passed the bill on a 104-43 vote at 12:06 a.m. Tuesday. Most of the no votes were cast by Democrats.
The bill’s impact would be broader than Plainfield: It would expand the number of so-called “environmental justice”  communities able to hold referenda by raising the population threshold from 10,000 to 16,000.
Environmental justice communities are any U.S. census block for which at least 30% of the population consists of low-income people who have an income below 200% of the federal poverty level.

Labor lobbyists were fuming at the prospect of the Democratic majority calling the bill for a vote as part of a last-night deal to smooth business. At that moment, Lamont arrived and was immediately confronted by Jennifer Berrigan of the Connecticut AFL-CIO.
“She was not talking about the other bill that she cares deeply about,” Lamont said after their conversation.
“The other bill” is the measure that would provide jobless benefits to strikers, and the AFL-CIO is already angry at Lamont over his pledge to veto it. 
Berrigan spoke animatedly to the governor, her words inaudible to onlookers. 
Lamont said the topic Wednesday night was HB 7004, the siting bill. He was not familiar with its details and looked to Matt Brokman, his chief of staff.
“I think it’s not a bill you really like,” Brokman said, telling the governor it could hamper the ability to site necessary projects in Connecticut.
Lamont said his night-time stroll was meant to be purely social.
“I think I did this last time, to just go around, say, ‘Hi, thank you for a good session. Good working with you. Now get out of here,’” he said.
The Senate passed the bill at 11:15 p.m. on a 25-11 vote, with every Republican in support.

No charter school change
For years, some education lawmakers have tried to back-pedal on a decade-long standing piece of legislation that made it more difficult for charter schools to open in the state.
An effort to change it came up empty again this year.
Prior to 2015, a charter school could begin recruiting students and building its campus as soon as it received approval from the state Board of Education. That year, however, a bill changed the process into a two-tier approval system, where the state Board of Education grants “initial” approval and a charter school can only open in Connecticut after receiving funding approved by lawmakers.
Senate Bill 1439 proposed to “include funding for new charters granted by the State Board of Education in the Governor’s annual budget, revise the process by which charters are granted for state charter schools, include charter school students in a town’s resident student count for purposes of education cost sharing grant calculations, and require a biennial report regarding charter schools to be submitted to the General Assembly,” according to language in the bill.
It had passed out of the Education Committee 30-14 and 37-17 in the Appropriations Committee but was never taken up by the House or Senate.
Scholarship opportunities 
Several bills that expanded scholarship opportunities merged into the budget this year, including for students who qualify for the Roberta B. Willis grant and for students looking to become educators.
The budget allotted $6 million in each of the next two fiscal years for aspiring educators. The scholarship was proposed this year to expand from offering up to $10,000 annually to graduates from priority school districts, or the top 10 lowest performing districts in the state, to anyone who’s underrepresented in the teaching profession and willing to become an educator in a shortage area.

Child Advocate
The House and Senate have also approved a bill that would change the reappointment process for the state’s Child Advocate, a position that has subpoena power to investigate all matters related to children in the state, including child welfare and unexpected deaths. 
If Lamont signs the bill, the Child Advocate will be selected for a term of five years instead of four. The bill also requires the Office of the Child Advocate’s advisory committee to evaluate the advocate’s performance and recommend whether they should be reappointed or not.
Earlier in the session, lawmakers had considered a significantly different version of the bill which would have taken the selection process away from the governor altogether. At the time, proponents said that facing appointment and reappointment by the executive puts the advocate in a delicate position in which they are serving as a watchdog for the executive branch while also reliant on its favor for their position. 
But after pushback from Lamont, that provision of the bill was stripped out, and the new legislation allows the governor to retain the power to appoint the position. Lawmakers have called the new bill a compromise, since it would create public-facing information about the effectiveness of the advocate’s performance, making any future decision to decline reappointment of an effective advocate more transparent.
Omnibus education bill fails
The legislature’s omnibus education bill, House Bill 7009, which included dozens of provisions from establishing a state seal of civics education, requiring school boards to annually adopt policies limiting smart-devices, changing kindergarten waiver requirements, and more, was never taken up by the Senate.
The bill passed the House on a 128-20 vote in early May and was noteworthy for what it did not address: a recent report by the Office of the Child Advocate concluding that Connecticut is one of a dozen states with “no meaningful regulation of homeschooling.”
Nonprofits and inflation rates
For years, nonprofits that contract with the state have struggled to pay bills and employees, and wages have been stagnant. To that end, Senate Bill 1358, which passed through both the House and Senate, would tie increases in wages and Medicaid rates to inflation. 
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chair of the Appropriations Committee, said the bill was long in the making.
“The concept of the bill itself is very important,” Osten said. “It is not a new concept, by the way — we use this for nursing homes and residential care facilities right now, so this is continuing that concept so that the nonprofit providers can be set up to have a standard increase in their funding, based on the consumer price index each year.”
Gian-Carl Casa, the president of the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance, said nonprofits have been struggling for a long time with stagnant employee wages and with the rising costs of health insurance, energy and rent. 
But when those organizations are pinched, they are unable to improve wages. After inflation, that effectively results in a pay cut for workers. “Many nonprofits now provide food panties for their employees because they have been so poorly paid.”
Green crabs
On Tuesday, Lamont signed into law a bill that allows Connecticut restaurants to serve green crabs, one of the state’s most invasive species. 
House Bill 6222 passed the House and Senate in May and allows restaurants to serve other “bait” species as well, without gaining a license from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. 
Restaurateurs said in public testimony that they benefit from the new law, citing the high culinary value of green crabs. 
On a similar note, the bill authorizes the Department of Agriculture to study lowering the minimum harvest size for oysters to smaller than 3 inches, the current standard. Bill proponents cited consumer demand for smaller oyster sizes, whereas opponents of the bill — oyster industry members — said that the current standard of harvest size preserves the health of Long Island Sound’s species. 
The new law demonstrates, among other things, the prevalence of industry and consumer demands versus environmental concerns in Connecticut’s aquaculture.

Earned wage access regulations loosened
As inflation, economic uncertainty and Connecticut’s high cost of living continue to strain wallets, legislators approved Senate Bill 1396, a bill that makes it easier for workers to receive pay advances for hours worked before their official pay day.Under the bill, which originated in the Banking Committee and was later amended by the Senate, so-called “earned wage access” payments will now be exempt from certain portions of the state’s small loans law, relaxing previous regulations that went into effect last year. The measure limits how much borrowers can request to less than $750, prevents them from requesting more than what they will actually earn in a pay period, and caps any related finance charges at $4 per transaction, or a maximum of $30 per month. The bill also restricts third-party earned wage access providers from pursuing people who fall behind on repayment. Supporters said the changes protect workers and will make it easier for them to access money when they need it by requesting part of their paycheck early. But consumer protection groups criticized the measure, arguing that because earned access wages are expected to be paid back so quickly, typically by their next check, already cash-strapped borrowers could end up in trouble. The bill passed unanimously out of the Banking Committee and received a 35-13 vote in appropriations before clearing the Senate 32-3. But the measure sparked debate and significant questions before Wednesday’s 101-46 vote in the House, where dissenting lawmakers argued it did not do enough to protect users from high interest fees and finance charges that could trap vulnerable workers in a spiral of debt. “I know what happens to our low-income folks, our folks that don’t really know how to navigate the financial system,” said Rep. David Rutigliano, R-Trumbull, who compared the practice to a payday loan and described it as “predatory.” Earned wage access regulations have been a focus of several state legislatures in 2025, with lawmakers in Maryland, Arkansas and Utah passing new measures guiding how providers should operate. Banking Committee co-chair Rep. Jason Doucette, D- Manchester, argued that SB 1396 is the best version of the regulation to date. “This bill will end up being, believe it or not, the strongest consumer protection bill for this product in the country,” he said.

Better prison meals, reporting on strip searches and more power for the Correction Ombuds 
An omnibus bill put forward by the state Department of Correction was mostly folded into the state budget. The provisions include a ban on nutraloaf — a solid “loaf” made of a mix of different foods that is sometimes used as a form of punishment — and a requirement for “palatable” meals, a study on the possibility of relocating the Bridgeport and New Haven Correctional Centers, a protocol for documenting inmate assaults on correction officers, a plan to improve retention and recruitment, and reporting on strip searches.
Removed from the bill was a mandate to release a report on medical malpractice cases that took place under the care of the Department of Correction, as well as approximately $11.6 million that would have gone to educational and vocational programming. The bill also does not include a reference to a pilot program for two body scanners, although Ritter said at a Wednesday press conference that the funds for the scanners was included in the budget. 
A bill that would give more power to the correction ombuds, including the ability to subpoena witnesses and to conduct unannounced visits to correctional facilities, passed the House of Representatives four hours before the close of the legislative session. It had previously passed the Senate 36-0.
The bill extended the term of the ombuds from two to four years. It also requires a correction officer who sees a fellow officer engage in an inappropriate use of force to report that colleague to the warden, who must then report it to the commissioner of the Department of Correction and the state police, and it requires the department to instate body cameras for correction officers in the facilities.  
Modifications to hate crimes laws
After a lengthy and highly technical debate, the House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday revising the state’s laws on hate crimes. 
The original bill came out of the work of Lamont’s Hate Crimes Advisory Council, which was convened in 2021. Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said Tuesday that the purpose was to consolidate Connecticut’s hate crimes laws, which are “scattered,” “inconsistent” and “difficult for police officers and prosecutors to charge,” into one place. 
The bill will move all the current statutes that pertain to hate crimes into one section, increases penalties for criminal acts that are found to have been motivated by bias against a protected group, and extends the power of the Attorney General’s office to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. 
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, protested Tuesday against an amendment to the bill that removed an earlier provision that would have required someone who committed a murder that was also classified as a hate crime to serve life without parole. 
“When somebody kills someone — I don’t care how old you are — and you kill a Black person not because they were trying to do something, but merely because they were Black, that’s a different kind of evil,” said Fishbein. 
Stafstrom said they did not want to take away discretion from judges, particularly if a hate crime was committed by a young person. He also said nothing prohibited a judge from imposing a sentence of life without parole. 
“A 19-year-old kid, even a 19-year-old kid who commits a hate crime might — might — be a different person when they reach the age of 50 or 55 or 60, and we should at least allow that 19-year-old kid the opportunity to make their case at the Board of Pardons and Paroles,” said Stafstrom.  
The amendment passed 102-46. 
Fishbein offered an amendment that would have included law enforcement as a protected class, along with race, gender, sexual orientation, age and other characteristics. The House opted to pause the debate and resume it the next day, when Fishbein withdrew the proposal. 
The House passed an amended version of the bill unanimously on Wednesday.

Roaming dogs debated but run out of time
Late in the evening, House lawmakers spent about half an hour debating whether to increase penalties on the owners of roaming dogs — only to give up before the clock struck midnight.
The penalty for anyone whose dog is caught wandering on private lands or a public highway is currently a fine that would increase to $350 under Senate Bill 1446, with even greater penalties for subsequent offenses. In addition to the state ban, many towns have their own leash laws.
After introducing the bill, state Rep. Jack Fazzino, D-Meriden, faced questions from Republicans who said they were concerned that owners could be penalized for simple mistakes. 
“I could see dogs getting loose a couple of time on the owner,” said state Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott. “They’re excited, they’ve got the zoomies, they take off, I can certainly see it happening.” 
While Fazzino said that the bill was intended to deal with dogs that are habitually allowed to roam free, Rojas afforded to “throw him a bone” after several rounds of questions and pass over the bill, sending into the scrap heap of the legislative session.
Mobile home bill
A bill that would have offered more protections for mobile home residents died Wednesday night after passing the House earlier in the week.
House Bill 5428 would have required park owners to disclose any ancillary fees, such as extra costs to own a pet or have a washer and dryer, ahead of time, and increase relocation payments for residents from $10,000 to $20,000 if the owner sells the park with the intent to turn it into something else, among other measures.
It would also have required that park owners test the power of fire hydrants on their properties and report the results to fire marshals, a measure added in the wake of two fires at parks in East Hartford that were difficult to control because the hydrants didn’t have enough water pressure.
The bill passed the House after being stripped of proposals to implement caps on land rents and ancillary fees but wasn’t called in the Senate.
Prescription drug prices
The Senate on Wednesday gave final passage to a bill that aims to reduce the cost of prescription drugs for Connecticut residents and increase transparency of the pharmaceutical industry.
The proposal requires state-regulated insurance plans to count certain out-of-pocket drug costs toward an enrollee’s deductible, even if someone goes outside of their insurance plan to buy medication, if they find a cheaper price. The change is meant to ensure that purchases from companies like GoodRX, which offer drug coupons for discounts on medications, can still count toward a deductible.
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, said the measure would “get people savings right there at the pharmacy.” Gilchrest served as co-chair of a bipartisan prescription drug task force that met over several months earlier this year to weigh possible solutions to the rising cost of medications.
The legislation also seeks to increase transparency into the practices of pharmacy benefit managers, middlemen commonly referred to as PBMs that help to manage drug benefits for health plans. The bill requires that the state Insurance Department report each year on the percentage of drug rebate dollars that insurers put toward reducing premiums for policyholders.
PBMs arose to help health plans negotiate with drug companies and save money on prescriptions but have come under fire over the last year for driving up costs for people and health plans to reap bigger profits for themselves. Gilchrest called it “vitally important” to bring transparency to the inner workings of PBMs.
The bill also allows state agencies to opt into a bulk drug purchasing program and requires the state to petition the federal government to authorize the production of generic GLP-1s.
The measure drew wide support in both chambers, passing with a vote of 142-5 in the House, and 32-4 in the Senate.

Final Actions
In the frantic final stretch, the Senate added more than 30 bills and resolutions to a consent calendar that they passed with less than 10 minutes to spare. Among the items was Senate Bill 1558, which would create a new tax credit for anyone who challenges another state for taxing them on income earned while in Connecticut. 
The idea is one that stretches back to February 2024, when Gov. Ned Lamont announced that he wanted to create an incentive to encourage someone to sue New York — where tens of thousands of Connecticut residents commute ​​— over the taxes on wages they earned working from home. 
After a year of waiting, lawmakers and members of Lamont’s administration decided to re-up their offer. 
“This is a critical emerging policy issue as telework arrangements have become increasingly common since the pandemic,” Jeffrey Beckham, the secretary Office of Policy and Management, said in testimony in support of the bill. “Many of these workers would receive favorable tax treatment if their income were sourced to Connecticut, and our position is that our state is the correct tax jurisdiction for our citizens when telecommuting from their home.”
After passing their consent calendar, the Senate voted on the very last bill of the session, House Bill 7192, implementing recommendations of the state’s bipartisan drug task force. The roll call was taken at 11:58 p.m.

(Provided)As torrential rains inundated Kentucky in April, Union County Judge-Executive Adam O’Nan needed labor to fill and distribute sandbags to protect homes and businesses from flooding.
  With a phone call, local students from the Earle C. Clements Job Corps center stepped up to the task. 
“They loaded those bags for them and were a tremendous help,” O’Nan said.
Now the hundreds of students and employees at the center in Union County will be scattering to uncertain futures after the Trump administration on May 29  announced that it would “pause” Job Corps operations across the country. 
O’Nan, a Republican, said that would be a loss for his county.
“It really is difficult to measure the value because we’re just so used to them being around, and not that we take them for granted, but they’re just part of us,” O’Nan said.  “If, in fact, this is the end of Job Corps, that’s just going to be a big void for us.” 
The abrupt halt would be an even bigger loss for the center’s mostly low-income students who are feeling panic, anger and desperation about their futures, said Jonathan Brown, the finance and administration director for the Clements center in Union County. 
“Either they have nowhere to go — they’re homeless or house insecure, they don’t have safe places to go — or they’re just not done with their trade,” Brown said. “I couldn’t imagine going to college for two years, halfway done, and then my school closes and loses its accreditation and none of my classes count.” 
Brown said the contracts to run the center, including contracts for employees, are being cancelled with a deadline of June 30 to have students returned to their home states. Guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor states the department will cover the cost to send students back to their home states by the end of the month and connect them with other job training and educational opportunities.
The Jobs Corps center in the county seat of Morganfield is one of dozens across the country — including two others in Kentucky in Floyd and Muhlenberg counties —  funded by the federal government that have offered young people free training in a wide variety of career paths including culinary arts, welding, nursing, electrical work, diesel mechanics and more. 
Brown said the center is the second largest in the country in terms of students served. He said the center is contracted to serve over 1000 students, bringing in usually about 30-40 new students each week. He said about 275 employees serve those students. 
Created 61 years ago as a part of President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty, Job Corps enrolls people between the ages of 16 and  24 who are dealing with challenges such as poverty, homelessness, a disability or falling behind on reading and writing skills. 
In announcing the “pause,” the Trump administration cited data from 2023 that it argues shows cost overruns and low graduation rates.
But Brown, the Job Corps administrator in Union County, argues the April report from the Trump administration is largely misleading, cherry-picking data from 2023 when centers were still rebounding from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Brown also thinks the “pause” of operations is essentially a closure.
‘A failed experiment’
Brown said the headwinds for his center began to pick up months ago with various positions and departments being cut, but he became particularly troubled with the center’s situation when enrollment of new students was halted in March. 
He said the Department of Labor stopped doing background checks for new students, essentially stopping the center from bringing in new students. 
Then in April, the department issued a report looking at graduation rates and the cost to graduate students from each center, stating that the average cost for each student at a center was a little over $80,000 and the average graduation rate from the centers was 38.6%. 
In early May, the Trump administration sent a budget request to Congress that eliminated funding for the Job Corps, calling it “a failed experiment to help America’s youth.” In testimony before Congress on May 15, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer told lawmakers the president’s budget request signaled a need to “refocus” on “where those dollars are going to have the outcome for the workforce.” 
On May 29, Chavez-DeRemer announced the “pause” of Job Corps center operations, citing the report from April as evidence of the ineffectiveness of the Job Corps programs. 
“Job Corps was created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life through education, training, and community,” Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement provided in a press release. “However, a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve. We remain committed to ensuring all participants are supported through this transition and connected with the resources they need to succeed as we evaluate the program’s possibilities.” 
In Union County, Brown acknowledges there are “inefficiencies” within Job Corps and that some centers perform better than others. But given the United States is the “richest country in the history of the world,” he questioned why the federal government couldn’t provide “this small amount to give people that second chance.” 
An information sheet provided to the Lantern from the director of the Earle C. Clements center asserts the average graduation rate for Job Corps centers is higher than the average graduation rate for two-year community and technical colleges. The information sheet also asserts the average cost per student is lower, and comparable to community and technical colleges, when Job Corps enrollees who don’t ultimately graduate are taken into account.
 The April report released by the Trump administration says the Earle C. Clements center has a graduation rate of 47% and a cost per enrollee of $67,713 in 2023, both figures better than the national average in the report. 
Job Corps’ operations cost roughly $1.53 billion in fiscal year 2024, making up a small fraction of the $6.75 trillion of federal government spending that fiscal year.
“I wish it was a more nuanced look at how to make the program better to meet that national need to provide skilled labor while also serving disadvantaged youth,” said Brown.
A Department of Labor spokesperson did not respond to several emails requesting comment about criticisms of its April report. 
Finding meaning in helping students
Amanda Moore, the manager of Amanda’s Floral and Gift Shop in Sturgis, said the loss of Job Corps in Union County  “is really going to impact our whole community.” 
Her relatively new business hosted two paid internships with Job Corps students, one of whom worked on revamping the store’s website. 
“It kind of gives those kids a chance to get out into the real world without some of the struggles that they have at home,” Moore said. “Getting away from where they are and coming to the Job Corps Center and having a chance at life.” 
Job Corps students also put together a “wonderful meal,” she said, for a local gathering called “Derby Days” celebrating the running of the Kentucky Derby. 
“All the Derby favorites: They made a virgin mint julep, all the cucumber sandwiches that you could eat,” Moore said. “They put their heart and soul into all of that, and that was a big deal downtown here in Sturgis.” 
Brown, the finance and administration director for the local center, said the backgrounds of students can vary depending on what circumstances qualify them to enroll. It’s not uncommon for students to show up with only a garbage bag of “old, dirty clothes.” 
Finding meaning in helping those students is what has kept Brown, a Union County native, working at the center for 11 years, starting as a career counselor for students. He’s loved the work since “day one.” 
“My whole job was about the student, whatever they needed to get through the program, get their credentials, get their high school diploma, get a good job,” Brown said. “It’s stressful and it’s hard, but it’s meaningful. And you can see it every single day — the meaning.” 
He believes Job Corps is unique from other educational opportunities because it provides young people a safe place, free of charge, to sleep, have regular meals and work on a career away from the challenges they left behind. To make sure these young people, he said, don’t fall through the cracks. 
“I don’t know what a lot of this population will do. I don’t know what options they really have,” Brown said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2356-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-05 11:08:15.310363

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)It’s been more than 30 days since a hearing in a conflict over the language of a proposed 2026 reproductive rights ballot initiative, but with no decision yet from the Idaho Supreme Court, the group leading the push to restore abortion access in Idaho says the delay is hurting their organizing efforts.
Idahoans United for Women and Families launched its citizen-led initiative effort in April 2024 and submitted proposed ballot titles in August. A new state law also requires a fiscal impact statement to be attached to initiatives, and the group alleged Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican who has been outspoken about his anti-abortion views, and the Division of Financial Management inserted language that was prejudicial. They pointed in particular to a statement that said costs associated with the prisoner population and the Medicaid budget could occur.
Idaho Supreme Court hears arguments in abortion ballot initiative lawsuit

As part of the initiative process, the Attorney General’s Office is responsible for drafting short and long ballot titles that summarize what the legislation would do if passed. State law says the language must describe the proposal accurately and use common language without phrasing that is likely to prejudice voters. 
The complaint filed by Idahoans United with the Idaho Supreme Court in late January called the statement biased and says it includes contradictory language, “wrongly implies” that Medicaid and corrections spending would increase, and “prejudicially includes an irrelevant reference to the state’s $850 million Medicaid budget.” 
Labrador’s office did not respond to requests for comment. In court filings, Labrador did not address the fiscal impact statement component of the complaint, and only spoke to the “fetus viability” language that Idahoans United said was objectionable because it is not medical terminology. Labrador said it is common parlance and there is no difference between that language and “fetal viability.” 
In a separate court filing, officials with the Idaho Division of Financial Management did not speak to the rationale for the fiscal impact statement, but restated the language and denied that it was prejudicial to the initiative. 
 Group filed motion to expedite Idaho Supreme Court ruling in abortion initiative case

The Idaho Supreme Court heard arguments April 25, and there have been no updates since then, despite a motion to expedite. The last court battle over ballot titles was in 2023, when Reclaim Idaho said Labrador’s office also prejudiced its initiative language about changing the state primary election system.
In that case, oral arguments were held on a Monday and a decision came out that Thursday, with a unanimous vote in favor of Reclaim Idaho. Ultimately, voters overwhelmingly defeated the initiative in the November 2024 election. 
Idaho has a citizen ballot initiative process, but only its Legislature can propose constitutional amendments, unlike many other states. So instead of a constitutional amendment, the voters are asked to approve a citizen-crafted piece of legislation to be adopted. The measure requires a simple majority of voters to pass.
Idahoans United submitted a policy that would establish a fundamental right to contraception and fertility treatments under state law, including in vitro fertilization, the right to make decisions about pregnancy and childbirth, legalize abortion before fetal viability, and preserve the right to abortion after viability in medical emergencies. 
Fetal viability would be determined by a physician and what treatment is available, but the commonly accepted gestational age of viability in the medical community is 23 to 24 weeks.

The group’s spokesperson and lead organizer, Melanie Folwell, told States Newsroom that the delay has forced them to cancel a planned kickoff rally on June 14 at the Idaho Capitol. The rally is now scheduled for June 28, in hopes there will be a decision by then.
The initiative needs more than 70,000 valid signatures from districts across the state, and organizers had hoped to gather 10,000 of those in June alone. But the initiative language must be finalized and approved before any signatures can be collected, and the signature goal must be reached by April 30, 2026, to qualify for the ballot.  
“We won’t get another June. We won’t get another crack at this in the coming months, and there are some real impacts to having to pursue a lawsuit,” Folwell told States Newsroom.
The frustration is not directed at the court, Folwell said, but rather at state offices that crafted the language.
“I can’t speculate as to their intent, but in providing us with unclear titles and fiscal impact statement, we have certainly been slowed down,” she said. “It didn’t need to be this way.”  
There will also be financial effects, she said, because adding pressure to the timeline will increase the costs associated with mobilizing volunteers and canvassers to gather signatures by the deadline.
Nate Poppino, spokesperson for the Idaho Supreme Court, told States Newsroom in an email that the court does not comment on judicial deliberations, and opinions are issued at the court’s discretion.
“Sometimes the issues the court must consider resolve quickly, and sometimes they require longer discussion,” Poppino said.
Each opinion starts with one authoring justice, he said, and a draft is circulated among the other justices who can edit and weigh in before anything is finalized. That includes details like wording and the legal issues involved.
“If it’s a situation that involves a dissent, that also is examined by the full court,” he said.

When Thomas Fugate graduated from college last year with a degree in politics, he celebrated in a social media post about the exciting opportunities that lay beyond campus life in Texas. “Onward and upward!” he wrote, with an emoji of a rocket shooting into space.
His career blastoff came quickly. A year after graduation, the 22-year-old with no apparent national security expertise is now a Department of Homeland Security official overseeing the government’s main hub for terrorism prevention, including an $18 million grant program intended to help communities combat violent extremism.
The White House appointed Fugate, a former Trump campaign worker who interned at the hard-right Heritage Foundation, to a Homeland Security role that was expanded to include the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships. Known as CP3, the office has led nationwide efforts to prevent hate-fueled attacks, school shootings and other forms of targeted violence.
Fugate’s appointment is the latest shock for an office that has been decimated since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and began remaking national security to give it a laser focus on immigration.
News of the appointment has trickled out in recent weeks, raising alarm among counterterrorism researchers and nonprofit groups funded by CP3. Several said they turned to LinkedIn for intel on Fugate — an unknown in their field — and were stunned to see a photo of “a college kid” with a flag pin on his lapel posing with a sharply arched eyebrow. No threat prevention experience is listed in his employment history.
Typically, people familiar with CP3 say, a candidate that green wouldn’t have gotten an interview for a junior position, much less be hired to run operations. According to LinkedIn, the bulk of Fugate’s leadership experience comes from having served as secretary general of a Model United Nations club.
“Maybe he’s a wunderkind. Maybe he’s Doogie Howser and has everything at 21 years old, or whatever he is, to lead the office. But that’s not likely the case,” said one counterterrorism researcher who has worked with CP3 officials for years. “It sounds like putting the intern in charge.”
In the past seven weeks, at least five high-profile targeted attacks have unfolded across the U.S., including a car bombing in California and the gunning down of two Israeli Embassy aides in Washington. Against this backdrop, current and former national security officials say, the Trump administration’s decision to shift counterterrorism resources to immigration and leave the violence-prevention portfolio to inexperienced appointees is “reckless.”
“We’re entering very dangerous territory,” one longtime U.S. counterterrorism official said.
The fate of CP3 is one example of the fallout from deep cuts that have eliminated public health and violence-prevention initiatives across federal agencies.
The once-bustling office of around 80 employees now has fewer than 20, former staffers say. Grant work stops, then restarts. One senior civil servant was reassigned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency via an email that arrived late on a Saturday.
The office’s mission has changed overnight, with a pivot away from focusing on domestic extremism, especially far-right movements. The “terrorism” category that framed the agency’s work for years was abruptly expanded to include drug cartels, part of what DHS staffers call an overarching message that border security is the only mission that matters. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has largely left terrorism prevention to the states.
ProPublica sent DHS a detailed list of questions about Fugate’s position, his lack of national security experience and the future of the department’s prevention work. A senior agency official replied with a statement saying only that Fugate’s CP3 duties were added to his role as an aide in an Immigration & Border Security office.
“Due to his success, he has been temporarily given additional leadership responsibilities in the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships office,” the official wrote in an email. “This is a credit to his work ethic and success on the job.”
ProPublica sought an interview with Fugate through DHS and the White House, but there was no response.
The Trump administration rejects claims of a retreat from terrorism prevention, noting partnerships with law enforcement agencies and swift investigations of recent attacks. “The notion that this single office is responsible for preventing terrorism is not only incorrect, it’s ignorant,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an email.
Through intermediaries, ProPublica sought to speak with CP3 employees but received no reply. Talking is risky; tales abound of Homeland Security personnel undergoing lie-detector tests in leak investigations, as Secretary Kristi Noem pledged in March.
Accounts of Fugate’s arrival and the dismantling of CP3 come from current and former Homeland Security personnel, grant recipients and terrorism-prevention advocates who work closely with the office and have at times been confidants for distraught staffers. All spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the Trump administration.
In these circles, two main theories have emerged to explain Fugate’s unusual ascent. One is that the Trump administration rewarded a Gen Z campaign worker with a resume-boosting title that comes with little real power because the office is in shambles.
The other is that the White House installed Fugate to oversee a pivot away from traditional counterterrorism lanes and to steer resources toward MAGA-friendly sheriffs and border security projects before eventually shuttering operations. In this scenario, Fugate was described as “a minder” and “a babysitter.”
DHS did not address a ProPublica question about this characterization.
 Rising MAGA star
The CP3 homepage boasts about the office’s experts in disciplines including emergency management, counterterrorism, public health and social work.
Fugate brings a different qualification prized by the White House: loyalty to the president.
On Instagram, Fugate traced his political awakening to nine years ago, when as a 13-year-old “in a generation deprived of hope, opportunity, and happiness, I saw in one man the capacity for real and lasting change: Donald Trump.”
Fugate is a self-described “Trumplican” who interned for state lawmakers in Austin before graduating magna cum laude a year ago with a degree in politics and law from the University of Texas at San Antonio. Instagram photos and other public information from the past year chronicle his lightning-fast rise in Trump world.
Starting in May 2024, photos show a newly graduated Fugate at a Texas GOP gathering launching his first campaign, a bid for a delegate spot at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. He handed out gummy candy and a flier with a photo of him in a tuxedo at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. Fugate won an alternate slot.
The next month, he was in Florida celebrating Trump’s 78th birthday with the Club 47 fan group in West Palm Beach. “I truly wish I could say more about what I’m doing, but more to come soon!” he wrote in a caption, with a smiley emoji in sunglasses.
Posts in the run-up to the election show Fugate spending several weeks in Washington, a time he called “surreal and invigorating.” In July, he attended the Republican convention, sporting the Texas delegation’s signature cowboy hat in photos with MAGA luminaries such as former Cabinet Secretary Ben Carson and then-Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).
By late summer, Fugate was posting from the campaign trail as part of Trump’s advance team, pictured at one stop standing behind the candidate in a crowd of young supporters. When Trump won the election, Fugate marked the moment with an emotional post about believing in him “from the very start, even to the scorn and contempt of my peers.”
“Working alongside a dedicated, driven group of folks, we faced every challenge head-on and, together, celebrated a victorious outcome,” Fugate wrote on Instagram.
In February, the White House appointed Fugate as a “special assistant” assigned to an immigration office at Homeland Security. He assumed leadership of CP3 last month to fill a vacancy left by previous Director Bill Braniff, an Army veteran with more than two decades of national security experience who resigned in March when the administration began cutting his staff.
In his final weeks as director, Braniff had publicly defended the office’s achievements, noting the dispersal of nearly $90 million since 2020 to help communities combat extremist violence. According to the office’s 2024 report to Congress, in recent years CP3 grant money was used in more than 1,100 efforts to identify violent extremism at the community level and interrupt the radicalization process.
“CP3 is the inheritor of the primary and founding mission of DHS — to prevent terrorism,” Braniff wrote on LinkedIn when he announced his resignation.
In conversations with colleagues, CP3 staffers have expressed shock at how little Fugate knows about the basics of his role and likened meetings with him to “career counseling.” DHS did not address questions about his level of experience.
One grant recipient called Fugate’s appointment “an insult” to Braniff and a setback in the move toward evidence-based approaches to terrorism prevention, a field still reckoning with post-9/11 work that was unscientific and stigmatizing to Muslims.
“They really started to shift the conversation and shift the public thinking. It was starting to get to the root of the problem,” the grantee said. “Now that’s all gone.”
Critics of Fugate’s appointment stress that their anger isn’t directed at an aspiring politico enjoying a whirlwind entry to Washington. The problem, they say, is the administration’s seemingly cavalier treatment of an office that was funding work on urgent national security concerns.
“The big story here is the undermining of democratic institutions,” a former Homeland Security official said. “Who’s going to volunteer to be the next civil servant if they think their supervisor is an apparatchik?”
 Season of attack
Spring brought a burst of extremist violence, a trend analysts fear could extend into the summer given inflamed political tensions and the disarray of federal agencies tasked with monitoring threats.
In April, an arson attack targeted Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, who blamed the breach on “security failures.” Four days later, a mass shooter stormed onto the Florida State University campus, killing two and wounding six others. The alleged attacker had espoused white supremacist views and used Hitler as a profile picture for a gaming account.
Attacks continued in May with the apparent car bombing of a fertility clinic in California. The suspected assailant, the only fatality, left a screed detailing violent beliefs against life and procreation. A few days later, on May 21, a gunman allegedly radicalized by the war in Gaza killed two Israeli Embassy aides outside a Jewish museum in Washington.
June opened with a firebombing attack in Colorado that wounded 12, including a Holocaust survivor, at a gathering calling for the release of Israeli hostages. The suspect’s charges include a federal hate crime.
If attacks continue at that pace, warn current and former national security officials, cracks will begin to appear in the nation’s pared-down counterterrorism sector.
“If you cut the staff and there are major attacks that lead to a reconsideration, you can’t scale up staff once they’re fired,” said the U.S. counterterrorism official, who opposes the administration’s shift away from prevention.
Contradictory signals are coming out of Homeland Security about the future of CP3 work, especially the grant program. Staffers have told partners in the advocacy world that Fugate plans to roll out another funding cycle soon. The CP3 website still touts the program as the only federal grant “solely dedicated to helping local communities develop and strengthen their capabilities” against terrorism and targeted violence.
But Homeland Security’s budget proposal to Congress for the next fiscal year suggests a bleaker future. The department recommended eliminating the threat-prevention grant program, explaining that it “does not align with DHS priorities.”
The former Homeland Security official said the decision “means that the department founded to prevent terrorism in the United States no longer prioritizes preventing terrorism in the United States.”

The Delaware Division of Small Business (DSB) has awarded a new round of Encouraging Development, Growth and Expansion (EDGE) grants to 10 small businesses across the state, providing $650,000 to support a range of innovative and community-driven ventures.
Winners of the Spring 2025 EDGE grant competition were recognized during a ceremony held June 4 at Bally’s Resort in Dover. The awards were presented by DSB Director CJ Bell and Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez.
“I am incredibly excited by the diverse range of small businesses that we were able to support during this round of the EDGE competition,” said Bell. “These companies are contributing to the quality of life of Delawareans in a variety of ways. I’m proud that through this funding we are able to help elevate them to the next level.”
Launched in 2019, the EDGE program has now distributed nearly $8 million to 120 small businesses statewide. The initiative supports young Delaware businesses with fewer than 10 full-time employees through a competitive selection process, culminating in public pitch sessions to expert judges. Five businesses in STEM fields each receive up to $100,000, while five “Entrepreneur Class” businesses receive up to $50,000.
Patibanda-Sanchez emphasized the broader impact of this investment. “Small businesses enhance economic diversity in our state by helping create new industries, jobs and markets. When small businesses thrive, we all thrive,” she said.

This round’s recipients include ventures in mental health, biotechnology, menopause care, agritourism, and sustainable meat production. Several address significant public needs, from expanding therapy access in Wilmington to researching treatments for rare diseases.
The selected businesses reflect the program’s continued efforts to support historically underrepresented entrepreneurs. Since the EDGE program began, 54% of awardees have been woman-, minority-, or veteran-owned, with another 18% representing more than one of those categories.
In total, 139 businesses applied for the spring competition, matching the program’s initial 2019 turnout. Finalists presented in May at the BPG Brandywine Building in Wilmington, and 10 were selected: seven based in New Castle County, one in Kent, and two in Sussex.
Past EDGE winner Donny Legans, owner of Rail Haus in Dover, praised the program during the ceremony, describing the award as a catalyst for growth and strategic planning.
“Receiving the EDGE grant was a game changer for us,” Legans said. “It undoubtably made us a stronger business that forced us to look at our weaker areas and address them with a solid strategy.”

(Photo by Brian Venua/KMXT)Alaska school districts hiring from the Philippines are taking some of the country’s best and brightest teachers. It’s a win for Alaska kids, but what does that mean for students back in Southeast Asia? KMXT’s Brian Venua explores brain drain and brain gain in Part 5 of a five part audio series, Mabuhay sa Alaska.
When Alaska school administrators toured Pajo Elementary School, each class greeted them by welcoming them to the Philippines in both English and in Filipino. The administrators were there to see what the teachers they hire from the Philippines experience before moving to Alaska.
But the students are the other side of that story — These are kids that get left behind when Filipino teachers are hired abroad.
When recruiters opened up appointments for screening, all 720 spots were filled in just 16 minutes. The only advertising was a few posts on social media. But one consequence of hiring abroad is fewer quality teachers in the Philippines — a phenomenon known as brain drain.

Conversely, Alaska gets brain gain. Hiring teachers has largely been a success for the state’s kids. Recruiters on the 2025 trip picked some of the most highly educated teachers from the island nation. Kodiak Island Borough School District, for example, has more doctorate degrees from its 30 or so Filipino teachers than it does from its over 300 American hires.
“We were impressed with the quality of teachers that we met over there. And we were able to choose – from there – the top of the top,” said Cyndy Mika, the district’s superintendent. She said there have been more remarkable candidates than they can hire during recruiting trips.
It’s hard to say what the impact is on the Philippines, though.

Mika said that so far, a surplus of workers in the Philippines is helping address her district’s shortage.
“A lot of the teachers that we interviewed in the Philippines, when they first got their start, it was as a volunteer teacher,” she said. “They weren’t being paid because there weren’t jobs. They’re producing too many teachers.”
But Mika is concerned that taking so many highly qualified teachers could create a sort of skill ceiling there, if the country’s best teachers keep leaving for Alaska and other destinations.
That doesn’t change that her priority is the kids in the community where she works.
“My number one concern as a superintendent in Kodiak is getting the best quality teachers we can in front of our students,” she said. “If we didn’t have these Filipino teachers, who would we have?”

She said that without international hires, vacant teacher positions would lead to smaller teacher-to-student ratios and more burnout for her staff.
Remittance and returning teachers
It’s not a one-way street, though.
Many Filipinos working abroad send a lot of money home – 8% of the country’s economy, according to some reports. Their experience, professional development and cultural knowhow gained in the U.S. is valuable, too, and sometimes comes back.

Edna Auxtero is the administrator for Tagaytay Christian Academy, a private school about a two-hour drive from Manila. She said hiring Filipino teachers is a huge compliment to the country’s educational system.
“I’m so proud that they’re even interested to get Filipinos,” Auxtero said. “That’s always my dream – that the priority for employment in other countries are Filipinos.”

TCA’s principal, and many of its teachers, are alumni. Auxtero hopes some of them will go to Alaska someday and return with new skills.
“My hope is that they will come back to build the nation and impart all their knowledge, experiences to the next generation so that Philippines will rise up also,” she said.

“They can expect that for teachers under J1 visas,” said Serjoe Gutierrez, a Kodiak music teacher and one of the district’s first direct hires from the Philippines.
J1 visas require international hires to go back to their home countries after a few years. But Gutierrez, and many others, are on potential paths to permanent residency through H1B visas.

But he still thinks about kids he taught at a private school in Iloilo City.
“I do worry, sometimes,” Gutierrez said. He thought about it even before coming to Alaska. “I was thinking about it before resigning, but I told myself it’s for me. The kids, they would gain more experience – they’re still young. But I’m not getting any younger, so I need to do something for myself, too.”
Kodiak is his home now.
“I do love my country. I do love the Philippines, but I think being a teacher in Kodiak – being here in Alaska – opened a lot of opportunities for me,” he said.
He said he’s not sure he would have had the same chances to travel and play piano and violin publicly in the Philippines. He hopes to be one of the first to get a green card through the school and stay in the U.S. indefinitely.

Mike Dunleavy called a news conference on the governor’s floor of the Alaska State Capitol. The shades were drawn, and a handful of reporters lined a long conference room table, as Dunleavy spoke and took questions for over an hour, explaining his criticisms and his veto. 
In offices throughout the rest of the building, legislators on all sides of the politically contentious debate on how to fund Alaska schools, watched from behind closed doors, as well as school district leaders, news outlets, and Alaskans across the state — live, via the cameras of Gavel Alaska.

In the room, Gavel production crew Michael Penn operated a live camera broadcasting  Dunleavy, with Tulio Fontanella sitting to the governor’s right side, in a baseball cap, microphone in hand. 
During the May 19 news conference, Gavel Alaska was nearing the end of another legislative session. For nearly 30 years, Gavel has provided a free, public broadcast of the business of the state government to the rest of Alaska. A team of eight, mostly seasonal staff, operates cameras and broadcasts remotely from a ground floor production studio at KTOO Public Media, on Egan Drive along the waterfront of Juneau.
“It’s kind of the C-SPAN of Alaska,” said executive producer Will Mader, referring to the nonprofit cable TV network that has streamed the U.S. government in Washington, D.C., since 1979.
Above the chambers and committee rooms of the Alaska State Legislature, overlooking lawmakers’ debates, governors’ speeches, the prayers over floor sessions and the introductions of guests in the galleries, cameras and microphones capture the business of the State Capitol and Gavel broadcasts it live to Alaska. The team has just wrapped up covering another 120 day legislative session, with over 800 hours of live coverage broadcasting from the Capitol. 
The team of Gavel Alaska are used to dealing with technical problems, but now, they’re facing a potential new hurdle of federal cuts. Gavel’s crew finished the session at a sensitive time for public broadcasting. President Donald Trump has proposed large-scale cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides a share of funding to KTOO and public media across the country and state. 
Looking closely at Gavel Alaska gives a sense of the work that goes into giving the public access to state government. While the people in front of the cameras make the news, the people behind them rarely capture public attention. 
Behind the cameras
On a late winter morning, Mader sits in front of a wall of monitors, gearing up for a busy day covering the Alaska State Legislature, which typically runs from January to May. 
Teams of two staff monitor three or four robotic cameras in each chamber of the House and Senate, the committee rooms, and the hallways. During hearings or floor sessions, they toggle between cameras to focus on who is speaking, add captions with names and titles, feature speakers’ presentations and provide information for public comment.

Mader said the most newsworthy topics are recorded and streamed on KTOO’s statewide public affairs TV channel, KTOO 360TV. It’s also transmitted via satellite through the Alaska Rural Communications Service statewide, for those without consistent internet. “So it’s available to anyone out in rural Alaska that can view it, just with an antenna,” he said.
Though all hearings are livestreamed online, on some days there can be up to six committee meetings at a time, so Mader said that can be a challenge deciding which three to feature at once. “We always cover House and Senate floor sessions, and we almost always cover finance (committee) meetings,” he said. “The budget is always the No. 1 issue in session. So that’s one reason for covering finance, as well as that it’s the last stop for most legislation before it gets to the floor.”
The Gavel broadcast launched in 1996, first with one cameraperson moving a manually operated camera between rooms of the Capitol to cover meetings, “which isn’t ideal, because people are facing all different directions,” Mader said. 
Eventually, the Legislature started some basic webstreaming with its own cameras. Ultimately the Legislature agreed to an informal partnership with Gavel and KTOO to provide a more quality broadcast.  
“They share access to the cameras, and then they get a higher quality video feed from those cameras,” said Mikko Wilson, production manager at KTOO. 
The Gavel production at the Capitol saw a major technological upgrade in 2020, when grant funding and the purchase of new robotic cameras arrived at the same time as the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We had the quotes for the cameras. And I picked up the phone and said, ‘Ship ’em. Send us the cameras, like we need the robots now!” Wilson said, smiling. “And so that was my COVID project in 2020, pulling about 2 miles of cable and installing the 40-something-odd cameras inside.” 
At the controls are new seasonal staff, like fresh college graduates learning broadcast production, as well as veteran Alaska journalists, like longtime Juneau photojournalist Michael Penn and former TV broadcaster Bob Laurie.
In a small studio off the main production bay, Laurie wrapped up covering a committee meeting and had time to talk. “I try to really listen closely to what is being said, so that I can make sure I get the right names up, the right explainers, and kind of follow the flow of what is going on in the room. It takes a lot of focus for me,” he said.     

  Bob Laurie, former TV reporter and production technician with Gavel in the studio on February 13, 2025 (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)
 

Laurie first covered the Legislature as a young TV reporter, for a highly contentious session in 1981. 
“The leadership in the House, it took them a long time to organize…before they had their 21 votes together,” he said, to form a majority caucus. “We didn’t have the, you know, 121 day sessions, and people were dissatisfied with nothing getting through. Things were held up.”
He said he slept on someone’s floor while covering the action. “I was the first full-time television reporter from outside Juneau to cover the Legislature,” he said. “My competition followed about three days later — three days after I got on the air.”
That launched a television reporting career, then work in state government, before Laurie returned to cover the session seasonally with Gavel.
“So this is nice, clean. This is raw. All we’re doing is getting the different shots,” he said. “This is what is actually happening, so people can see their representatives at work.”
Some days Laurie is in the studio, and some days he’s in the Capitol operating a camera to cover live events, like speeches from the governor or Alaska’s U.S. senators. He said it’s an opportunity for Alaskans to watch their elected officials in action. 
“They can actually sit there and actually watch it and say, ‘Oh, that’s who I elected,’” he said. “Whether it’s good or bad. Without any editorial comment.”

Across the hall, Tulio Fontanella is covering a Senate Finance Committee hearing a report on the state’s oil revenues. He grew up in Juneau and just graduated from college with a degree in sports media. He said while there’s some comparisons to sports broadcasting, it’s much slower. 
“There will be times that you’ll stay on a wide shot, just because you don’t know who’s gonna talk next or how quickly they’ll be done talking,” he said. “There’s other people who pause a long time before they start speaking, so it’s a balancing act, getting that right.”

His partner in the booth on captions, Robbie Gabel, who also grew up in Juneau, is also in his first year of broadcast production. 
“I like when it’s a little more hectic. It’s a little slow. So it’s fun when they’re trying to get stuff in,” he said. “I like it when it’s more hectic and a lot more going on.”
The crew is on duty whenever legislators are live, so that means long hours and sometimes weekends, especially when bills are being voted on, and final budget negotiations take place at the end of May.
“It’s more complicated than someone would think,” Fontanella added. “This type of television, you know, is somewhat simplified, but also still more complicated than anyone would guess. Like Will does so much planning for what we do. And Mikko, with all the tech mishaps or whatever needs to be set up — they do a lot of work.”
Like C-SPAN, Gavel broadcasts the activities of all three branches of Alaska’s government: the Legislature; the executive, such as governor’s speeches or news conferences; and the judiciary, including oral arguments before the Alaska Supreme Court.  
At times, Gavel broadcasts emergency response updates, such as from the U.S. Coast Guard or National Weather Service; it provided updates when one of the strongest storms on record, Typhoon Merbok, hit in 2022, impacting more than 35 communities in Western Alaska.  
Gavel partners in Juneau and statewide
Gavel Alaska is an independent press outlet, but those broadcasts require close coordination with public offices around the state. 
For broadcasting the Alaska Supreme Court, that’s the court clerk’s office; for the Legislature, that’s daily coordination with the media team of the Legislative Affairs Agency, a nonpartisan support agency based in the Terry Miller Legislative Office on 6th Street behind the Capitol. 
The agency also provides webstreaming on the state’s website of all legislative floor sessions and committee meetings, for the public record, said Tim Powers, the agency’s chief technology and operations officer.

“So KTOO is going to do their high production quality for all the popular meetings, and we’re still going to create the record for everything that may not be as popular, yeah, and won’t have as high demand on television,” he said.
The agency also coordinates all call-ins for the public to comment. “You can testify on every bill in every committee in Alaska when they have public testimony, and that is not the case in other states,” he said. 
“In some other states, you have to go to the State House to testify. In some other states, you’re not allowed to testify, even if you do go to the State House, because they just don’t take it. So it’s unique, uniquely Alaskan, and I think it’s a benefit to us,” Powers said. 
Powers said typically they see an estimated 1 million minutes per year of teleconferencing. “Yeah, it’s a lot of people connected,” he said.
The Gavel livestream is watched closely by Alaska news outlets and journalists too, like Matt Acuña Buxton, who writes the political newsletter, the Alaska Memo.  
“Literally — and I mean literally — I couldn’t do my job covering the Alaska Legislature from Anchorage without Gavel Alaska’s hard work,” he said. “It’s a lot more than just a camera in a legislative hearing, and Gavel’s crews do so much behind the scenes to ensure we can see what’s going on in Juneau, whether it be news conferences or the beloved hallway cameras. 
“Their work with the broadcast during the day, which has to keep up with packed days of simultaneous hearings as well as the slow days, does a good job of balancing the big-ticket issues while also offering a wide look at things that you didn’t know needed to be on your radar.”
Federal funding under threat
KTOO receives local funding, as well as federal funding, whose future is now uncertain. 
The partnership with the state to broadcast Gavel Alaska is an informal one. “We don’t receive any state funding for actually making this happen,” said KTOO manager Justin Shoman, “So we’re really relying on these other sources.”
Since its start in 1996, the public television broadcast has been partly funded by the City and Borough of Juneau, to provide Alaskans access to the Capitol. Amid a long-running dispute on the location of Alaska’s capital, the city’s funding of the broadcast continues still today.
“Regardless of where the capital is in Alaska, it’s still inaccessible easily to a large number of people,” Mader noted. “So that’s why I think, of all the states, having this service is most crucial in Alaska.”
The Gavel Alaska staffing and production costs about $750,000 per year, Shoman said, with $455,000 funded by the city. 
The remaining roughly $295,000 is funded by a mix of sponsorships, underwriting, community donors and federal grant funding, including funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which also supports the general TV operations of KTOO. “The majority of CPB funding goes to television. That’s simply because television is more expensive to produce,” Shoman said. 
That federal funding is threatened now, as Trump has proposed steep cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
Shoman and other supporters of public broadcasting in Alaska are actively advocating, including flying to Washington, D.C., and meeting with Alaska’s congressional delegation, urging them to protect the funding. 
“For those who are concerned with the future of Gavel Alaska and that level of government, accessibility and transparency — it is reliant, in Alaska, on some federal funding, and it’s important that people know that,” Shoman said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSCF4772-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 11:08:15.310363

With $49,000 in student loan debt, Josue Villalpando figured becoming a homeowner was a long way off.

“The thought of purchasing a home was definitely floating around, however I never actually looked into it knowing that I had such a big burden with my student loans,” he said.

A recent graduate of the University of Illinois Chicago, Villalpando, 29, took out private loans to pay for college. Unlike federal student loans, private loans typically have higher interest rates and fewer forgiveness programs, making them harder for borrowers to pay off.

Then, his fiancé came across the SmartBuy program – an initiative set up by the state to help incentivize residents to purchase a home while paying off their student loan debt, one of the leading factors delaying homeownership among young adults.

SmartBuy pays up to $40,000 in student loans and contributes up to $5,000 towards a down payment or closing costs at the time of purchase.

“He showed it to me and said, ‘Hey, maybe, let’s fact check it, and let’s make sure it’s a real thing, because it’s almost too good to be true, right?’” said Villalpando, who received his degree in communication.

Records obtained by the Illinois Answers Project show that a total of 755 houses have been purchased through the program, with 482 still in process from the second round of applications.

Villalpando closed on his home in Lansing, Illinois in March.

“With my student loans being fully paid off, I know I can comfortably pay my mortgage without having to worry about financial constraints,” said Villalpando. “The SmartBuy program is what made me take the initiative.”

But the long-term viability of SmartBuy remains uncertain.

Renewal for the program is dependent on reallocation of state funding. After the first round closed in 2021, it took the state more than three years to reopen the program, which closed for the second time in February.

The uncertain timeline for program renewal raises questions about it being a viable option for tackling the staggering $63 billion in collective student loan debt the state faces.

Illinois has the seventh highest average state debt in the nation. Coupled with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, the burden of these loans become even more substantial for some borrowers, effectively delaying the purchase of a home, the decision to start a family and progress towards economic advancement.

With federal student loan programs in disarray, innovative, state-level programs like SmartBuy offer an alternative answer to combating the crisis. But federal funding, legislative approval and borrower awareness remain barriers to sustained coverage and widespread success.

Student loans are also preventing qualified applicants from pursuing professions with costly higher education requirements, like legal and medical careers.

“Tuition for undergraduate and law school has grown at something like three to five times the rate of inflation over the last 40 years,” said Bob Glaves, executive director of the Chicago Bar Foundation, which promotes equitable access to justice and legal aid in Chicago.

“We don’t have a way to measure [this], but I think everybody knows how many people, particularly from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, are not even pursuing these careers, not even pursuing higher education, because they see the price tag and the amount of debt they’d be taking on and just aren’t going to do that,” said Glaves.

The burden of this long-term debt has created a financial paradox for many graduates.

“When we think of the American dream and [how] everybody should have equal opportunity, this is a big part of it — education,” said Glaves. “Being able to make that realistically accessible to everybody in a way that’s fair to everybody. We’re falling short of that in the system we have right now.”

What does student loan debt look like in Illinois?

Nicole Johnson, 35, is currently on track to receive her fourth higher education degree by the end of September — a master’s in journalism from Northwestern University’s Medill School.

This will be her third master’s degree in the past 12 years.

Johnson is a strong advocate for education, having worked in numerous public service roles, including as a former third grade teacher in Chicago Public Schools. In 2019, Johnson ran in the 20th Ward aldermanic election, losing to Jeanette Taylor in the general runoff.

“I wanted to be part of being able to provide young people with a good education, because education was the thing that opened so many doors for me and exposed me to a new world,” said Johnson.

Growing up in Englewood, Johnson was exposed to disparity and inequity at a young age.

Motivated by the stark economic inequities she witnessed in her own community, Johnson sought out numerous higher education degrees as a means to increase her earning potential.

“Your economic outcomes and possibilities are going to be quite limited unless you do some type of investment,” she said.

Her degrees haven’t come for free. Johnson’s current student loan balance is over $200,000, a number that would take decades to pay off without any kind of repayment or forgiveness program.

Johnson isn’t alone. Nearly 1.6 million Illinoisans are currently living with student loan debt.

The average borrower in the state owes about $39,000 in student loans, according to the Education Data Initiative, a research group that collects data and statistics on the U.S. education system.

More than half of all borrowers in the state are under the age of 35, and only 13.4% of student borrowers owe less than $5,000. A majority of borrowers owe more.

25 – 34 year olds account for the most borrowers of any age group – more than 558,000. But 35 – 49 year olds like Johnson have the highest total outstanding debt of over $22 billion.  Together, the two age groups account for almost 68% of the state’s federal loans.

While residents like Johnson have sought relief via. federal forgiveness options, recent changes and cuts at the federal level have made the future of these programs uncertain.

The current status of loan forgiveness

The Department of Education has been the U.S. government’s administrator of all federal aid programming since 1965, but this is soon to not be the case.

With the Trump administration’s announcement that student loan oversight will be moved to the Small Business Administration, and the U.S. Department of Education being effectively cut in half, many borrowers are left wondering how this will impact their relief options.

In February, former President Biden’s SAVE program – the lowest monthly income-driven repayment plan to date –  was issued an injunction by a U.S. appeals court. Several Republican-led states rejected the plan and sued the Biden administration, citing that it was “​​unlawfully trying to mass cancel hundreds of billions of dollars of loans.”

Monthly payments for those enrolled in SAVE have been placed in a period of forbearance, with accruing interest, until the court reaches a final decision.

On May 5, the Federal Student Aid office resumed its collection of many student loans, which had been effectively paused since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since Johnson has returned to school, her loans have been in deferment. But when she purchased a home in 2021, she said student loan and credit card debt notably impacted the mortgage rate she was able to qualify for.  “It was definitely an impediment,” said Johnson.

The dissolution of the U.S Department of Education has left millions of student loan borrowers, including Johnson, confused and wondering what the future of their repayments will look like in the wake of a departmental restructuring.

Rae Kaplan, a Chicago-based attorney specializing in student loan law and bankruptcy solutions, said she has witnessed despondency in a number of clients as a result of student loan debt.

“I’ve had people come in and tell me that they didn’t want to get married or have a family because their student loans were so daunting,” said Kaplan. “And the point is that student loans were meant to lift people up, not to be this weight dragging everybody down,” she said.

According to Kaplan, a majority of clients don’t even realize what options are out there.

Several federal and state-based forgiveness solutions can provide effective relief for borrowers over a period of time, even amidst the disorder of the FSA. They just need to know what their choices are, said Kaplan.

Relief options for Illinois residents

Johnson was formerly enrolled in the SAVE program, but like many other federal borrowers, qualifies for other income-driven repayment plans like Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

To qualify for PSLF, individuals must work full-time for a governmental body or select non-profit organization. PSLF forgives the total remaining balance on all federal student loans after 120 monthly payments determined by a qualifying repayment plan.

“Essentially, you only have to make payments on your loans for 10 years… and the payment is very reasonable, because it’s about 10% of your discretionary income,” said Kaplan.  “So for a lot of people, that means the monthly payment is no more than their cell phone bill,” she said.

Working on and off in the public sector for nearly a decade, Johnson already has 93 qualifying monthly payments towards her student loans. Her nearly six figure balance will be completely forgiven once she completes the remaining 27 over the next two years.

Kaplan estimates that nearly 30% of Illinois residents qualify for this program, along with additional state-based loan forgiveness and repayment opportunities.

According to the Education Data Initiative, only about 18% of eligible student borrowers end up applying for loan forgiveness at all.

“We go on WGN TV, we go on WGN radio, and try to get the word out that if you are an Illinois resident and you work in the public sector, there are some really good options out there to get your loans reduced and forgiven, but people think that it must not apply to them,” Kaplan said. “I hear all the time.”

Johnson says borrowers may also remain unaware of forgiveness programs because of prevailing social taboos. “Honestly, student loan debt is not a conversation,” she said. But specialists like Kaplan are working to change that by speaking openly about local repayment options.

The Illinois Student Assistance Commission, a state-based government agency that provides higher education resources to students and families, administers a number of relief programs for residents.

Dollar amounts for each award are subject to annual reviews by the Illinois General Assembly and the Office of the Governor, but last year the state awarded nearly $4 million in loan repayments to qualifying residents through their seven ISAC-administered programs. ISAC has increased funding for most of those programs for the 2025 fiscal year.

Last year, 649 residents enrolled in an ISAC repayment program, but many more than that qualify for the award, according to Kaplan. Frequent federal policy changes and extended loan repayment uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to lowered demand, according to ISAC.

“We’ve been in an extended period of uncertainty with respect to loan repayment since 2020,” said Lynne Baker, managing director of communications at ISAC. “There were extended forbearances as a result of the pandemic, which meant that there was a period when people didn’t have to pay on their loans and likely were not focused on loan forgiveness programs,” she said.

Although a majority of borrowers’ student loans are federally allocated, in 2019 to 2020 approximately 10% of college graduates in Illinois had private student loan debt.

In response to growing concerns about the impacts of large private student loans, The Office of the Illinois State Treasurer created the Student Empowerment Fund in 2024, a $1.5 billion investment fund providing capital for lower-rate private loans for residents attending in-state institutions.

“This program aims to alleviate student debt burdens in Illinois and make it possible for more students to pursue higher education,” said Eric Krol, director of communications for the Treasurer’s Office.

Kaplan said while it’s essential to know what relief programs exist, the best way to tackle student loan debt is preemptively.

“Having a good plan and strategy, knowing the laws, knowing who should be the federal parent, plus borrower, and exactly what those payments are going to look like is really key, and can really avoid wasting a lot of money,” she said.

“For 90% [of borrowers] there’s something you can do to lower your payments and even get on track to have your loans forgiven. I just don’t want people who have loans to feel hopeless, because I talk to a lot of people every day who feel hopeless about their loans,” said Kaplan.

The SmartBuy solution

Illinois will have the greatest decline in the number of new homeowners in the next two decades – a decrease of more than 7% by 2040, according to the Urban Institute, a non-profit economic and social policy research firm.

While multiple factors can be linked to this decline, data from the Federal Reserve suggests historic levels of student loan debt are to blame.

A little over 20% of the decline in homeownership rates among 24-32 year olds from 2009 to 2014 can be attributed to rising student loan debt across the country.

“Student loan debt is one of the single largest barriers delaying younger households from achieving their dream of homeownership,” said Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) Executive Director Kristin Faust in a press release.



[caption id=""attachment_69873"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""] Through the SmartBuy program, Josue Villalpando was able to close on his home in Lansing, Illinois in March 2025. “With my student loans being fully paid off, I know I can comfortably pay my mortgage without having to worry about financial constraints,” said Villalpando. (Provided by Josue Villalpando)[/caption]



The state came up with SmartBuy as a proposed solution. The program was created using a $25 million capital bill fund from Gov. JB Pritzker’s 2019 Rebuild Illinois Plan.

“Through SmartBuy, we have seen that this targeted relief can help new buyers overcome this financial burden and secure a home much earlier, allowing for a better opportunity to start building equity,” Faust said.

The first round of SmartBuy paid off an average of $26,700 in student loan debt per buyer, with the second round expected to average $28,800 per buyer.

Of course the program does come with specific eligibility requirements.

A buyer’s full student loan debt must be paid off at the time of purchase. If their debt exceeds $40,000, they must make up the difference at the time of closing. Villalplando said he needed to come up with an extra $9,000 before closing on his Lansing home.

Buyers also need to have a minimum credit score of 640 and live in the home for at least three years after closing or repay a portion of the debt assistance. IDHA determines the interest rate on the home’s mortgage.

So far, of the 631 loans closed in the first round, 15, did not make it through the three year forgiveness period. IDHA told the Illinois Answers Project they do not possess data as to why the borrower had to sell.

Chicago residents must have a household income of less than $134,000 and the purchase price for a one unit home must be under $610,000 and no more than $754,000 for a two-unit.

“There is no requirement in terms of where the home is or the census tract it’s in,” said Jason Finn, a Chicago-based realtor who works with SmartBuy applicants.

According to data obtained from IDHA, about 87% of homes purchased in the first round and 75% of homes purchased in the second round of the program were located in the Chicago region of Illinois.

“This is the sixth different IDHA program that I’ve worked with, and, for the folks that can benefit, I think it’s a bigger boom than any of the other programs they’ve had,” said Finn.

“I’ve had a lot of clients that have huge amounts of student debt, well into the six figures. Many of them aren’t working in a career that was envisioned when they incurred all that student debt. So, I’d love to see more opportunities like this.”

What begins as an investment in future prosperity can become a prolonged financial strain that limits career choices and delays other life milestones. The SmartBuy program hopes to make Villalpando’s story a more common one.

“I know many people who have student loan debt just following them for 15 plus years, and it seems like it’s never ending,” said Villalpando.

“So I just hope [SmartBuy] keeps going,” he said.

A new proposal on student loan debt

Even with available state-sponsored and federal forgiveness programs, and unique opportunities like SmartBuy, eligibility for these options can be so specific that many borrowers still fall through the cracks. For example, the borrowers who work in service-oriented careers but don’t qualify for PSLF.

That is what led members of the Chicago Bar Foundation, the charitable arm of the Chicago Bar Association, to develop a comprehensive legislation proposal addressing the coverage gap.

“We had an advocacy committee that really started this process of getting feedback on, how did [student debt] get like this? How did we get to this position now where it costs so much to go to school and we have people graduating with these mortgage sized debts?,” said Glaves.

The proposed legislation includes a simplification of current repayment programs by incorporating a multi-tiered income-based repayment program that places stricter limits on borrower loan sizes.

“It really has to be done with some more accountability on the amount that’s borrowed in the first place, both on the schools and the borrower,” said Glaves. “Otherwise taxpayers are on the hook for a lot of this.”

Glaves believes setting realistic borrowing limits will also mitigate national student loan default rates, which have declined in recent years, though such limits may prevent students from accessing sufficient funds to cover their educational costs.

The initiative also suggests Congress should allow bankruptcy options as a last resort. While not impossible, Glaves said filing for bankruptcy is extremely difficult within the current financial aid system.

“Someone gets in a situation where that income based approach isn’t going to work for them, there should be an option to file for bankruptcy at that point, as there is in every other kind of instance, in our country,” said Glaves.

Filing for bankruptcy typically results in additional consequences for borrowers, impacting their credit score and ability to acquire future loans. But if necessary, this option can substantially aid borrowers who, for reasons out of their control, aren’t able to complete their degrees and now have a mountain of debt to pay off.

The proposal has received support from the Illinois delegation and a general recognition from Congress of the need for a unified legislation approach, but Glaves expects it will not be passed during the current political term. Still, he remains hopeful.

“This is just one of those issues that, because it really does require some bigger changes to the system, we’re going to continue to work on,” said Glaves. “Even if there isn’t a lot of promise to have this happen in the short term politically.”

With an uncertain political landscape and climbing student debt, borrowers like Johnson wonder what the future of education will look like without a clear plan in place.

“Education is going to look different in 20 years, who knows what’s going to happen,” said Johnson. “In my mid-30s I’m thinking, okay how are my kids going to go to school?”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico’s relatively cool and moist weather so far this spring will dry and warm up in coming weeks, putting fire managers and forecasters on high alert for wildfires before the start of the seasonal monsoon rains this summer.
This year’s low snowpack has already put much of the state in drought conditions, and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham recently declared a state of emergency and additional actions to prevent fires over the coming weeks.
Recent rains around the state offer some relief, as May and June typically emerge as some of the driest months, said George Ducker, a wildfire prevention and spokesperson at the New Mexico Forestry Division.
But the projected warm temperatures through the next several weeks could mean the recent spouting of new plants could aggravate the problem, he said.
“We could see a substantial dry up of these flashy fuels, the grasses and even shrubs,” Ducker said. “Then, if you get a start, get a little bit of wind — there would be more fuel to burn.”
The recent rains did not herald the start of the monsoon, the seasonal tropical patterns that provide Arizona and New Mexico with critical moisture, said Andrea Bair, a forecaster with the National Weather Service Western Region based in Salt Lake City, at a National Integrated Drought Information System presentation Tuesday.
Rather, she said monsoons are expected to start in mid-June and could be stronger than past years, but hot temperatures will continue to dry out the soils and stress plants across much of the Southwestern U.S.
“The drought looks to continue throughout the season and the monthly outlook forecasts,” she said. “So not a lot of relief is expected.”
The rains lessened the acute risks of fire in the Southwest, said Jim Wallmann, a senior forecaster for the National Interagency Coordination Center Predictive Services. But other parts of the county are seeing wildfires “extremely early” in the fire season, he said, noting the 1,000-acre Banana Lake fire in Montana.
“We’re having to spread our resources over a much greater footprint of the country,” Wallmann said. “That could affect how big a fire gets in California, if we’re stretched and can’t send everything to California while it’s burning; we’ll be on fires burning everywhere else.”
Ducker said the concerns about availability for resources to fight wildfires is “a bridge we’ll cross when we come to it,” and said the state is working to be prepared.
“We have the resources to be able to jump on fires as they start,” Ducker said. Our federal partners seem to be in the same place where they’re ready to respond, so right now we’re just waiting for June to see what it shows us.”

Larry Rhoden speaks to the media during a press conference on March 13, 2025, at the Capitol in Pierre. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Republican South Dakota Governor Larry Rhoden signed an executive order this week to plan for future disasters as the Trump administration works to shift the responsibility for disaster relief to state and local entities.
“We pray that the most challenging circumstances will never arise, but we are preparing so that South Dakota can face such situations with determination, resilience, and grit,” Rhoden said in a press release.  
President Trump has called the Federal Emergency Management Agency a “disaster” and suggested it might “go away.” FEMA is led by Homeland Security Secretary and former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. 
Trump signed an executive order in March titled “Achieving Efficiency Through State and Local Preparedness,” which says “federal policy must rightly recognize that preparedness is most effectively owned and managed at the State, local, and even individual levels.”
The Trump order also instructs federal agencies to reevaluate grants, contracts, and technical assistance funding programs. FEMA has since ended the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The 2021 program aimed to direct $1 billion in funding toward infrastructure projects to help communities across the U.S. “reduce their hazard risk” as they “build capability and capacity.” According to a tally of federal cuts compiled and updated weekly by the governor’s office, $8.9 million in South Dakota projects were set to benefit from BRIC grants.
End of FEMA program affects drinking water, building code updates, tornado shelter in SD

Critics say the shift in disaster relief responsibilities and funding from the federal government to state and local governments will leave poorer, rural states unprepared and unable to respond.
Rhoden says the task force will “support” the Trump administration’s executive order. 
Rhoden dubbed the group the Governor’s Resilience and Infrastructure Task Force, or GRIT. He said the task force will serve as an advisory body to “develop policy recommendations, assess risks and vulnerabilities, and support long-term planning and investment in critical infrastructure systems across our state.”
The task force will be chaired by Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen. Adjutant General Mark Morrell of the South Dakota National Guard will serve as vice chair. Venhuizen said the task force is more than a response to President Trump ending programs and planning to shift responsibilities to states. He said the concept of the task force has been under consideration since last year.

Kim Reynolds talks to reporters May 17, 2022, after signing legislation dealing with biofuels at a farm near Prairie City. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As she considers whether to sign legislation limiting the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines, Gov. Kim Reynolds faces a decision that will forever define her legacy in the Iowa Republican Party: whether to uphold the constitutional rights and the property rights of Iowa landowners, or whether to put ethanol industry profits ahead of those rights.
The party platform unequivocally supports landowner rights. The Iowa House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, have passed bipartisan legislation that would protect those rights. This should not be a difficult choice.
However, there are many special interest groups urging the governor to veto House File 639, claiming it would harm the ethanol industry and derail future economic development opportunities in the state. But if those claims were true, why do nearly 30% of Iowa’s ethanol plants choose not to participate in this risky CO₂ pipeline venture? Why is Summit Carbon Solutions suing multiple Iowa counties over zoning ordinances, the very tools those counties use to guide and protect local economic growth?
The self-serving arguments of the ethanol industry do not stand up to scrutiny. Privately owned carbon dioxide pipelines do not align with the constitutional definition of “public use” necessary for eminent domain, and they do not justify using the government’s “takings” power to force private landowners to participate in a speculative business enterprise. Essentially, these special interests are asking the governor to pick economic winners and losers at the expense of constitutional rights.
Importantly, HF 639 does not stop the pipeline project, nor does it prevent voluntary easements. In fact, Summit has already secured all necessary voluntary agreements in Minnesota and must now do the same in South Dakota to meet Iowa Utilities Commission conditions for construction here. Iowa landowners deserve the same rights as landowners in our neighboring states.
If this project truly serves a vital economic need and garners legitimate support, it can move forward through the free market—without coercion, and without undermining the rights of landowners.
I commend Gov. Reynolds for engaging a broad range of stakeholders in this conversation. Listening to the public and not just to special interests is essential for crafting sound public policy, but it does not change the dilemma facing the governor: constitutional rights vs. special interest profits.
By signing HF 639, Gov. Reynolds would uphold constitutional rights, curb the misuse of eminent domain for private profit, demonstrate her commitment to the Republican Party’s property rights platform, protect landowners from inadequate insurance coverage, and strengthen the public accountability of the Iowa Utilities Commission.
It would ensure she is forever remembered as a champion of the Republican Party’s commitment to constitutional rights and private property rights.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/reynolds-gaggle-5.17.22-prairie-city-biofuels-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234

For 32 years, the kidnapping and murder of 6-year-old Willie Cook remained a mystery. 
Then, in 2008, sheriff’s deputies in Siskiyou County got their first big break: A man came forward to say he had witnessed the kidnapping. Steve Marshall was only 10-years-old when Willie disappeared, but his memory of that August day remained vivid. 
So vivid, in fact, that the District Attorney’s Office built its case around his testimony, charging a local man with murder. 
Deep inside the file, however, lay evidence that would cast doubt on Marshall’s testimony. Would anyone discover it? 
To find out, read the gripping narrative of the cold case from CalMatters investigative reporter Anat Rubin. 
The story is part of a series exploring how poor people accused of crimes in California are routinely convicted in California without anyone investigating the charges against them. 
Defense investigators are perhaps the most important safeguard against wrongful convictions. But, as Rubin found, close to half of California’s 58 counties do not employ any full-time public defense investigators. 
Among the findings of her investigation:

Of the 10 California counties with the highest prison incarceration rates, eight have no defense investigators on staff. 
In Riverside, for example, the district attorney has 30% more lawyers than the public defender but 500% more investigators.
Hidden in the data is the greatest tragedy of failing to investigate cases: wrongful convictions. 

Maurice Possley, a leading expert on exonerations, said that a failure to investigate is at the heart of most of the cases he reviews. He’s astounded by what he finds when he looks at the evidence. 

Possley: “If someone had just made the effort. This was all sitting there.”

Air quality regulators are expected to vote Friday on rules that aim to phase out water heaters and other heating systems powered by natural gas, writes CalMatters’ Alejandra Reyes-Velarde.
Officials at the South Coast Air Quality Management District — which oversees four counties in the Los Angeles basin including Orange County and parts of L.A. and San Bernardino counties — say that home appliances are one of the largest sources of smog-causing gases in the region.
If the rules are approved, 30% of heating appliances sold in the region must be zero-emissions beginning in 2027. Consumers also wouldn’t be required to swap out their appliances immediately, but could buy electric-powered heat pumps when it comes time to replace their natural gas water heaters, central heating systems or furnaces.
Contractors and developers oppose the phaseout, citing higher costs: Installing a heat pump in lieu of a natural gas water heater costs $2,000 more, and replacing a furnace costs $8,000 more.

On Wednesday the California Supreme Court heard arguments involving a lawsuit against state regulators for their decision to dramatically reduce the compensation customers with solar installations receive for the excess energy they generate. 
As CalMatters’ Malena Carollo explains, in 2022 the California Public Utilities Commission slashed compensation payments utilities paid homeowners with rooftop solar panels by around 75%. The commission said the updated rates reversed what it saw as unfair subsidies to well-to-do solar customers, striking a balance between affordability and encouraging renewable energy alternatives. Since then, demand for rooftop solar projects has taken a nosedive.
The rooftop solar industry, ratepayers and renewable energy groups opposed the reduction and three environmental groups are suing the commission. They argue that the commission didn’t properly consider benefits to customers and disadvantaged communities when it changed the rules. The court is expected to issue its decision in about a month.

Though federal immigration agents cannot be blocked from accessing places they are legally authorized to enter, California’s Democratic-led Senate passed a series of bills Monday that would limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Read more about what the handful of these bills would do from CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: With the deadline to pass the state budget drawing near, lawmakers will have to either make difficult spending cuts, increase the state’s chronic deficit or raise taxes.
California’s landmark environmental law has been used to cause harm, and state lawmakers should pass a bill that would limit its reach for some housing projects, write Nick Yost, creator of the environmental section of the California Department of Justice, and Daniel Yost, founding board member of Peninsula Clean Energy.

The revenue picture now “looks worse than we expected,"" according to the report's author.
The post Falling office building values still a concern for Boston’s budget, think tank says appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IT’S ROUND 2 for Mayor Michelle Wu and the Boston Policy Institute. The think tank that repeatedly clashed with City Hall over taxes is out with a follow-up to their report last year that Boston is facing a stormy revenue picture in the years ahead, as remote work has led to a loss in the value of office buildings. Their takeaway, as put by Evan Horowitz, the Tufts University analyst and author of both last year’s report and the one out Thursday: The revenue picture now “looks worse than we expected.” The city’s $4.6 billion operating budget heavily relies on property taxes, which are calculated based on assessed values of a property and an applied tax rate. Commercial property taxes make up a third of the budget. The think tank’s latest report says property taxes are a “very stable” source of revenue, having helped Boston power through past economic downturns. But several notable buildings, such as 101 Arch Street and 400 Atlantic Avenue, are now trading hands at discounts ranging from 50 to 70 percent. With hybrid work, high mortgage rates, and federal tariffs leading to increased costs, “there’s no reason to expect a near-term turnaround in the value or profitability of office spaces,” the report said. The report added that “the total assessed value of all office properties in Boston fell 9 percent in FY 2025 (in real terms), a one-year decline comparable only to the [2008] financial crisis and the bursting of the [2001] dot-com bubble. And while those earlier, recession-induced drops were short-lived, today’s slump seems more durable.”The Boston Policy Institute’s new report, like the one in 2024, doubled down on what it termed a city budget “shortfall” due to falling office building values, saying the new estimate totals $1.7 billion over the next five years, revising up from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Wu administration officials have previously disputed the think tank’s use of the word “shortfall,” noting any revenue decrease from commercial property taxes would have to be made up by an increase in residential property taxes. The mayor, joined by House lawmakers, pushed for property tax shift legislation last year on Beacon Hill, only to see it die in the Senate. The legislation would have temporarily shifted more of the tax burden onto commercial businesses in order to avoid a spike in residential property taxes. The Boston Policy Institute, a nonprofit, has emerged as a rival to a longtime city watchdog, the Boston Municipal Research Bureau (BMRB). While BMRB gets money from the city’s top businesses, like Fidelity and State Street, the BPI does not reveal its donors. As with the February 2024 report, the think tank provided Thursday’s report under an embargo, meaning reporters could not share the findings with the Wu administration for comment. The latest report comes as Wu faces a challenger, Josh Kraft, the son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. The younger Kraft, a longtime nonprofit executive, has criticized Wu for declining to cut the city’s budget. Wu, for her part, has said her administration is “preparing for worst case scenarios while refraining from preemptive disruption of city services,” and noted that cuts would lead to fewer police and firefighters. In her fiscal year 2026 budget proposal, she proposed slowing growth, with the operating budget coming in at $4.8 billion, a 4.4 percent increase from the previous year, down from a 7 percent increase the year before that. In May, Wu touted Moody’s Investor Service and S&P Global Ratings, two ratings agencies, both handing the city a AAA bond rating, the same week that Moody’s downgraded the United States. The city has held the top credit rating, an indication of fiscal health, since 2014. “Boston’s commercial and retail properties continue to rebound from elevated vacancy rates seen during the pandemic and these metrics now compare favorably to similar large metro areas in the US,” S&P wrote in its assessment, dated May 13. “It is working to address the effects of declining office building values, which are not expected to affect the city’s revenue collections due to the structure of its tax collections, but may result in a shift of the tax burden to residential taxpayers due to the city’s dual tax rate,” the rating agency added. S&P also noted the city’s effort to convert some downtown office space into residential properties in a bid to boost foot traffic, improve housing supply, and stabilize property values. “These office conversions face several challenges; the success of this program, however, will be felt over an extended time horizon,” the agency’s analysts wrote.The post Falling office building values still a concern for Boston’s budget, think tank says appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/0Traffic.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234

In California, there’s no guarantee.","On Aug. 28, 1976, sometime between 7:30 and 8 p.m., a 6-year-old boy named Willie Cook disappeared from the bed of his father’s pickup in Happy Camp, a secluded logging community in Northern California’s Klamath National Forest. Willie’s father, Bill Cook, had been working on his lawn mower at a repair shop in the center of town. When he was done, he told Willie to wait in the truck with the family dog while he ducked into the bar across the street. He was gone less than 20 minutes. The sun had set behind the mountains, but there was still light in the sky.
Cook searched the area on foot, then drove in the direction of the family home. After he circled town a couple more times, he called law enforcement to report that his son was missing. He gave the local deputy a description: Willie was 42 inches tall and weighed 45 pounds. He was wearing a black baseball jersey, jeans and white tennis shoes. His right eye was blue, and his left eye was a mix of blue and brown. He was, Cook said, “a very good boy, and had never wandered off in the past.” 
By midnight, 150 people were searching for Willie, combing the dense woods surrounding the town. But Cook did not believe his son was lost in the forest. From the moment he had walked out of that bar, he was certain that someone had taken him. “I felt it,” he said. “I felt it all over.”
Willie’s body was discovered six months later in a small cardboard barrel at a campground along the Klamath River, more than 50 miles from Happy Camp. The Siskiyou County sheriff’s office launched a murder investigation but never solved the case. 
After 32 years, sheriff’s deputies got their first big break when a man came forward to say he had witnessed the kidnapping. Steve Marshall was only 10 years old in 1976, but his memory of that August day was vivid: He was sitting alone in his mother’s blue station wagon, parked outside the Headway Market, within view of the repair shop and the old bar. He was eating a vanilla ice cream cone. His brother was inside the market with their mother. They would be having spaghetti for dinner that night — his favorite.

Marshall seemed to remember what happened next as though it were unfolding in slow motion: The sound of a logging truck as it roared past. Willie’s Labrador wagging his tail. And a young man in blue jeans and a vest, his long hair in two braids, standing on the opposite side of the street, staring at the boy and his dog.
Marshall recognized him. His name was Gregory Nelson. And Marshall said he had a clear view of him as he crossed the street, grabbed Willie, shoved him into a VW bus and drove off, disappearing down the one-lane highway that cut through town. Marshall had tried to tell his mother what he’d seen, but she’d brushed him off. For the next few decades, he mostly kept it to himself. But the memory, he said, had haunted him.
The Siskiyou sheriff arrested Nelson, then 51, and brought him in for questioning. He had a couple grams of methamphetamine and several syringes in his pocket. After two days of interrogation, he confessed. The following day, the sheriff told a local reporter that a cold case is like a puzzle. “After 32 years, we’re finally getting the pieces put together.”
Nelson was charged with kidnapping and murder. Siskiyou’s chief public defender, Lael Kayfetz, thought there was little chance of overcoming a signed confession and an eyewitness account. Then the prosecutors turned over the recordings of Nelson’s interrogation. When Kayfetz watched the footage, she said, “my eyeballs fell out of my head.” 
She realized she needed to test the claims against her client, but she couldn’t do it on her own. “I’m an expert on the law,” Kayfetz said. “I’m not an expert on getting the facts.” She needed an investigator. 
The prosecutors were working closely with detectives at the sheriff’s office, issuing warrants and building a case. They also employed their own team of five investigators. 
That year, Siskiyou County’s public defender didn’t have a single defense investigator on staff. 
***
Lawyers have a constitutional obligation to investigate every case. But a CalMatters investigation found that poor people accused of crimes, who account for at least 80% of criminal defendants, are routinely convicted in California without anyone investigating the charges against them. Close to half of California’s 58 counties do not employ any full-time public defense investigators. Among the remaining counties, defendants’ access to investigators fluctuates wildly, but it’s almost always inadequate.
The cost of this failure is steep, for individual defendants and for the integrity of California’s criminal justice system. Of the 10 California counties with the highest prison incarceration rates, eight have no defense investigators on staff, according to an analysis of staffing and prison data. 
The lack of investigators affects counties throughout the state, from poor, rural areas like Siskiyou to the state’s largest and most well-funded public defense offices. Los Angeles employed just 1 investigator for every 10 public defenders — one of the state’s worst ratios, according to the most recent data from the California Department of Justice. Only seven California counties met the widely accepted minimum standard of 1 investigator for every 3 attorneys. 
The situation is most alarming in the 25 California counties that don’t have dedicated public defender offices and pay private attorneys to represent indigent people in criminal court. Most of these attorneys receive a flat fee for their services, and the cost of an investigator would eat away at their profits. Some counties allow contracted attorneys to ask the court for additional funds for investigations, but court records show the attorneys rarely make those requests. 
In Kings County, which has one of the highest prison incarceration rates in California, contracted attorneys asked the court for permission to hire an investigator in 7% of criminal cases from 2018 to 2022. In Lake County, attorneys made those requests in just 2% of criminal cases over a three-year period; in Mono County, it was less than 1%. To earn a living from meager county contracts, research shows, private attorneys and firms must persuade defendants to accept plea deals as quickly as possible. An investigation is an expensive delay.
Defense investigators interview witnesses, visit crime scenes, review police reports and retrieve video surveillance footage that might prove the defendant was on the other side of town when a crime was committed, or that an assault was an act of self-defense. They do work that most lawyers are not trained to do. Without them, police and prosecutorial misconduct — among the most common causes of wrongful convictions — remain unchecked, significantly increasing the likelihood that people will go to prison for crimes they did not commit.
“Law is important, but the facts are what influences the law,” said Aditi Goel, executive director of the Sixth Amendment Center, a national nonprofit focused on improving indigent defense. “The heart of a case is what happened.”
***
In 2008, Kayfetz and her four staff attorneys were left to sleuth most cases on their own, and they worried about what they might be missing. Siskiyou County provided them with a small budget to contract with a private investigator, but the Nelson case, which had already spanned three decades, would burn through their entire investigation fund for the year. Still, Kayfetz didn’t feel as though she had a choice. Nelson was facing life in prison, and the sheriff was in the papers talking about closure for the Cook family. 
She called Rob Shelton, an investigator who had spent most of the previous two decades in law enforcement — first with the Coast Guard, then as a harbor patrol officer in Ventura, and recently as a probation officer for Siskiyou. He’d crossed over into defense investigations, and this would be his first homicide case for the public defender’s office.

Nelson’s mug shot had by then been published on the front page of the Siskiyou Daily News. His hair was graying, and his cheeks were deeply sunken. Shelton knew that look. He had seen it on the probationers he had monitored, people whose hard lives were etched into their faces. He had come to view their struggles with the law as a symptom of their poverty and addiction. But he also believed Nelson was guilty. It was hard for him to imagine that the sheriff would pursue a case without concrete evidence, and even harder to believe that the district attorney would push it toward trial. 
Kayfetz handed Shelton the records she’d gotten from the prosecutors, and he spent those first few weeks combing through old police reports.
As he made his way through the documents, he found black-and-white copies of photographs the sheriff’s deputies had taken as they searched Happy Camp in the days after Willie’s disappearance: The chain-saw repair shop where the truck had been parked. The old bar across the street. And a building that looked as though it had recently burned down. It was familiar to Shelton, though he couldn’t initially place it.
Then one day, while he was staring at the photo, it clicked. It was the Headway Market, where Marshall said his mother had been shopping when he witnessed the kidnapping.
“There was no store,” Shelton said. “There was just ruins.” 
Shelton walked down the street to the Siskiyou County assessor’s office to pull records on the property. The market, he learned, had burned down a few months before Willie Cook was taken.

California is the birthplace of public defense. The nation’s first public defender office opened in Los Angeles in 1913. By the time the U.S. Supreme Court established in 1963 that defendants have the right to an attorney in state criminal proceedings, more than a dozen California counties were already providing free representation to poor people accused of crimes.
As the nation caught up, California slipped behind. The state kept its defender system entirely in the hands of its counties. Today, it is one of just two states — alongside Arizona — that don’t contribute any funding to trial-level public defense, according to the Sixth Amendment Center. The state does not monitor or evaluate the counties’ systems. There are no minimum standards, and for many defendants there are no investigations — even in the most serious cases.
Meanwhile, prosecutors have robust, in-house investigative teams. In Riverside, the district attorney has 30% more lawyers than the public defender but 500% more investigators, state data shows, in addition to the support of the county sheriff and various municipal police departments. This pattern repeats throughout the state. In what is supposed to be an adversarial legal system, indigent defendants and their attorneys are often on their own, facing an army of investigators who are working to secure a conviction. 
Hidden in that data is the greatest tragedy of failing to investigate cases: wrongful convictions. The National Registry of Exonerations is filled with cases in which convictions were overturned when someone finally looked into the prisoner’s claims, years or even decades after they were imprisoned. 
Hundreds of those cases are in California. In one exoneration out of Fresno, Innocence Project investigators found nine witnesses who corroborated their client’s alibi: He was more than 25 miles away at a birthday party at the time of the crime. In a recent case out of Los Angeles, investigators found evidence of their client’s innocence in a police detective’s handwritten notes, material that had been included in a file turned over to the defense before trial. If their cases had been investigated on the front end, these men might have been spared a combined 30 years in prison. 
Maurice Possley, the exoneration registry’s senior researcher, said that a failure to investigate is at the heart of most of the registry’s 3,600 cases.
When he looks at the evidence that overturned these convictions, he’s astounded the defense didn’t find it when the case was being prosecuted. 
“If someone had just made the effort,” he said. “This was all sitting there.”

Shelton was in his early 40s when he got the Nelson case. He had been living in Siskiyou for years, but he hadn’t shed his Southern California accent. He was soft-spoken, smiled often, and had the easy mannerisms of someone who had spent a lot of time at the beach. It didn’t take long for him to build a rapport with Nelson, and he visited him frequently at the Siskiyou County jail. Nelson told him he had no memory of the events that Marshall had recounted for the deputies. Those claims of innocence had sounded hollow to Shelton, but the picture of the burned market changed his thinking about the case. Now he wondered whether anything Marshall had said was true.

Detectives with the Siskiyou sheriff’s office had interviewed Marshall several times in October 2008, a month before they arrested Nelson. Kayfetz requested those recordings, and she and Shelton listened to the tapes.
In the first interview, Marshall initially hedged his words. When a detective asked him whether he saw Willie — who was Marshall’s cousin — on the day he was taken, he said that it “seemed like” he did. Then he said that he watched Nelson grab Willie and put him in the van, where another man was crouching in the passenger seat.
“You saw that?” the detective asked. 
“That was with my own eyes I saw that,” Marshall said. 
Minutes later, in a second accounting, Marshall added an accomplice — the woman who would later become Nelson’s wife slid the van door open and jumped inside before they drove off. Three days later, an additional woman appeared in the story — the wife’s sister — and the man in the passenger seat was gone. 
It was remarkable to Shelton that the detectives didn’t challenge Marshall on these discrepancies. Each time he told the story, he added details — the ice cream flavor, the face his brother made at him as he walked into the market.
When a detective asked whether Marshall had said anything to his mother when she came back, he replied that he had tried but that his brother was teasing him. “That’s why I just threw it aside,” he said. “Because my brother, he made me mad.” Marshall eventually told his mother what had happened, he said, but neither of them mentioned it to Cook when they joined the search party later that night.

A newspaper clipping related to the Willie Cook murder case from the Sept. 15, 1976 edition of the Sacramento Bee.
In a separate interview with detectives, Marshall’s mother corroborated his account. “I should have listened to him,” she said. “It was like he was trying to tell all of us that he had seen who took Willie. Is that possible? But nobody would believe him, because he was a little boy.”
In one of the recordings, the detectives alluded to some kind of legal trouble Marshall was facing. “You’re taking care of us, and we’re going to scratch your back in return,” a detective had promised him. 
During his fourth and final recorded interview with detectives, Marshall had something new to share: He wasn’t just a witness to Willie’s kidnapping. He was also a witness to his murder. Months after the kidnapping, Marshall said, he took a trip with his father to visit his grandparents on the Hoopa reservation, some 70 miles from Happy Camp. It was there, he said, while hiding behind a tree in the back of Nelson’s house, that he saw Nelson take Willie out of a locked van and heard him say, “This is the last time you’re going to even breathe air.”
“I’m standing right there, and I’m watching him from that tree,” he told a detective. “I’m watching him put his hands around that little boy and strangle him until that little boy was dead.”
The detective conducting the interview initially seemed alarmed by this change in the story. She told Marshall that her sergeant would need to speak with him “about the differences in your statement from the first time that we talked to you.” She left the room but came back alone. “I think you and I pretty much clarified everything,” she said. 
In her report, she wrote that Marshall had witnessed the murder “four or five days” after the kidnapping. That was an error — Marshall repeatedly said four or five months had passed between the kidnapping and the murder, according to a transcript of the interview. But that error would find its way into Nelson’s confession.
From Marshall’s testimony, police and prosecutors created their theory of the crime, interview transcripts and court filings show. They proposed Nelson was a pawn in a scheme hatched by his sister-in-law — one of the women Marshall named as an accomplice — who wanted to hurt Cook by taking his son. Maybe she had been jealous of his success. Maybe she wanted to avenge her husband, who had been tried, and later acquitted, for the murder of Cook’s brother. 

A newspaper clipping related to the Willie Cook murder case from the Feb. 23, 1977 edition of The Dunsmuir News. 
Nelson and his sister-in-law were both Native American. To Kayfetz, law enforcement’s assumption that they would kidnap and kill a child as an act of revenge, or in a fit of jealous rage, played into racial stereotypes and became the “underlying stench” of the case. 
The evidence had suggested that Willie was kidnapped by a sexual predator. His body was naked when it was discovered. Now law enforcement posited he was murdered in a family feud. 
Even Willie’s father initially had a hard time believing this theory. “I just can’t imagine that,” Cook told a detective in 2008. “Over something that stupid? My gut feeling is no.”
But the deputies were insistent. Eventually, Cook began to come around to the possibility that Nelson was the killer. 
Deputies exhumed Willie’s body, but it did not provide any new evidence. Far too much time had passed.
***
When Shelton began working on the case, he was shocked whenever he discovered that law enforcement had made a mistake, or that prosecutors had failed to turn over a key document. 
He would burst into Kayfetz’s office, saying, “You’re not gonna believe this!” And Kayfetz would tell him, dryly, “There’s no Santa or Easter Bunny, either.” 
He would soon lose that sense of disbelief. 
As the investigation progressed, Shelton became convinced that Marshall had invented most of his story. Marshall had given detectives the names of other potential witnesses, but those turned out to be dead ends. Still, Siskiyou’s district attorney, Kirk Andrus, seemed determined to move forward, and Nelson was losing hope. 
Then, one day, while he was looking through old police files, Shelton found a list of materials the deputies had entered into evidence in 1976. It included references to interviews they recorded with potential witnesses. Shelton scanned the list and saw Marshall’s name. The prosecution’s star witness had spoken to officers just days after Willie disappeared. If law enforcement still had access to these recordings, they hadn’t shared them with the defense.
When Kayfetz asked the district attorney’s office to turn over the evidence, the prosecutors said they didn’t have it. But Shelton learned the tapes from the case had recently been digitized and enhanced by the Justice Department, at the request of the Siskiyou detectives. Kayfetz filed a second motion to get the recordings. When the judge ordered the prosecutors to explain how the tapes had gone missing, they said that they had found them and that they had been lost on a detective’s desk, according to court documents.

Soon Kayfetz and Shelton were listening to Marshall, 10 years old, answering questions about the evening Willie disappeared. There was no ice cream. Marshall’s brother was not in the car, but his older sister was. Their mom didn’t go to the grocery store, but she did stop at a liquor store to buy a TV Guide. When they drove through the center of town, Marshall waved to Willie, who was sitting in his dad’s truck. 
“I said, ‘Hi, Willie,’ and he said ‘Hi’ back. And I said, ‘Where’s your dad?’ And he said, ‘He’s in the bar.’” When they drove by again, Willie was gone. 
“Am I allowed to go now?” Marshall asked the detective. 
In a separate interview that same day, Marshall’s mother corroborated her son’s account. Nobody mentioned Nelson. Nobody said anything about witnessing a kidnapping.
***
Shelton felt as though they were pulling a string and unraveling the district attorney’s case. 
He discovered that Marshall had a motive for becoming useful to law enforcement in the fall of 2008. He had violated the terms of his probation for a drunken-driving conviction and was facing prison, but police kept the violation off his record, Shelton said.
Kayfetz was encouraged by the evidence that was mounting in Nelson’s favor, but if the case went to trial, she would have to contend with the fact that he had confessed to the crime. 
She sent the footage of his interrogation to Richard Leo, a University of San Francisco law professor and one of the nation’s foremost experts on coerced confessions, and asked him to testify on Nelson’s behalf. She couldn’t afford his fee — she was already pushing the outer limits of her budget. And when she first reached out, Leo told her he didn’t have time to take on another case. But she begged him to watch the footage before he made up his mind.
Even now, almost 17 years later, he remembers how stunned he had been when he first saw it. Among the 2,400 cases he’s consulted on, he said, the Nelson case stands out as one of the most egregious examples of a coerced confession he has ever seen. He called it “a form of psychological torture.” 
“There’s a sequence to this — a long interrogation, lie to the suspect about evidence, attack the suspect’s denials, cause him to doubt his memory,” he said. “Sometimes you see this person denying and admitting at the same time: ‘I couldn’t have done this. I have no memory. You’re telling me I did this, maybe I did this.’”
Leo said Nelson was subjected to almost every tactic known to lead to a false admission of guilt. He agreed to do the case for a reduced fee — a “bro deal,” Kayfetz called it — in exchange for permission to include it in a future book.
More than 12% of the wrongful convictions listed on the National Registry of Exonerations involved false confessions. In a recent case in San Bernardino, police officers pushed a man to admit to killing his father after he called police to report him missing. During a marathon interrogation, officers told the man they had conclusive evidence of his guilt and got him to agree with a gruesome scenario that they had pulled, it seems, from thin air. A few hours after he confessed, police officers located the man’s father. He was alive and well.

In 2007, the Bureau of Justice Statistics conducted a census of the nation’s public defender offices. It found that 40% had no investigators on staff and that 93% failed to meet the National Association for Public Defense’s industry standard of at least 1 investigator for every 3 attorneys. 
The study made it clear that, across the country, investigators were seen as a luxury, not a necessity. CalMatters interviews with top public defenders in several states, along with recent reports examining indigent defense systems, suggest that’s still the case.
In Mississippi, only eight of the state’s 82 counties have public defender offices. The rest rely on private attorneys who are paid a flat fee — one that rarely covers the cost of an investigator. A 2018 report found that, in many Mississippi counties, with the exception of murder cases, the attorneys “never hire investigators and have no time to investigate cases themselves.” Appointed attorneys told researchers they would “get laughed out of court” for requesting additional funds for an investigator. 
Public defender systems that are funded and controlled by state legislatures also have severe investigator shortages. The head public defender in Arkansas, Gregg Parrish, said he has only 12 staff investigators, responsible for assisting in felony cases, including capital cases, in all of the state’s 75 counties. Minnesota’s top public defender, William Ward, said he is trying to maintain a ratio of at least 1 investigator for every 7 public defenders but knows that’s not enough. “I would rather have a great investigator and an average lawyer than an average investigator and a great lawyer,” he said. “Investigators make all the difference on a case.”
Colin Reingold remembers one case in particular from his time as a public defender in Louisiana’s Orleans Parish. His client was accused of breaking into a car, but he insisted he was entering the car to leave a note offering to do yard work.
Reingold sent an investigator to the car owner’s house, but there was no one home. His client had two prior felonies, and a car burglary would qualify him for a life sentence. When the prosecutor offered 10 years in exchange for a guilty plea, Reingold advised him to take the deal. But his client begged him to find the note, he said. 
That year, Orleans Parish had 65 public defenders and three investigators. The one assigned to the man’s case refused to give up. She tried for six weeks to find the car’s owner. In the week before the plea hearing, she stopped by his home almost daily. One evening, he answered the door. He said, “Oh yeah, I still have that note!”
Reingold presented the note as evidence, and his client was released from jail. 
It was, he said, a rare stroke of luck. “The scary thing is, we don’t know all the other times we’ve missed things like that.”

Just weeks before Nelson’s trial was set to begin, the prosecution was still turning over discovery materials. 
Shelton began to make his way through the latest batch. Many of the documents were familiar — duplicates of reports and transcripts he had already reviewed. But he stumbled on a few photographs, tucked into the file, that he hadn’t seen before. In the foreground of one of the pictures, leaning up against a trailer home, something caught his eye — a cardboard cylinder, not quite 2 feet tall. It looked just like the barrel in which Willie’s body was found. 
“Jesus Christ, man. That’s it right there,” he said to himself. “It was in their hands. They had it all along.”
The trailer belonged to a man who had lived in Happy Camp in the 1970s and whom everyone knew as Sonny. He washed trucks for a local logging company and lived on the owner’s property. Cook told police he had been on that property with Willie the day of the kidnapping, which is probably why the deputies photographed the area.
When Shelton went back to Happy Camp to learn more about Sonny, he discovered he had been arrested less than a year after Willie’s body was found, when a 5-year-old boy told his parents that Sonny had sexually abused him. The boy’s family had owned the logging company, and Sonny had been their employee. Prosecutors didn’t file charges, and Sonny was released.
According to documents Kayfetz filed with the court, the boy, who was in his late 30s when Nelson was arrested, had always wondered about the connection between Willie’s murder and his own abuse. His grandmother once told him she believed the cardboard barrel had come from their family’s property — she said it was a container for the detergent that Sonny used to wash the trucks.

He had recently searched for the Cook case online and was surprised to find that it had been reopened and that Nelson had been charged with the crime. He wondered: Did the police know about Sonny?
The local press had published a phone number for the Siskiyou detective’s bureau, urging people to come forward with relevant information about the crime. He called and left a message, but no one called him back. He called a second time and explained to a receptionist who he was and why he was calling. He was still waiting for a reply. 
Sonny did eventually go to prison for sexually abusing a child. A mother reported him to the police when she learned he had been molesting her son for years. She told investigators that after Sonny was sentenced, other boys came forward to say he had abused them as well, according to a statement filed in court. He died in 2001.
To Shelton, these discoveries seemed like “a game changer.” He shared the details with Kayfetz. “I was like, ‘This is done,’” he said.
But the jury would not get to see the photo of the barrel or hear from Sonny’s accusers. The prosecution fought to exclude the evidence, arguing it didn’t prove Sonny had ever met Willie, let alone had kidnapped and killed him. And the judge agreed.
“It never even made it to court,” Shelton said. “Our job was to create reasonable doubt. We never planned to solve this case and figure out who did kidnap Willie. But I think we did, and no one cared.” 
The case would radically alter Shelton’s beliefs about the justice system and his perception of how police and prosecutors operate. “I used to be on their team,” he said. “And when I worked for the defense I started to see that, you know, sometimes it’s more about winning than actual justice.” 
He began to view his job as “quality control” for law enforcement agencies.
“Some district attorneys are wonderful and they disclose everything,” he said. “They’re not all like that. And so, if you’re a defendant and you draw a dishonest attorney, well, is that it? Is your fate sealed?”
It would be, Shelton said, if you didn’t have anyone to look into your side of the story.

Over the past 20 years, California has introduced ambitious legislation aimed at reducing incarceration, earning the state a reputation as a leader in criminal justice reform. But those efforts are routinely undermined by California’s failure to provide defendants with a proper investigation of the charges against them. 
“That’s what’s so shocking — that it’s California,” said Goel, of the Sixth Amendment Center. “There’s perception, and then there’s reality. When will the state look in the mirror and see what it really is?”
Investigations affect every part of the criminal justice process. They’re not just about figuring out whether a client is innocent. Even if a case is moving toward a plea deal, an investigation can turn up information that forces a prosecutor to reduce the charge or compels a judge to grant bond or shorten a prison sentence. 
Lawyers are discouraged from interviewing witnesses on their own. If a witness later changed their story or disappeared before trial, the attorney might have to testify on their client’s behalf and recuse themself from the case. 
California lawmakers are considering a bill that could bolster defense investigations by eliminating flat-fee contracts. But it faces opposition from county officials, who say it would force them to increase their defense budgets without helping them pay for it. 
New York was once very similar to California. Its counties managed their own public defender systems, without much input or funding from the state, until a class-action lawsuit, settled in 2015, led to statewide changes. 
New York created an office tasked with improving public defense, eventually giving it some $250 million to dole out each year. Counties that take the money must prioritize certain aspects of public defense, including investigations. In a recent report to the agency overseeing the effort, these counties consistently said the ability to investigate cases was among the most profound impacts of the new funding. Some described specific cases that ended in acquittal or significantly reduced charges as a result.
California was also sued over claims it failed to provide competent defense. To settle the lawsuit, filed in Fresno County, Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 expanded the scope of the Office of the State Public Defender, which had previously handled death penalty appeals, to include support and training for county-based public defender systems.
But the governor committed only $10 million in one-time grants to the effort, and that money has since run out. 
***
Nelson’s trial began in September 2009. The case hinged on Marshall’s account and Nelson’s confession. Kayfetz built much of the defense on what Shelton had discovered. 
The jury deliberated for six days and could not come to a decision. Seven jurors believed Nelson was guilty of murder, and five did not. Six believed he had kidnapped Willie, the other six did not. The judge declared a mistrial. A few weeks later, Andrus, the district attorney, announced he was dismissing the charges against Nelson and his sister-in-law, whose kidnapping case was awaiting trial. 
In a press release, Andrus said it was “the most difficult and painful decision I have made in my professional career.” He told a news reporter that his office had a heavy caseload and didn’t have the staff to prosecute the case. Andrus noted that he could always refile the charges if new evidence emerged or a new witness came forward. 
Nelson was released, but he didn’t get to go home. He had to answer for the drugs he had on him at the time of his arrest and was sent to a Humboldt County jail. 
“I left here just to be interviewed, and 16 months later I got out,” Nelson said from his home in Hoopa. “They got their hook in me, and they kept it in me. There’s nothing you can do when you’re in that situation.”

Nelson said he’s certain he would be in prison if not for Shelton. “He believed what I told him,” he said. “Without that investigator, you don’t have a chance.”
Marshall and his mother have since died. 
Shelton retired from defense investigation last year. He was initially hesitant to talk about the Nelson case and insisted that he had only been doing his job. He said he doesn’t want to be the hero of a story that is still, at its core, a tragedy. “Imagine being Bill Cook,” he said. 
Although CalMatters was unable to reach Willie’s parents, a Facebook group dedicated to his memory, which has been inactive since 2016, includes posts from family members who express the belief that Nelson is guilty. 
That’s what compounds the tragedy of the case for Kayfetz.
“They took a decades-old bandage off of these people’s hearts and just ripped it off,” she said. “It’s every kind of miscarriage of justice.”
Last year, the Siskiyou public defender’s office finally got its first staff investigator. Kayfetz said she needed to “clone him.” She cobbled together funding from a couple of new grants to hire a second, who started earlier this year. But she said it’s still not enough. 
The Nelson case, she said, “rose and fell on the quality of the investigation.”
For his part, Andrus said he doesn’t believe Shelton’s work had much impact on the case. He said the prosecutors and sheriff’s deputies had always known that Marshall was “a compromised witness.” 
“There were so many nails in the coffin of Steve Marshall’s credibility that it didn’t need more,” he said. “He was not the kind of person that we would want to rely on in a murder case.” 
He said they had a duty to “look into his statement, see if we can corroborate it.” And Nelson had confessed. The other evidence they gathered, he acknowledged, “was not very strong.” 
They pushed the case forward anyhow. 

How we reported on California’s lack of public defense investigators
To report and write this story, CalMatters reviewed police reports, case files and other materials related to the kidnapping and murder of Willie Cook and the subsequent case against Gregory Nelson. We spoke with more than 45 people and made an effort to interview everyone who is named in the article. Some people have since died, could not be reached or declined our invitation. To quote people we could not speak with directly, including Bill Cook, Steve Marshall and Marshall’s mother, we relied on transcripts from recorded interviews with law enforcement.
CalMatters also analyzed staffing data, incarceration rates and caseloads for California’s 58 counties. We obtained this data from the California Department of Justice, the Judicial Council of California and the Vera Institute of Justice, as well as from court records.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/101324-The-Investigators-MG-CM-05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234

It needs a reform that can retain its benefits and deal with its downsides.,"Guest Commentary written by

Nick Yost
Nick Yost created and formerly led the environmental section of the California Department of Justice. As general counsel of the Council on Environmental Quality under the Carter administration, he was lead draftsperson of National Environmental Policy Act regulations.


Daniel Yost
Daniel Yost is an attorney and the former mayor of Woodside. He was a founding board member of Peninsula Clean Energy.


In 1947, decades before the federal Clean Air Act, California’s leaders began regulating the causes of harmful air pollution. It was also our state that, in 2006 under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, passed arguably the most aggressive greenhouse gas reduction law in the world, setting off a global race for climate action.
California’s leadership on the environment has a well-deserved reputation.
So it is with a great deal of pride, and no small amount of sadness, that a growing flaw in the California Environmental Quality Act, one of the principle legal mechanisms we use to protect clean air and water, conserve sensitive lands and habitats and address the pollution that causes climate change, is now cause for concern. 
CEQA, as its colloquially known, embodies the proposition that you should “look before you leap” on issues that could have negative environmental or public health impacts. The law’s core legal principle holds that decisionmakers should know the environmental consequences of their actions before taking them.
This purpose remains a worthy one. Unfortunately, over time CEQA has led to unfortunate and inadvertent consequences — in particular, it is commonly used to block much-needed housing in California. But the law is not only harmful in its use: The mere threat of a CEQA lawsuit is enough to stifle new housing developments since such suits can add substantial time, cost and risk for builders who already face daunting construction costs.
The dilemma is how to retain the beneficial essence of CEQA while dealing with the downsides. A bill in the California legislature deals with this and deserves support.
Assembly Bill 609 creates an exemption from CEQA for infill housing projects that are compliant with local laws and not in environmentally sensitive locations. “Building up” in urban locations reduces development pressure on open land in outlying areas. It also reduces commute times and reduces pollution.
As a father and son with lifetimes of experience in environmental causes, we write with some ambivalence. Decades ago, one of us was responsible for the emergence of CEQA as a “super statute,” drafting the amicus brief to the California Supreme Court in Friends of Mammoth v. Mono County — the bedrock case in which the court ruled CEQA extended a public “right of action” against private activity.
Some may view any changes to CEQA as a “camel’s nose under the tent,” inevitably leading to its demise. Our view is the opposite: Like all laws, CEQA derives its social license from its good-faith application. But when a bedrock environmental law is used to cause measurable environmental harm — for example, by displacing housing developments to agricultural and open lands — that undermines political support for the law.
Thoughtful reforms such as AB 609 can maintain CEQA’s core focus on environmental protection, while enabling housing to be built more quickly, cheaply and sustainably.
For those that view climate change as one of the key issues of our time, infill housing is a critical solution. For those that want to see California’s environmental values shape the nation, without cheaper housing, California will lose population and electoral power to other states. 
After the 2030 census, projections show that California could lose four congressional districts (and four electoral college votes), while states with cheaper housing, like Texas and Florida, stand to gain.
If reducing the cost of housing alone is not enough, then for those that care about the environment and climate change, there is plenty to love in the growing push to legalize more infill homes in our cities.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/080719_LosAngeles_AW_CM_61.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234

Highly publicized immigration raids have rattled the community and prompted lawmakers to push for more laws protecting immigrants.


Hospitals. Schools. Shelters.
Those are some of the places that California lawmakers want to shield from immigration arrests and raids. They advanced a package of bills this week as President Donald Trump’s administration continues its ramped-up deportation campaign around the country. 
The Democratic-dominated Legislature can’t block federal agents from entering places where someone has allowed them to be. They also can’t stop ICE from going where officers have the  legal authority to be, such as immigration courthouses. But the bills the state Senate passed Monday push local officials to limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and to require agents to get a warrant to enter. 
One bill would bar immigration agents from entering “nonpublic” parts of schools without a warrant. Another would do the same in hospitals, and prohibit health care providers from sharing patients’ immigration status with federal authorities unless they have a warrant. Another would limit immigration agents from accessing homeless or domestic violence shelters. 
Other bills limit information sharing. One would require California health departments, when issuing birth certificates, to shield the parents’ countries of birth from the publicly viewable portion of the document. Another would require cities and counties that license street vendors — a business dominated by immigrants — from sharing information about licensees with federal authorities.
Senate Majority Leader Lena Gonzalez, a Long Beach Democrat who authored the schools bill, said she was responding to a recent string of highly publicized raids and other enforcement operations that have rattled immigrant communities and threaten to send workers, students and patients into hiding.
ICE last week raided two San Diego restaurants in a search for workers allegedly living in the country illegally, setting off a confrontation with protesters outside. Immigration agents in April showed up trying to speak with students at two Los Angeles elementary schools; school administrators turned them away. That month they also detained a group of day laborers in the parking lot of a Pomona Home Depot. 
The lawmakers’ proposals sailed through the Legislature so far, and passed the Senate this week with near-unanimous support from Democrats. They now head to the Assembly.
“Every student, regardless of their immigration status, should be given the right to a free and fair education,” Gonzalez said.

Sen. Jesse Arreguin, a Berkeley Democrat who authored the hospitals bill, said it was “about making sure that people can access health care in California without fear of being arrested or deported.”
Though Republicans generally opposed the bills, some acknowledged they were concerned about the widespread fear sown by the sight of federal agents. For Republicans, the politics of a flashy GOP-led immigration crackdown remain delicate in California, where more than one in four residents is foreign-born. 
Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil, a Modesto Republican, criticized Democrats for what she called overblowing “a problem that is very real” and said she was worried school officials would be stuck between state law and complying with federal agents’ requests or orders.
“I definitely believe we have a problem in this state, and we exacerbate that problem by continuing to instill fear in young people,” she said during debate about Gonzalez’ schools bill. “When we talk about ICE agents in masks and instill fear that way, we are doing a disservice to the educational system.”
Her Republican colleague Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh joined Democrats in voting for the bill limiting law enforcement access to schools. She opposed the other bills, including one requiring school officials to notify parents, staff and community members if immigration agents come to campus.
“When someone enters the school we always want to make sure they’re official,” the Redlands lawmaker said. “Putting in statute knowing and asking whether or not someone has a warrant or has an official capacity to enter the school, is really a no-brainer.”

California resists Trump’s immigration crackdown
Kevin Johnson, an immigration law professor and former dean of the UC Davis School of Law, said he expects the legislation, if enacted, would have a limited effect on ICE operations, given that the state is already engaged in a yearslong back-and-forth with the federal government over whether to cooperate with immigration authorities. 
The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are both trying to withhold federal funding from California over its sanctuary law that prohibits state and local police from arresting immigrants on behalf of ICE, and limits their cooperation in transferring detainees to immigration custody. Federal courts upheld the law during the last Trump administration.
In his second term, Trump is further pushing the boundaries in an aggressive effort to curb both illegal and legal forms of immigration. That includes everything from rescinding a longstanding policy of avoiding arrests in “sensitive locations” such as churches, schools and hospitals, to arresting immigrants when they show up for required check-ins or immigration court hearings, to seeking to deny U.S. citizenship from immigrants’ American-born children.
The state may have the authority to shield babies’ parents’ birthplaces from public view, Johnson said, but he theorized that if the U.S. Supreme Court allows Trump to repeal birthright citizenship, the federal government could require people to show proof of their parents’ birthplace to become an American citizen. 
“They can only do so much to limit what the federal government can do,” Johnson said of the state. “We’re in the middle of a long, protracted skirmish between the state and federal governments on immigration.”
Still, he said, forcing federal agents to get warrants to search for or arrest someone could help immigrants feel safer going out in public. 
“We at least have to get the federal government to think about complying with the law, as opposed to just sending out hordes of ICE agents wherever,” he said.
Immigrant aid groups set to lose funding

The effort to protect vulnerable immigrants comes as California nonprofits are scrambling to respond to increased enforcement and competing for limited resources. 
California spends $60 million a year on immigration legal aid and in a special session in December gave that fund a one-time boost of $10 million. 
Some Democratic lawmakers this year have backed advocates’ requests to further increase that funding even as the state stares down a $12 billion budget deficit. Gov. Gavin Newsom has already proposed other cuts to immigrants’ social services to address the shortfall. 
One program that would run out of money without new funding is the Children’s Holistic Immigration Representation Project, a pilot program started in 2022 to provide lawyers and social workers for unaccompanied minors facing deportation.
Originally slated to last through summer 2024, the program has helped about 800 immigrants who arrived as children. The California Department of Social Services has kept it going with a one-time $4.2-million boost in money originally budgeted for other immigration legal services. That money will run out at the end of June.
This year, advocates and legal service providers say they’re not expecting there to be any extra money to go around. 
When California made $5 million of the legal aid funding available this year, organizations across the state applied for six times that amount, said Lisa Hoffman, co-executive director of the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant in Berkeley. 
Hoffman said state funding helps her nonprofit pay caseworkers and attorneys to represent 50 young immigrants between ages 17 and 22. The clients, many of whom fled violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, get help with their cases and assistance enrolling in school, securing transportation and going to the doctor. 
“By investing in these services now, it prevents much more serious, longer-term problems,” she said. “Even if they are allowed to stay, but they drop out of school or don’t get the support they need, it’s going to create much bigger and more expensive problems down the road in terms of homelessness, mental health challenges.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/120224_Deportation-Protest_FG_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234
,California,2025-06-05 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California is failing to provide a vital safeguard against wrongful convictions,Anat Rubin,,,,,https://calmatters.org/investigation/2025/06/public-defense-investigators-takeaways/,"If you’re accused of a crime, will someone investigate your side of the story? In California, there’s no guarantee.","A CalMatters investigation has found that poor people accused of crimes, who account for at least 80% of criminal defendants, are routinely convicted in California without anyone investigating the charges against them. 
Close to half of California’s 58 counties do not employ any full-time public defense investigators. Among the remaining counties, defendants’ access to investigators fluctuates wildly, but it’s almost always inadequate.
The cost of this failure is steep, for individual defendants and for the integrity of California’s criminal justice system.
Defense investigators interview witnesses, visit crime scenes, review police reports and retrieve video surveillance footage that might prove the defendant was on the other side of town when a crime was committed, or that an assault was an act of self-defense. They do work that most lawyers are not trained to do. Without them, police and prosecutorial misconduct — among the most common causes of wrongful convictions — remain unchecked, significantly increasing the likelihood that people will go to prison for crimes they did not commit.
In our new investigation, we examine the consequences of this pervasive issue through a reopened kidnapping and murder case in Northern California’s Siskiyou County.
Here are the takeaways:
1. Of the 10 California counties with the highest prison incarceration rates, eight have no defense investigators on staff. 
The lack of investigators affects counties throughout the state, from poor, rural areas like Siskiyou to the state’s largest and most well-funded public defense offices. 
Los Angeles employed just 1 investigator for every 10 public defenders — one of the state’s worst ratios, according to 2023 data from the California Department of Justice. Only seven California counties met the widely accepted minimum standard of 1 investigator for every 3 attorneys.

2. The situation is most alarming in the 25 California counties that don’t have dedicated public defender offices and pay private attorneys. 
Most of these private attorneys receive a flat fee for their services, and the cost of an investigator would eat away at their profits. Some counties allow contracted attorneys to ask the court for additional funds for investigations, but court records show the attorneys rarely make those requests. 
In Kings County, which has one of the highest prison incarceration rates in California, contracted attorneys asked the court for permission to hire an investigator in 7% of criminal cases from 2018 to 2022. In Lake County, attorneys made those requests in just 2% of criminal cases over a three-year period; in Mono County, it was less than 1%. To earn a living from meager county contracts, research shows, private attorneys and firms must persuade defendants to accept plea deals as quickly as possible. An investigation is an expensive delay.
3. Prosecutors have an overwhelming advantage when it comes to investigator staffing. 
In Riverside, the district attorney has 30% more lawyers than the public defender but 500% more investigators, state data shows, in addition to the support of the county sheriff and various municipal police departments. 
This pattern repeats throughout the state. In what is supposed to be an adversarial legal system, indigent defendants and their attorneys are often on their own, facing an army of investigators who are working to secure a conviction.

4. Hidden in the data is the greatest tragedy of failing to investigate cases: wrongful convictions. 
The National Registry of Exonerations is filled with cases in which convictions were overturned when someone finally looked into the prisoner’s claims, years or even decades after they were imprisoned. 
Hundreds of those cases are in California. In one exoneration out of Fresno, Innocence Project investigators found nine witnesses who corroborated their client’s alibi: He was more than 25 miles away at a birthday party at the time of the crime. In a recent case out of Los Angeles, investigators found evidence of their client’s innocence in a police detective’s handwritten notes, material that had been included in a file turned over to the defense before trial. If their cases had been investigated on the front end, these men might have been spared a combined 30 years in prison. 
Maurice Possley, the exoneration registry’s senior researcher, said that a failure to investigate is at the heart of most of the registry’s 3,681 cases.
When he looks at the evidence that overturned these convictions, he’s astounded the defense didn’t find it when the case was being prosecuted. 
“If someone had just made the effort,” he said. “This was all sitting there.”
5. California, once a leader in public defense, has fallen far behind.
The nation’s first public defender office opened in Los Angeles in 1913. By the time the U.S. Supreme Court established in 1963 that defendants have the right to an attorney in state criminal proceedings, more than a dozen California counties were already providing free representation to poor people accused of crimes.
As the nation caught up, California slipped behind. The state kept its defender system entirely in the hands of its counties. Today, it is one of just two states — alongside Arizona — that don’t contribute any funding to trial-level public defense, according to the Sixth Amendment Center. The state does not monitor or evaluate the counties’ systems. There are no minimum standards and, for many defendants, no investigations — even in the most serious cases.
Investigations affect every part of the criminal justice process. They’re not just about figuring out whether a client is innocent. Even if a case is moving toward a plea deal, an investigation can turn up information that forces a prosecutor to reduce the charge or compels a judge to grant bond or shorten a prison sentence. 
Lawyers are discouraged from interviewing witnesses on their own. If a witness later changed their story or disappeared before trial, the attorney could have to testify on their client’s behalf and recuse themself from the case. 
6. This is a national problem.
In 2007, the Bureau of Justice Statistics conducted a census of the nation’s public defender offices. It found that 40% had no investigators on staff and that 93% failed to meet the National Association for Public Defense’s industry standard of at least 1 investigator for every 3 attorneys. 
The study made it clear that, across the country, investigators were seen as a luxury, not a necessity. CalMatters interviews with top public defenders in several states, along with recent reports examining indigent defense systems, suggest that’s still the case.
In Mississippi, only eight of the state’s 82 counties have public defender offices. The rest rely on private attorneys who are paid a flat fee — one that rarely covers the cost of an investigator. A 2018 report found that, in many Mississippi counties, with the exception of murder cases, the attorneys “never hire investigators and have no time to investigate cases themselves.” Appointed attorneys told researchers they would “get laughed out of court” for requesting additional funds for an investigator. 
Public defender systems that are funded and controlled by state legislatures also have severe investigator shortages. The head public defender in Arkansas, Greg Parrish, said he has only 12 staff investigators, responsible for assisting in felony cases, including capital cases, in all of the state’s 75 counties. Minnesota’s top public defender, William Ward, said he is trying to maintain a ratio of at least 1 investigator for every 7 public defenders but knows that’s not enough. “I would rather have a great investigator and an average lawyer than an average investigator and a great lawyer,” he said. “Investigators make all the difference on a case.”
7. New York stands as a model of how to reform the system. 
New York was once very similar to California. Its counties managed their own public defender systems, without much input or funding from the state, until a class-action lawsuit, settled in 2015, led to statewide changes. 
New York created an office tasked with improving public defense, eventually giving it some $250 million to dole out each year. Counties that take the money must prioritize certain aspects of public defense, including investigations. In a recent report to the agency overseeing the effort, these counties consistently said the ability to investigate cases was among the most profound impacts of the new funding. Some described specific cases that ended in acquittal or significantly reduced charges as a result.
California was also sued over claims it failed to provide competent defense. To settle the lawsuit, filed in Fresno County, Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 expanded the scope of the Office of the State Public Defender, which had previously handled death penalty appeals, to include support and training for county-based public defender systems.
But the governor committed only $10 million in one-time grants to the effort, and that money has since run out.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/100923_CARE-Court_AH_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 09:01:09.284234

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)An effort to mitigate devastating flooding in Ellicott City is moving forward with the announcement of two $5 million loans to complete projects that will divert storm-driven flash flooding away from downtown Ellicott City businesses.
The $10 million in loans are the first of from a state account created in 2021. In Ellicott City, the money will go toward two projects designed to move tens of thousands of gallons of floodwater per second off Main Street.
State and county officials are already looking to other projects, even as its ability to secure federal loans and disaster recovery aid remains uncertain.
“At a time when we’re watching the federal government cancel supports for emergency management and telling states and local jurisdictions that if tragedy happens, you are now on your own, in Maryland, we’re choosing to move differently and actually invest in our local jurisdictions, both in preparation and also in recovery,” Gov. Wes Moore said Wednesday as he toured the site.
Officials said the projects could be duplicated in other areas prone to similar floods including an area of western Maryland ravaged last month by flood waters.
“It’ll be used 100% here” in Maryland, said Department of Emergency Management Secretary Russ Strickland. “It’s not dependent on federal money, which, right now, obviously, we’re in a very uncomfortable situation with Washington.”
In January, President Donald Trump called for eliminating the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and FEMA in April said it was canceling funding for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, program. The move hit funding earmarked for fiscal years 2020-2023, putting roughly $1 billion in projects approved in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in jeopardy.
Scores of federal lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats — have called for BRIC funding to be restored.
The Ellicott City projects, meanwhile, will proceed with state money.

Tunneling equipment — a 300-foot long device nicknamed “Rocky” — is expected to begin cutting a channel a mile long and 18-feet wide through granite 150 feet below ground. It will stretch from the west end of Ellicott City and terminate at the Patapsco River, with the capacity to move 26,000 gallons of water per second from downtown Ellicott City to the river.
A second project, called the Maryland Avenue Culvert, will move water from the Tiber-Hudson branch to the Patapsco River.
The two projects are part of a massive effort to make the historic mill city prone to flooding more resilient.
The county is coupling the projects with water retention ponds. Three ponds, with a combined capacity of over 12 million gallons, are already been built. Others remain in the design phase.
Howard County Executive Calvin Ball (D) called it “the single largest public works project” in county history.
“When complete, these projects will work together to reduce the quantity and the velocity of water on Main Street during major flooding events, and make Ellicott City a national, if not international, model of resiliency,” Ball said.
Moore said the projects will “save lives … but also help save the community and will also help save the state money.”
“Because, you know, what’s more expensive than preparing for the next big flood? Having to recover from the next big flood — immeasurably more expensive,” he said.
Moore said every dollar spent on flood mitigation saves taxpayers “an average of $6 in return when it comes to recovery costs.”
Flood-prone Ellicott City has seen three major events since 2011, including what was called a once in a 1,000-year storm in 2016, when flooding along Main Street damaged buildings and killed two people. Two years later, another storm dumped 8 inches of rain in two hours on Ellicott City.
The floods resulted in plans to make the area more flood-resilient, demolition of some buildings, debris clean up after big storms, an alert system, automated gates to high-ground areas and the stormwater retention ponds and diversion systems.
Initial cost estimates of $82 million in 2019 had grown to $130 million four years later due to costs of expanding the project — most notably the north tunnel project — and  “external economic factors,” including inflation. But the project also grew more expensive as officials widened the diameter by 20% and more than tripled its length to a mile.
FEMA cancels $1 billion for flood prevention projects in Chesapeake Bay region

Money for the project comes from a revolving loan fund created in 2021.
“Even as we were fighting for Ellicott City, we realized that this was a bigger problem than this one town and the rest of the state could learn from us,” said Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), who sponsored the Resilient Maryland Revolving Loan Fund and who was at Wednesday’s event.
She said the Northeast has seen “a 70% increase in extreme rainfall since the 1950s and the Chesapeake Bay could rise by five feet, by 2050. I’ve seen some horrible projections where we’re looking at $19 billion worth of damage if we do not invest. But that is not what we’re doing, because we are being proactive.”
The $10 million in loans for the Ellicott City project are about half the state’s revolving account. Strickland said so far there has been little competition for the money.
Jurisdictions that use the money agree to pay it back over time. Strickland said a repayment agreement with Howard County has not been finalized.
Del. Courtney Watson (D-Howard) said Wednesday the projects in Ellicott City could be a model for other parts of the state.
“We were lucky enough to be the first to be able to put these policies in place, to be able to figure it out, to do something that’s never been done before, to solve a tedious, complex public infrastructure project and puzzle for threats that didn’t exist 20 years ago,” Watson said.
“We hope to model and assist other jurisdictions who are facing the same type of problems, such as Westernport,” she said.
More than 5 inches of rain fell in Allegany and Garrett Counties on May 14, triggering flash floods that overwhelmed roads, schools and homes, and damaged utilities. Areas including Westernport and Lonaconing were some of the hardest hit. Moore declared a state of emergency in the region — an early step toward seeking aid from FEMA.
Strickland said initial damage estimates could be completed as early as next week. The threshold for seeking federal aid comes in at around $12 million, he said.
“I think we’re going to meet that,” Strickland said.
Strickland said he’s “cautiously optimistic” that federal aid will still come through, but is also looking at contingency plans. One such plan would use money from the state’s disaster recovery fund as well as a catastrophic event fund.
When asked if the funds could cover the potential $12 million in damages, Strickland said: “I think it would be very close.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)President Donald Trump recently signed a resolution expanding motorized access to remote regions surrounding Lake Powell. 
The resolution — sponsored by Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy — overturns a policy from the National Park Service that limits where off-road vehicles can drive in parts of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. 
Under the rule, which was implemented during the Biden administration, conventional vehicles were still allowed to travel existing routes within the recreation area. But about 25 roads amounting to roughly 26 miles were closed to specialized off-road vehicles, like dirtbikes, ATVs or side-by-sides. 
Maloy and other members of Utah’s congressional delegation say the resolution allows for greater recreation opportunities in the area, and criticized the Biden-era rule for going against the will of locals. Opponents to the resolution, which included Democrats in Congress and a number of environmental groups, argue that expanding vehicle access could cause severe damage to the region’s most sensitive and pristine environments.
“Orange Cliffs, Gunsight Butte, and Canyonlands National Park’s Maze District will be impaired by noisy, destructive off-highway vehicles. It’s a dark day for all who love Southern Utah and Glen Canyon’s wild places.’’ said Hanna Larsen, a staff attorney for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, in a statement last month.

The resolution, which passed the House in April, the Senate in May and was signed by Trump on May 23, invokes the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to review and overturn federal rules.
It’s the latest in nearly two decades of political back-and-forth over motorized recreation in Glen Canyon. 
For years, environmental groups criticized the National Park Service for its loose regulation of off-road vehicles around the recreation area. In 2005, groups sued over the lack of enforcement. In  2008, the service settled and agreed to create an off-road vehicle management plan. 
Then in 2021, the first Trump administration released a new plan that opened up much of the recreation area to all kinds of motorized use. 
The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance sued two years later, arguing the administration’s plan failed to take all of the environmental impacts into consideration. The National Park Service settled again, agreeing to close the Lake Powell shoreline to motorized use, unless water levels were “sustainable.” It also put restrictions on ATV and side-by-side use in certain areas.
In January, the park service rule officially went into effect. Maloy said in a statement Tuesday that her resolution was a result of constituent concerns over the rule’s “nonsensical restrictions on motorized access.”
“We took legislative action and, through this (Congressional Review Act), reversed a rule pushed through by the previous administration. Utahns shouldn’t be shut out of decisions that affect their own backyard. Now we can continue to recreate in the National Recreation Area. Thank you to our Senators for working with me to get this done for Utah,” Maloy said.

Utah’s two Republican senators, Mike Lee and John Curtis, also celebrated the resolution becoming law. Curtis called it an “an important step to ensure our public lands remain open to the people.” Lee said it makes it clear that “environmental groups don’t get to dictate our National Recreation Areas through backroom deals.” 
“This was a classic case of sue-and-settle policymaking where bureaucrats caved to activists and cut Americans out of the process. That’s not how representation is supposed to work,” Lee said in a statement. “I’m proud President Trump signed this CRA into law.” 
Managed by the National Park Service, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was formed in 1972 and borders several national parks and monuments, like Bears Ears, Capitol Reef and Canyonlands. It covers Lake Powell, the second-largest reservoir in the country, which attracts millions of visitors each year. In 2023, the service recorded more than 4.7 million visits.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020225_Lake-Powell_16-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 08:09:34.853824

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Employees’ Insurance Board (SEIB) has narrowed its search for a CEO to three finalists from an initial pool of 49 individuals.
Members of the SEIB executive committee on Wednesday laid out a timeline for the final selection process, which started after William Ashmore, the board’s outgoing CEO of SEIB, which oversees health insurance for state employees, announced his retirement in March. The three remaining candidates were selected after initial screenings and interviews conducted by ITAC Solutions, a Birmingham-based recruiting firm, based on criteria established by the board, including leadership and industry experience.
“I believe that the list does reflect a strong group of individuals who will align competencies,” said Charles Baughman, a consultant with ITAC Solutions, which conducted the candidate search for the board.

After the meeting, Ashmore said that “as far as (he knows),” Sally Corley, chief operating officer of the board, was one of the three candidates selected to interview for the position. Corley has worked for the board since 2013 and was the board director of government affairs before becoming COO.
“With her 12 years of experience (with SEIB), she was one of the most qualified internal candidates we had,” Ashmore said after the meeting, adding that she expressed interest in the position.
Corley would be the first woman to lead the board. Prior to Ashmore’s tenure as CEO, which started in 1988, the board was under the Retirement Systems of Alabama and led by CEO David Bronner.
Corley said in a text message that she applied for the position but still did not know if she was a finalist.
The selection process will proceed as follows:

Finalist information will be presented to the board chair for distribution to the full board, allowing members to review the materials and prepare questions.
The executive committee will interview the candidates in an open meeting on June 16, using questions submitted in advance by the full board.
At the end of the June 16 meeting, the executive committee will vote to select their preferred candidate and present that recommendation to the full board.
The full board will convene on June 18 to hold a final vote on whether to accept or reject the executive committee’s recommendation.

Ashmore said during the meeting that his timeline for retirement is flexible to allow a smooth transition. A new hire could potentially start as soon as July 1, but the board agreed that an external candidate, especially one from out of state, may need at least a month after being hired.
“If the need is not there, then I’ll go ahead and retire on July 1,” Ashmore said.

,California,2025-06-05 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"California’s deficit dilemma: Cut spending, borrow money or raise taxes?",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/california-budget-deficit-dilemma/,"Gov. Gavin Newsom estimated there's a nearly $20 billion hole in the budget, but if lawmakers restore his Medi-Cal cuts the hole could grow $10 billion larger.","The California Legislature has just a few days to pass a 2025-26 state budget to meet the state constitution’s June 15 deadline.
The deadline will be met, if for no other reason than legislators would, at least theoretically, have their salaries suspended were they to miss it.
However, the budget they enact may bear only a passing resemblance to what will eventually, perhaps many months later, become a complete fiscal plan.
The revised budget that Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a month ago projects that general fund tax revenues for the year would be about $20 billion short of covering the spending that he has proposed — and that’s after counting the billions of dollars in reductions, primarily in health care and other services for the poor, he’s asked the Legislature to swallow. 
Newsom would roll back expansions that he and legislators happily enacted when they erroneously believed the state had a huge surplus. Newsom now says the cuts are necessary to balance the budget — although it would still have, by his own numbers, the $20 billion gap between income and outgo that he would cover with temporary fixes, such as on- and off-the-books borrowing, tapping emergency reserves and accounting gimmicks. He plans to tap $7.1 billion from the budget rainy day fund, bringing the shortage closer to $12 billion. 
So that’s the dilemma. Newsom and legislators are getting very heavy pressure from advocates for the endangered services, such as Medi-Cal coverage for undocumented immigrants, to back off. However, restoring them in the budget would cost about $10 billion, thus increasing the state’s chronic deficit and requiring either reductions in other spending categories or more short-term patches.
The dilemma’s large amounts of money, uncertainty about the effects of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and proposed federal spending reductions — and ideological divisions among Capitol Democrats over what to do — all point to the passage of a paper budget to meet the constitutional deadline while debate and negotiations continue indefinitely.
Underlining the situation is an acknowledgement by the administration, backed up by the Legislature’s budget analyst, Gabe Petek, that the hole in the budget is what’s called a “structural deficit,” meaning that spending now on the books is $10 to $20 billion a year higher than expected revenues.
Petek’s office has calculated that since Newsom became governor in 2019, spending has risen by an average of 9% a year while revenues have increased by just 6% a year, and if the gap continues, the state’s debt from borrowing could reach $42 billion within a few years.
The bottom line of all these numbers is that no matter what they do on this budget, it will continue to leak red ink until there is a day of reckoning.
There is another way out of the conundrum if the Capitol’s politicians want to take it — raise taxes.
Labor unions, advocates of health care and social programs and the most left-leaning members of the Legislature want to do it. Various taxation schemes are floating around the Capitol, mostly suggesting raising taxes on corporations to avoid directly taxing voters.
In its recent review of the state’s budget situation, Petek’s office raises the tax increase alternative, saying it “ultimately is a difficult judgment call for the Legislature” with political consequences as well as financial ones.
Newsom — who’s clearly looking ahead to what he’ll do after his governorship ends 19 months hence — has repeatedly rejected tax increases, preferring to get through each year with short-term fixes.
Moreover, increasing corporate taxes would amplify the state’s image as having an extraordinarily difficult and expensive business climate.
Will Democrats, who have complete control over the state finances, bite the bullet by either rolling back spending or increasing taxes, or will they, as former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was fond of saying, merely “kick the can down the road?”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121923_MediCal-Expansion_LJ_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-05 08:09:34.853824

A message seeking comment from Shaw was left Wednesday morning.
Dunham and her husband had their daughter Aria through in-vitro fertilization (IVF), which they had to seek outside of Alabama. The Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February 2024 that frozen embryos outside the womb are “children,” which caused fertility clinics in the state to close.
“No family should have to leave their home state to pursue the dream of parenthood,” she said. “I know what it means to desperately want a child, to fight for that chance, and to finally hold that miracle in your arms. That empathy drives my career, my faith and my life, and it’s why I’m stepping up now.”
Associate Justice Jay Mitchell, who wrote the majority opinion in the ruling, is running for Alabama attorney general in 2026.
Lawmakers quickly passed a bill in March 2024 intended to provide the clinics immunity, and most services resumed. The bill did not address the court ruling that frozen embryos were unborn children.
Dunham is currently a referee in Jefferson County’s Juvenile Court and an attorney at Magic City Fertility Law, helping couples navigate the legal complexities of assisted reproduction, according to the release. As a referee, Dunham conducts hearings and makes findings like a judge would, but her decisions are not final.

After a pandemic-era pause, repayments on defaulted student loans restarted last month, and many borrowers are running into barriers. (Photo by Seth Wenig/The Associated Press)Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of information about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
Universities try 3-year degrees to save students time, money

When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults. After 90 days without a payment, the delinquency will be reported to credit bureaus. For two types of loans, they go into default after 270 days —about nine months — without a payment.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to cancel or reduce $400 billion worth of debt for 43 million Americans. His administration did, however, forgive loans for millions under other programs.
That includes nearly 48,000 South Carolinians who got their debts reduced or wiped out, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Biden’s already reduced SC student loans by $2.6B. Clyburn hopes newest plan secures more votes.

But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.
Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
 ‘Can’t wait for Washington’

Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
These South Carolinians owed more than $120,000 in student loans. Now their debt is forgiven.

Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
 Repayment

Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
Scholarship program that enables debt-free college now available in 13 SC counties

“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
 ‘Incentive to hike prices’

Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

Joe Lombardo’s wide-ranging crime bill to stiffen penalties for DUI offenses, retail theft, and crimes on the Las Vegas Strip died because the Nevada State Legislature simply ran out of time.
In the final hours of the session, the state Senate and Assembly passed slightly different versions of Senate Bill 457 with overwhelming bipartisan support, but the Senate was forced to adjourn before it could take a second vote to approve the last-minute amendments added by the Assembly.
Its death underscores the risk of rushing complex public policy through the legislative process at the last minute.
The bill was first introduced in early April, but it was only in the final five days of the session that the policy was publicly debated, amended, amended again, and voted on. As it raced toward the finish line, there were myriad unanswered questions around the fiscal cost of implementing the bill, as well as the interpretation of last-minute amendments.
At one point, hours before the Legislature’s midnight deadline, ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah told lawmakers the bill, and the process for passing it, was plagued with red flags.
“It is a joke that this body, this committee is forced to hear this at 5 p.m. on sine die,” Haseebullah said, referring to the term used to mark the end of a legislative session. “We are now here being told this is what needs to be passed because, what? Democrats need to seem tough on crime. This is not tough on crime. It’s stupid and reckless. It’s totally unacceptable. You should not have been put in this position. It’s an embarrassment.”
Hours later, Haseebullah and other opponents of AB457 would find an unexpected ally in state Sen. Ira Hansen and the rest of the Senate Republicans. The caucus, angry about an unrelated resolution, began a series of parliamentary motions to slow down voting. The crime bill was incidentally one of the victims.
While opponents of the crime bill were relieved at the end result, the process has left a bad taste.
Haseebullah noted the bill was changing frequently in its final hours that the lawmakers “couldn’t possibly have fully read within a 2-hour window” before voting on it.
“The fact that the bill didn’t receive a vote after this much backdoor dealing is probably karmic,” he said in a statement. “I almost feel bad for the Governor at this point because he went from purporting to address theft issues to having his bill turned into a nefarious attempt to bolster the power of the resorts and to allow warrantless wiretapping of Nevadans. You almost can’t make this up.”
‘Nobody gets what they want’
Lombardo’s bill “Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act” was introduced April 7, the 64th day of the 120-day session.
Since its first hearing May 28, the bill received persistent criticism from groups not involved with drafting the bill language. Public defenders, the ACLU and criminal reform advocates argued that the bill lacked any input from opponents.
John Piro with the Clark County Public Defender’s office added the bill also lacked any data to support proponents’ claims that it was needed to address safety issues. 
Washoe County District Attorneys took the lead on the bill presentation, which also received proposed amendments by the Nevada Resorts Association.
The versions of the bill lawmakers voted on Monday sought harsher penalties for people who destroy property while committing theft, stronger punishment for children who assault teachers, and enhanced penalties for people who assault hospitality workers. The Assembly version also would have enabled Clark County to re-establish a court specific to prosecuting crimes within the Las Vegas Strip resort corridor.
The Senate passed the bill 20-1 at 2:12 p.m. Monday Democratic state Sen. James Ohrenschall cast the lone dissenting vote. 
The Assembly voted 36-6 to pass an amended version of the bill at 11:15 p.m. Democratic Assemblymembers Venicia Considine, Tanya Flannagan, Jovan Jackson, Selena La Rue Hatch, Cinthia Zermeño Moore, and Erica Roth opposed.
What made it to – but not over –  the finish line was markedly different from what Lombardo originally proposed. 
While campaigning for governor, Lombardo, then Clark County sheriff, pledged to roll back modest criminal justice reforms passed in 2019 that lowered penalties for non-violent theft and drug crimes and increased access to diversion programs.
SB 457’s initial version proposed reducing the felony threshold for theft from $1,200 to $750 and changing the state’s bail process by excluding holidays from the 48-hour mandatory hearing provisions. 
These provisions were stripped from the bill.
What remained in the bill through several revisions was harsher punishments for people charged with repeated felony DUIs, stalking and possession of child pornography.
It also stricter punishment for youth who commit repeated crimes against teachers or social service workers, while also limiting eligibility for diversion programs for those convicted of felony abuse, neglect or exploitation of children or the elderly.
During the Senate vote, Democratic state Sen. Melanie Scheible encouraged lawmakers to vote for the legislation, saying it focused on “smash and grab crimes” and improved DUI statutes.
“SB 457 is a comprehensive public safety bill that ensures we have safety for people who work in our schools, shop at our businesses and people who drive on our roads,” Scheible said. “SB 457 has been a collaborative effort between stakeholders, primarily between myself and the governor’s office.”
After the bill passed the Senate, it was heard by the Assembly Judiciary Committee at 4 p.m. Monday. At that meeting, the Nevada Resort Association emerged to pitch its own proposed amendments. The Nevada Independent around that time reported that the amendment was being pushed by the NRA and the Culinary Union.
The provisions of the bill added behind the scenes by the NRA requires Clark County to adopt ordinance that “designates the geographic boundaries of one or more corridors in which the commission of crime poses a significant risk to public safety and the economic welfare of this State due to the high concentration of tourists at the resort association’s request.”
The bill would prohibit anyone who violates the ordinance from entering the resort corridor for at least a year. 
Nevada Resort Association lobbyist Matt Griffin said the group first submitted the amendment to the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Scheible, several weeks ago. 
Haseebullah told lawmakers that if it was submitted three weeks ago and the ACLU and public defenders only learned about it Monday, that in itself is a red flag. 
“It is totally unprofessional beyond measure,” he said during the hearing. “I don’t know if that lies at the governor’s steps or at Chair Scheible’s steps.”
In a statement to the Current, a spokesperson for the Nevada Senate Democratic Caucus wrote that Scheible did incorporate concerns for a variety of people, adding, “just like with any piece of legislation, nobody gets everything they want.”

Thomas Sheng/U.S. Marine Corps)The University of Maryland Global Campus should pay out $69 million to run out the contracts of two independent businesses it created that came under sharp criticism from legislators and legislative auditors last year.
That was the recommendation of the University System of Maryland’s Board of Regents Finance Committee, which quickly voted Wednesday to extend the $46 million-a-year contract for UMGC Ventures for another 18 months, while the online university works to pull it and another spun-off unit back in-house.
Ventures handles the online UMGC’s information technology services, and the university is “not currently positioned to perform these functions in-house,” the resolution said as justification for the extension.
The resolution notes that it does not increase the current contract with Ventures, which handles UMGC’s information technology services, but merely extends it a current rates. The contract will start July 1 and run through Dec. 31, 2026, the length of time UMCG officials said it will take reintegrate Ventures and the other independent unit called AccelerEd, a subsidiary of Ventures.
“The requested contract extension does not increase the annual contract from the current value of fiscal year 25,” UMGC President Gregory Fowler told the committee via Zoom. “But it does provide us with a necessary runway to implement the reintegration services without disruption of these, which are critical IT services as we are trying to move forward.”
Fowler said a consulting firm had been hired to craft a reintegration plan and assess the university’s relationship with the two units.
“I just want to say thank you for dealing with a difficult situation, and for your summary that you sent out,” committee member William T. “Bill” Wood said during the brief discussion on the issue. “That was really helpful to read that and understand,. And congratulations on almost getting through the whole thing.”
“Thank you, Regent Wood,” Fowler said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The move to reintegrate offices came after a critical August 2024 audit completed by the state Office of Legislative Audits (OLA), which stated the online university’s creation of AccelerEd and Ventures cost too much money and appeared to skirt normal university procedures.
UMGC created the two companies under a University System of Maryland policy called the High Impact Economic Development Activities program. Under HIEDA, campuses in the system are allowed to give preferential treatment to businesses they spin off, under specific circumstances.
According to the audit, the campus created Ventures in 2016 as a tax-exempt holding company for UMGC businesses that the university seeded with $15 million. A year later, UMGC spun off its information technology office into AccelerEd.
Ventures had $215.3 million in revenues from fiscal years 2017 to 2022, the audit said, but about $198.1 million of that came from UMGC. And of the $198.1 million, about $184 million of those service agreements were made without competitive bids and with little oversight afterward, the audit said.
While HIEDA policy doesn’t require institutions to seek competitive bids, the audit noted that “the law does not mandate exclusive use of these entities.”
University officials defended the arrangement in the audit, and when they appeared before the joint committee nearly three months later, in a November hearing, they said they still stood by “the intent” of the program, even if there were issues in how that intent was executed.
The university hired Attain Partners of McLean, Virginia, to study the companies, with a plan focused on seven areas that included governance and leadership alignment, communication and change management, finance and budgeting and technology.
According to an executive summary Attain presented in May, Ventures and AccelerEd helped create 174 jobs , supported St. Mary’s College of Maryland and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, provided $1.5 million in scholarships and established three technology programs.
The summary also highlighted legal advice offered by Florida-based Holland & Knight, which has a Washington, D.C., office. It said Ventures met its IRS designations and complied with UMGC rules by conducting business “on an arm’s length basis.”
Some members of Ventures’ board of directors were not appointed by the university, governor or executive authority, so its board didn’t require a quorum, and the university “has no veto power or ability to reverse decisions,” the consultant’s report said.
“It does not appear that Ventures would be subject to audit by UMGC or the University System of Maryland without either volunteering to do so or judicial deliberation,” according to the summary.
Among Attain’s recommendations was to develop “a 12–18-month implementation plan to incorporate the necessary frameworks, mechanisms, and structures within Ventures to support the commercialization lifecycle,” and it said that if UMGC absorbed AccelerEd’s staff and services back into the university, it “addresses the majority of OLA audit concerns.”
The Finance Committee’s recommendation will be presented to the full Board of Regents, which is scheduled June 13 at 8 a.m. at the University System of Maryland at Hagerstown.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7759030-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-05 08:09:34.853824

(Getty Images)Indiana education officials presented the first draft of a sweeping new school accountability framework Wednesday, marking a major step toward replacing the state’s previous A-F grading system with a model that instead “values the unique skills and strengths of each student.”
The proposal, shared at the Indiana State Board of Education’s June meeting, outlines a point-based system designed to measure a broader range of student outcomes — from academic proficiency to work-based learning and attendance, as well as soft skills like communication and collaboration. 
The school performance model is still in development and must undergo a months-long rulemaking process that includes multiple rounds of public comment and revisions. 










The model no longer evaluates schools based on how well all of their students do on a single assessment.


– Ron Sandlin, Indiana Department of Education’s chief innovation officer


A final version is expected to be adopted by the state board by December. State law now requires the first round of school grades under the new system to be issued in fall 2026.
“This model is intentionally designed to encourage schools to support and nurture the unique skills and strengths of each student,” said Ron Sandlin, Indiana Department of Education’s (IDOE) chief innovation officer, who co-presented the draft. “The model no longer evaluates schools based on how well all of their students do on a single assessment. Rather, it shifts, and it evaluates schools on their ability to help individual students be on track for postsecondary success.”
What the new model could include
The shift is part of a broader effort mandated by House Enrolled Act 1498, signed into law earlier this year. The legislation, authored by Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, requires the state education board to adopt a new school accountability model by December 2025, with implementation beginning in the 2026–27 school year. 
The move follows a years-long push to update Indiana’s previous A-F grading system, which has been effectively suspended since 2018 amid transitions in state testing and COVID-related disruptions. 
During the pause, schools instead received performance report cards posted online. The cards offered data on test scores, graduation rates, attendance, and postsecondary readiness, but stopped short of assigning a single letter grade.

Supporters of a revamped system, including Republican Gov. Mike Braun and key GOP lawmakers, maintain that it provides needed clarity and transparency for parents. But critics, including some Democrats and educators, have warned against oversimplifying complex school dynamics when evaluating overall performance.
The new system, as proposed, aligns closely with Indiana’s recently redesigned high school diploma and the state’s “Graduates Prepared to Succeed” (GPS) characteristics — a set of five competencies state leaders say matter most to lifelong success: academic mastery, work ethic, communication and collaboration, civic and digital literacy, and career readiness.
Under the draft framework, schools would earn points based on student outcomes at four key checkpoints.
Each student’s “score” combines academic mastery — such as ILEARN or SAT performance — with additional indicators including regular attendance, completion of college-level coursework, progress in English language acquisition, and participation in work-based learning or credential programs.

For example, a hypothetical third-grade student who scores just below proficiency in math but passes the IREAD reading exam and maintains high attendance would earn 90 points under the proposed model — compared to zero points under the current A–F system.
“That student is on track,” Sandlin said. “We want to support and cultivate their interests and strengths, and this model values that.”
In third grade, evaluations would specifically assess “essential” math and literacy using ILEARN standardized test scores. Third grade reading proficiency and “regular attendance” rates would be factored in, too.
ILEARN scores would also be used to determine academic mastery for students in grades 4–8. But other points could be earned for good attendance rates, for high percentages of students proficient in science and social studies, and for “advanced” students who take accelerated coursework before high school. 
By the end of ninth grade, students should have earned at least 10 high school credits. Evaluations for high schools would also factor in student participation in college and career ready coursework; proficiency on a biology-specific standardized test; PSAT scores; school attendance; and English language learner progress. 
Accountability points for 12th grade could additionally be earned based on SAT proficiency, and if students complete any of the following: a new diploma “seal,” work-based learning, or a credential of value. Like at other checkpoints, school attendance and English language learner advances would also qualify for points.
Positive feedback so far — and more to come
Board members and school leaders largely praised the more “student-centered approach” at Wednesday’s meeting.
“I think our new accountability model completes the story for students,” said board member Byron Ernest. “We are creating, now, an environment where we can finally tell that story, and  just applaud that and encourage us to keep that. … This makes our accountability truly student-driven. It’s not about the school. It’s about the student.”
The draft rule proposes awarding maximum points to high school students who graduate with an “honors plus” diploma seal. 
Indiana Education Secretary Katie Jenner emphasized that those credentials now carry “real currency” in Indiana and can lead to automatic admission at public universities, guaranteed interviews with major employers, or advancement opportunities in the military.
Indiana education officials green-light high school diploma overhaul

IDOE’s Chief Strategy Officer Jacqueline Kronk noted that the model was shaped by more than a year of stakeholder feedback, including input from educators, parents, industry leaders and community members.
“This hasn’t been altered or updated in over 10 years, and so obviously we need to think through the additive process and the change management,” she said.
A 30-day public comment period will begin later this summer once the draft rule is officially published. A second round of revisions is expected before the board votes on a final version in December.
“We have zero intention or plan (to adjust) those cut scores to make it easier on schools and kids. We want to keep that rigor and that standard high in Indiana and be very honest about where we are,” Jenner said. “But we want to see the full picture of each child, because so often, when you just do pass or fail … you sometimes lose students in those models.”
“We want to hear from Indiana to get this landed in the best possible spot in December,” she continued. “And we know … we’ll get to the best spot by humbly listening and refining.”
Feedback can be submitted via a QR code or online portal once the rule is published. Department officials will also host additional focus groups and public hearings this fall.
“This is a really good rough draft,” said board member B.J. Watts. “And I think, as we’ve shown before with the diploma work, this board listens.”
