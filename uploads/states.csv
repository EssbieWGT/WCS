(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Since June of this year, the Trump administration has deployed — or attempted to deploy — federalized National Guard troops to several major U.S. cities against the wishes of state governors. In doing so, the administration has sought to test a legal theory that would broadly expand the president’s ability to deploy military forces on the homefront, on his orders alone. Litigation over these actions has reached the U.S. Supreme Court’s “emergency” docket, in a case involving the deployment of federalized National Guard troops to Chicago.
One of the last times the court spoke to such issues was in 1990, in a case involving former Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich. In Perpich v. Department of Defense, the court held that if the president had lawfully federalized National Guard troops, they could be ordered to attend training operations in overseas locations. (National Guard troops serve a dual state and federal role).
The facts in the current case are much different — involving the deployment of federalized troops to support civil authorities enforcing laws inside the United States. In the Chicago case, U.S. District Court Judge April Perry held that the administration had not met the legal threshold necessary to mobilize troops for domestic deployment.
In a separate case, U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer was even more pointed when he ruled that the administration had violated federal law when it sent California National Guard troops to Los Angeles.
“Contrary to Congress’s explicit instruction,” Breyer wrote. “federal troops executed the laws.”
The administration’s push for broad authority to deploy the military on the homefront has been uniformly opposed by Democrats, but has not yet generated substantial push-back from conservatives despite their opposition in decades past.
In 1993, a standoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidian religious group ended in a fiery conflagration in Waco, Texas. Four federal agents and six Davidians died during a gunfight that erupted during a “dynamic entry” SWAT raid on the Davidians’ headquarters.
The federal government then provided military equipment (courtesy of the U.S. military’s Joint Task Force 6) and Special Forces advisors to the FBI, which conducted a paramilitary raid on the Davidian compound. A fire broke out in the course of the raid, killing 75 Davidians — including 25 children — according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
The Waco raid — including the use of military assets against civilians — alarmed the political right. In the fall of 1993, I traveled with a colleague to a conference in Vevay, Indiana, to conduct television interviews with attendees concerned about Waco and its legacy. The conference brought together a variety of conservative activists, along with former military and intelligence personnel alarmed by the drift of federal agencies towards aggressive, paramilitary-style domestic operations. The FBI’s use of military assets at Waco came just a year after that same agency had employed paramilitary tactics during a raid at Ruby Ridge, Idaho. In the course of that operation, FBI snipers mistakenly killed the wife of a man accused of selling a sawed-off shotgun to a federal informant.
The concerns raised at the Vevay conference were part of a much longer tradition. Since its founding, America has harbored a historical aversion to “standing armies,” as witnessed by the Third Amendment’s prohibition against quartering troops and other features of the U.S. Constitution. While provision has been made for the deployment of federal military forces in true emergency situations (as well as for the use of National Guard troops in state-level emergencies), federal law has placed multiple constraints upon the domestic use of the military.
The principal legal barrier is the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the ability of the U.S. military to “execute the laws” unless another statute provides for an exception. Where those exceptions are found — such as in the federal Insurrection Act — specific requirements must be met before federal forces can be utilized. Those requirements are intended to prevent federal military forces from becoming just another domestic policy tool that presidents can use at will.
In the wake of the Vevay conference, I conducted multiple interviews with people on the right who highlighted the risks of unchecked domestic military activity. I spoke with Gene Wheaton, a federal security contractor and 30-year military veteran. Wheaton characterized himself as a conservative patriot, alarmed by the growing militarization of the home-front.
The use of military assets at Waco, he noted, was made possible by an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act that Congress had passed to enable military assistance for counter-drug operations. (This was the genesis of Joint Task Force 6). Wheaton saw this slow erosion as a major problem.
“While I was in the military, we were instructed that the Posse Comitatus Act was sacrosanct, and we should never, ever become involved in the areas of civilian law enforcement,” he said. “We’re out there to go after the enemy, not after our own citizens that we’re there to protect.”
Similar issues were flagged by Larry Pratt, then-president of Gun Owners of America.  Pratt’s organization had been so concerned about the potential for domestic military use that it commissioned a legal review of how and when a presidential administration might deploy military forces against its own citizens, and it criticized exceptions drawn up for military support to civilian counter-drug efforts.
“We have got the result of a War on Drugs that has increasingly been used to water down, by law, the barrier that had been drawn up by the Posse Comitatus law,” Pratt told me. “So that the military is no longer more than arms-length from civilian law enforcement. And as a result, not surprisingly, since the military function is not compatible with the Bill of Rights, the Bill of Rights has suffered.”
Pratt feared that “emergency” exceptions in various federal statutes could be improperly exploited to normalize future, domestic use of the military.
With its recent state-side troop deployments, the Trump administration has pointed to statutes identified in Pratt’s legal review — stretching the definitions of “emergency” and “rebellion” to justify domestic deployments in circumstances that far exceed the plain text of those laws.
Conservatives of a generation ago raised concerns about the exact kinds of military operations that are occurring on the streets of America today. For them, Waco and Ruby Ridge provided ample evidence of the danger posed by military operations “bleeding in” to civilian law enforcement — distorting the missions of both institutions.
Wheaton spoke about this explicitly. “The military is meant to fight wars,” he told me. “It is not geared, set up, psychologically trained, or physically trained in any way, shape, or form, to be a law enforcement organization.”
When issues of National Guard federalization were last heard at the U.S. Supreme Court (in the wake of legal action by Perpich), the court had a narrow issue (overseas military training) to decide.
The issues that are now before the court could have much wider impacts. In a sign that the court may have misgivings about the breadth of President Trump’s claimed powers, the parties were directed to submit additional briefing on a question that cuts against the administration’s core legal arguments.
While litigation continues, there is also a deeper political question at play — whether traditional small-government conservatism will re-assert itself, and help diffuse Trump’s military brinksmanship.
The answer to that question will have profound effects on the shape of both American conservatism — and presidential power — for years to come.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/losangelesnationalguard-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The Nevada Resort Association and a host of other business and industry groups are backing a fast-tracked bill they claim would codify into state law what is already standard business practice in the state. But attorneys who have represented workers in lawsuits against those companies say the proposed legislation would weaken worker protections.
The question at the heart of the issue is: What sort of ancillary activities should be considered work and be compensated for? And what isn’t?
Senate Bill 8 was introduced on Saturday, the third day of the special legislative session, and presented to the Senate Committee on Jobs and Economy by the lobbyists for the Nevada Resorts Association and Vegas Chamber that same day.
On Sunday, the committee advanced the bill to the full Senate, which voted to declare it an emergency measure and allow an immediate vote. SB8 then passed the full Senate with overwhelming support. Only Democratic state Sens. Skip Daly and Edgar Flores opposed.
The bill now goes to the Assembly for consideration.
SB8 was prompted by an advance opinion filed by the Nevada Supreme Court on Oct. 31 that unanimously declared that the state had never incorporated into law the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, which amended the Federal Labor Standards Act and defined what activities employers can consider noncompensable and what activities must be considered work and paid for.
The District Court of Nevada asked Nevada’s high court to weigh in on the legal issue because of a pandemic era case, Malloy v. Amazon. The online retail giant, which operates several warehouses in the state, during the height of the pandemic instituted mandatory covid testing of employees before shifts. The company did not pay those employees for the time spent undergoing testing.
Amazon argued mandatory testing was a noncompensable activity. Under Portal-to-Portal, employers do not have to pay workers for activities that are “preliminary” or “postliminary” to their main job duties — like the commute to work.
SB8 would have the state adopt certain provisions of the Portal-to-Portal Act. It would also, courtesy of an adopted amendment proposed by the Nevada Mining Association, provide retroactive legal immunity to companies over potential violations.
Paul Moradkhan, a lobbyist for Vegas Chamber, and Paul Trimmer, a lawyer for the Nevada Resort Association, told lawmakers that businesses have been operating for decades on the belief that the principles in the Portal-to-Portal Act were law in Nevada.
The recent Nevada Supreme Court opinion upends that, creating an unstable regulatory environment and opening them up to liability, Moradkhan said.
The Nevada Mining Association testified that, because of Malloy, one national law firm has targeted their industry and state, filing multiple class-action lawsuits.
Nevada Resort Association President Virginia Valentine said businesses “will be forced to make significant, immediate changes to how workplaces function.” She used the example of an employee dining room, gym or on-site daycare, saying casinos would stop offering them.
Valentine said passage of SB8 would be a maintaining of the status quo.
Joshua Buck, the attorney in the Malloy case who also presented his opposition to lawmakers during the hearing, rejected that narrative.
“I can believe in aliens,” he told the Current in an interview. “That’s my own status quo. I believe in aliens, and I’ve been believing them since I was 10. Does that mean there are aliens?”
Buck said the examples being bandied about by proponents were hyperbolic red herrings. Employers requiring workers to come in for a pre-shift meeting before they clock in is a more accurate example of the issue, he said. Or a hotel worker being told to report to their supervisor for an assignment, that employee having to wait around a significant amount of time because the supervisor was busy, and telling them to clock in after they physically reported to their station.
One case referenced numerous times in the hearing involved a theft-security screening that Amazon required its employees to undergo after leaving their shift. According to Buck, an attorney on that case, the workers were spending 20 minutes in mandatory “airport-like” security screening and not getting paid for it. In response to litigation, the retail giant changed that process.
Sen. Daly, whose background is in organized labor, in the hearing said he recognized that some labor and wage laws in the state might need to be addressed with the Malloy opinion. But he said he opposes the proposed solution being pushed in SB8.
“The adoption of these rules without additional protections will result in less protection for workers in this state,” Daly told his fellow senators before the vote. “It will take away (from) those employees, who have a legitimate claim, the right to seek their compensation.”
One of those ongoing court cases that would be thrown out by SB8 goes back to 2024, well before the Nevada Supreme Court issued the opinion that prompted the proposed legislation, according to Daly.
In the Senate committee hearing, Daly referenced a potential future amendment to add language about workers being paid when under the direction and control of the employer.
“Without that provision, workers will suffer,” he said. “When we get this thing to the other side (the Assembly), and if the AFL-CIO can pull their head out and try to get something done, we need to go from there.”
While no less than a dozen employers testified in support of the bill, no groups other than the trial lawyers who presented in the hearing publicly testified in opposition to the bill.
“You want my assessment on that? Everybody, all the other people, are dealing with the motion picture bill,” said Buck, referencing the Summerlin studio bill. “This is why this particular bill should never be rammed through in a special session. It’s intentionally being rammed through in a special session so no one has any eyes on it.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Medicaidwork.jpg,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

Kelly Keck
Kelly Keck has a child with special needs and is a neonatal nurse practitioner


When my daughter’s development stalled and then regressed, her bright personality dimmed. Doctors said to wait. 
But as a clinician I suspected she needed urgent help — the kind that Early Start, California’s early intervention program, provides. What I feared most was losing the spark that made her unique.
Early Start met us right at our breaking point, offering a lifeline and hope. The program transformed fragility into possibility and gave my child a voice. 
For me, it offered a circle of support that reminded me I wasn’t facing this journey alone. It introduced me to other parents facing the isolating darkness of uncertainty about their child’s future. This community became the difference between despair and determination.
From strengthening my daughter’s muscles to finding her first words, Early Start’s team also became my daughter’s and my biggest cheerleaders, celebrating progress and helping us navigate setbacks. 
But the promise that shapes thousands of families like mine now hangs by a thread. 
This summer Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill, extending tax cuts but slashing billions from Medicaid. In California, federal Medicaid funds sustain the regional centers that coordinate Early Start services for infants and toddlers with — or at risk for — developmental delays.
 With California facing a multibillion-dollar deficit, the future of such early interventions looks precarious. Losing federal support means the state must fill the funding gap or scale back, thus putting therapy, progress and hope at risk for countless children and families.
I’ve witnessed what happens when families lose access to care. When speech therapy disappears, a baby’s first words vanish into silence. When physical therapy stops, a toddler’s first steps may never come. 
From surviving to thriving
Early Start is not a luxury; it’s a bridge from surviving to thriving. When that connection is frayed, a child’s trajectory is altered, sometimes irreversibly.
The Department of Developmental Services has already warned that its caseloads are surging as staffing shortages worsen. Federal cuts will only amplify this with fewer therapists, longer waitlists and children stranded during the most critical period of their brain development. 
Every week’s delay, every family told to “wait and see,” means consequences that may never be undone, developmental windows that will not reopen.
Supporters of the Big Beautiful Bill claim it will foster innovation and eliminate “waste.” But when waste means a therapist teaching a mother to feed her baby safely or a child learning to hold a crayon, the cruelty becomes clear. Efficiency cannot replace empathy. Those proposing it have never witnessed the triumph of a child relearning to walk after months of painstaking effort.
California lawmakers cannot reverse federal decisions, but they can refuse to let our youngest citizens be left behind. California should immediately create an Early Start stabilization fund to offset Medicaid cuts, ensuring therapy access during the critical brain development stage. 
Legislators must require agencies to publicly track staffing shortages and therapy delays, making inequities visible and impossible to ignore. 
California’s congressional delegation must fight to protect the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Part C funds, which guarantee early intervention access. Election-year speeches about potential aren’t enough; lawmakers must safeguard the infrastructure that makes potential possible.
My work in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit only reinforces what’s at stake. Every day, I meet parents whose babies will need Early Start. Families finally bring home babies ready to grow, only to find themselves mired in complex systems of authorizations, denials, and delays.
If we fail to act, those babies will confront mounting waitlists, fewer specialists and programs stretched to the breaking point. 
Early Start caught my daughter and me before we fell through the cracks. For families in similar situations, losing this safety net threatens more than milestones; it threatens hope. When we protect early intervention, we save futures — one child at a time.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/061121_SummerSchool_AW_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

For YIMBYs and other champions of more housing development, ditching the extra staircase has become a surprisingly buzzy cause. In Culver City, they have a test case.


In late September, Culver City became the first municipality in California to legalize the construction of mid-rise apartment buildings with a single staircase. 
Unless you’re a member of the niche but fervent subculture of architects, urbanists and pro-housing advocates who clamor for “single stair reform,” this might not sound like big news. But supporters say it could be the key to unleashing the kind of urban apartment building boom that years of pro-development legislation in Sacramento has tried, and so far failed, to deliver. 
Culver City apartments up to six stories tall can now be built around a single stairwell. Conditions apply: These buildings have to be on the small side — each floor maxes out at 4,000 square feet with no more than four units. They’ll also have to abide by an array of added fire-prevention measures.
That’s a break from the standard minimum of two staircases — connected by a corridor — required of buildings taller than three stories in nearly every other city in the country. 
For YIMBYs and other champions of more housing development, ditching the extra staircase has become a surprisingly buzzy and enduring cause. It’s one weird trick, they say, that can turbo-charge urban housing construction at a modest and more affordable scale while also promoting apartments that are bigger, airier and better lit. 
For more than a decade in California, pro-development activists have railed against zoning, the local patchwork of restrictions on what can get built where. Those efforts are beginning to bear fruit: Earlier this year, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a series of housing bills aimed at clearing legal impediments to apartment construction. The campaign for changes to the building code, the rules that specify in mind-numbing detail exactly how buildings must be constructed, appears to be the next chapter of this fight. Single stair, and the fate of Culver City’s ordinance specifically, represents an early California acid test.
“This is bigger than a staircase,” said Bubba Fish, the Culver City councilmember who introduced the single-stair ordinance. “The vast majority of the world builds apartments this way. We are an outlier. It touches on the housing crisis, the affordability crisis.”
It also runs up against more than a century of American conventional wisdom about fire safety. Multiple staircases in mid-rise apartments are meant to give occupants multiple means of escape. Though rare outside of North America, the “two ways out” rule for mid-rises has been a mainstay of fire protection policy in this country and in Canada for the last century. 
There are a handful of exceptions: New York City, Seattle, Honolulu and, most recently, Portland, Oregon, allow single-stair buildings up to six stories. Georgia, Vermont and Puerto Rico permit them up to four. 
Culver City is the first in California to join this small club. But the Los Angeles county burg is also likely to be the last — for now. This summer, state lawmakers passed a bill to freeze local building code changes in place for the next six years. The city passed its ordinance before the freeze went into effect, but others exploring the change, including San Jose and San Francisco, didn’t make the cut. 
That gives Culver City the next half decade to show the rest of the state just how much difference a single staircase actually makes.

Is one staircase better than two?
Fish, the 34-year-old councilmember, happens to be a renter in a block-spanning “luxury” apartment complex: “One of those fortresses that everyone makes fun of.”
You know the type.
Retail and a massive parking lot on the bottom. Three floors of supersized-Lego-looking residential on top. Inside, the apartments are mostly studios and one-bedrooms, long and dimly lit by windows confined to one side. On the other is a wide corridor that runs the length of the building with all the charm and utility of a hotel hallway. 
Fish spends an inordinate time thinking about that hallway. Sometimes he uses it as a place to play fetch with his new dog , but mostly he sees it as a blown opportunity.
“All of that space,” Fish marvels. “All of that could be homes.” 
Seven percent more. That’s how much floor space is dedicated to additional staircases and the various corridors that connect them in the average American apartment building, according to a first-of-its-kind study on the safety record of single-stair buildings issued by the Pew Charitable Trusts earlier this year. 
Reclaiming all that space is the first selling point for single stair advocates: Less real estate for stairs means more units, bigger units, or a combination of both. 
“This is bigger than a staircase.”Bubba Fish, councilmember, Culver City
But it’s not just a numbers game. Single-stair apartment buildings are vibe enhancers, say supporters. Allowing architects to design apartment buildings that wrap around a central staircase makes it easier for them to include units with windows on multiple sides, meaning more light and more air. 
Culver City’s cap of four units per floor also nudges design away from efficiency apartments toward roomier digs that might appeal to families. 
Single-stair apartments may be alien in much of the United States, but “represent a building more like Brooklyn or Seville or Berlin or Paris,” said Ed Mendoza, a building code policy researcher at California YIMBY. “The buildings that single-stair promotes are just more — what’s the word? Nicer. They’re nicer.”
But the biggest perk of this design, according to proponents, is that it allows apartment buildings to go up on small plots of land otherwise too cramped for the modern American apartment block.
“Funky little lots”
Seattle, like most big cities, is full of lots that are “not big enough to allow a larger scale project that would require two stairs and an elevator,” said Andrew Van Leeuwen, an architect with the Seattle-based Build LLC. 
In most cities, these parcels would be the sole domain of single-family homes interrupted by the occasional duplex. But Seattle has had a single-stair allowance on the books since the late 1970s. As a result, “all these funky little lots in the city of Seattle are eligible for nice little boutique apartment buildings,” said Van Leeuwen.
In New York City, which has allowed modest single stair buildings up to six stories for its entire history, such buildings are commonplace.
Promoting more nice little apartments is especially relevant to California this year. In September, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed one of the year’s most contentious housing measures, Senate Bill 79, allowing for much denser and higher residential development close to many public transit stops in major metro areas. The goal: Packing more apartments into California’s major cities where reasonably affordable housing has long been in catastrophically short supply.
As in Seattle, plots in these neighborhoods tend to be on the small side. Under the current two-stair requirement, a California apartment developer hoping to take advantage of the new state law and build a six story building near a train station would need to either purchase a massive lot nearby (an expensive and rare find) or successfully convince a row of neighbors to sell their properties at the same time (also expensive, even rarer). 
Zoning and single-stair reform are “two great tastes that taste great together,” said Stephen Smith, founder of the Center for Building in North America and lead author of the Pew study.
The safety record on single stair
Whenever a local or state government considers this particular change to the code, fire marshals, fire chiefs and firefighter unions regularly rise up to oppose it. The logic of their argument is intuitive enough: In the event of a fire, the more ways out the better. 
Rules requiring multiple internal staircases were born of tragedies. “Great” fires engulfed cities like Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire killed 146 workers trapped at the top of a ten story building.
The newly sanctioned apartments in Culver City are modeled on Seattle’s ordinance with fire prevention in mind: The unit count is capped, minimizing the chances of overcrowding in the stairwell. The sole stairway itself must either be pressurized to keep out the smoke or open air. The entire building must be outfitted with the highest class of automatic sprinkler systems. That’s all on top of the strict fire-prevention standards already required of mid-rise apartment buildings: alarm systems, fire-rated walls around stairwells, doors that are set to close automatically.
But no fire prevention system — nor a complex of systems — is perfect.
“What if something happens and that one stairwell is blocked?” said Sean DeCrane with the International Association of Fire Fighters union. And while sprinkler systems and alarms are effective, they have to be maintained. “We can’t just design a building for Day One of opening. We have to think about the life of the building, and I don’t think people are thinking about that as they approach this issue.”
DeCrane’s concerns aren’t reflected in the available data. The Pew study pored over residential fire deaths across New York City between 2012 to 2024 and found that the fatality rate in single-stair buildings was both low and equal to other residential structures. No deaths were obviously attributable to the lack of a second way out. The study likewise could find no deaths in Seattle over the same time period that could be blamed on a missing staircase.
Single-stair skeptics say New York City and Seattle, with their large, professional fire departments, are not representative of much of the rest of the country.
Exporting New York and Seattle’s building code to other municipalities is based on “the assumption that the fire department is going to be able to respond with sufficient resources,” said Crane.
Weighing costs and benefits
Not that buildings allowed under the current code are entirely risk-free. 
In a modern American apartment complex, the distance from any one unit to the nearest staircase might be 250 feet, said Travis Morgan, co-founder of the Livable Cities Initiative, which advocated for the Culver City policy. “Those corridors fill up with smoke, so now you’re having to do a fireman crawl along the floor for potentially hundreds of feet,” he said. 
Even if single stair apartment buildings were found to be more dangerous —  and they haven’t been yet — Smith said the debate over single stair reveals a more fundamental philosophical split over how much risk society is willing to take on and whether certain dangers are more tolerable than others.
“Fire and building officials are looking to drive down the rate of death in new buildings and that is actually pretty different from driving down the rate of death overall,” he said. “You could mandate that every room has a fire station in it, but then that will make the world much less safe because then you live in a world where no one can live in new apartment buildings” because they are so impractically expensive.
“It’s almost impossible to go up against firefighters. They are a highly beloved group.”Ed Mendoza, researcher, California YIMBY
Instead, would-be tenants would turn to older apartment buildings, single-family homes or, in the most extreme cases, shelters and encampments. All are more vulnerable to fire danger than newly-constructed mid-rises. With fewer apartments in urban cores, more renters would also likely live further away, forcing them to commute, which comes with its own set of risks.
“What happens when you drive? You die. You die at really high risks on the road,” said Smith. “That’s a life and safety risk and it’s one that never gets accounted for in developing building codes.”
Even if you buy that argument, it makes for a tough sell. 
Unlike prior housing policy battles, in which development boosters have warred with neighborhood groups and property owners over relatively anodyne concerns like parking, shadows and “neighborhood character,” pushing changes through the building code puts activists in the unenviable political position of disputing rules ostensibly written to keep people alive. 
“It’s almost impossible to go up against firefighters,” said Mendoza with California YIMBY. “They are a highly beloved group.”
In effect, but legally uncertain
The elected officials in Culver City didn’t seem to have much trouble. The vote to pass the ordinance was unanimous. 
Next came the review by the state’s Building Standards Commission. Under California law, building codes are imposed statewide. Locals are then free to amend them, so long as they are “more restrictive.” Rescinding a required staircase would seem, on its face, to be less restrictive, though supporters of the ordinance argued that the additional safety requirements demanded of single stair buildings make it more so — or, at least, a wash. 
Ultimately, the commission accepted Culver City’s code change. But they left things on an ambiguous note, warning in a letter to city staff that the ordinance “may contain a local amendment that is less restrictive” than the state code and therefore conflicts with state law.
Translation: The state won’t be the final judge of whether the code is or isn’t illegal. If Culver City wants to permit these types of buildings, it can go ahead at its own risk.
In the past, local governments have attempted to promote their own stricter rules over the state’s clerical objections only to have developers take them to court. But this is a more unusual case of a local government changing the code not to ratchet up safety measures or energy efficiency requirements, but in order to lower costs and promote development. 
If anyone opts to challenge Culver City’s novel approach, it’s not likely to be a developer.
That leaves Culver City’s ordinance in effect for now. Though the moratorium remains in effect, more changes to the prevailing Legislative thinking on staircases could be coming soon. A 2023 state law directed the state Fire Marshal to study the state’s single-stair rules. That report is due in January.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-Staircase-Hallway-IS-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

Critics say it’s absurd to expect fair decisions from newcomers who are unfamiliar with the law. Beyond that, some argue the move violates a ban on using the military for law enforcement. 
Andrasko, reached by phone Friday, declined comment and referred Utah News Dispatch to a spokesperson for the Justice Department’s Executive Office of Immigration Review, which oversees immigration courts. 
The office wouldn’t comment on those criticisms. In a new federal rule outlining the plan, it said a national backlog of cases topped 4.1 million by January 2025 and the office has the authority to make the change. 
It also said there’s no reason to pass over federal employees “with stellar credentials” because they don’t have experience in immigration law. Previously, the job was only open to immigration judges, administrative law judges, and Justice Department attorneys with 10 years of experience in immigration.  
The new crop of judges is on a temporary six-month assignment, but the department said the term could be extended. 
Separately, the Justice Department hired 11 judges for permanent roles, mostly in Texas and Southern states. The majority have an immigration background, and some have military ties. 
In Utah, many attorneys understood the new judge, while assigned here, would hear cases from other states. But lawyer Christopher Vizcardo said he represented a client in Adrasko’s courtroom in a brief hearing last week. 
“He was very polite, and he was very kind, very reasonable with my client,” Vizcardo said.

Utah began the year with five immigration judges but dropped down to two over the summer. One judge took a buyout, another left the job abruptly and a third was fired. As a result, the system has slowed down significantly, Vizcardo said. 
“Everything is taking longer now, and I think that for my clients that do fear returning to their home country, they have an interest in having their case adjudicated as soon as possible,” Vizcardo said. “So in that sense, I’m happy that we have more help because I think in the long term, it’s going to be good for my clients so they can finally get legal status in the United States.”
But he’s also concerned about how well the new temporary judges can handle complex legal arguments and convoluted, yearslong cases. He noted they may feel pressure to churn fast as they try to clear the backlog. 
“If they’re too quick about making their decision, I don’t think that that’s good for the due process of my clients, either,” Vizcardo said. 
Attorney Nicholle Pitt White said the change comes with unknowns but she agrees it may work in her clients’ favor.   
“We’ve found that a lot of judges — when they’re new to the bench, especially if they don’t have a lot of prior experience — tend to give more favorable outcomes to our clients in certain situations where another immigration judge may have denied their case,” she said. It’s not clear how much instruction the new judges are getting. In the rule, the government said they’ll receive the same continuous training as other judges – six weeks – but NPR has reported they’ll get just two weeks.

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Fairhope Public Library has permanently lost over $20,000 in state funding that the Alabama Public Library Service Board had withheld since March amid disputes over library materials found in the teen section.
The $22,000 in question, about half the state aid it had been allocated,  was disbursed to other libraries in Baldwin County because APLS said the library had materials the APLS board considered sexually explicit and out of compliance with state regulations past a June 30 deadline.
Randal Wright, chair of the Fairhope Public Library Board, said Friday she was “disappointed, shocked, confused (and) angry.”

“There are so many adjectives I can think of to describe my feelings in conjunction with this,” she said.” I don’t even know where to start. The bottom line is that I am really disappointed in how APLS has handled this. I am very disturbed that we have lost this funding, it is a critical part of our library’s budget.”
The board first suspended Fairhope’s funding in March after complaints alleging the Fairhope Public Library continued to place books that are sexually explicit and inappropriate on the shelves of the teens’ section of the library in violation of the APLS administrative code.
Others disputed that claim and supported the library. The books at the center of the controversy included ‘Sold,’ a novel about human trafficking and child sexual exploitation in India that includes a scene of a rape, though one the author says does not include graphic language. A second book explained what consent is to minors.
A state law says that libraries not in compliance with the APLS administrative code by the end of June will lose funding allocated at the start of the fiscal year. APLS disbursed the Fairhope Public Library’s funding in either late August or early September.
Libraries may retrieve the funds that were suspended only if the APLS Board declares they are back in compliance with the rules by that deadline or otherwise lost the funding they are due permanently.
Katie Bailey, assistant director of APLS, said on Friday that other libraries in the state have permanently forfeited their state aid because they were not in compliance by the deadline. It was not clear Friday whether the Fairhope Public Library is only one to lose funding in a dispute over library materials.
“I did not expect them to go past June 30 before getting in compliance,” said John Wahl, chair of APLS Board and the Alabama Republican Party. “The bottom line is, they were not in compliance with state code, they were warned about that and were suspended in March. And they could have finished their review process and requested to get in compliance before June 30. They were the ones who did not make that request.”
Libraries are allocated funding at the beginning of the fiscal year but are distributed in four equal installments each quarter. The Fairhope Public Library received two of the installments, half of the total, in December and in early spring of 2025.
However, at the APLS Board meeting in March, members voted almost unanimously to suspend state aid due to the Fairhope Public Library after Amy Minton, one of the board members, made a motion to suspend the library’s funding as well as a second motion to terminate Nancy Pack, the former director of the Alabama Public Library Service.
For the next several months, the board of trustees of the Fairhope Public Library reviewed the books that individuals challenged. The library reviewed 17 books in total, according to Robert Gourlay, the director of the Fairhope Public Library, in an interview on Friday. Board members decided to reshelve seven of the books in the adult section but keep the rest in the teens section where they had been originally placed.
Both Wright and Gourlay said they had not been given any update on the status of their state aid since the meeting in September when they met with the APLS Board in person to discuss their decisions regarding the books that were challenged.
At that meeting, the APLS Board decided to review the books that were challenged to make their own determination before formally deciding whether the Fairhope Public Library was in compliance and eligible to receive state aid.
Wright had expected to receive the funding that APLS had suspended once the library was found to be back in compliance.
“I had hoped that if they voted to reinstate us, that we would get the money,” Wright said. “Now, I am assuming they are going to vote ‘no’ because there is no money to give us.”
Wahl said that the rules are in state code that stated the Fairhope Public Library was at risk of permanently losing its funding.
“The APLS Board was actually expecting them to come back with their review process far sooner than August,” Wahl said. “It was the decision of the Fairhope Public Library to delay getting back with us on that.”
The Fairhope community has been supportive of the library. Supporters raised tens of thousands of dollars this spring. Voters largely rejected a slate of candidates endorsed by pro-censorship groups this summer.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250918_141510-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

(Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)Las Vegan Mike Kosor is a longtime thorn in the side of the homeowners association industry, and of state regulators he asserts are too cozy with those they regulate. Wielding powers generally reserved for government tribunals, HOAs can assess fines, deny property rights, and even foreclose. 
Kosor and other critics contend the Nevada Real Estate Division (NRED), which regulates HOAs, is a smokescreen designed to do the bidding of the multi-million dollar industry it oversees, often at the expense of the 1.3 million Nevada homeowners subject to HOA control. 
So it came as a surprise to Kosor when Dr. Kristopher Sanchez, director of the Nevada Department of Business and Industry, which oversees the Real Estate Division, invited Kosor to be a member of an HOA task force that met a few times after it was created by legislators in 2019 as a response to concerns about the independence of NRED, then went dormant. 
“Your expertise and commitment to public service will be invaluable, I appreciate your willingness to serve and look forward to your thoughtful contributions,” Sanchez wrote to Kosor via email on Oct. 13. 
“Surprised by that bold direction — and encouraged by the potential the Task Force offered — when asked to serve, I accepted,” Kosor wrote on his blog. 
But the day after issuing the invitation to Kosor, Sanchez’ office scheduled a phone meeting with Kosor for Oct. 17.  
“Sanchez offered a strained explanation difficult to square: he said he had received ‘many calls’ from parties he declined to identify, expressing “concern” over my selection — creating a level of disapproval he believed would make it impossible for the Task Force to function,” Kosor wrote. 
Kosor, in an interview, notes his appointment had yet to be made public, and wonders how Sanchez could have received so much objectionable feedback in one day, that he scheduled a call to rescind Kosor’s invitation.  
“This is very disappointing and frustrating, Michael,” a key insider in Gov. Joe Lombardo’s re-election campaign, who Kosor asked the Current not to name, wrote to Kosor via email after being informed of his removal from the task force. “You’re making waves in the CIC [common interest communities] community, and major players are exerting political influence. The Governor trusts Kris and will be deferential to him on these kinds of decisions.”
Lombardo’s office did not respond when asked if the governor received complaints about Kosor or discussed his removal from the task force with Sanchez. 
Sanchez also did not respond to inquiries from the Current. 
Kosor contends that because of state inaction, he’s been required to take his beef against his association to court, where he’s spent more than half a million dollars on legal fees. Most recently, he’s been represented by Hutchison and Steffen, the law firm founded by former Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, who serves as Lombardo’s campaign manager. 
Lombardo, Kosor notes, has promised more, not less, accountability in Nevada government. 
“Accountability is always the key. Throughout my history in education, law enforcement, and as your governor, our constituents continually say we have to hold the schools [to] more accountability… Less money, more accountability,” he said in September during his reelection announcement. 
“The first opportunity his people have to be accountable, they throw off the one guy that wants to hold them accountable,” Kosor told the Current on Thursday. 
In a letter to Sanchez, Kosor says his removal from the task force, “appears to be a bow to industry influence,” adding Sanchez was “keenly aware of my longtime criticism” of the state, and “concems with the industry’s long-standing dominance over all things HOA, and the lack of attention paid to the systemic issues that have plagued Nevada homeowners – and frustrated lawmakers – for decades. Yet despite that, or perhaps precisely because of it, you determined my presence on the ‘reconstituted’ Task Force constructive.”
Kosor wrote that of equal importance was Sanchez’ “decision to include independent and opposing voices – an element missing from the prior Task Force and vital to strengthening its credibility and the public’s confidence in this effort.”
However, Kosor notes, the expanded task force of eleven members includes just two homeowners, while numerous members represent related legal and property management interests. 
“It has become clear that the same forces that captured the regulator and sidelined the original Task Force have now shaped the reconstitution effort,” Kosor wrote to Sanchez. “I am disappointed to see how easily your resolve – and the machinery of reform – can be redirected into preserving the very status quo it was meant to challenge.”
The Department of Business and Industry, which Sanchez leads, is no stranger to allegations that it has been captured by the industries it seeks to regulate. 
The department also oversees Nevada’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which rescinded $400,000 in fines levied against Elon Musk’s Boring Company in May of this year, after a meeting between the governor’s office and company executives, Fortune reported this week. A record of the meeting was removed from Nevada OSHA’s database, according to the story. 
A records request submitted by the Current to Nevada OSHA in September for all fines levied against the Boring Company since it began digging tunnels in Nevada, and the balance owed, was returned with just one fine listed for $112,504, assessed in 2023.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly formally endorsed state Sen. Ethan Corson’s campaign for governor on Monday, favoring a “true middle-of-the-road” politician she believed capable of drawing enough votes from Kansas Republicans, Democrats and independents to prevail in 2026.
Kelly, a popular governor forbidden from seeking reelection to a third term, said the Democrat from Fairway was the candidate most capable of being a voice of reason in terms of the state budget, protecting K-12 public school funding, lowering taxes and delivering economic growth. These themes, and a relentless critique of former Gov. Sam Brownback, anchored Kelly’s gubernatorial victory over Republican nominee Kris Kobach in 2018 and narrow defeat of GOP candidate Derek Schmidt in 2022.
“Kansas is in good shape right now. And that is why I am enthusiastically endorsing Ethan Corson,” Kelly said in a statement. “Ethan will build on my work, but he will also bring visionary and bold new ideas to the job. His allegiance will be to Kansans, not party or politics. Ethan is a good man. He wants to be governor for the right reasons. He is a true public servant.”
Kelly’s endorsement of Corson wasn’t a surprise, given her statement in July that he would be a “very strong candidate” and pointing to Corson as “someone laser focused on the issues Kansans really care about.”
“Ethan is a true middle-of-the-road candidate who will attract that same broad base of support that is necessary to win but also to then govern effectively. He is the most qualified and most suited to be our next governor,” Kelly said.
In the Kansas Democratic Party’s primary set for August, Corson’s main rival would appear to be Democratic Sen. Cindy Holscher of Overland Park. Democrat Marty Tuley of Lawrence also declared his candidacy.
Corson, an attorney and former director of the Kansas Democratic Party, was elected to the Kansas Senate in 2020 and reelected in 2024 to serve a northeast Johnson County district. In the Senate, Corson said, he joined bipartisan efforts to cut property and income taxes, eliminate a state sales tax on groceries and end the state tax on Social Security benefits. He also sought to target tax relief for the benefit of seniors, veterans and working Kansans.
“I’m honored to have Gov. Kelly’s endorsement and grateful for her confidence in my ability to keep Kansas moving forward,” Corson said.
As governor, I’ll build on the progress we’ve made by lowering costs, creating good paying jobs, strengthening our public schools, and bringing both parties to the table to deliver results for all Kansans.”
Corson entered the race for governor in July. He reported Nov. 5 the campaign raised $500,000 from nearly 2,000 donors in the initial 100 days of the campaign. During an 8,000-mile, crisscross journey of Kansas, Corson emphasized lowering the cost of living for working-class families, creating good-paying jobs and strengthening investment in public schools. He said his goal was to bring “both parties to the table to deliver results for all Kansans.”
“Our campaign is about creating a Kansas where the next generation can build a life right here,” he said. “That means lower costs for families, the best public schools in America, safer communities and a growing economy in all 105 counties.”
Corson, 43, earned a law degree at Washington University in St. Louis and worked seven years for a firm in Washington, D.C. He was employed by the U.S. Department of Commerce before returning to Kansas in 2019 to be executive director of the state Democratic Party.
Kansas candidates for governor must maneuver through an electorate that delivered double-digit victories in 2016, 2020 and 2024 for President Donald Trump.
In addition, no political party in Kansas has retained the governorship for more than eight consecutive years since the 1950s.
Candidates for the Republican Party’s nomination for governor include former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Senate President Ty Masterson, Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt, Secretary of State Scott Schwab, businessman Philip Sarnecki, former Johnson County Commissioner Charlotte O’Hara and former Wichita school board member Joy Eakins.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1132285-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

A state senator last week said the price tag on a new men's prison in Elmore County had grown to $1.2 billion, eating up nearly all the money the Legislature allocated in 2021 for the construction of two prisons. (FIle)Most Alabama politicians call themselves fiscal conservatives. But in Alabama, fiscal conservatism is usually performative and never consistent.
We often hear boasts that Alabama balances its budgets. This is not a choice. Alabama, like every state except Vermont, has to pass a balanced budget every year. We might struggle to do that if the federal government didn’t pay for 73% of our Medicaid program.
Another fun adventure with numbers took place in 2013. That year, Gov. Robert Bentley and legislative Republicans proclaimed that they had saved the state over $1 billion a year.
What they actually meant was that three years of cutting public jobs and slashing retirement benefits for teachers and state workers would lead to annual savings of $1 billion. In 30 years.
You don’t have to look far to find more examples of situational frugality. Take the Gov. Kay Ivey Correctional Complex in Elmore County.
In 2021, Ivey persuaded the Alabama Legislature to approve a $1.3 billion construction package for corrections facilities. The governor and her supporters had argued for years that Alabama’s prisons were aging and decrepit; that they were unsafe for incarcerated people and staff members, and that they lacked space for training and rehabilitation programs.
The plan called for two 4,000-bed men’s facilities. The first would go up in Elmore County and the second in Escambia County. There was even language (though no dedicated funding) authorizing renovations at other men’s prisons, and construction of a new women’s facility to replace the 80-year-old Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka.
Four years on, the state is struggling to get the first part of that agenda done.
Barely 18 months after the Legislature approved borrowing for the Elmore County prison, the cost jumped by $300 million. It’s now $1.2 billion. That number will almost certainly rise further by the time the prison is finished, which officials expect next year. At this point, the Escambia prison is little more than an intention.
Ivey and other prison supporters are correct to be concerned about deteriorating corrections facilities. But the high cost of renovating them was a big selling point of the construction program. With every dollar the Elmore prison plucks from the treasury, that case gets weaker.
In light of that, you’d expect fiscal conservatives to demand answers. To this point, they’ve shrugged.
“I mean, I wish it wasn’t up there,” House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said in 2023, after the first leap in price. “But inflation has hit us pretty hard over the last few months, and I think that’s certainly a reflection of that.”
Two years later, lawmakers continue to treat soaring costs as inevitable. The Legislature borrowed even more money earlier this year for prison construction, and are talking about more for the Escambia facility.
Compare this fatalism to the white hot rage Medicaid expansion sparks in these same people. Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, who has sponsored the prison construction bills, opposes Medicaid expansion and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have allowed it to move forward.
What would Medicaid expansion cost the state?
About $225 million a year, according to the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama. The state would make most if not all that money back in new tax revenues from jobs created by expansion. Even better, public health would improve. Hundreds of thousands of Alabamians would have a little more peace of mind.
For the price of one still-incomplete prison, we could have paid for five years of Medicaid expansion. For all the money spent on locking up 4,000 people, we could have improved the lives of at least 174,000 Alabamians.
But that’s a trade-off our leaders will gladly make. Since 1819, our state government has had a single priority: control. Control of Alabamians; control of policy, and above all, control of punishment.
A government obsessed with keeping people in line can never spend enough on a prison. In that view, walls and bars aren’t a service of government; they’re why government exists. The people building them are heroes, worthy of our unquestioning trust.
Inevitably, a government obsessed with order will hold the governed in contempt. A prison going far over budget is just normal business. A person using food aid to buy a candy bar is a scandal.
A corrections facility that costs $300 million than expected, and then $300 million more? Eh, not worth our attention. Not like a person getting $275 a week while looking for job. That’s a serious abuse of public trust and requires weekly reports from the person getting that pittance.
Our lawmakers love creating felony offenses, making our overcrowding crisis worse. But most seem content with the state cutting tens of millions of dollars in checks to settle excessive force lawsuits, instead of confronting the violence and chaos in Alabama prisons. Because prisons are always the answer.
And if the Elmore facility costs $10 billion, our leaders will keep shoveling money into it. In Alabama, there is no greater civic virtue than punishment. And when it comes to punishing Alabamians, no dollar is ever wasted.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-Flag-2019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)The Nevada State Legislature over the weekend moved closer to passing the largest public subsidy package in state history — $1.65 billion in transferable tax credits over 15 years to film productions and a 31-acre film studio in Las Vegas.
The Assembly on Sunday morning narrowly passed the film studio bill, 22-20. A Senate committee, after a more than 6-hour long hearing, approved the bill 6-2.
The Assembly’s narrow passage came after another round of political theatre, in which a group of Democrats challenged Speaker Steve Yeager’s decision to allow two Republicans, who were known to be “yes” vote on the bill, to vote remotely. Procedural rules in the chamber allow for remote voting under exceptional circumstances.
The Assembly, minus the two remote members, voted on a razor-thin margin to allow the remote voting, paving the way for the film studio bill’s passage.
The final tally of 22-20 mirrored a June regular session vote by the Assembly on an earlier version of the bill. However, several members changed their positions.
Three assemblymembers who voted against the project in June voted for it on Sunday: Republican Brian Hibbetts and Democrats Hanadi Nadeem and Cinthia Zermeño Moore.
Moore, in an interview after the vote, said she changed her position because of the construction jobs it will create and because of an adopted amendment giving $6 million to Chicanos Por La Causa to create a job training facility on the eastside of Las Vegas.
“Getting outside of this building and going back to my district, I was able to talk to my constituents and regular folks who are not here in the building,” said Moore. “They want this in my district.”
Nadeem declined to speak to the Nevada Current after the vote.
Hibbetts, Nadeem and Moore’s new yay votes offset three other assemblymembers who supported the film studio bill in June but voted against it Sunday: Democrats Jovan Jackson and Elaine Marzola and Republican Burt Gurr.
Vince Saavedra, the executive secretary-treasurer of the Southern Nevada Building Trades Unions, which has been heavily lobbying for the bill’s passage, said after the vote he thought the bill would have “an easier time” over at the Senate because conversations with senators have been happening concurrently with the Assembly.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-1-1024x683.png,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

“The Chinese Communist Party is not a normal government,” Sobolik, who also presented as an affiliate of the Vandenberg Coalition, a neoconservative foreign policy nonprofit, said. “It’s a one party dictatorship determined to reshape the world to its advantage, to weaken the United States from within. Beijing’s goal is clear: to displace America as the world’s leading power, to export authoritarianism and to erode our freedoms and institutions here at home in the United States.”
From local law enforcement using drones made by DJI to solar inverters made by Huawei to ports using cranes made by CPMC — all based in China— Sobolik emphasized that these companies and others could be feeding information back to the Chinese government. 
“Beijing wouldn’t need to launch missiles from across the world or detonate an electromagnetic pulse from space to darken our cities,” he added. “They could simply trigger the kill switches already hidden within our infrastructure.”
Biotechnology was also a key point for Sobolik.
“During the COVID-19 pandemic, BGI offered cheap testing kits worldwide, quietly gathering genetic data from unsuspecting populations,” he said, referring to a Chinese genomics company, adding that it was “nearly impossible” to know precisely how that data was being used.

Committee chairman Rep. William Bruck (R-Erie) asked specifically about 23andMe, a genetic testing ancestry company whose bankruptcy earlier this year prompted concerns that the company would sell that data as part of a resolution. Sobolik responded that COVID-19 tests were a much greater risk, as many were coming from Chinese companies. 
One additional target of Sobolik’s presentation was higher education, specifically Chinese international students he said were functioning as essentially Chinese Communist Party agents. Sobolik pointed to four instances where students or researchers tied to the University of Michigan were arrested or charged on issues of security. 
In one of those instances, charges were announced last week by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan against three Chinese nationals who allegedly attempted to smuggle biological materials related to round worms into a research laboratory at the University of Michigan. 
Sobolik also referenced a case from earlier this year in which a noncitizen Chinese international student at the University of Michigan allegedly voted in the 2024 election. 
“There are many PRC nationals who are applying for these student visas, not because of some nefarious scheme that they are a part of willingly,” Sobolik said. “When Chinese students come over here, they are monitored, surveilled, and organized, either by consulates or by student organizations that operate on college campuses that report to consulates in the embassy.”
Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) asked Sobolik about President Donald Trump’s plan to bring hundreds of thousands of Chinese international students to American universities — which Sobolik called a “profound concern.”
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed concerns about the issues that Sobolik raised throughout the hearing. The minority vice chair of the committee, Rep. Denise Mentzer (D-Mt. Clemens), as well as Bruck, said that his testimony had “scared the hell out of us,” as Mentzer said.

(Courtesy Castelion Corp.)On Monday, the New Mexico Economic Development Department announced that California-based Castelion Corp. will build its 1,000-acre manufacturing plant, known as ‘Project Ranger,’ in Sandoval County.
The facility will build solid rocket motors, conduct static tests and “assemble components to produce finished rounds,” according to a news release.
The department in August announced New Mexico was in the running for the facility. In a statement Monday, Castelion’s co-founder and CFO Andrew Kreitz said the company conducted a “competitive nationwide search” and ultimately chosen New Mexico “for its technical talent, regional infrastructure, and history of scientific achievement. Project Ranger represents a critical step in restoring America’s capacity to produce the advanced systems our country needs.”
In a statement Monday, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Project Ranger would help carry forward New Mexico’s “legacy” of being “front and center in shaping the frontiers of American defense and innovation.” Economic Development Secretary Rob Black, in an echoing statement, invoked the atomic Manhattan Project, noting that, “securing this investment propels our innovation economy forward, creating high-tech careers and reinforcing our position as a hub for advanced manufacturing and national security.”
The state says the project will create more than 300 high-paying jobs and “generate more than $650 million in economic output over the next decade.” Castelion, the NMEDD news release says, plans to invest more than $100 million over the project’s first four years, with more to follow.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) also praised the selection of Sandoval County for Project Ranger, noting his own efforts “to bolster New Mexico’s bases, defense research labs, and private industry partners so we can keep excelling in emerging defense capabilities.”
Rio Rancho Mayor Greg Hull, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, characterized the project as “in line with Rio Rancho’s history of advanced manufacturing and New Mexico’s expertise in national defense.”

Ned Lamont vetoed after the regular session.,"The House and Senate approved a wide-ranging housing bill last week to replace a similar bill that Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed after the regular session.
House Bill 8002 requires towns to create housing growth plans, changes minimum off-street parking requirements, expands fair rent commissions and incentivizes towns to take steps to allow more housing, among other measures.
Its major goal is to make it easier to build more housing in Connecticut. Housing costs have gotten more expensive and homelessness has risen over the past several years. Experts say there hasn’t been enough housing built in Connecticut to meet the need, which has made these and other issues worse.
Lamont is expected to sign the new bill, which he helped negotiate with local leadership.
Here’s a look at what happened in housing legislation in the special session last week.
Why was there a special session?
During the regular session, the legislature passed a sweeping housing bill known as House Bill 5002, but Lamont vetoed the measure after facing opposition from local leaders. He said he wanted to find a way to get them on board with the measure. 
After months of working on a new version of the bill, Lamont called the legislature into special session for two days. The House met Wednesday, and the Senate met Thursday. They passed the housing bill in addition to three other bills.
Lamont has touted the new bill because local leaders, who broadly opposed the old bill, have signed on. A bipartisan group of mayors and first selectmen spoke at a press conference in support of the new bill.
Democrats said they wanted to get a bill passed to meet the need for more housing as soon as possible, while Republicans criticized the special session, saying the bill should have been brought in regular session when the public could read it and comment.
What will change in my town’s zoning?
Some of that isn’t clear yet and is up to your town. The bill requires towns to create housing growth plans, with goals on how many units they’ll plan and zone for.
If towns create these plans or take certain steps to add more housing near train and bus stations or in downtowns, they’ll have access to a new state fund and can get more state reimbursement for what they spend on school construction.
The bill also says that towns can’t require developers who build new apartments with fewer than 16 units to add off-street parking, with a couple of exceptions.
Democrats and housing advocates say these measures will help push towns to build more housing because a lot of local zoning makes it hard to build apartments. Republicans fear it will reduce local control.
What else is in the bill?
This is a big bill that deals with a lot of different issues. It expands the number of fair rent commissions, which is a government body that can hear complaints about rent increases and make decisions on whether to change that rental increase number.
It bans “hostile architecture,” or the use of things like armrests in the middle of benches or spikes to make it harder for people experiencing homelessness to lie down.
It also establishes the Connecticut Department of Housing as a statewide housing authority, which means they can work with towns to build more housing and build on state land.
How is this different from the old bill?
This bill has a lot of similarities to the old bill. Many Democrats who worked on the bill said the majority has stayed the same; it’s mostly the zoning portions that have changed.
One difference is the creation of the state fund to encourage towns to participate in the programs to increase housing density near public transit and in downtowns. The former bill had measures that would have prioritized certain existing infrastructure funding for towns that decided to make certain zoning changes.
It also eliminates a process known as “fair share” that assigned each town a specific number of units to plan and zone for. Instead, regional councils of government will figure out how many units each town needs to plan for. Towns can either participate in the plans from the COGs or create their own plans and their own goals.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1112_SR_SpecialSession_015-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-17 07:56:15.156312

(Photo Courtesy Santa Fe National Forest)The New Mexico environment and health departments on Friday issued an alert urging Mora Count residents to test their private wells following the discovery of high levels of metal in the groundwater.
While the source of the metals has not been determined, a news release noted that they ones are found in fire suppressant materials used to battle wildfires — including the 2022 Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon fire.
“There are potential long-term health effects that can develop over several years if people continue to drink untreated water with these levels of metals,” New Mexico Department Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau Chief Chelsea Langer said in a statement. “The only way to know for sure what is in your well water is to have it tested by a certified laboratory.”
According to the news release, those metals at higher concentrations or with long-term exposure “can damage the kidneys, skin, cardiovascular system, and nervous system.” Infants, young children and pregnant people have the most sensitivity, particularly to arsenic and manganese, which can impact brain development.
According to a news release, three metals, antimony, arsenic and uranium, exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s safe drinking water limits, and the study found elevated levels of manganese beyond the EPA guidelines as well.
An independent study also found barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, thallium and vanadium at elevated levels, but within EPA standards.
The New Mexico Environment Department is recommending all private well owners test their water at a certified lab, and decrease exposure by drinking bottled water “when possible.” Moreover, NMED recommends installing whole-house reverse osmosis systems “out of an abundance of caution.”
The state says it will be developing additional plans for testing and water treatment solutions.

(USDA Photo by Lance Cheung)New Jersey lawmakers want the state’s retailers to tell consumers how much they’re paying for tariffs, a move criticized as unworkable by an industry group that has broadly opposed the Trump administration’s tariff policy.
Legislation sponsored by Assemblywomen Annette Quijano (D-Union) and Rosie Bagolie (D-Essex) would require retailers to display the portion of a product’s cost attributable to tariffs on store tags, receipts, and online product pages.
“The consumer has the right to know how they’re paying for the tariffs and for the goods. It’s a simple disclosure,” said Quijano, the bill’s prime sponsor in the Assembly.
The legislation, which saw a Senate companion introduced earlier this month by Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson), is Democrats’ latest response to President Donald Trump’s tariff-heavy trade policy, which was a frequent target of Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill on the campaign trail.
Tariffs are a tax on importers — in this case, firms based in the United States — on goods brought in from abroad. Tariffs raise businesses’ costs by increasing the cost of their goods, and firms typically pass some or all of those cost increases onto consumers, though the increases take time to filter through supply chains and into storefronts.
The state bill has drawn some resistance from the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, an industry group that is critical of the administration’s tariffs but warned that complicated international supply chains could make determining tariff costs impractical or expensive.
“There is a good idea behind it. As somebody who does not like tariffs — and BIA has publicly pointed out concerns with tariffs — this is a very burdensome and unrealistic way of trying to tackle the issues that tariffs bring,” said Chris Emigholz, the group’s chief government affairs officer.
Analysts spanning the political spectrum — from the conservative Tax Foundation to the liberal Urban Institute and the slew of investment banks in between — have warned the Trump administration’s tariff regime will cause the country’s gross domestic product to contract and shrink the variety and quality of goods available in the United States.
Disentangling those added costs can be complicated, Emigholz said, because businesses’ supply chains can stretch into multiple countries, each with its own tariff rate, at different stages of production for different products or components that are later imported into the United States.
Complicating matters is that businesses may not pass the entirety of tariff costs onto consumers through price increases. In competitive markets, businesses are incentivized to keep prices down, and those that add the full cost of tariffs to retail prices risk losing sales to retailers that add only a portion.
“Every day, I’m sure there’s some tax increase and some tariff being absorbed by a company for a competitive advantage, and every single day there’s tariffs being passed onto consumers because they can’t afford to,” Emigholz said.
Quijano said retailers could figure out their tariff expenses by talking to wholesalers.
The bill would require wholesalers to maintain records of their tariff costs and share those records with retailers so they can comply with the bill’s disclosure provisions. Retailers found to be out of compliance by periodic audits required under the bill would face fines of up to $500 for each violation.
“You buy from your wholesalers. You know what the price is, and the wholesalers are going to have to tell them. I don’t see it as that hard,” she said.
Uncertainty about how much tariffs were increasing prices was a major driver for the legislation, Quijano said.
“We just see prices increasing. No one’s disclosing that there’s a tariff or how much it is. That’s why this bill is so important,” she said.
The bill includes some exceptions. Retailers with less than $500,000 in annual revenue would not be required to disclose tariff costs, and no retailers would have to disclose tariff costs for any product where the import taxes account for less than 2% of the final retail price.
The bill would grant the state’s consumer affairs director the power to exempt other products from tariff reporting if such reporting would be impractical, unreasonable, or unnecessary to protect consumers.
Quijano, who said she had not yet heard the business group’s concerns, said she may accept amendments to the bill after hearing their worries.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Decades ago, a medical emergency brought Jean Whitehorse to an Indian Health Service facility in Gallup. There, she says, she was coerced into signing a form for a procedure she later learned left her unable to have more children.
Whitehorse (Navajo) is one of an untold number of Indigenous women who have been sterilized in the U.S. without their consent.
Over a roughly four-year period in the 1970s, 3,406 women were sterilized at facilities in four Indian Health Service areas, including Albuquerque, according to a 1976 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Many consent forms the agency reviewed lacked key details required by federal regulations, such as statements that the procedures were voluntary.

New Mexico In Depth originally published this article.

But the review covered only four of 12 IHS areas during a narrow window. How many more women were sterilized remains unknown.
According to later studies, at least 25% of Native women may have been sterilized.
Two state lawmakers think it’s time for a truth and reconciliation commission. During the 2026 legislative session, Sens. Shannon Pinto (Diné), D-Tohatchi, and Linda Lopez, D-Albuquerque, plan to push for a memorial to study the scope and ongoing impacts of the practice on Indigenous women and women of color in New Mexico.
The memorial would direct the Legislative Health and Human Services Committee, in collaboration with the Indian Affairs Department, to present findings and recommendations to the Legislature by the end of 2027.
“This opportunity for New Mexico is a critical one,” Keely Badger, an international human rights advocate whose Oxford University legal dissertation examined the issue, said during a presentation to the Indian Affairs Committee in Santa Fe on Thursday. No state, Badger said, has formally acknowledged this history.
In April, Badger traveled with Whitehorse to New York for the annual session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, an advisory body dedicated to discussing the concerns and rights of Indigenous peoples throughout the world. Whitehorse shared her story before the body and called for reparations for survivors and a formal apology from the U.S.

During their trip, they spoke to an independent U.N. investigator who agreed to visit New Mexico, if invited, and meet with local officials, Badger said.
The practice of forced and coerced sterilizations “contributed to a deep mistrust of health care systems” that’s made some Indigenous people reluctant to seek needed services to this day, Elena Giacci (Diné), an advocate for sexual violence survivors who also made the trip to New York earlier this year, told lawmakers.
“Today, we begin the path to acknowledge the trauma to our families and the lost generations, to discover and confront the depth of what occurred” in a way that strengthens Native communities, Giacci said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1032-e1759359429280-1024x721.jpg,,,2025-11-17 07:56:15.156312

She tole the task force that obesity is a chronic disease and should be treated comprehensively. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)A physician specializing in obesity urged state health insurers Thurday to cover comprehensive treatment of the condition, including medication like GLP-1s and lifestyle management.  
Speaking to the Chronic Weight Management and Type 2 Diabetes Task Force, Dr. Katherine Saunders said insurers must view obesity as a condition and not a lifestyle choice. 
“Obesity is a chronic disease, meaning that we don’t have a cure right now, and that in order to manage obesity effectively, it needs to be treated long term,” Saunders said. “So having patients taking GLP-1 medications and then stopping them, what a lot of people aren’t talking about is when somebody stops a GLP-1, they regain a significant amount of that weight.”
According to the National Library of Medicine, after 68 weeks on semaglutide, a GLP-1 medication, patients who lost 17.3% of their original weight gained 11.6% of it back after withdrawal.
It was not clear if legislation would result. Rep. Ed Oliver, R-Dadeville, the chair of the task force, said it will meet again in three months during the 2026 Legislative session.
“We will take up some of these topics. As the world changes in front of us, I’m sure that in three months things will be a little different than they are today,” he said.
Saunders and her mentor Louis Aronne, one of the first obesity specialists, created FlyteHealth, a comprehensive care model. Saunders told the task force that comprehensive care is the only way to treat obesity.
“It’s not just about getting every single patient with obesity a prescription for GLP-1 receptor agonist,” Saunders said. 
She is one of nearly 10,000 physicians in the United States that specialize in treating obesity, a chronic health condition, she said. There are 77 obesity physicians in Alabama, according to the American Board of Obesity Medicine.
According to the U.S. Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 39.2% of Alabama’s population was obese in 2023, the fifth-highest percentage in the nation. The CDC About 1 in 5 Americans are obese, according to the CDC. 
The CDC defines obese as a person with a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 30. BMI was created in the 1830s by a Belgian statistician, mathematician, and astronomer, who wanted to establish what an “average man” was, according to the National Library of Medicine. It did not include age in the calculation and was not intended to be used as a medical tool.
Saunders said that obesity cannot be treated with only GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, Wegovy and semaglutide injections, which have become increasingly popular. 
“There’s not a single person I can think of who hasn’t had a bump in the road,” Saunders said. “If there isn’t a plan for long term care, and somebody hits a bump in the road, and they’re not still following their medical team, they’re going to regain all their weight. Then they’re going to be in a really bad situation.”
According to ClinCalc DrugStats, a data resource that is managed by pharmacist Sean Kane, almost 5.4 million Americans were prescribed semaglutide, one of four major GLP-1 medications, in 2023. It was the 19th most prescribed medication at almost 26 million prescriptions. It was also one of the most expensive. The average drug cost was $1,322 per prescription with an average out-of-pocket cost of $53 per prescription, according to ClinCalc. 
According to a recent KFF poll, a nonprofit health policy research organization, 18% of adults have taken a GLP-1 for weight loss, diabetes or another condition, with 12% currently taking one. That’s an increase of six points since May 2024, according to the poll.
FlytHealth’s program includes constant contact with physicians, lifestyle management and medication when necessary. Saunders said that not all patients need a GLP-1 to achieve their health and weight goals.
“We start with less expensive, generic alternatives. The medication Metformin can be incredibly effective for a subset of people,” she said. “We use GLP-1s if and when we need to.”
She said there are a lot of factors that lead to obesity, and some are not preventable. Conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), insulin resistance and sleep apnea contribute to obesity and the inability to lose weight and not gain it back.
Dr. Jonathan Parker, an obesity physician in Muscle Shoals, said that there are a lot of hoops providers have to jump through to get patients the medication they need. He said it is hard to get GLP-1s covered for a patient that needs it, he said, like somebody with a BMI of 27 and PCOS.
“We have guidelines from all these national organizations that are telling us ‘This is what you should do.’ At times, that also includes the recommendation to use GLP-1s,” he said.
Despite the popularity of GLP-1 medications, half of the adults polled said it is hard to afford the medication. Rising health costs have impacted public and private insurance, with expensive prescriptions contributing. The Trump Administration announced this month that the out-of-pocket prices of Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound and Orforglipron, will fall when purchased through TrumpRX.com, a new website the White House has created to spotlight Trump’s work to reduce drug prices.
Oliver said he has been taking a GLP-1 for the last few years and pays $500 per month out of pocket.
“The thought of not doing that anymore is really exciting,” Oliver said.
According to the administration, Ozempic and Wegovy will fall from $1,000 and $1,350 per month, respectively, to $350 per month, and Zepbound and Orforglipron, if approved, will fall from $1,086 per month to an average of $346 per month.
“We’re hopeful that the reduction in the cost of real brand name medications will help take care of some of this. But it’s a very vulnerable population that will pay a lot or do anything to finally treat their disease,” Saunders said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1214-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 07:56:15.156312

(Getty Images)In Bloomington, a packed auditorium at Indiana University heard Gov. Mike Braun speak at a Turning Point USA event that drew thousands of students. The gathering came just weeks after the assassination of Charlie Kirk and it underscored how powerfully speech can unite or divide a community. Yet while one part of campus celebrated the right to assemble and speak freely, another faced the loss of that same freedom.
Indiana University ended the print edition of its student newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student, and dismissed its adviser, Jim Rodenbush, after he refused an administrative order to limit content in a Homecoming issue. The university cited a structural deficit and a move toward digital publishing. I along with many others see something else: an attempt to control editorial content. For a public university meant to foster open inquiry it sent a chilling message.
If our largest university can silence its own student journalists, what does that say about free expression across Indiana? We champion cherished liberties, from the right to bear arms to the right to worship freely and pursue opportunity. Yet the First Amendment the foundation of all those freedoms often lacks the same defense.
The university has since reversed its stance on print editions but tensions are still high.
The new face of censorship in Indiana
Free expression faces new pressures across our state. The Attorney General’s “Eyes on Education” portal, launched in 2024, invites citizens to report teachers and schools for “inappropriate” materials or comments. Marketed as transparency, it has instead created fear.
Teachers worry that a book, a classroom discussion, or even a social-media post might trigger an investigation. While no mass firings have occurred, many educators now self-censor to avoid controversy.
National surveys show that more than half of teachers report limiting discussions about race, gender, or current events. Defenders of the portal say it gives parents a voice. But vague accusations and anonymous complaints do not empower families; they intimidate educators. The result is a culture that echoes the McCarthy era, when suspicion replaced dialogue and fear silenced dissent.
In Fishers and Noblesville, the Hamilton East Public Library Board ordered staff to remove and review hundreds of young-adult books, including titles by Indiana author John Green, for “inappropriate” content. After months of public backlash, the board reversed the policy in 2023, but librarians and teachers across the state took note. Many now hesitate to include books that could provoke complaints.
In Carmel, repeated challenges to reading lists and classroom materials have left teachers cautious about introducing complex topics. When lessons are trimmed to avoid controversy, students lose the opportunity to think critically about the world around them. These pressures, from classrooms to libraries, shrink open dialogue in communities that once valued curiosity and debate.
Protecting the First like the Second
We say we cherish our freedoms. Now we have to prove it. The First Amendment deserves the same fierce defense that we give every other right. Without freedom to speak, write, and question authority, our ability to protect any liberty falters.
Rokita’s new ‘Eyes on Education’ portal prompts pushback from Indiana school officials

Free expression is messy. It can offend. It can provoke. But the strength of democracy lies in our willingness to protect even the ideas that make us uncomfortable. When governments or communities decide which opinions are acceptable, no one is safe from shifting political winds.
We do not need portals or book bans to safeguard our schools. We need trust in teachers to educate, support for journalists to report truth, and courage among citizens to disagree without fear. Censorship, whether it comes from the left or the right, weakens the shared foundation we all stand on.
Protecting free speech starts with everyday action. Attend school-board meetings and speak up for fair curriculum policies, as residents did in Noblesville when they pushed to restore banned books. Support student journalists by subscribing to the Indiana Daily Student or donating to the Student Press Law Center. Encourage lawmakers to reform the “Eyes on Education” portal so that only verified complaints, not anonymous tips, trigger reviews. These small steps can rebuild trust and ensure that Indiana’s classrooms and newsrooms remain places for open dialogue.
The First Amendment is the heartbeat of a free society. By defending it with action, supporting educators, journalists, and honest debate, we can keep Indiana a state where liberty is more than a slogan. Free speech, though messy, is our strength. Let us protect it with the same courage we bring to the Second Amendment.

In the telling of that story, for a year, the Anishinaabe people no longer saw deer, caribou, or moose. When they started asking each other why, they realized that they had not been wisely using the meat or the hides of the animals that they were harvesting, unnecessarily increasing the hardships on the Hoof Nation, whom they considered to be relatives. When one scout reported back that they saw a deer, they said that they were being mistreated.
“They no longer wanted to be part of the Anishinaabe lifestyle until their grievances were met,” Migizi said. “And so they just up and left.”
That Hoof Nation treaty is one of the first treaties that the Anishinaabe people had, Migizi explained, and has informed the ceremony that happens now when an animal is shot and used for food and clothing. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“If the roles are reversed and our people are not having treaty obligations met by the U.S., then why are we still participating in a system that harms us?” Migizi asked. “Why are we following rules? Why are we not taking our lead from the Hoof Nation, who said, ‘I’m no longer going to participate in things that harm me’?”
These questions were prominent in Migizi’s mind amid the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history, in which Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, a food assistance program that about 1.4 million people in Michigan use, were paused for the first half of November. While those benefits are finally being paid out now that the government has reopened, the broader implications on food sovereignty still apply.
“That’s the key thing. How do we feed our people, right?” Joe Van Alstine, the food distribution program specialist for the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians and the midwest region president of the National Association of Food Distribution Programs on Indian Reservations, said. 
“Food sovereignty for tribes is mandatory,” Van Alstine continued. “For us to go ahead and create our own distribution centers, our own distribution channels, networks, being able to work with local farmers to help put food in food boxes.”
Tribal citizens, in Michigan and around the United States, are also eligible for a different food aid program, the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, or FDPIR, which is colloquially known as commodities. Only a small fraction of Michigan’s tribal population are enrolled in the commodity program — USDA data shows that, as of June, enrollment in the state had not reached over 2,000 households since early 2018.

Households cannot be enrolled in both commodities and in SNAP in the same month. At least one of Michigan’s federally recognized tribes, the Bay Mills Indian Community, announced on social media that they would allow members who are normally on SNAP to apply for emergency benefits, but this would mean disenrolling from SNAP. 
“We were really worried about a lot of folks coming over from SNAP to FDPIR, who are tribal. And here, we have seen a slight increase in that,” said Van Alstine. But the government takes time to process closing someone’s SNAP benefits to switch to the Indigenous distribution program — and his job is to ensure that people are not receiving double benefits, even unintentionally. 
“Once you’re certified on the SNAP side for that month, our hands are tied,” he said. “With this administration, their biggest thing is fraud and abuse right now. For FDPIR we have a pretty good record of being really diligent on that.”










If the roles are reversed and our people are not having treaty obligations met by the U.S., then why are we still participating in a system that harms us?


– Meredith Migizi, the executive director of indigenous advocacy organization Miigwech, Inc.


Migizi also expressed concerns about logistical backlogs for those who would consider switching to commodities, given the uncertainty of when SNAP benefits will be restored. “If you get off SNAP, and then three days later, they decide, we’re gonna put SNAP back in,” she said, “you might have to wait 30 to 60 days to get your application re-approved.”
Migizi is not involved in tribal politics, nor does she want to be. But she urged tribal leaders to think more creatively about how to use the commodities program to help their members in a time of crisis, such as a loss of SNAP benefits. 
“There’s a really unique opportunity to also make sure that there’s food security for our people on SNAP by not making more barriers,” she said. “We know you can’t be on SNAP and commods at the same time, right? Could we make it so our people can do it temporarily? I’m sure there’s a way to do it. I’m sure it’s going to be difficult, but it would also be asserting our treaty rights of guaranteed health and safety during this time for our people.”

Commodities work differently than SNAP benefits — they don’t allow participants to shop at any grocery store. Instead, households get certain ingredients and foods, which do include traditional foods like walleye and wild rice, from a specific distribution center located on or immediately around tribal lands. 
Earlier this year, the food distributor that was supposed to send Van Alstine and other food distribution specialists failed to get the food that they needed to them, and trucks were not arriving with that month’s supplies.  
“It’s not just one item in the food package,” Van Alstine said, noting that this incident led to conversations about how to continue to provide food to the people who rely on the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations. “We didn’t have anything in the warehouse. And so what they (distribution directors) did is they worked with the Commodity Credit Corporation, to provide a monetary supplement to each tribe who wanted it.”
The program is intended to serve those who live on or immediately near the service area of a tribe, which means that for tribal citizens who live outside that area — including in cities like Detroit, Lansing or Grand Rapids — they cannot access this program. And even if they did qualify, Migizi noted, it would be unreasonable to ask people to drive potentially hundreds of miles to get food from the designated distribution center. 
“Low-income American Indian and non-Indian households that reside on a reservation, and households living in approved areas near a reservation or in Oklahoma that contain at least one person who is a member of a Federally-recognized tribe are eligible to participate in FDPIR,” according to the USDA. 
However, Van Alstine noted, he and others in his position have worked with the USDA to change rules around having distribution centers in urban centers where there is a significant tribal population. Lansing, Grand Rapids and Traverse City were all places with a notable population from the Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians, where he would aim to open distribution centers. 
“I would love to set up a store down there and a food distribution center for them to come in there. But it takes tribal leadership to also see that,” he said. “It’s not that we don’t think about them.”

Migizi’s organization, Miigwech Inc., partners with local farmers and tribal fishermen to bring food boxes across the state, including in the metro Detroit area, when they host events, a way to engage those who have become disconnected from tribal government. 
“As a tribal citizen, as someone who runs a tribally incorporated nonprofit, I assert my sovereignty every day, and it’s hard to watch my relations in the community go hungry,” she said. 
“I would hope that tribal governments look and they remember those traditional stories, and that they realize that that’s who we are as Anishinaabe, and that a lot of us talk about treaty assertion,” Migizi added. “How are we asserting those if we’re making it so some of our people go hungry, our most vulnerable, our elders and our youth?”

Mike Braun's hallmark tax law may squash growth in assessed value statewide through 2031, when key changes take full effect.","Larry DeBoer, an emeritus professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, presents an analysis of recent Indiana property tax changes on Nov. 14, 2025. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Recent changes to Indiana’s property tax system will likely cut bills for most Hoosier homeowners, a new analysis has found.
But owners of pricey houses are expected to get bigger breaks, while those with low-valued dwellings may pay more, according to an Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute report released Friday.
Its author, Indiana tax expert Larry DeBoer, said Gov. Mike Braun’s hallmark tax law may squash growth in assessed value statewide through 2031, when key changes take full effect.
Indiana Senate sends finalized local property, income tax plan to governor

Chief among them is the homestead standard deduction, which Senate Enrolled Act 1 phases out by 2031. The fixed deduction lops $48,000 off the taxable value of a primary residence.
“If you’ve got a half-million-dollar house — you got a million-dollar house — $48,000 is nothing,” DeBoer said. “If you’ve got an $80,000 house, $48,000 is very significant.”
DeBoer, an emeritus agricultural economics professor at Purdue University, presented his results Friday at the Indiana Farm Bureau’s headquarters in Indianapolis.
The supplemental deduction, however, will rise from its current 37.5% to a whopping 66.7% by 2031. Because it’s a percentage, homeowners will save less on cheap homes than pricey ones.
The breakeven point — at which the two policies yield the same taxable value — is a home worth $102,740, per DeBoer. He estimated the average in Indiana at $234,500.
Counties with high homestead values, particularly Boone and Hamilton, will take harder hits to their tax bases, he said.
If Senate Enrolled Act 1 restricts assessed value growth but levies — the total governments can collect — rise, tax rates will also creep higher. DeBoer calculated that most property will hit the property tax caps at a rate of $3 per $100 in assessed value.
Homestead property owners get a circuit breaker credit on the amount of property taxes over 1% of assessed value. Many primary residences will likely reach the caps by 2031, according to the analysis. Property tax bills for those houses will be higher than now, but lower than they would’ve been without the law.

DoBoer joked that when Hoosiers complain bills went up, local officials can reply, “‘Ah, had we not changed the policy, it would have gone up even more!’ And the taxpayer will be satisfied.”
“Rueful laughter, right?” DeBoer said. Under his projections, it “really is a tax reduction … for the average homeowner, but the average homeowner is not going to believe it!”
But, for those not at the caps? Pricey homes are expected to carry smaller increases in their bills — or even slight drops. Low-value homes could see double-digit percentage hikes, per the report.
Also, beginning in 2026, a new supplemental tax credit will apply after the caps, taking off 10%, or up to $300.
More changes
Property types that hit the caps at 2% of assessed value get new breaks under Senate Enrolled Act 1 — “the first deduction that those folks have ever really gotten,” DeBoer said.
Non-homestead residential, like apartment buildings or vacation houses, falls under that category. So does farmland.
The new deduction phases into 33.4% by 2031.
DeBoer estimated that, if gross assessed value for non-homestead residential rises 5% annually through 2031, the net assessed value would fall each year over that time period.
Farmland net assessed value is also projected to fall most years, and. Under DeBoer’s assumptions, the net would be 33.4% lower in 2031 than it is in 2025.
Senate Enrolled Act 1 also raised the business personal property exemption from $80,000 to $2 million. DeBoer said that will impact small and medium-sized firms more, since larger ones with more property will continue paying as before.
Counties with a high share of business personal property will see lower losses from the exemption, like rural counties hosting large electric utility installations, according to the analysis.

The law also ditches a 30% floor on those property assessments after 2025. DeBoer predicted little effect in the short term, higher assessed values in the medium term and lower assessed values in the long run, once the business personal property purchased before 2026 has been retired.
But there could be loopholes.
One attendee asked what happens if, when a company purchases $2 million worth of equipment, it does so under a new entity.
“One of the goals of property tax policies is to create a neutral system that does not influence business decision-making,” DeBoer replied, to laughter. “And I suspect they’ve created something that (could) …”
“Obviously, the big ones aren’t going to be able to divide themselves up into little, $2 million segments, but a medium-sized business, one could manage it,” he continued. “… Accountants and lawyers are going to earn their money.”
Business real property gets no new deductions.
“Taxes in SEA 1 are shifting to big businesses with lots of personal property, and to rural homeowners with very low value homes,” DeBoer said. “It’s an interesting policy mix.”

Bob Ferguson signing Senate Bill 5480, a bill exempting medical debt from credit reports, on April 22, 2025. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Just months after Gov. Bob Ferguson signed a Washington law to keep medical debt off consumers’ credit reports, the Trump administration is looking to block such policies.
The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau now says federal law preempts laws like Washington’s. The federal agency’s position is a reversal from the Biden era.
Backers of Senate Bill 5480, which stops collection agencies from reporting medical debt to credit agencies, decried the move. 
“Overturning safeguards around medical debt is just another indicator that we have a president that prioritizes cash money to special interests over people,” said state Sen. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane, the bill’s sponsor. “And honestly, I don’t get this upset typically, but I’m pretty upset.”
The bureau’s new interpretation of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, filed in the Federal Register late last month, doesn’t invalidate Washington’s law, but opens it up to legal challenges.
A spokesperson for Attorney General Nick Brown said his office is tracking the issue.
It comes as many people in Washington and across the country face spiking health care premiums due in part to the end of federal subsidies that help pay for Affordable Care Act coverage. These tax credits were at the center of the government shutdown fight. 
Thousands in Washington are expected to forgo health insurance because of the rising premiums. Costs for employer-sponsored plans are also increasing.
Adam Zarrin, of Blood Cancers United, called it “devastating timing.”
“What’s going to happen is that more Americans, more Washingtonians are going to incur medical debt,” Zarrin added. “It will happen.”
Riccelli’s bill passed the Legislature this year with some bipartisan support. It took effect in late July.
In a survey last year from the American Cancer Society, nearly half of cancer patients and survivors reported dealing with medical debt, even though almost all were insured.
About six in 10 Washingtonians say they would struggle to pay an unexpected $500 medical bill, and around the same proportion reported avoiding or altering their medical care because of the cost, according to Northwest Health Law Advocates.
The goal of the new law is to stop debt from hurting residents’ chances of renting an apartment or buying a car, and to remove it as a barrier to people seeking treatment, said Audrey Miller García, the government relations director for Washington at the American Cancer Society.
“This is not debt that they acquired because they were out on a shopping spree,” she said. “They were sick. This is not their fault.”
Over a dozen states have these laws on the books. Others include California, Colorado, Illinois and New York.
In 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under then-President Joe Biden issued the opposite guidance of the Trump administration. The federal agency said states could ban medical debt from credit reports. Many states then passed their laws. 
The following year, three major credit bureaus voluntarily announced medical debt under $500 would no longer appear on their credit reports.
Separate from the 2022 guidance, the Biden administration finalized a rule this January barring medical debt reporting under some circumstances federally. But industry groups sued, and the new Trump administration declined to defend the new federal policy, so a federal judge in Texas voided it over the summer, ruling that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had exceeded its statutory authority.

Now, with Trump in office, the bureau says its own prior interpretation was “manifestly wrong” and “reflected a misguided policy choice that would undermine the credit reporting system and credit markets.”
“The 2022 rule sowed confusion into the credit reporting system by creating a patchwork quilt of federal and state laws competing to govern the marketplace,” states the notice signed by White House budget director Russell Vought, who is also acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Miller García called it a “full 180.” 
In a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year, the conservative majority undercut the power of federal agencies to interpret ambiguous laws, instead leaving that power to the courts.
Meanwhile, Trump is seeking to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau entirely within months.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1724-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 07:56:15.156312

Brian Stack, who is also the Union City mayor, would allow towns to ""purchase"" unused sick time from employees annually, which one critic said could fuel fraud and waste. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Public employees who want to cash in on their unused sick time wouldn’t have to wait until retirement to do so under new legislation.
Under a bill sponsored by Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson), government officials could “purchase” up to 120 hours a year of accumulated sick leave from employees at up to 60% of its worth. The bill would undo part of a 2007 law that allowed such payouts to be disbursed only at retirement. Employees would have to maintain at least 800 hours of accrued sick time after such a purchase.
It’s unclear what motivated the bill. Stack, who’s also the Union City mayor, did not respond to a request for comment.
Lavish sick leave payouts to retiring public workers have long been a target for reform by government watchdogs.
Acting state Comptroller Kevin D. Walsh urged state legislators in 2022 to tighten up sick leave rules after his investigators found, in a review of 60 towns statewide, that most illegally paid out millions and ignored state caps on such payouts, which can cripple local budgets. Walsh earlier this month directed Pleasantville to correct sick leave and severance policies he called “wasteful and ripe for fraud” after investigators found the city paid its former business administrator almost $84,000 in accumulated sick leave she wasn’t entitled to.
Asked to comment, Walsh blasted the bill as “a step in the wrong direction.”
“It’s effectively a taxpayer-funded bonus that will fuel waste, favoritism, and ballooning government costs,” Walsh said in a statement. “At a time when the state is facing a budget crunch and many residents are financially struggling, it’s terrible to see this bill that would invite more fraud, waste, and abuse and favoritism.”
The proposal has some cautious early support.
John Donnadio, executive director of the New Jersey Association of Counties, said it could help local officials better financially prepare for the departure of employees who are due checks for accrued sick leave by paying them smaller amounts over time instead of a one-time windfall. He also likes that the plan would allow, but not require, local governments to make these changes.
“I don’t know the politics behind the bill, but it seems like maybe you can use it as a budgeting tool,” Donnadio said.
The bill has no Assembly companion and has not yet been scheduled for a committee hearing. Lawmakers have a short window to act on legislation in the Statehouse pipeline, with the current session set to end in mid-January.

Bill Eigel of Weldon Spring, shown in a 2024 photo, is using recurring donations from across the country to finance his bid for St. Charles County executive (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).A Korean War veteran from Nebraska named Russell Wood made 35 donations totaling $1,050 over the last year to Bill Eigel’s campaign for St. Charles County executive.
The problem is, Wood, who is 92, has never heard of Eigel or set foot in St. Charles County. He told The Independent he had no idea he had made so many donations to Eigel’s campaign.
At some point in the last four years, one of Eigel’s fundraising emails — which focus on national issues and often don’t make any mention of Eigel — showed up in Wood’s inbox. He’s concerned about immigration and crime and donated thinking he was giving to help Donald Trump and other Republicans defeat Democrats. 
That’s when he appears to have been caught in an online fundraising practice that makes donations automatically repeat on a weekly or monthly basis unless the contributor changes a pre-checked box.
Wood said he doesn’t recall making any donations this year, “and if I did, it wasn’t to anybody in Missouri.”
Wood is one of 141 people nationally — including six from Missouri — who made multiple donations to Eigel’s 2024 campaign for governor who are also contributors to his St. Charles County executive race. 
One retired woman in Texas, who made 143 donations to Eigel’s campaign for governor, has contributed $1,205 in 74 separate donations since December. All are about the same dates each month, just like the donations to the campaign for governor.
She could not be reached for an interview.
Automatic recurring donations have been criticized as “dirty and rotten” for taking advantage of people who respond to one message with a small gift but who wind up giving thousands over several months or years.
Out-of-state donors fuel pair of GOP candidates running for Missouri governor, AG

It’s not the first time Eigel’s fundraising strategy has raised concerns. During his run for governor last year, a similar scheme drew the ire of President Trump’s campaign, who complained Eigel was using his name to raise money without permission.
And thanks to the widely held view that an Eigel victory next year could serve as a springboard for a rematch with Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe in the 2028 GOP primary, he’s facing more scrutiny than a candidate for St. Charles County executive usually endures. 
“I would say that it’s a matter of his character, the fact that he is allowing these tactics to go out under PACs that are supporting him, and has never once condemned the tactics that he’s authorizing,” said Mike Hafner, a Republican consultant close to Kehoe who is working for one of Eigel’s opponents in the Republican primary for county executive, Lake St. Louis Mayor Jason Law.
Law has raised $528,000. Only seven of his donors are from outside Missouri. Incumbent Republican Steve Ehlmann has raised nothing, spent what little he had on consulting during the summer and will start the campaign with $2,436.
Eigel’s campaign declined to comment on his fundraising practices, instead providing an emailed statement on the dynamics of the county executive race. 
“I’m not thinking about Mike Kehoe or Steve Ehlmann and whatever their political goals might or might not be,” Eigel said. “I’m thinking about St. Charles — a St. Charles that is free from personal property tax and growing again after several years of stagnation.”
 Tried-and-true tactics

After victories last week by Democrats in Virginia, New York and other states, Eigel’s fundraising machine warned email recipients that socialists are coming to take over small towns.
There are “radical Democrats who openly cheer when conservatives are hurt or killed,” read one message from the Believe in Life and Liberty, or BILL, PAC.
Another, headlined “Antifa Insurrection Warning,” told recipients: “They want to destroy our country through violent uprising to install a Socialist ‘utopia’ where the law of the land comes from leftist ideology, not morals or principles.” 
The appeals never mention Eigel or identify the purpose of BILL PAC, which is named as the recipient in small type at the bottom of the emails.










When I started getting my thoughts back and my memory was rebounding, I realized, holy crap, I've given almost $9,000 the last four years.


– Russell Wood, Nebraska veteran


The fundraising emails caught the attention of Bill MacKenzie, a former reporter and Capitol Hill staffer for Republicans and Democrats who lives in Oregon. In a post on his personal blog from early October, he wrote that it was “deceptive” to use a national focus in the BILL PAC appeals to collect money for a candidate seeking a Missouri county office.
“He’s successfully raising a ton of money,” MacKenzie told The Independent, “by appealing to a very narrow constituency, seniors all around the country, when he’s not even running for a national office.” 
Those appeals, and hundreds of similar messages sent this year, have brought in nearly $480,000 to BILL PAC. Of that amount, nearly $90,000 has been spent raising the money, while $154,000 has been transferred to Eigel’s campaign committee.
Similar fundraising messages with a national sweep helped Eigel raise $1.8 million and BILL PAC raise almost $5 million during the 2024 campaign for governor. Kehoe won with 39% of the vote, after spending more than $17 million through his campaign and PAC efforts, while Eigel took 33%.
Both BILL PAC and Eigel’s campaign committee raise the vast share of their itemized donations from outside the state. Of 3,679 itemized contributions this year to BILL PAC this year, only 137 are from within Missouri. Fewer than half that number are from constituents who could actually vote in next year’s county executive election.
Of the 1,074 itemized donations so far this year to Eigel’s campaign committee, only 11 are from Missouri, representing seven individual contributors. Only four live in St. Charles County. 
There are more contributors to Eigel from New Jersey, Florida, Texas and California than Missouri.
“It really exposes a weakness in our political system, that people who give money are giving based upon some ideology nationally,” MacKenzie said. “They’re giving based upon ideological viewpoints about national issues, without even necessarily being aware of where that money’s going.”
Hafner said the Missouri Ethics Commission should investigate Eigel’s fundraising.
“It appears to me,” he said, “that he has picked up exactly where he left off in the governor’s race in using highly deceptive fundraising tactics to con people out of contributions.” 
 Automatic contributions

In 2021, after an investigative series by the New York Times, the Republican National Committee and the campaign committee for Donald Trump refunded $12.8 million collected from people who thought they were making a single donation.
Instead, the online solicitation signed them up for weekly contributions. The tactic was adopted by Republican and Democratic fundraising organizations. In 2023, an analysis of millions of campaign contributions by researchers at Columbia University found that about half of top Republicans signed donors up for automatic repeats. The practice was less prevalent among Democrats.
That’s the system that brought Wood’s money into Eigel’s campaign.
Wood’s first donation to Eigel occurred Oct. 1, 2023, with additional donations on Oct. 12, Oct. 24 and Oct. 29 of that year. The contributions, totaling $1,380, repeated on or about the same days each month until August 2024, with one final donation on Sept. 29, 2024. That was 10 days before Eigel’s gubernatorial committee closed its books for good.
The automatic donations resumed when Eigel’s campaign rebooted in January, and Wood has given $1,050 to Eigel this year.
The BILL PAC fundraising appeals have a recurring donation box but it is not pre-checked. Even if it were pre-checked, the tactic is not illegal in Missouri.
An attempt to ban the practice in 2023 in Pennsylvania didn’t advance very far and New Jersey lawmakers became interested in banning it this year after reports in Politico about the fundraising by a Republican candidate for governor.
Wood said he made his first online contribution in 2021 to the Republican National Committee. He’s since been diagnosed with early dementia, which Wood said he is combating with vitamin and other therapies.
“I didn’t find out about (this year’s donations) until I got a note from someone thanking me for help,” Wood said. “And then when I started getting my thoughts back and my memory was rebounding, I realized, holy crap, I’ve given almost $9,000 the last four years.”
Wood said he has tried making small donations to uncheck the recurring donation box and thinks some of it has been successful. When it doesn’t work, he’s tried to contact political organizations to stop it but they keep adding charges to his credit card, he said.
“I’ve got my tit in a wringer here,” he said.
 The shadow primary

While Kehoe won the statewide contest in 2024, Eigel defeated him handily in his home county, taking just under 46% of the vote. In 2016, when Eigel was elected to the state Senate in St. Charles County, he won his primary with 40% of the vote.
Eigel’s high name recognition and fundraising prowess, along with fears he could use the office as a platform to stage another run for governor, helped convince Ehlmann, executive since 2007, to forgo retirement and run for a sixth term. 
Ehlmann has never been tested in a contest for county executive. He won his first term in 2006 without a primary opponent and took 60% of the vote in the general election. He’s only had nominal primary opposition, if any, since and has run unopposed by Democrats on two occasions.
Law is staying in the race, Hafner said, and will focus on St. Charles County issues while Eigel raises money talking about national questions. He wants the donors to know what their money is for, he said.
“A lot of them would be furious if they knew that their money was going to a candidate for a local office in a state, you know, on the other side of the country, or multiple states away,” Hafner said.
Mike Elam, a St. Charles County councilman who intended to run for executive if Ehlmann retired, said he wants Eigel to show he can find backers in the county.
“If Bill has so much support from St Charles County, why is it 97% or if not more of his fundraising coming from retirees around the country?” Elam said. “Why is he not trying to fundraise from St Charles County, people who supposedly support his campaign?”
In Nebraska, Wood isn’t thinking about Missouri politics. He said he wants to use his modest income to help his seven grandchildren, 17 great grandchildren and three great-great grandchildren.
The money already donated is gone, Wood said.
“Do I want to get it back? Not really,” he said. “But I want to stop the flow.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Eigel-speaking-20240702-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 07:56:15.156312

In oral arguments on Nov. 5, a majority of the justices on the court voiced open skepticism over Trump’s claim that he has authority to impose sweeping tariffs under a law that does not even use the word “tariffs.” The law in question is the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.
During the argument, Chief Justice John Roberts told Solicitor General John Sauer in no uncertain terms that tariffs are “the imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been the core power of Congress.” Roberts thus rejected Sauer’s baffling claim that tariffs were a form of “import regulation” and not a tax. Sauer was trying the couch the tariffs as “import regulations” to fit the language of IEEPA.
Roberts also questioned how the authority to impose tariffs could pass muster under the “major questions” doctrine. Roberts observed that Sauer was claiming broad authority under the statute “to impose tariffs on any product, in any amount, for any length of time.”
That stuck Roberts as “major authority,” and “the basis for that claim seems to be a misfit.” Roberts noted the word “tariff” is not even in the statute.
In a surprising set of questions, Justice Neil Gorsuch opined the president’s usurpation of the tariff authority of Congress violated separation of powers. Echoing his concerns under the non-delegation doctrine, Gorsuch questioned how Congress could recover this core constitutional authority once it has been improperly delegated.
Gorsuch was taken aback by Sauer’s claims about the breadth of president’s inherent powers in foreign affairs. Gorsuch asked: “What would prohibit Congress from just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce — or for that matter, declare war — to the president?”
From a textualist standpoint, Justice Amy Coney Barrett took issue with Sauer’s claim that IEEPA’s language granting presidents the emergency power to regulate imports encompasses tariffs.
Barrett asked: “Can you point to any other place in the code or any time in history where that phrase ‘regulate importation’ has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?” Justice Sonya Sotomayor expressed frustration when Sauer refused to give a direct answer to Barrett’s question.
The three liberal justices voiced their own concerns. For instance, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson observed IEEPA was designed to limit presidential authority, not expand it. She declared: “It’s pretty clear that Congress was trying to constrain the emergency powers of the president.”
With the liberals almost certain to vote against Trump, that appears to make at least a five-justice majority against the tariffs. Because Barrett posed tough questions to both sides, I view her vote as more uncertain. At least that’s my preliminary headcount.
Yet the court was obviously divided.
Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett voiced some possible justification for the tariffs by referring to Nixon’s imposition of tariffs under an older statute that was a precursor to IEEPA. Kavanaugh also has expressed skepticism over whether the major questions doctrine should apply to matters of foreign policy and national security.
And Barrett seemed to acknowledge what a “mess” it would create if the court forced the administration to unwind the tariffs. Justices Alito and Thomas are likely to back Trump on all the tariff issues. So, the final decision is still up in the air. It’s always a bit risky to predict the result from oral arguments alone.
But legal scholars may have been wrong on a fundamental question how the Supreme Court is dealing with Trump. The conservative majority repeatedly acquiesced to Trump in the multiple emergency docket orders. The majority has shown an almost reckless indifference to questions of irreparable injury in these orders. Lawyers have worried the court was not willing to serve as a proper check on Trump’s abuse of power. I have expressed that same concern in some of my own writings.
The tariff appeal shows the blind deference to Trump may not apply when the court is engaging in a full plenary review of major constitutional and statutory questions. In the merits cases, the justices can no longer hide their reasoning behind unsigned orders.
What I find interesting in the tariff appeal is that some justices seem open to applying conservative legal theories like major questions and non-delegation against Trump.
We’ll see how that plays out in the coming months. If I had to guess, I suspect the Trump administration may face similar skepticism from the justices in the birthright citizenship appeal. I’m cautiously optimistic.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/supremecourtoctober2024norman-scaled-e1763058490829-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 06:56:58.308708

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)A program to expand electric vehicle charging stations in Wisconsin is getting  a $14 million jolt with plans to build 26 more stations across the state.
Gov. Tony Evers and the Wisconsin Department of Transportation announced the expansion plan Monday.
The announcement recharges the state’s electrical vehicle charging network project, supported by the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. NEVI, part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law signed by  then-President Joe Biden, provides grants to states to build more charging stations.
“Transportation is evolving, and departments of transportation and states have to adapt with that evolution,” said John DesRivieres, WisDOT’s communications director. “As the market and the number of folks who are driving electric vehicles grows, EV infrastructure is needed.”
NEVI funding paused after President Donald Trump took office, and Wisconsin was one of 15 states along with the District of Columbia to sue the Trump administration in May for cutting off money for the program. A federal judge blocked the administration in June from defunding NEVI, and the Wisconsin DOT subsequently restarted its program.
The $14 million in federal funds for Wisconsin’s new round of charging stations will go to projects in communities throughout the state, from Superior in the northwest to East Troy in the southeast. They include 11 locations at Kwik Trip service stations, six locations at hotels or resorts, six locations at other service station brands and a handful of other businesses.
“My administration and I have prioritized ensuring our state’s infrastructure meets the needs of the 21st Century since Day One because expanding our clean energy and electric vehicle infrastructure helps create jobs and bolster our economy, and it’s good for our planet, too,” Evers said. “Thanks to our actions to get the Trump Administration to release this critical funding that they were illegally withholding, we are thrilled to see the NEVI program continue to support these goals and further move us toward the clean energy future Wisconsinites deserve.”
The transportation department chose projects based on their location, their potential for future development, and the business site’s hours. Extended hours were given preference to accommodate longer refueling times, according to WisDOT.
Wisconsin’s plan calls for charging stations along 15 major interstate, U.S. and state highway corridors that cross the state. A WisDOT EV charging station dashboard shows the locations for all planned chargers in the state.
With the round of grants announced Monday, Wisconsin has invested a total of $36.4 million in federal funds for 78 projects.

The first round, announced in May 2024, invested $22.4 million to build 52 stations. Of those, 11 are operational, 16 have been authorized for construction and the rest are in pre-construction phases.
A federal tax credit for electric vehicles that was included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act abruptly ended, effective Sept. 30, under the Republican tax-cut and spending mega-bill enacted in July.
“There are already 37,000 EVs on the road today, and we saw that number spike as people raced to purchase EVs before the federal tax credit expired,” said Alex Beld, communications director for Renew Wisconsin, a nonprofit that promotes policies and programs to expand solar, wind and hydropower along with building electrification, energy storage and electric vehicles.
“By expanding our network of charging stations, we hope to see that number continue to climb,” Beld said. “Through this transition away from gas-powered vehicles, we can reduce emissions and support our state’s economy.”
An analysis by SRI International published in 2023 for the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. concluded that “there is a tremendous opportunity for Wisconsin to develop a globally competitive cluster centered on the manufacturing of EVs and EV-related equipment, which in turn can help revitalize Wisconsin’s automotive manufacturing industry and drive statewide economic development.”
Beld said that jobs related to clean energy grew four times faster than the rest of Wisconsin’s economy in 2024.
“If this funding had been clawed back permanently, I think we would have still seen progress,” Beld said. “It would have certainly been slower and would have likely cost the state jobs.”

Oklahoma Turnpike Authority officials said such messages are scams, and that they will never contact people via text message about unpaid debt. (Photo illustration by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)I was pretty sure I was being pranked or scammed when a collections company called to inform me that I owed $15.23 in unpaid Oklahoma tolls.
I told the caller bluntly that I was certain it was a scam and I wouldn’t be paying Linebarger, Goggan, Blair and Sampson a dime, despite the collection agent’s assurances that his firm had been retained by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority to collect the measly amount.
I assumed — incorrectly it turns out — that there was no way a state agency would send any Oklahoma PikePass holder to collections without first snail mailing them a notice that they owed money. Or even reaching out by phone to try to first rectify the situation.
But I felt my first inkling of doubt when the agent inexplicably had my license plate number. Then I tried to access my PikePass account and found it deactivated. At that point, I thought I had been hacked because I’d held a PikePass for nearly a decade, my contact information was up-to-date, and I thought I had always been in good standing.
When I called the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority the next morning, I discovered that the state was the one who had deactivated it, and that they had indeed sent me to collections over $15.
I demanded to know what steps they had taken to contact me about this debt prior to sending it to collections.
The PikePass employee told me the agency had reached out via email three different times. She said the first notice was sent in April, warning me that my credit card was set to expire. The second email was a notice with a generic subject line reading “PIKEPASS Payment Request Notice” sent in late July, which stated that I owed $3.48. And the third came in September, generically titled “PIKEPASS Email Notice” with a random string of numbers. That email contained an account termination warning notice but nothing really specific, including the amount owed.
Like pretty much every Oklahoman, I’ve been subject to multiple phishing attempts along with multiple text messages claiming I owed for tolls. So I hadn’t opened a single one of those communications, assuming they were spam.
OTA apparently never took the time to mail me a paper invoice containing my past due balance because, I was told, at some point, I waived my right to that courtesy by selecting electronic billing.
Ultimately, I paid the $15.23 along with another $40 to get my account turned back on. I couldn’t see the bill, so I have no idea how much of that was late fees. The OTA employee told me none of it was, so I had to blindly trust her on that.
The irony is I’m pretty sure OTA spent more money paying for this collections agency to hound me for $15 than they actually collected from me.
But my bigger concern is that state agencies should be required to do the right thing by consumers before going nuclear and sending them to collections.
And if they won’t do it voluntarily, then lawmakers need to step in and mandate it.
Ahead of publication of this column, I emailed an OTA spokesperson some questions about how they handle collections. I asked how many accounts are in collections and what is the average amount owed. I asked why OTA doesn’t snail mail paper invoices to consumers before they’re sent to collections. I asked about how many overdue notices OTA typically sends to consumers attempting to collect unpaid balances. And, given the number of electronic toll collection scams preying on Oklahomans right now, how can someone know if the demands are legitimate.
OTA had not responded to my questions a week later.
As a state agency, lawmakers have given OTA a lot of power. 
In 2023, Oklahoma Voice reported that lawmakers had granted the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority the power to place holds on vehicle registrations in a bid to help collect unpaid tolls. At the time, tens of thousands of Oklahomans had their vehicle registrations frozen under the law. The number was expected to climb as the state transitioned to cashless tolling.
At the time, we interviewed a Norman resident who said she never received any notice or call that her family owed toll payments. Her first warning was when she couldn’t renew her vehicle registration.
As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility.
The Turnpike Authority should have a mechanism to collect past-due tolls. But they should also first have an obligation to make a good faith effort to collect that before they send Oklahomans to collections, potentially ruining their credit over a few dollars. A person’s credit rating impacts their ability to borrow money to purchase cars or homes. It influences the interest rates on those loans.
Good faith efforts include calling consumers and using the traditional mail to send an overdue notice. 
That will help people differentiate between reality and scams.
In this case, OTA clearly had my phone number because the PikePass agent used it to find my account when I called to ask what was going on.
They also had my mailing address because over a week after I paid the $15.23, I received a collection demand letter in the mail from Linebarger Goggan Blair and Sampson. They amazingly could take the time to send me a letter.
OTA should have sent that letter first. It would have saved both of us an expensive trip to collections.
Oklahoma consumers deserve to be treated with respect, and they deserve the benefit of the doubt. While I’m sure that some PikePass holders are legitimately dodging their tolls bills, I would assume the majority are not. (Maybe OTA will update us on that when they respond to me.)
We entrust OTA with a lot of our personal information with the understanding that they’re going to use it appropriately.
We’re not nameless, faceless people. (It’s like they forget we not only pay tolls but also allocate them a portion of a motor fuel tax to fund their operations). The fact that a state agency is being allowed to treat us like that is problematic.
Our government should always operate in good faith and that goes double when it comes time to collect any money we owe.

On the heels of a failed lawsuit to stop a prohibition on some cannabis products in Wyoming, hemp vendors confront a sudden federal ban on most products. 
The post Wyoming hemp vendors reel from Delta-8 court loss, new federal ban appeared first on WyoFile .","Smoke shops and other businesses that sell hemp products in Wyoming confronted a tough future this week after Republicans in the U.S. Senate inserted a ban on most THC-products derived from hemp into the bill that ended the federal shutdown.
Though hemp advocates have a year to advocate for its reversal, the measure represented a substantial blow to an industry already reeling from a recent court ruling. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Wyoming-specific ban on certain THC derivatives just two weeks ago.
With products containing the THC derivative Delta-8 off the table in Wyoming, hemp vendors were looking toward the sale of edibles and beverages containing hemp-derived THC to make up the sales. 

But beginning a year from now, the federal government will ban any hemp product that carries more than 0.4 milligrams of THC. Hemp is a derivative of the cannabinoid plant, as is marijuana. Hemp has a wide range of uses, from the making of rope and clothing to the production of CBD, a non-intoxicating and widely used supplement.

Under Wyoming law, hemp plants are legal as long as their THC concentration remains under 0.3%. At such a concentration, the plant itself would not get a user high if it were smoked.
But some shops still sell products with higher concentrations in the final product itself — drinks and edible gummies can carry 10 milligrams of hemp-derived Delta-9 THC or more. Those are concentrations equivalent to some marijuana products sold over the border in Colorado, where the drug is legal. The THC in Wyoming comes from hemp and not marijuana, and some shops are operating on an interpretation of the laws that says it’s the strength of THC in the hemp plant itself, not in the substance in which it is packaged, that matters.
The federal ban would end that practice. The language passed into law outlaws a concentration of more than 0.4 milligrams THC in the final container handed to the consumer, meaning all the liquid in a soda can or chocolate bar must have a total concentration below 0.4%. 
Changing laws, changing products
Since the federal government legalized hemp production in the 2018 Farm Bill, vendors in Wyoming and the dwindling number of other states where marijuana itself remains illegal have been playing what is essentially a game of whack-a-mole with regulators and lawmakers. 
The new ban comes just weeks after a federal appeals court in Denver upheld a law passed by the Wyoming Legislature that outlawed the THC derivative Delta-8. Since 2019, when Wyoming legalized the sale of hemp products, stores around the state had built up a thriving trade in Delta-8 products, which are intoxicating. In 2024, however, after reports emerged from Cody of a handful of students getting sick after consuming Delta-8, state lawmakers outlawed that substance as well as two other popular THC derivatives. 
That ban was a blow to vendors in the state, who say the products were mischaracterized as “synthetic” versions of cannabis when they remained natural derivatives of the plant. They were popular among consumers, shop owners say. 
“Before the ban, roughly 70% of our sales came from those cannabinoids,” Alicia Watt, a founder of Platte Hemp Company, which was one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the Delta-8 ban, wrote in a statement to WyoFile. “That hit every hemp retailer and grower in the state hard — from small storefronts to hardworking Wyoming hemp farmers who invested everything into a once-legal crop.”
Another plaintiff in the lawsuit, Justin Arnold, part of the husband-and-wife team behind Cin D’s CBD shop in Torrington, told WyoFile he was selling around $20,000 a month of Delta-8 products before lawmakers banned it. He estimated those sales would have doubled in another year. Arnold imposed an age limit of 21 years old for Delta-8 customers, though the law actually allowed sales to people 18 and up.

His products helped cancer patients and other people struggling with chronic pain, he said, without forcing them to drive to Colorado to buy weed legally and then illegally bring it into Wyoming. “If you’re buying hemp in Wyoming, you’re not buying weed in Colorado, you’re not going to the doctor and you’re not going to the bar,” he said.
To Arnold, this week’s sudden legislative action in Washington, which was pushed by Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, was another example of powerful influences like the legalized cannabis industry and pharmaceutical lobbyists trying to oppress a competitor that is largely made up of small business owners.
McConnell was an architect of the 2018 bill legalizing hemp production. But he has since grown concerned about the practical effects of the bill. “My 2018 hemp bill sought to create an agricultural hemp industry, not open the door to the sale of unregulated, intoxicating, lab-made, hemp-derived substances with no safety framework,” McConnell said this summer, according to the Cannabis Business Times. 
Officials with the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, a national industry group, predict that if the ban is not unwound within the year it will wipe out 98% of a hemp industry worth $28 billion. The group is instead trying to lobby lawmakers to pass legislation that does not ban higher THC quantities but instead regulates production practices to keep out harmful chemicals and outlaw marketing and sales practices that target minors.
Lawsuit fails
In the Wyoming court case, Watt, Arnold and their fellow plaintiffs sought to show that regulating Delta-8 was the province of the federal government, not the state, among other legal arguments. Federal judges disagreed with them, first in the U.S. District Court of Wyoming and then at the appeals court in Denver. 
Platte Hemp Company now sells Delta-9 gummies that are under 0.3% THC, as well as other legal herbal products and glass smoking devices — the traditional and long-running wares of “head shops” in Wyoming and other states. Wyoming lawmakers need to better educate themselves on hemp and cannabis, the difference between the two plants and their respective uses, before passing more legislation, Watt said. 
“Both offer legitimate medical value and industrial benefit, from fiber and textiles to seizure control and pain relief,” she wrote. “Instead of supporting natural medicine and Wyoming’s own hemp farmers, our state is protecting Big Pharma and alcohol.”
At least one plaintiff from the Delta-8 lawsuit has decided the regulatory uncertainty makes it too difficult to run a business. Owners of the Green Room, which describes itself as Casper’s first hemp dispensary, posted a notice to their website saying they’d be closing at the end of this year. “This has been a difficult decision for us, but the law changes have put us into a position where we can no longer stay in business,” the notice said. 
An owner of the business declined to comment to WyoFile.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Rodney Bennett has finalized a plan to cut up to $27.5 million from UNL’s budget. 
About $9 million in academic cuts go to the University of Nebraska Board of Regents for a final vote in December. This includes $4 million in anticipated savings from department mergers, which an advisory committee supported almost unanimously. Most other cuts are now set in stone, though many details still need to be ironed out.
“I have a strong conviction that even though what we are doing is very difficult, it is in the best interest of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s long-term future,” Bennett said in a Nov. 10 email announcing his final plan.

The UNL chancellor’s latest proposal would cut at least $20.76 million, depending on the regents, and assuming the mergers are accepted. The number could be larger with not-yet-detailed executive administrative “efficiencies” sought and nearly 70 tenured faculty offered a buyout package.
The current minimum total would be just shy of the $21 million Bennett has said is needed to close an ongoing “structural deficit” at UNL. Bennett’s plan also calls for $6.5 million in additional cuts meant to “help safeguard against repetitive budget reduction cycles.” The total is $27.5 million in the latest round of cuts.
The finalized plan shares many similarities with the proposal Bennett unveiled Sept. 12. Here is an in-depth breakdown of the final budget plan and the status of each line item.
Academic program eliminations ($6.74 million) and department realignments ($2 million)*
Nearly $9 million of UNL’s budget reduction consists of eliminating or merging academic departments, which the regents will consider at a Dec. 5 meeting.
Bennett’s updated cuts to the regents no longer include a call to eliminate academic programs in community and regional planning ($475,000) and landscape architecture ($225,000), both in the College of Architecture. Instead, the college will find the same savings through an internal plan that doesn’t require a vote of the regents.

The areas proposed for elimination, as well as nearly all degrees and the 51.5 faculty serving within them, are:

Earth and Atmospheric Sciences ($1.85 million, 13 positions eliminated).
Statistics ($1.75 million, 12 positions eliminated).
Educational Administration ($1.69 million, 15.5 positions eliminated).
Textiles, Merchandising and Fashion Design ($1.45 million, 11 positions eliminated).

In the case of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, some faculty will be “strategically” retained whose teaching, research and service “align with the needs and priorities of Nebraska.” Certain courses supporting federal requirements for meteorology careers and undergraduate minors will still be offered.
The master’s degree in educational administration will also be retained.
Departments the university plans to merge, with estimated savings of $1 million each, will develop plans in the spring and be subject to a later vote of the NU Board of Regents. Those are the departments of Entomology and Plant Pathology as well as Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication.
An advisory committee of faculty, staff and students narrowly supported just two of the eliminations: educational administration (11-10) and textiles, merchandising and fashion design (12-9). It opposed cutting earth and atmospheric sciences (9-11) and statistics (8-13). 
The committee unanimously supported the entomology and plant pathology merger, and just one member opposed merging the agricultural economics and leadership departments.
Advisory committee splits with UNL chancellor on key academic program cuts

In an unsigned Oct. 24 letter, the committee urged Bennett to allow more time to find alternatives. The academic cuts were announced and forwarded to the regents in less than two months.
The committee said it also did not have time to consider department revenues in weighing cuts.
“Multiple units noted in their hearings that they are revenue-positive, meaning that elimination of those units may end up costing the university more than it would save,” the letter states.
A UNL spokesperson said administrators reviewed “all aspects” of the proposed programs for elimination, including tuition and research, and they expect the cuts to yield long-term savings.
*This is the only budget item that requires separate regents approval.
Buyout program for tenured faculty ($5.5 million)
Tenured faculty who were at least 62 years old and had at least 10 years of service to NU by their time of separation were eligible to apply for a buyout program in September. About 130 faculty applied.
While the system intended to allow as many faculty to participate as possible, each campus reserved the right to limit awardees “to preserve the viability of programs and services, as well as to remain fiscally responsible.”
This month, campus leaders in Lincoln, Omaha and Kearney made offers to 116 faculty:

University of Nebraska-Lincoln: 69 faculty.
University of Nebraska at Omaha: 26 faculty.
University of Nebraska Medical Center: 11 faculty.
University of Nebraska at Kearney: 10 faculty.

Faculty must accept the separation agreement by Jan. 5. Awardees would receive a lump sum payment of 70% of one year of their annual base salary they are paid as of Oct. 1.
UNL Executive Vice Chancellor Mark Button had previously said UNL would achieve savings if more than 30 faculty participated in the program. An estimate of savings from a larger number of participants was not immediately available, in part because some positions would be replaced sooner than others and because salary levels differ.
Across-the-board 1% cut ($4.61 million)
An approximate 1% reduction in all state-aided budgets across UNL (budgets made up of tuition and taxpayer dollars). Unchanged from the original budget proposal.
UNL executive administrative reductions and staff ‘efficiencies’ ($2.95 million)
The UNL spokesperson said these cuts are “still in process” and are not planned to be announced until after the Dec. 5 regents meeting. The budget proposal says some administration and staff positions will be eliminated in Bennett’s office, the Executive Vice Chancellor’s Office and the Business and Finance Department.
Bennett’s salary is $732,000. He joined UNL in July 2023 with his contract currently set to expire June 30.
UNL Faculty Senate to weigh ‘no confidence’ vote against campus chancellor Nov. 18

The chancellor faces a possible “no confidence” vote from the UNL Faculty Senate in an emergency meeting set for 2:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Nebraska East Union. While Bennett has not responded directly to the “no confidence” effort, in his Nov. 10 email, he said he followed university processes to pursue budget reductions.
“The Executive Leadership Team and I worked hard to adhere to this comprehensive process — both in letter and in spirit — and to complete all steps within the provided timeline,” Bennett said.
Private philanthropy to cover mandated scholarships ($2.5 million)
UNL leaders continue to work with the University of Nebraska Foundation to secure private funding, but there was no further update at this time, the UNL spokesperson said. 
NU President Jeffrey Gold is continuing to work with the Nebraska Legislature to find solutions to unfunded tuition remissions — mandatory scholarships that lawmakers have said colleges must provide — as costs have ballooned in recent years. 
State-mandated tuition remission expenses for 2025 totaled $8.8 million across NU. Institutional tuition remission expenses, such as the Nebraska Promise, Regents Scholars or Presidential Scholars, totaled $48.4 million.
It’s unclear what slice of scholarships Bennett is trying to fill specifically at UNL. This is the lone part of the UNL budget proposal that seeks or suggests private philanthropy as a solution.
College budget reductions ($1.6 million)
There will be $550,000 less state-aided funding for graduate assistantships in research or teaching in the College of Arts and Sciences ($325,000) and the College of Engineering ($225,000).
The College of Architecture will still find $700,000 to cut, but from an alternative plan to preserve academic degrees in community and regional planning and landscape architecture. The budget proposal says this will mean “streamlining operations, administration, staffing and curriculum.” The advisory committee rejected the architectural cuts 19-2 and supported the alternative.

Also included is $350,000 in specific savings for the College of Fine and Performing Arts. The original idea had been to require the Glenn Korff School of Music and Johnny Carson School of Theatre and Film to share a director, a plan that is no longer being pursued as the college found “alternative budget savings.” Bennett’s plan did not detail those alternatives.
The advisory committee, while not asked to review the proposal, split 7-7-7 in favor, opposition and abstention regarding the idea. Bennett did not disclose the idea in his original proposal.
College administrative and staff ‘efficiencies’ ($750,000)
Administrative and college staff positions, as well as certain operating expenses, will be eliminated in the Colleges of Business, Engineering and Journalism and Mass Communications.
While some specifics are still being finalized, these cuts will create less flexibility in offering summer and elective courses, according to college deans. A separate broadcasting degree will also be formally merged with journalism. The degree paths already share significant similarities, and the three overseeing faculty are retiring, either already planned or via the buyout package.

The event centered around fusion voting, which is the practice of allowing more than one political party to nominate the same candidate on a ballot. Currently used in Connecticut and New York, the fusion voting system means the candidates on the left can appear on the ballot under both the Democratic Party and the smaller Working Families Party while candidates on the right appear for the Republican Party and the Conservative Party. 
In theory this can give the minor parties enough influence to push for policy changes. A minor party that can swing 4% of a vote total can move the needle. 
Throughout the 1800s, fusion voting was the norm across the country — the Republican Party itself was formed in Wisconsin as a fusion party by voters who felt that the major parties at the time, the Democrats and Whigs, weren’t doing enough to end slavery. Eventually, the two major parties worked together to get the practice banned in most of the country.
Often, minor fusion parties are further from the ideological center than the major parties, but a lawsuit is currently pending in Wisconsin from a group called United Wisconsin aiming to create a fusion party that connects moderate voters who don’t feel like they’re represented by the modern Democrats or Republicans. The effort is being helmed by former state Senate Majority Leader Dale Schultz and former Dane County Sheriff Dave Mahoney. The group is represented in the lawsuit by the voting rights focused firm Law Forward. 
Lawsuits to reinstate fusion voting are also pending in New Jersey and Kansas. 
Lilliana Mason, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University, said during the conference that the two party system and primary election process have polarized the country’s politics and made our’ “sense of winning or losing” more “existential.”
Looming over the discussions, but without being explicitly mentioned very often, was the Trump administration’s anti-democratic actions — including denying the outcome of the 2020 election, supporting the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and pardoning Wisconsin’s fake electors —  and the threat of authoritarianism. The debate Friday was often an exchange over how fusion voting fits into broader systemic reforms and if it can be used in tandem with proposals including proportional representation, multi-member congressional districts, ranked choice voting, gerrymandering prohibitions, filibuster reform and others. 
“It makes it possible for people who want to organize and who want to create and claim their own political power, to do so in an effective way,” Beau Tremitiere, an attorney from the non-profit Protect Democracy, said. They’re exactly right. “People are deeply dissatisfied with the system. There’s a lot of energy to do something better and fusion makes that easier.”
Fusion advocates said the system allows politics to be more dynamic. People’s political beliefs don’t always fit neatly in a party system that encourages big tents and the necessity of coalition management in those big tents means that parties aren’t encouraged to distance themselves from their most extreme members. 
“Politics is a complex, dynamic system that is always changing,” said Lee Drutman, who studies political reform at the think tank New America. “And the key is, how do you keep it from spiraling out of control? How do you keep it from a self-reinforcing tumult? And if you have a party system problem, which we do, you need a party system solution.”
But several speakers at the conference also laid out the limits and downsides of fusion voting. It’s not a major structural reform. Fusion parties are usually further from the ideological center, so if the goal is a more moderate politics, it’s not clear fusion will deliver that. Members of the Green Party expressed concern that fusion enables a patronage system of political favor trading. 
Overall though, the conference often returned to the idea that the country is in a democracy crisis and experimentation is a good thing in the effort to turn it around. 
“I’m supportive of experimentation,” Derek Muller, a law professor at Notre Dame, said. “It seems to me, we should see more real world experiments.”
Schultz, who was in the Legislature from 1983 to 2015, said he’s trying to establish a fusion party in Wisconsin to get more “humanity” in the state’s politics. 
“Why fusion voting? Why does it matter? Because of agency, the fact that suddenly people get a chance to sit at the table, to be a part of the discussions that matter to them,” he said. “Yes, fusion voting is not the be- and end-all political reform, but it is, in my opinion, an essential part of our future if we’re going to get back to having a healthy democracy.”

The issue involves the Idaho Transportation Department’s former administrative headquarters, which is located on a 44-acre campus situated at 3311 W. State St. in Boise. The headquarters building flooded Jan. 2, 2022, suffered water damage and was contaminated with asbestos, resulting in the displacement of all employees working in the building, state records show.
The damaged building has sat vacant since the flood and been subjected to a tug-of-war involving the Idaho Legislature. 
The summer after the flood, the Idaho Transportation Department declared the building surplus property, which paved the way for it to be sold. But in March 2024, the Idaho Legislature abruptly blocked the planned $51.7 million sale of the 44-acre campus to a group of buyers that included Hawkins Companies, FJ Management and Pacific West Communities, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
 After Legislature blocked sale, officials working toward renovating former agency headquarters

Instead of selling the property, which is located just west of Downtown Boise near parks and the Boise River Greenbelt, some Idaho state legislators argued it would be a better deal for taxpayers if the state blocked the sale, held on to the property and renovated it so state employees could use the building again. 
After years of uncertainty, the state is moving in that direction now. 
Based on a property condition assessment report completed late last year, the Idaho Transportation Board approved a resolution during its September board meeting directing staff to work with the Idaho Division of Public Works to award a contract for the abatement of hazardous materials in the damaged building, Communications Manager John Tomlinson said.

Based on the December 2024 property condition assessment report, the estimate for the work to remove the hazardous materials is $8.2 million, state records show. 
During a December 2024 tour of the flood-damaged building, an Idaho Capital Sun reporter observed mold, visible water damage and stains to numerous walls, ceilings, carpets and floors. Exposed electrical wiring and tangled messes of metal and broken wood were present throughout different areas of the building. The elevator, which was not operational, had its doors propped open and electricity and heat were only working in some areas.

Idaho Transportation Department officials also told the Sun and other reporters the building had been contaminated with asbestos. 
 State staffers also directed to begin designing remodel, with plans for employees to return to work once projects are finished

In addition to directing staff to award a contract for the abatement of hazardous materials at the State Street campus, the Idaho Transportation Board also directed staff in September to begin designing a remodel of the building. 
The board said the remodel plans should address:

Fire suppression sprinklers and alarm systems.
Replacing the existing elevators.
Rehabilitating or replacing the building envelope to include windows and doors.
Replacing all of the electrical, HVAC, plumbing and other major systems.
Any needed structural modifications or reinforcements that may be needed.
Landscaping, drainage, rehabilitating the parking lot and increasing exterior lighting for employee safety.

“Once design is done, the plan is to go right into getting a contract and beginning the remodel,” Tomlinson said in an email to the Sun.
Officials are estimating the remodel could take two years to complete, Tomlinson said. 
“Once completed all HQ staff working out of Building 8 at the state of Idaho Chinden Campus would be moved back down to State Street,” Tomlinson said. 
Cost estimates provided in the December 2024 property condition assessment report appear to exceed the amount of funding the Idaho Legislature has provided so far to rehabilitate the building , the Sun previously reported. 
Cost estimates range from $64 million to $69.4 million. But the Idaho Legislature has so far provided a total of $42.1 million – $32.5 million in the 2024 legislative session and $9.6 million during the 2025 legislative session. 
Idaho Transportation Department officials have previously told the Sun that a building design would provide the necessary details to execute the rehabilitation work and provide a more accurate cost estimate.
That estimate would inform the department’s budget request in future fiscal years, Idaho Transportation Department officials said.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)Nearly 40 Tennessee hardwood companies are among hundreds of U.S. hardwood industry operators calling for federal relief from tariff-induced economic hardship.
Tennessee’s forestry products industry supports an estimated 85,000 jobs, according to the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, which includes the state’s Division of Forestry. Forest products are the fourth-largest agricultural commodity in the state. Export sales dipped by $45 million in 2023, resulting in an estimated loss of 362 jobs, according to a University of Tennessee report.
The industry as a whole lost an estimated $9 billion in commercial opportunities since the 2018 trade war began when President Donald Trump first escalated tariffs against China, one of the United States’ biggest export markets since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. But the lumber industry was not included in federal tariff relief payments made to agricultural producers in 2018, according to an Oct. 14 letter to Trump administration officials signed by 452 lumber industry mills, manufacturers and distributors across the U.S.
Tariffs on some Chinese goods continued through former President Joe Biden’s administration. Trade tensions flared again with Trump’s return to office and renewed tariff escalation threats this year as China imposed export controls on rare-earth minerals — key components for electric batteries, computer chips, smart phones and more. 
China halted imports of U.S. logs in April amid retaliatory measures against heightening U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump reached a deal with China in late October, in which China agreed to resume purchases of U.S. logs, according to the White House.
Tariff negotiations and fluctuating trade relationships compounded an already difficult market for U.S. hardwood mills, according to Claire Getty, CFO at Thompson Appalachian Hardwoods in Huntland, Tennessee. The company works with landowners and loggers in a 150-mile radius of its rural headquarters, paying them for the cut logs that the company then processes in its sawmills. Historically, the company focused on creating products for homes: furniture, molding, millwork, trim, floors, cabinets and doors, for example. But the rise in popularity of cheaper man-made materials (for example, vinyl floors that resemble wood) has crippled the hardwood market, she said.
TN Soybean farmers face ‘desperate situation’ amid inflation, weather extremes and tariffs

“The North American hardwood industry has really suffered, and tariffs exacerbated that, because it causes prices (for hardwood) to be even higher, which then causes the manufacturers of these consumer products to have even more reason to find alternative materials,” Getty said.
The letter to Trump’s administration encouraged officials to give the U.S. hardwood sector “equitable access to relief programs” to “safeguard rural jobs, secure a sustainable domestic supply chain, and preserve a proud American industry for generations to come.”
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture did not confirm whether the administration plans to issue payments to agriculture producers who were negatively impacted by tariffs, though Politico reported on Oct. 30 that up to $12 billion may be put toward farm aid payments. The USDA also did not respond to The Tennessee Lookout’s inquiry on whether the department is considering making forestry industry producers eligible for future tariff aid.
“Currently, the farm economy is in a difficult situation, and President Trump is utilizing all the tools available to ensure farmers have what they need to continue their farming operations,” the spokesperson stated in an email, adding that the USDA will continue to “assess the farm economy and explore the need for further assistance.”
Getty and other companies that signed the letter are seeking relief payments and an agricultural designation for lumber mills. Getty said she sees that kind of acknowledgement as a step toward potential federal help for the industry overall. She points to programs that offered tax credits for energy efficiency improvements in homes, and a previously proposed bill that would have offered similar credit for installing solid hardwood products.
“For us, that’s really where a starting point is, being acknowledged as a critical ag producer to manage these resources,” Getty said. “And because we are considered (a critical ag producer), what can be done to support and help strengthen U.S. forest product markets — hardwood markets, specifically — to help us change this demand curve that we are fighting against.”
Mills diversify businesses to survive, ask for federal support
Getty said Thompson Appalachian Hardwoods has weathered the ebbs and flows of tariffs and industry shifts since 2018 by diversifying its export partners and turning toward industrial markets for hardwood instead of products made for homes.
Export sales made up 61% of Thompson Appalachian Hardwoods’ lumber sales in 2018, when exports took a hit from the first trade war. It took until 2022 for exports to rise again to about 63% of the company’s sales, with 45% of those sales coming from China. But in 2025, export sales dropped to 45%, and exports to China fell to 15%, Getty said.










Our forest products companies and sawmills … have been running at either break-even margins or a less than 2-3% profit margin for the last 36 months, or in the negative.


– Claire Getty, Thompson Appalachian Hardwoods 


The volatility and uncertainty caused by trade negotiations proved to be the most challenging, she said.
In October, Getty said the company had nine orders canceled after rhetoric of rising tariffs, followed by an about-face toward smoother negotiations. But those nine loads were still canceled or delayed by three weeks, and the average price of each load is $20,000.
“That was $180,000 that got shifted out of our sales and our revenue to a future date,” Getty said. “That’s what’s been happening all year.”
The trade deal reached with China in late October states that the country will resume its purchase of U.S. logs, something Getty’s company does not directly export to China. But there are several outfits in Tennessee that do sell logs to China, and this will positively impact the price those companies can get for their logs, she said.
The trade deal also brought back an element of overall stability for hardwood exports — Getty’s sales team saw an increase in calls and orders from China directly following the deal’s announcement.
“What we have found this week is it seems like everybody is moving forward in good faith that there will be fair and reasonable trade moving forward,” she said.
But Thompson Appalachian Hardwoods has also taken steps to hamper the negative impacts of any future trade disputes. The company has invested in strengthening trade relationships with Vietnam and is looking for other markets in Mexico and the Middle East region.
In 2022, the business invested in an industrial sawmill that produces railroad crossties used to maintain U.S. rail infrastructure. The mill started running in 2025, providing a more stable source of income — railroad companies typically buy around 19 million crossties every year, Getty said.
“It’s just diversifying our overall blend, because at one point … our exports were a very high percentage of our business, and then that Chinese sector was a very high percentage of that, and we can’t find ourselves in that position again,” she said.
Over the last three years, Getty watched as sawmill after sawmill shuttered, and she worries that in the long term, those losses will stamp out market-driven options for forest management. Companies like hers pay landowners and harvesters for the trees they cut down, and ensure every part of the tree is used, from the logs to the wood chips and sawdust. 
If mills go out of business, landowners and governments may have to shoulder the cost of tree removal instead, Getty said. 
Federal aid could help offset some of the profits lost during trade wars and help some businesses stay afloat, she said. The companies that have survived may not have been able to invest in maintenance for their mills, expansion or employee benefits while they were in “fight-or-flight mode.”
“Our forest products companies and sawmills … have been running at either break-even margins or a less than 2-3% profit margin for the last 36 months, or in the negative,” Getty said. “That insertion of capital kind of helps everybody catch their breath.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Activist groups and community members gathered Saturday morning to denounce the construction of a new federal immigration enforcement detention facility on Milwaukee’s Northwest Side. Renovations at the property, located at 11900 W Lake Park Drive, were clearly underway, with construction equipment sitting behind new fencing, piles of dirt and stacks of building materials visible through the building’s dark windows. Outside, protesters marched in the street and delivered speeches. 
The 36,000-square-foot detention and processing center is planned to serve as a central hub for southeastern Wisconsin, holding people before deportation or transfer to other detention centers.
“You may be here, but you are not welcome here,” said Ald. Larresa Taylor — who represents the district where the facility will be located. Although the city cannot prevent ICE from taking over the facility, Taylor said that this “doesn’t mean that we are going to accept it laying down.”

Activists from Voces de la Frontera, Comité Sin Fronteras, the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Never Again Action–Wisconsin, the Party for Socialism & Liberation, and the Wisconsin Coalition for Justice in Palestine picketed outside the building for close to two hours. Towards the end of the event, a drone was seen flying overhead, which was not operated by any of the activist groups who held the rally. In a empty parking lot nearby, several deputies appeared to be packing away equipment in the trunk a Milwaukee County Sheriff’s vehicle. The Sheriff’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment on whether its drone team was flying over the Saturday protest. 
Opponents of the facility say that its opening moved forward without community input or consent, and that it will perpetuate troubling uses of force and arrests in cities nationwide including Chicago. The facility will be used to  process ICE detainees, as well as immigrants who must come in for regular check-ins.
Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, applauded Taylor, calling her “the first person to sound the alarm months ago about the expansion of this detention center, and to call attention and condemn what was happening in our city.”  The building is privately owned by Milwaukee Governmental LLC, which originally requested modifications to the property (something Taylor learned about in December). The LLC is linked to the Illinois-based WD Schorsch LLC, which owns properties leased to federal government agencies.

“It’s not an accident what is happening, where this facility is being chosen to be built,” said Neumann-Ortiz. “It’s part of a long-term pattern of discrimination and marginalization, and criminalization of working class people of color.” Neumann-Oritz said that instead of spending “millions” on the facility, “that money should be used to pay for FoodShare, BadgerCare, and our public schools.” 
 Angela Lang, executive director of Black Leaders Organizing Communities (BLOC), said, “We are not free, until we are all free.” Lang added that Black communities “know what it’s like to be ripped away from our families and locked away,” and that people are concerned about federal agents’ behavior in cities like Chicago. “And we have been worried for months, if not years, ‘is this going to happen to Milwaukee?’” 
Over recent months months, videos have suggested an escalating patter of force from federal agents including shooting people in the head with pepper balls, placing protesters in chokeholds, deploying tear gas in crowded neighborhoods in broad daylight, arresting and attacking journalists, arresting parents in front of their children, and having unprofessional verbal exchanges with citizens.

Although Milwaukee hasn’t seen protest-related clashes, ICE stirred anxiety and condemnation earlier this year after arresting members of families with mixed-immigration status at the Milwaukee County Courthouse as they attended court hearings. Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was also arrested and criminally charged after the federal government accused her of attempting to hide a person sought by ICE who’d attended a hearing in her courtroom. Dugan is expected to go to trial in federal court in December. Other high profile arrests and deportations of community members have also occurred in Milwaukee during the first six months of the second  Trump administration. 
Conor Mika, a student activist at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) condemned what he said is a lack of transparency and accountability for his  school’s relationship with ICE, which has been using a university building for operations in Milwaukee. “It’s time MSOE takes a stand. It’s on MSOE to slow down ICE’s operations, and protect its students by removing ICE from this building, and refusing any future collaborations with these agencies conducting mass deportations in our city.”
Leah Janke and Tanya Brown both attended the rally Saturday, and told the Wisconsin Examiner that it was important to make their voices heard. “I think it’s important that people here know that we don’t want this,” said Brown. “It’s not just a small community that doesn’t want it, it’s everybody. We don’t want it.” Janke said. “It’s 2025, and this is completely unacceptable to be running an ICE facility like this, and be deporting people illegally, without due process. This is insanity.

Besides attending rallies, Janke has been making “whistle kits” filled with whistles and information about reporting ICE, or alerting the community if an arrest is happening. “Be safe out there,” said Janke. “Because honestly, it’s scary and people are getting  hurt.”
Raúl Ríos, an activist with both Comité Sin Fronteras and Party for Socialism and Liberation, said it was important to rally people on Saturday both on the North and South Sides of Milwaukee, especially since the city is one of the most segregated in America. “Most people that I’ve heard, not only today but previously, had said that they had no idea that this was even being constructed, and that it’s going to be used as the main facility for southeast Wisconsin,” Rios told the Examiner.

(File photo by Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho faces tough budget choices in the coming months. Cutting mental health peer support should not be part of the answer.
As directed by the state, Magellan, the contractor managing Medicaid behavioral-health services, plans to cut several behavioral health services, including peer support as of Dec. 1. This announcement has had the mental health services world reeling for the outsized impact it will have on some of Idaho’s most vulnerable.
Idaho budget writers prepare to enter new era of trimming state budgets

The decision saves a few dollars in the short term, but at a devastating cost. Not only do hundreds of active peer support specialists face losing their jobs just before the holidays, but the thousands of people they serve, who are seeking recovery and need support navigating daily life, managing symptoms, and building recovery skills, will be left without support when they need it most.
Idaho has made meaningful strides in the behavioral health space recently, including expanding the 988 crisis line to include 24/7 mobile behavioral health response teams statewide – a major step toward accessible, community-based crisis care. Cuts to peer support services represent a larger step backwards.
It’s one that Idaho cannot afford. Mental Health America ranks Idaho 48th out of 50 states. Too many Idahoans still struggle to find timely, affordable care. Cutting peer-support only widens that gap. Any progress we’ve made is at risk if we curtail evidence-based and cost-efficient systems that bolster our behavioral health workforce.
Peer Support Specialists provide the human connection in a system that can otherwise feel impersonal and intimidating. They have walked their own path of recovery and now reinforce that work by helping their clients stay engaged in treatment and connected to their communities.
Research consistently shows peer support reduces hospitalizations, improves recovery outcomes, and lowers costs. A full-time peer support specialist typically carries a caseload of 12-15 individuals who rely upon them. This means, as of December, Idaho faces the quadruple whammy of thousands of Idahoans suddenly losing essential support, peers losing gainful employment that supports their own recovery, another blow to our already beleaguered mental health workforce, and impacts to the work of clinicians.
Especially in rural areas, peers fill the gap where licensed clinicians are scarce. Our 988 mobile crisis teams depend on this workforce; peer specialists turn moments of fear into connection and hope. Dropping this key component jeopardizes that model. Once programs close or staff are reduced, rebuilding will take years.
Budget pressures are real, but cuts that save a small amount now will cost us later in emergency care, hospitalization, incarceration, family disruption, and worse for those who live with serious mental illness. Instead, Idaho should focus on maintaining and even strengthening the peer workforce as a cost-effective method for supporting recovery.
Gov. Brad Little and the Legislature have proven strong stewards of Idaho’s finances. The state’s rainy-day fund, now holding record reserves, is precisely the tool for stabilizing essential services while policymakers plan for sustainability. Protecting mental-health access isn’t excess spending; it’s safeguarding lives and the workforce that supports them.
Idaho is modernizing our crisis response, investing in 988, and talking openly about mental health in ways unthinkable a decade ago. Undercutting that progress will have lasting impact.
Peer support is a bridge between clinical care and real life. It keeps people connected to treatment, hope, and community. If we truly value recovery, dignity, and access to care for all Idahoans, we must protect that bridge. Use the rainy-day fund. Exempt behavioral health services from cuts. Don’t balance the budget on the backs of Idaho’s most vulnerable.

(Photo by Don Petersen/Associated Press)A Colorado law that prevents medical debt from appearing on consumer credit reports is facing a new legal challenge following guidance from the Trump administration that says federal credit policy overrides such state laws. 
In 2023 Colorado enacted a law that requires credit reporting agencies to remove medical debt from consumer reports, limiting who can see it.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at the end of October reversed a Biden-era interpretation of the 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act that allowed states to ban medical debt from appearing on credit reports. The new rule says the FCRA overrides state laws around reporting debt to credit bureaus, “consistent with Congress’s intent to create national standards for the credit reporting system.”

At the time Colorado’s law passed, about 11% of Coloradans had medical debt in collections. Colorado was the first state to approve a policy limiting how medical debt affects credit, and more than a dozen states now have similar laws.
ACA International, an association of credit and collection professionals, filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado on Nov. 5 challenging the state’s law after the Trump administration announced the new rule. The association says the law has compromised accurate credit reporting and harms medical providers and patients in the state.
New Trump administration rule could override state medical debt protections

“Creditors and lenders who lack a complete picture of a consumer’s credit history may extend a loan the consumer cannot afford, which only hurts their financial situation and increases the cost of credit for everyone,” Jennifer Whipple, ACA’s board president, said in a statement.
Bethany Pray, chief legal and policy officer at the Colorado Center on Law and Policy, said the Trump administration rule is a change in guidance and doesn’t immediately lead to changes, but it opens the door to legal action such as the ACA lawsuit. The guidance itself acknowledges that the courts are the “ultimate arbiters of statutory meaning,” Pray said.
Previous court rulings in Maine and New Jersey found that states are not preempted from implementing bans on medical debt appearing on credit reports, so Pray said those cases offer viable arguments that could support Colorado’s law in court.
Isabel Cruz, policy director at the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, said Coloradans should know that the law’s protections are not immediately threatened, and those affected would be alerted before any changes.
“We were really excited that Colorado was at the forefront of this important policy, and we’ve heard from consumers, from legal advocates and from other folks on the ground that having the ability to pursue housing, to pursue different careers, has really opened up without having a medical debt on credit reports for the last few years,” Cruz said.
The bill has a July 2028 sunset included because of how new the policy was, Cruz said, but she hasn’t heard any desire at the Colorado Legislature to end the law sooner than that because the protections have been “quite popular.”










We know that a big reason people don’t access care is for fear of what it will cost.


– Don't forget to add author


Colorado has seen what medical debt appearing on credit reports does to consumers since the law only recently passed. Cruz says it stops people from being able to build wealth and feel financially stable enough to pay back their debts. Medical debt appearing on consumer credit reports again, she said, “will take us backwards and unravel the progress that has been made for Coloradans.”
“We know that a big reason people don’t access care is for fear of what it will cost,” Cruz said.
Medical debt is not planned or voluntarily incurred, Pray said, so the debt affecting someone’s ability to rent a home, get a loan, or sometimes get a job harms “all aspects of Coloradans lives.” Medicaid work requirements and the end of Affordable Care Act tax credits means more people will potentially incur medical debt, too, she said.
“This is a really tough time for this issue to come up when we know that there are tens of thousands of people who are likely to lose health care coverage in the next months,” Pray said.
Cruz and Pray both said their organizations will closely watch the lawsuit as it goes through the court system.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)The secretary of state is asking for a formal legal opinion from the attorney general on the North Dakota Ethics Commission’s authority, including whether it had the right to issue a recent advisory opinion. 
The request joins previous questions about the commission’s authority raised by other executive branch leaders. The Legislature empowered the commission to issue advisory opinions if a public official wants to know whether an action is permitted under state law. But the governor and other elected officials say the agency has overstepped, with the conflict contributing to a stalled process to fill vacancies on the commission.
Secretary of State Michael Howe (Provided)
Secretary of State Michael Howe asked in a July 22 letter for Attorney General Drew Wrigley to weigh in on the overlapping responsibilities of his office and the Ethics Commission in response to an advisory opinion about campaign finance.
The inquiry is in response to a June 25 Ethics Commission advisory opinion about campaign finance. Howe asks the attorney general if the commission’s advisory opinion is accurate, what would happen if his office disagrees with future opinions, and whether his office is obligated to follow ethics rules adopted by the commission that differ from state law. 
“The advisory opinion appears to provide a legal interpretation of the statute rather than addressing an ethical question or scenario related to the statute,” Howe writes. 
Howe also points out that the secretary of state oversees campaign finance and election laws, but his office was not consulted about the opinion. 
ND Ethics Commission has no authority to punish officials violating ethics laws, state leaders argue

Gov. Kelly Armstrong has raised concerns about the advisory opinion during recent meetings to appoint new members to the Ethics Commission and during a public hearing in July. He has said that paying for day care or security with campaign funds should be a policy question, not an ethical one.
The advisory opinion is one reason Armstrong has objected to reappointing Murray Sagsveen to the Ethics Commission. Armstrong advocates for a “reset” on the commission, while the Senate majority and minority leaders want to reappoint Sagsveen to promote continuity. The three-member selection committee has deadlocked during three previous meetings and is meeting again Wednesday. 
Meanwhile, the Ethics Commission is also set to meet Wednesday and plans to discuss for the first time Howe’s request for an attorney general opinion.
Advisory opinions
In the advisory opinion requested by Sen. Josh Boschee, the Ethics Commission said caregiving and security expenses can be paid for with campaign funds in some instances.
Boschee, a Democrat from Fargo, said he initially tried to get Howe’s opinion about whether a candidate’s child care can be paid for with campaign funds. Howe said he doesn’t recall anyone asking his office.
The lawmaker provided a March 2024 email showing he posed the question to Howe. Boschee said the secretary of state told him during a meeting he couldn’t provide an answer, which led him to request advice from the Ethics Commission. Boschee also asked the commission to weigh in on whether candidate security could be a campaign finance expense, but he did not ask Howe about security.
“By giving these kinds of advisory opinions, I think it helps give clarity to the public, as well as those that are regulated by the Ethics Commission’s authority, on what we can and can’t do,” Boschee said in an interview.

North Dakota voters in 2018 approved a constitutional amendment that created the Ethics Commission to be an ethics watchdog in state government. The amendment, now Article XIV of North Dakota’s constitution, authorizes the Ethics Commission to adopt ethics rules related to transparency, corruption, elections and lobbying for lobbyists and public officials. The commission can also investigate alleged violations of those rules, other sections of the constitutional amendment and related state laws.  
In 2021, lawmakers voted nearly unanimously to give the commission authority to issue advisory opinions at the request of someone they have jurisdiction over. The opinions provide guidance on how state law, ethics rules created by the commission, and Article XIV of the constitution apply “to specified hypothetical facts or prospective conduct.” 
Ethics Commission staff research and write the opinions before they’re submitted to the five ethics commissioners for feedback and approval. People who follow the guidance can claim “safe harbor” or immunity if they are later accused of violating a criminal or civil statute as a result of their action. 
Rep. Larry Klemin, a Republican from Bismarck, was one of the original supporters of giving the Ethics Commission the authority to issue advisory opinions. The practice was modeled after a similar system commonly used by state bar associations to provide ethical advice to attorneys. 
“I think it’s working pretty well,” he said. “It’s a good guide for the people that have questions about the Ethics Commission’s interpretation of the statute and the Constitution, about whether some particular conduct is ethical or not.”
The Ethics Commission encourages requests for advisory opinions as a way to answer questions before potentially unethical conduct occurs, instead of investigating complaints of unethical conduct after the fact, said executive director Rebecca Binstock. 
State Treasurer Thomas Beadle requested an advisory opinion earlier this year. He is president of the National Association of State Treasurers and was considering participation in the organization’s trip to Israel. He asked the Ethics Commission if the trip, paid for by the Israeli foreign ministry and a nonprofit, would violate any ethics laws. The commission concluded it would not. 
“If we can stop things that might be improper from happening before they happen, seems like a good policy,” Beadle said.
Unlike the commission’s constitutional authority, the power to issue advisory opinions stems from state law written and passed by legislators. The Legislature has the power to make changes, such as requiring the commission to follow certain processes in researching an advisory opinion or eliminating the power altogether. 
Ethical versus legal opinions
The Ethics Commission’s decision to issue an advisory opinion on campaign finance, an area of law it shares jurisdiction over with the Secretary of State’s office, has led to allegations by Armstrong of encroachment on the authority of the executive branch. Howe, in his letter requesting an attorney general’s opinion, called it “potentially overstepping its ethical mandate.”
“The Ethics Commission, they’re tasked with determining if something’s ethical or not, not legal,” Howe said in an interview.
But the section of state law authorizing the Ethics Commission’s advisory powers does not make a clear distinction between the two. 
A spokesperson for the attorney general said the office is working on the opinion but declined to provide a timeline. Attorney General Wrigley did not return a call seeking comment.
North Dakota Ethics Commissioners to evaluate ‘strained’ relationship with Attorney General’s Office

Previously, Wrigley has been highly critical of Ethics Commission staff, while commissioners have defended the staff. Wrigley said during an interview on the Plain Talk podcast his office is working on “a pretty extensive AG opinion” in response to Howe’s request.
“As the governor likes to point out, there’s a big difference between something that is a legal question and something that is an ethical question,” Wrigley said during the August interview. 
Ethics Commissioners have said they are committed to working with members of the executive branch who have concerns about the agency’s activities. 
Sagsveen, the ethics commissioner presiding over the public hearing where Armstrong first expressed his concerns about the advisory opinion, has signaled he’s open to creating a process to gather feedback about an advisory opinion before it is finalized. He also invited Armstrong to meet with the full commission at a later date to discuss his concerns. 
The Ethics Commission opted to hold off on scheduling a meeting with the governor until its three vacancies have been filled to ensure the newly appointed members can participate. Two of three vacancies remain. 
Armstrong’s concerns about the advisory opinion have been a factor in his refusal to reappoint Sagsveen to a full term on the commission. The governor also objects to Sagsveen’s answer to a questionnaire in which he said the Legislature has violated the constitution by passing laws to limit the commission’s authority.
Governor wants ‘reset’ from North Dakota Ethics Commission as committee deadlocks on candidates

Ethics Commission Chair Cynthia Lindquist sent the committee a letter on Oct. 30 acknowledging “a need for better dialogue, exchange, and understanding about the work of the Commission.”
“The Commission must be allowed to carry out our responsibilities as outlined in the North Dakota Constitution, and this essential work requires the assistance and collaboration of those the Commission regulates,” she said. “With these goals in mind, the Commission welcomes productive policy discussions regarding its work, including the critiques it received regarding one advisory opinion.”
Lindquist declined to comment for this article because the five-member commission has not had an opportunity to discuss the subject in a meeting. Sagsveen, a Bismarck attorney, has declined to comment on ongoing selection committee discussions.
Boschee, for his part, said he’s glad the Ethics Commission has the power to issue advisory opinions like the one he requested. 
“There are questions that the public has, there’s questions that candidates and policymakers have, and we need someone to be able to provide us that guidance,” Boschee said. “And so far, that’s been the Ethics Commission. I think they’ve done a good job.”

NextEra Energy is proposing North Dakota’s first battery storage systems to be constructed near wind farms in Emmons and Burke counties. (Photo courtesy of NextEra Energy)For the first time, North Dakota utility regulators are considering proposals for massive battery storage sites that would serve as backstops for renewable energy sources. 
Battery Energy Storage Systems hold energy when it’s produced in excess, such as when wind farms see especially windy days, or when solar panels absorb more sun energy than what’s in demand. Energy harvested by the batteries is later used when those resources are in deficit. 
Such technology has been materializing across the country in recent years, receiving generous production tax credits from the federal government. 
In theory, the sites could help reduce congestion on the power grid and potentially alleviate cost fluctuations that can otherwise cause price spikes for customers. But it’s too early to tell whether that’s the case for projects being proposed in North Dakota, according to Director of Utilities for the Public Service Commission Victor Schock. 
The first-ever project under consideration is being proposed by NextEra, a company with several wind farms across the state including a location in Emmons County. That wind farm is where the company is looking to put its $181 million battery storage site, according to its application to the Public Service Commission.

Chair Randy Christmann said he’s apprehensive of normalizing battery storage systems in the state: “I just don’t know how the benefit compares to what it’s costing.”
He said he’s concerned about the grid becoming “reliant” on energy stored in the lithium-ion batteries, especially since the materials typically come from “adversarial” countries.
China produces the majority of the world’s lithium-ion batteries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
NextEra told the North Dakota Monitor in an emailed statement that the specific battery system has not been finalized for the Emmons County project, but the company has “secured arrangements to source a U.S.-made battery for a significant portion” of its portfolio. 
The massive battery units would have the capacity to store 140 megawatts, the amount of electricity used by approximately 13 average homes in one year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Overall, the project would use 24 acres already housing an adjacent wind farm, with construction beginning May 2026 and, if the project is approved, operations starting as early as December that year. It would bring around 150 construction jobs and one to three permanent jobs, the company estimates. 
Over the 25-year span of the operation, the county is estimated to reel in $7.2 million in property taxes in addition to the nearly $4 million county application fee. 
Emmons County Commissioners and NextEra representatives discussed the permitting costs and taxation at length during a public hearing in August before they approved the project later that month. 
During the nearly four-hour meeting, members of the public raised concerns primarily centered on transparency from the company and the safety of the facility.
Some residents said the company had previously been disingenuous in gathering easements for its wind farm; others mentioned how, if the battery storage system were to malfunction and catch on fire, the response would likely be delayed due to the remoteness of the site’s location.
In response, NextEra representatives told the residents they are working with local first responders and volunteers.
In an emailed statement, the company did not share specific data related to safety of battery storage systems but said its systems are extensively monitored and have physical safeguards to minimize any damages should any issues arise. 
Commissioner Christmann said he is eager to learn more about the project during its hearing, which is open to the public and scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday at the Emmons County Courthouse Auditorium in Linton. 
On the other end of the state, in Burke County, NextEra is proposing a second battery storage site with 100 megawatts in capacity. The nearly $129 million site would occupy 21 acres and also attach to existing wind energy infrastructure, according to application documents. 
Construction is expected to last six months and yield around 100 jobs, with two permanent positions for operations. 
The second project’s formal, public hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. Dec. 19 at the Bowbells Memorial City Hall.

“It’s a little daunting when you come in every morning and there’s 60 voicemails and every one of them needs something,” said Margaret O’Neal, president and CPO of the United Way of Central West Virginia, which operates West Virginia’s 211 helpline. “In this particular case, those needs were almost always food.”
More than 2,600 calls came into 211 call centers — almost all for food — since the federal government shutdown began on Nov. 1 and benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program weren’t delivered to about 275,000 West Virginia residents who rely on the program.
It’s a 1,680% increase from the number of calls 211 received last year in the same time frame, according to call center data.
There were 2,000 text messages to 211, as well.
During the drawn-out saga over SNAP, Gov. Patrick Morrisey continuously directed people in need to call 211 to get connected with a local food pantry. The state’s charitable food network experienced skyrocketing demand; some food pantries in the southern part of West Virginia saw a 1,800% increase in the number of families in need.
O’Neal said 211 call specialists around the state “were the boots on the ground” talking to people every single day. Sometimes phone lines were overloaded, she said, but call specialists kept trying to call people back. The organization said that all call were answered. 
“We found ourselves delivering food a number of times over the last two weeks,” O’Neal said.
“Seniors would call and talk to the call specialist, and they would express deep concern of no food and no transportation and no way to kind of see the end of the crisis.”
Brian Aluise, community impact associate with the United Way of Central West Virginia, said someone called 211 trying to get food to 70 seniors in apartment buildings in Charleston couldn’t get to food handouts. 
“A lot of them are homebound … Went over there and distributed, like 150 meals to folks there in the community,” Aluise said. “211 is not only great for referring folks to resources, but also identifying big unmet needs for large populations and then trying to address those issues as they arise.”
There were follow-up calls with individuals to make sure they received food, O’Neal said. 
She explained that it was all hands on deck the last few weeks to meet the need while operating on “a shoestring” budget. 
“We’re a little tired and a little emotional, and all the things that go with disaster,” she said.
Morrisey handed out around $13 million in state funding to the state’s food banks.
The United Way receives $200,000 through the state’s portion of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families federal funding.
West Virginians received full SNAP benefits Thursday, Morrisey said, after Congress approved legislation reopening the federal government, ending the longest federal government shutdown in United States history.

Just when policymakers in Tennessee need to be doing more to make our communities safer, legislators are passing laws that make it easier for those with murderous intent to obtain and carry firearms, all while totally ignoring the underlying reasons why America suffers from a gun violence epidemic in the first place.
The emergency: Gun violence results from a society that fails to provide its residents with social safety and economic opportunity
The U.S. has the highest murder rate of developed nations, killings that are overwhelmingly driven by gun violence. Even other developed countries with large populations of gun owners, like Canada, Finland, Iceland and New Zealand, have nowhere near America’s gun violence rate. Furthermore, the U.S. is seeing more mass shootings each year, a problem that is truly singular to this nation as compared to other developed countries.

Why is the U.S. unique in this regard? The core difference is that the citizens of other first-world democracies have made their governments provide universal healthcare, affordable housing and education, good-paying jobs and strong social safety nets. Conversely, U.S. politicians and their corporate backers increasingly put profits over people.
This nation’s failure to provide basic safety and opportunity to the American people engenders trauma within the population that is not just experienced acutely; it becomes intergenerational. 
Our system is such that tens of millions of Americans are born into terrible economic situations that lack safety and security. Those experiences shape Americans’ development from birth, including how their parents (who are themselves suffering) raise them, whether they go on to use mind-altering substances as a coping mechanism, and how poorly they do in school, at work and in social settings.
Economics and social safety mean everything to a person throughout their development because they touch every aspect of a person’s life, from the household to the school to the workplace. Americans acting out in insane, criminal, murderous ways at rates far higher than in comparable nations is the end result of a system that has denied them safety and security in some way or another for their entire lives.
Some people are born with serious psychological impairments that could lead them to commit gravely immoral acts regardless of their upbringing. Yet, for these individuals too, America in the 21st century continually fails them by not prioritizing mental health treatment for those who need it. Mental health issues are a global problem, yet only in the U.S. does a mental health crisis end in a mass shooting.
Gun deaths in Tennessee hit a historic high

Sadly, very few in the halls of power have supported policy prescriptions that might reverse our glacial slide into a late-stage capitalistic dystopia where our healthcare, housing, education, fair wages, basic security and social safety are sacrificed on the altar of shareholder value.
The triage: Americans support the actions that would immediately begin curbing gun violence 
Despite our politicians utterly failing us, Americans, including Tennesseans, overwhelmingly support triage actions. For example, Americans support common-sense gun law reforms such as universal background checks, waiting periods, firearm safety training, permit-only handgun carry, and safe storage laws. Even red flag laws receive 71% support in Tennessee when pitched to the public as a gun safety measure that would require law enforcement, family members and intimate partners to petition a court for an emergency protection order to temporarily remove firearms from someone deemed an imminent risk to themselves or others.
These laws aim to keep guns out of the hands of individuals who pose a danger to themselves and others without infringing on the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. 
The long-term care: We also support solving the underlying problems that lead to gun violence 
Triage efforts in the form of common-sense gun laws will make it more difficult for sick people with evil intentions to access firearms, but it won’t solve the core societal problems that produce such individuals. 
Thankfully, we also overwhelmingly support society-improving measures like universal healthcare, publicly subsidized higher education, reducing corporate ownership of housing stock, and increasing American worker power through minimum wage increases, stronger unions and fair labor standards. And perhaps most important of all, Americans also support getting corporate money out of politics and forcing politicians to represent people, not wealthy donors.
I wish it were as easy as, “It’s guns!” “It’s mental health!” “It’s culture!” “It’s substance abuse!” or “It’s video games!” But a problem as complex as gun violence has no easy villain. And there is a lot of work ahead. Our gun violence issue is a uniquely American disease, yet it is perhaps better described as a symptom of a much deeper illness. 
Pulling our brothers and sisters out of the mire that is 21st-century America will take more than tinkering around the edges. It will take a reshaping of our society into one that prioritizes the health and well-being of all who live here, not just the wealthiest and most influential among us.

Harris, 27, stayed on the pill until around 25 but decided to switch to an intrauterine device because of blood pressure issues — and politics.
Harris of Louisville is part of a nationwide surge in demand for long-term birth control since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. 
Kentuckians told the Lantern they got intrauterine devices, better known as IUDs, because of concern that they would lose access to birth control under the Trump administration. Others got them to manage health conditions while some enjoy the comfort of having a long-term birth control method without having to take a daily pill.  
Among U.S. women ages 15-49 who use contraception, 10.5% used IUDs compared to 11.4% who chose the pill during 2022-2024. IUDs are highly effective at preventing pregnancy — more than 99%, according to Planned Parenthood. 
But for some this popular form of birth control comes with an unwelcome surprise: pain, sometimes extreme. The medical community is responding by offering more in-office treatments, though several patients said they weren’t effective enough. 
Several women interviewed by the Lantern described extreme pain during the procedure to insert the IUD into the uterus and said providers should employ — and insurers should pay for — better pain management, such as more effective numbing treatments and sedation.

They also said having the option for patient advocates to be in the room would be a welcome policy. 
“I was kind of scared into getting the IUD, I will say,” Harris said. “I was kind of frightened into it, at this point, because of the restrictions and limitations that are being put on women’s reproductive justice in this country every day.” 
She felt particular pressure being “a Black, queer person living in the South” and expressed concern over “if I got pregnant by a conservative dude.”  
Harris went to Planned Parenthood for the procedure and was offered over-the-counter ibuprofen, lidocaine and numbing cream for the pain. Even with lidocaine shots, the procedure was quite painful, Harris said. 
The doctor “definitely knew it was going to be painful, and she was trying her hardest to not be super blunt or s – – – – y about it,” Harris said. “But she did offer me several options for pain that … I didn’t even know they offered to women, and they probably don’t in some places.” 
‘We don’t want patients to avoid the procedure out of fears for pain.’ 
Pain associated with IUD insertion went viral on social media in 2024, prompting people to share their experiences undergoing the procedure and medical providers to take that pain more seriously. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance for pain management in August 2024. In July 2025, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists said there is “an urgent need for health care professionals to have a better understanding of pain-management options and to not underestimate the pain experienced by patients and for patients to have more autonomy over pain-control options during in-office procedures.” 
That organization, better known by the acronym ACOG, called for more research into the pain and directed doctors to have discussions with their patients about it. 
Even though patients say much more work remains, Kentucky medical providers are responding and taking pain during insertion more seriously. 



How do IUDs work? 
“There are two types of IUDs, which are small T-shaped devices placed in the uterus to prevent pregnancy: copper IUDs and hormonal IUDs. Copper IUDs work by releasing copper ions that are toxic to sperm. Hormonal IUDs work by thickening cervical discharge so that it’s difficult for sperm to make their way to an egg in the fallopian tubes. In some patients, the hormonal IUD can inhibit ovulation so no egg is released. Some IUDs can also be used as emergency contraception if they are inserted within five days of sexual intercourse.” — University of Chicago Medicine
“IUDs are 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. IUDs and contraceptive implants are the most effective kinds of reversible birth control available.” — Cleveland Clinic



Dr. Maria R Schweichler, an OB-GYN with Total Woman, which is part of Norton Women’s Care, said there are several options available to manage pain of IUD insertion, which varies in intensity person to person. 
Options include taking cytotec (misoprostol) the night before and the morning of the procedure to help soften the cervix and aid in the dilation process for patients who have never given birth vaginally or gone through labor; taking ibuprofen or Xanax; and doing the procedure during menstruation so dilation is easier. 
Doctors also have numbing lidocaine spray or a gel for the actual procedure, according to Schweichler. 
“In the worst-case scenario, people can have the procedure in the operating room with anesthesia,” she said. “However, this adds cost while an in-office procedure is covered by most insurance plans at 100%.” 
Some patients can get a paracervical block in the office, but this comes with “more risks because it involves an injection of a local anesthesia into the cervical stroma,” according to Schweichler. This block will also not help with cramping after the procedure. 
“IUDs can be a safe and effective form of birth control so we don’t want patients to avoid the procedure out of fears for pain,” Schweichler said. “Our goal is to work with patients to ensure the experience is as comfortable as possible.”

Planned Parenthood is working to be a leader in IUD pain management and routinely offers low-level sedation to patients getting IUDs. 
“Gone are the days where we believe that women do not feel pain when an IUD is inserted or removed,” said Rachel Brown, the area services director for Planned Parenthood who works in Kentucky and other states. 
Providers in the organization’s Kentucky locations are trained to offer paracervical blocks and low-level sedation. 
Planned Parenthood staff, she said, “really do want to be a leader in that care.” 
Ibuprofen or over-the-counter pain medication is enough for some people, Brown said, but not everyone. Sedation is both “medically possible” and “medically advisable,” she said, but insurance companies “often are the last to jump on board” and reimburse for it.  
Dr. Colleen McNicholas, the chief clinical transformation officer for the Planned Parenthood network that includes Kentucky, said the low-level sedation doesn’t involve putting patients into sleep as they would expect during surgery. 
“Sedation exists on a spectrum — local, minimal, moderate, deep and general,” McNicholas said. “In Kentucky, we currently offer local anesthesia — numbing medicine around the cervix — and minimal oral sedation, which helps patients feel calmer and more comfortable while remaining awake and responsive.” 
Still, there is a disconnect between what patients want and need to manage pain and what insurance companies consider necessary. 
“Insurance coverage varies by payor, but most plans do cover minimal sedation and a local paracervical block,” McNicholas said. “For patients who face additional out-of-pocket costs, Planned Parenthood works to bundle pricing so expenses are as transparent and affordable as possible.” 
The organization does this, Brown said, because “we don’t think that you should have to pay extra because you don’t want to feel pain during your procedure,” she said.

‘A lot of pain, a lot of blood’ 
Experiences with getting IUDs vary by person. The common theme women shared with the Lantern was that they were unprepared for the pain and while they enjoy the benefits of having an IUD, they wanted a better heads-up on what to expect during insertion. 
The lidocaine and numbing cream Harris was offered at Planned Parenthood were not pain management options offered to all the women who shared their IUD stories. Most said they were instructed to take over-the-counter pain medicines like ibuprofen for any pinching or discomfort, but that it was woefully inadequate to address their pain during insertion. 
Erin Bruker, 35, of Louisville, passed out during her insertion procedure. Her doctor had told her the IUD “goes in easy,” but that wasn’t her experience. 
“If I understood the pain, I would have definitely wanted something stronger than Advil,” Bruker said. 
LaDonna Murphy (Photo provided)
LaDonna Murphy of Lexington, decided to take her chances with cancer rather than endure the “trauma” of an unmedicated IUD insertion. 
She originally got an IUD in 2011 under anesthesia and with private insurance to help manage her endometrial hyperplasia, a condition that raises the risk of cancer. 
Murphy, 54, had Medicaid in 2017 when she had her IUD removed. The removal process went fine, but implantation of a new one never worked even after more than an hour of trying, she said. 
There was “a lot of pain, a lot of blood,” she recalled. “We took a break in the middle of it, and then finally, (the doctor) just said, ‘I don’t think I can get it in there.’”  
Her option at that point was to come back at a later date and try again with a new IUD. 
“It was so traumatic, I decided at that point to never have one implanted again. I just took my chances,” Murphy said. “Luckily for me, the hyperplasia has not returned, but at that point, I was willing to deal with it. To me, it was such a traumatic situation, I was willing to take the chance of getting cervical cancer over having to have that done without anesthesia.” 
After Murphy’s unsuccessful IUD insertion, she stopped receiving any gynecological care for four years. 
“I was not very trusting at that point,” she said. She said it would have helped if, after trying and failing to insert the IUD, her provider had said: “it’s not your fault” or showed compassion for her pain. But she left feeling stigmatized and alone.
She finally found an OB who showed her compassion and took his time with procedures, explained them well and supported her through them. That made all the difference. 
“Even if I had had a lot of pain in that one, I think I still would have felt better afterwards,” she said. “He was really good at making me feel like: However I react is okay.” 
Medical providers say everyone’s experience with the procedure is different, and there are a few pain management tools they can offer patients. The more effective tools, though, aren’t always covered by health insurance. 
Kentucky women who’ve gotten IUDs in recent years say that has to change. They also say they want medical providers to have honest conversations with their patients about the pain they could experience — what they’ll feel is often minimized as a “pinch” or “discomfort” when the reality is much worse. 
Louisville’s Jessica Thacker, 48, described her first IUD insertion procedure, which she estimates took about three minutes, as a “horrible” experience that left her lightheaded, pale and limping. 
“I had no idea how painful it was actually going to be,” she said. “I was at the point I was either going to pass out or ready to scream ‘stop!’ That’s how bad it was.”  
She appreciates that more organizations and providers are looking at policies to help with pain management. People, she said, “should not have to go through pain and even trauma by having this done just because that’s been the norm for so many decades.” 
Even with pain, several women said that if their doctor was more honest about how much insertion would hurt and showed compassion for the pain, it would be more bearable. 
Harris’ IUD experience was painful enough that she cried, despite being a “tattoo person” with a higher pain tolerance. The doctor showed compassion for the pain they felt during insertion, they said. 
“She even asked me before the procedure: ‘do you want me to talk you through the whole thing? Do you want me to tell you exactly what I’m doing? Do you want me to  distract you, or not talk to you at all?’” Harris said. “She was very accommodating and asked me exactly what I needed, if I wanted to put my feet in the stirrups or not. I feel like she did everything that she could to make me as comfortable with the resources and tools she’s been given.” 
What do insurance companies say? 
The Lantern reached out to spokespeople with several insurance providers in Kentucky — WellCare, Anthem, Humana Healthy Horizons, Aetna Better Health, United Healthcare Community Plan and Passport Health Plan by Molina asking for information about IUD pain management coverage. Most did not reply. 
Anthem spokesman Jeff Blunt said his company will “typically cover sedation associated with IUD insertion and removal when these procedures are billed as preventive services, resulting in no out-of-pocket cost to members.” 
“In cases where sedation is required due to complications, such as an IUD displacement, coverage is also available but may be subject to standard copayments, deductibles or other cost sharing based on the member’s specific plan,” Blunt said. “These claims may require additional documentation from the care provider.” 
Medicaid, the state-federal plan that covers 1 in 3 Kentuckians, or about 1.5 million people, will cover sedation “in instances where sedation is medically necessary to perform an IUD insertion,” a spokeswoman with the Cabinet for Health and Family Services said. She did not answer a follow-up query asking what constituted a medical necessity in this instance. 
A spokesperson for the Kentucky Association of Health Plans said Medicaid covers typical in-office pain relief. The association is the trade organization for the seven managed care organizations (MCOs) the state employs to process Medicaid claims.
“When a patient and clinician determine that additional sedation may be required, the request can be reviewed under federal medical-necessity rules by clinical specialists,” the spokesperson said. “Those reviews are based on the patient’s individual needs and circumstances, such as a previous difficult or unsuccessful insertion or personal or medical history.” 
Medicaid rules dictate, according to the Kentucky Association of Health Plans, that “sedation be covered when it is medically necessary and not billed for routine use when it is not. Medical necessity means the clinician provides a clinical reason that the additional level of pain support is appropriate for that specific patient.” 
In other words: Everyone’s case and pain management needs will be different. 
“There is no one-size-fits-all approach: some patients need little to no intervention, while others, especially those with prior trauma, may need a higher level of support to have an affirming experience,” McNicholas, the Planned Parenthood physician, said.
‘I was afraid that they would take away access’ 
Kimber Guinn, 34, has had four IUDs, the most recent of which was in March 2025. Her experiences have varied in the degree of pain.

Guinn’s previous IUD wasn’t due to be replaced until September 2026, but she said she felt pressure to reset her contraceptive clock because of the political climate.  
“I wanted to get it replaced sooner than eight years because of the Trump administration,” said Guinn, who is from Somerset and lives in Louisville. “I was afraid that they would take away access to birth control or do something weird.” 
After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, undoing the constitutional right to abortion, Guinn’s husband got a vasectomy. 
But she still wanted an IUD for a couple of reasons — she enjoyed not having a monthly period and she travels a lot. 
“My worry is always — even domestically, not just internationally, but anywhere — what if I get sexually assaulted and end up pregnant? That is my worst nightmare,” she said. “It’s been my biggest fear that that right to reproductive control will just be taken away.” 
With her current IUD, though, she has effective birth control until 2033.

My two table mates are eager to tell me their stories. They are both veterans, attending an Armed to Farm training for beginning farmers. One went out of her way to welcome me, fetching a chair from a nearby table.

Mary Martinez Rigo, 64, is older than most of the other attendees. She and her husband rehabilitated a former pine forest in Virginia into pasture for alpacas by literally drilling nutrients into the compacted clay. Her husband’s health is declining and she is at Armed to Farm with an eye to the future.
“I don’t want to give it up, and am looking to age gracefully in place as a farmer and a veteran,” she said. “I am looking to pivot from production to offering workshops.”

This November event was the 54th Armed to Farm, a program of the nonprofit National Center for Appropriate Technology. NCAT was founded during the energy crisis of the 1970s to develop energy saving strategies for underserved communities. In 1987, NCAT expanded its mission to include sustainable agriculture.
The week-long training events combine classroom instruction with in-depth farm tours. Experts, some of them veterans themselves, present on beekeeping, marketing, soil health, and agricultural law in the mornings. Afternoon tours provide for a close inspection of thriving small-scale agriculture operations and the chance to ask practitioners specific questions.
Participants begin by discerning goals for their farm. During the week they explore enterprises that could meet those goals. Some are aiming for profitability while others are seeking to be self-sufficient, grow a community garden in order to donate food, or operate a farm that trains other veterans.
The farm visits at the November event, held in Berea, Kentucky, exposed the group to aquaponics, horticulture, beekeeping, fruit and nut production, goat tending, retail operations, and seed saving. The Berea College Forest hosted a session on horse logging that drew a lot of interest.

Towanda Farrington got involved in farming through an equine program for veterans. She found that being outdoors and caring for animals helped her PTSD. She plans to operate her Mississippi-based vegetable and herb enterprises the old-fashioned way.
“I want to use a plow horse on my farm,” she said. “I got my horse from the Humane Society and like nurturing him as he nurtures me.”

Piloted in 2013 and launched in 2015, the Armed to Farm program has welcomed participants from 46 states. It has also proven highly successful; 83% of its thousands of graduates remain involved in farming. Some have gone on to leadership in community food system work.
Participants in this program gain much more than knowledge. Veterans face unique challenges, and being in a group with their former military peers creates an instant community. Participants feel safe to share their military experience in this nurturing environment, and program leaders are intent on accommodating their special needs.

Sean Judge was in a pivotal place in June 2019 when he attended his first Armed to Farm. With a PTSD diagnosis and recent surgeries to remove a tumor from his spinal cord, his physical restrictions dictated that he walk slowly and carry nothing over five pounds. Regardless, he felt like a full participant in the event.
“They asked about accommodations on the application and found a way for me to attend,” he said. “They never let go of me, even though they knew it would take a little bit for me to get there.”

Some attendees don’t know any other veterans interested in agriculture before Armed to Farm. They meet the teaching staff of NCAT, five of whom are veterans, who act as mentors and guides, and emerge connected to a supportive network they can call on in the months and years to come.
“Veterans having their own program is one of the biggest factors in [Armed to Farm’s] long-term success,” said Mike Lewis, a veteran and NCAT staff member. “I get at least four texts a week from graduates reaching out or asking technical farming questions.”
Veterans continue to benefit from NCAT resources after their Armed to Farm experience. Each receives a stack of books and pamphlets to take home, and can take advantage of networking and virtual learning opportunities. The advanced Armed to Farm 2.0 events provide a deeper dive into the business aspects of farming and scaling up production.
NCAT developed and operates Armed to Farm through a cooperative agreement with USDA-Rural Development. Each event relies on organizational partners for expertise and funding. Nonprofit Ranchin’ Vets offers a transportation stipend to participants. The Berea event was in partnership with Kentucky State University under one of their grant programs.
Looking to the future, Armed to Farm leaders hope to expand its reach. They are working on offering more enterprise-specific trainings, and hosting a tribal-focused Armed to Farm event.

(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)After long and difficult state budget negotiations ended without a plan to tax or regulate gambling devices that exist in a legal gray area, the leading maker of skill games across the nation is back in the public spotlight in Pennsylvania.

Lawyers for Ashokkumar Patel’s estate argued his death during a robbery was attributable, in part, to the companies’ negligence in ignoring safety and security practices to protect their all-cash gambling operations. 
Patel’s fatal shooting in a broom closet at the Hazleton convenience store where he worked has been held out as evidence of the need to regulate slot machine-like games, which can be found in social clubs, taverns, gas stations and other businesses across the commonwealth.

The verdict against Georgia-based Pace-O-Matic and the Lycoming County business that builds the Pennsylvania Skill game machines came as the companies prepared to defend their business model before the state Supreme Court. 
On Thursday, the high court will hear arguments in an appeal by the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General asserting that skill machines are functionally no different from casino slot machines and should be regulated under existing state law.
A lower state court upheld findings that because skill machines incorporate games that allow players to win back money they have lost, they’re not illegal under the commonwealth’s gaming laws. 
The attorney general’s office argues skill machines are recreations of traditional slot machines.
“They spin, play, and pay just like the modern electronic slot machines found in casinos today,” the office said in a court filing, adding the Commonwealth Court found they’re not slot machines because they include a “hidden” second game in which a player can win back their last bet plus a bonus of 20 cents, at most. The skill element is difficult to find and so long and tedious that few players use it, the attorney general’s office claims.
If allowed to stand, the Commonwealth Court’s en banc decision, stemming from a Pennsylvania State Police raid on a Dauphin County bar, could have a sweeping impact, the attorney general’s office said.
“These machines are proliferating across the state, in bars, in convenience stores, and even in casino-style gambling halls – all without any special licensing, regulation, or taxation. And under the lower court’s ruling that these slot machines are not slot machines, they could be placed anywhere at all, even in middle school cafeterias,” the office said in its brief.
State lawmakers have proposed legislation to regulate skill games, which they, and casino operators, say have no safeguards against children or problem gamblers using them and are a catalyst for crime in the communities where they’re placed.
Despite Gov. Josh Shapiro’s call in his February budget address to regulate and tax the machines as a badly needed new revenue stream, the state budget package passed Wednesday, 135 days late, without legislation to address skill games. 
As the June 30 budget deadline approached earlier this year, lawmakers pitched competing proposals. Shapiro proposed a 52% tax on the games’ gross revenue. Sen. Gene Yaw (R-Lycoming), whose district is home to Pennsylvania Skill game builder Miele Manufacturing, called for a 16% tax. Senate Republican leaders, meanwhile, pitched a compromise 35% tax.

Pace-O-Matic pressured lawmakers to back its preferred legislation, Yaw’s 16% tax. But the debate turned ugly as Pace-O-Matic accused Senate Republicans of threatening the company’s lobbying firm. And an out-of-state super PAC distributed flyers targeting senators who backed regulation legislation, Spotlight PA reported in June. A spokesperson for Pace-O-Matic told Spotlight it had nothing to do with the flyers.
Asked about the absence of skill machine legislation in the budget package signed into law this week, Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) and President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) said they recognized the need for regulation, but expressed frustration with the intensity of disagreements on the issue. 
“I believe there is some bipartisan interest in figuring this out,” Pittman said. “However, this building has a long history of going through gaming debates, and they are very complex and very tedious, very difficult.”
Ward added that she was angered by what she described as bullying by the skill games industry.
“The only people that aren’t going to like this budget are special interests. But we get threatened all the time by some of these interests,” Ward said. “We don’t do well being bullied. And I think a lot of these gaming interests have done nothing but try to bully us. … In the end, we’re not going to stand for that.”
Yaw told the Capital-Star he sees the regulatory scheme he proposed, along with the 16% tax and a $500 per machine state fee, as a jobs bill.
“Gov. Shapiro’s proposal at 50 some percent is going to kill the industry and it’s not going to generate any revenue, any income for the commonwealth,” Yaw said. “The power to tax is the power to destroy and taking at the rate that has been discussed will kill the industry.”
In addition to 200 jobs in his district, skill machines benefit thousands of workers across the state in bars, stores and clubs where the machines are located, because those businesses share in the revenue, he said.

“If any other senator came to me and said I have an issue in my district and it involves 200 jobs I would help with that,” Yaw said.
Others lawmakers simply want the machines gone. 
Sen. Amanda Cappalletti (D-Delaware) in 2023 sponsored a bill that would ban skill games outright. In a hearing in August of that year, witnesses said skill games are part and parcel of nuisance businesses in their communities, such as stop-and-go shops that sell liquor by the shot without liquor licenses. Others said the cash-based gambling machines were a magnet for crime.
That was the focus of the case attorneys Robert Zimmerman and John Lang presented on behalf of the murdered Hazleton convenience store clerk’s estate. 
Pace-O-Matic and Miele said in a statement Patel’s death is tragic and a terrible loss for his family. But spokesperson Michael Barley said the companies maintain they are not connected in any way to the actions of Patel’s killer. 
Although the jury apportioned only 20% of the liability between Pace-O-Matic and Miele, they plan to appeal what Barley described as numerous irregularities in the case. The remaining liability was attributed 55% to the gunman and 25% to the store’s owner, which settled out of court.
“The decisions rendered in this case set a dangerous precedent by establishing responsibility and liability for criminal activity with businesses that offer any product, service or software license at a location where a crime has occurred — even when there is little to no connection to the crime,” Barley said.
Patel, 50, was working at the Choice Food Mart to send money back to his family in India. The store had several skill machines manufactured by Pace-O-Matic and Miele and other makers. 
“Unlike casinos that have to follow extremely strict safety measures, where they have armed guards, state police on site, double-locked cashier cages … they are in convenience stores with none of those safety measures,” Zimmerman said in his opening statement. “The clerks in these stores have to handle thousands of dollars in cash to pay out the bettors and pay out collectors from the defendants’ enterprise.”
Patel’s killer ​​Jafet Rodriguez, who is now serving a life sentence, had lost about $6,700 playing the games in Patel’s store and knew that the store kept large amounts of money on hand, Zimmerman said. 
After Rodriguez was threatened by a drug dealer to whom he owed money, Rodriguez drove to the store where he pushed Patel into the closet and shot him in the neck, severing Patel’s tongue, which left him unable to call for help.
“Jafet Rodriguez had one goal.  He had one target. He went for one thing. He didn’t go for the cash register money. There was a key right in the cash register, didn’t bother. He went for the betting cash, just the betting cash,” Zimmerman said. “And the people at the bottom paid the ultimate price.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/skill-games-Somerset-County-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 05:57:03.754485

I suppose that means I’m overdue for an introduction. 
Saying where I’m “from” requires a lengthy explanation, because I’ve bounced around a few places. Though I was born and (mostly) raised in Utah, I call upstate New York home because that’s where I spent my high school and college years. 
I’m a proud graduate of St. Bonaventure University (#GoBonnies!) and a crafter who’s currently learning to knit — but also sews and crossstitches. I have cats and enjoy volunteering with my local community theater.

Follow me on Twitter or Bluesky. 

My first journalism job was in Mississippi, where I cut my teeth covering the minutiae of local government. There, I found a love for breaking down wonky, acronym-heavy documents into actionable information for the public. 
I come to the Capital-Star most recently from Indiana. I spent six years embedded in the state’s capital, reporting exclusively on statewide issues. I was part of the founding team that launched the Indiana Capital Chronicle, the Capital-Star’s sister publication under the States Newsroom umbrella. 
While there, I carved a niche for myself as a “Medicaid” reporter, mostly because I wanted to fill an information gap. But, also, because I love diving into any intersection between government and the people it serves. I reported extensively on state payments for children with complex medical diagnoses, a transition in home care services for elderly or disabled Hoosiers (and its waitlists), and the state’s Medicaid funding woes. 
Outside of health care, I was also the chief budget reporter and spearheaded our coverage in a highly contentious Republican primary.

Which is academically interesting, so long as you’re not the one in extreme pain. (Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)Pain comes with living. We all know that, and grow up with it. Sometimes pain is our quick warning to stop, sometimes a nagging caution to go easy and protect an injured part of the body. And as such, pain is a necessary part of healthy living. This feels good, this hurts … pay attention.
Pain also comes from accident, and disease. Unavoidable. And sometimes intractable. Screamingly so. Ruling the reality of a moment like a despot. And removing all the cultural graces and intelligence from human life in a heartbeat.
I have had three such incidents in my adult life, when pain dominated reality so forcefully. Once was when I wound up, a distance from home, beneath a horse. Left femur broken. Hours before I was found. Let’s just say the sound of sirens was sweet that day. And then, maybe a decade later, kidney stones appeared out of nowhere and rang that bell when they ask you to number your pain on a scale of 1 to 10. No doubt about it. Ten just got a huge promotion.
The third event was just recently, when I lifted something heavy on the farm. Suddenly too much for a back with 75 years of wear and tear. The pain getting worse by the day until finally an MRI provided the view of a chipped disc, bearing down on the sciatic nerve. Again ringing the bell, on some days at least, of a heavy 12 on the 10-scale for pain. 
The main pain-treatment difference this time has a lot to do with the Sacklers and the opioid epidemic they launched in their modern pursuit of uncountable wealth. Seriously felt in our region with more than a reasonable share of addicts and overdose fatalities. Such that we are now self-conscious, as a nation, about prescribed pain relief. Which is academically interesting, so long as you’re not the one in extreme pain. Because there’s apparently a lot of folks trying to get such prescriptions and faking the pain to achieve that end. Especially back pain, because it is pretty endemic to working humans, and hard to disprove. So, the common medical response seems to have defaulted to “He must be faking.”
In my first two events, opioid painkillers were readily prescribed. Because they are a CIVILIZED response to that rising crescendo of pain. But in this last instance, plodding NSAIDs were the limit. There were some days they were grudgingly sufficient, and some days they were savagely insufficient. I got through those days by falling back on some long-expired Tramadols we dug up in the downstairs medicine cabinet, residue from that ancient horse wreck. And Tramadol by my research is the weakest of the common opioids, by a long shot. One-tenth the strength of morphine. But it was enough to stop that impinged nerve root from its constant screaming into my ear. And bring some purpose and sanity back to my day. Relief, I believe, is the appropriate word.
But on that day I revisited the Spine Center and got the verdict of a chipped disc. I mentioned the inadequacy of NSAIDs and that my store of old Tramadols was about used up. And they were unwilling to prescribe an opioid of any type. Even with the strength of x-rays and an MRI testifying on my behalf. They did suggest that perhaps my family doctor could step in and do it in their stead. (He was gone on a medical mission to South America.) Instead they scheduled me for an epidural injection into the spine that would help with the pain, but due to great demand the earliest they could work me in was three weeks distant. O boy!
Luckily for me, there was also a chance my body would absorb the chip and the pain would eventually dissipate on its own. Which in my case occurred before the appointed epidural came about, which I canceled.
But my point is this: Since the billionaire Sacklers monetized a certain naivete in the narcotic Rx system, the pendulum for pain treatment has swung the other way. Wildly so. So that doctors are afraid of the consequences (and regulatory bother) of prescribing opioids. And genuine patients are constantly (and conveniently) being profiled as drug seekers. Even when the demographics don’t fit. And the medical evidence doesn’t fit. Such that pain too often reigns in individual lives, when much more civilized solutions exist. And normal folks are forced into very abnormal, and painful, outcomes. (Dare I say savage?) Largely because a certain percentage of the population can’t control themselves, and doctors can’t or won’t parse the difference. 
(A possible apology to doctors: because I never saw one at the Spine Center. My entire experience there relied on “go-between” PAs, which is fast becoming the norm in American health care. And PAs can’t write narcotic prescriptions. But they DO have doctors above and around them who can. And they certainly could have made the necessary introductions.
Until I know differently, I am sorely tempted to characterize those out-of-sight doctors as cowardly. And inclined to advise all you normal non-addicts out there to think twice before disposing of those unused portions of your old-fashioned opioid prescriptions. Your rainy day may be closer than you realize.)",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2214163374-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 05:57:03.754485

With a new governor taking office in January, Virginia is poised to revisit plans for a legal adult-use cannabis marketplace. (Photo by Pixabay/Creative Commons license)After four years of stalled efforts and repeated vetoes from outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Virginia lawmakers now see a clear path to finally standing up a legal adult-use cannabis market.
During her campaign, Democrat Abigail Spanberger, elected governor two weeks ago, pledged to sign legislation establishing a regulated retail system — reversing the impasse that kept marijuana sales in limbo since Virginia legalized possession and home cultivation in 2021. 
Lawmakers and advocates say the absence of a retail structure has fueled an unregulated market increasingly dominated by illicit operators.
At its next meeting on Dec. 2, the Joint Commission on the Future of Cannabis Sales, which the legislature created earlier this year, will roll out its finalized proposal for a retail framework it hopes the General Assembly will pass during the 2026 session. If lawmakers send the bill to Spanberger’s desk early next year, sales could begin as early as fall 2026.
The legislation will be carried by Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, the commission’s chair, and Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg.
Krizek told The Mercury in an interview last week that Spanberger’s election removed the biggest roadblock lawmakers had faced to date. 
He said the outcome was “a good day for public safety and for communities disproportionately affected by cannabis prohibition,” and a chance to finally direct tax revenue toward priorities such as job training and education. By contrast, he said, “It was a bad day for organized crime in the illicit cannabis market.” 
After years of pushing a bill under a governor “that was unwilling to discuss it at all and just vetoed our bill,” he said lawmakers now have the opportunity they have been waiting for.
“We’ve got to stand up this legal marketplace sooner rather than later,” Krizek said.
 Final proposal pending

At the December meeting, Krizek said, the commission will present a proposal that incorporates months of stakeholder testimony and adjustments intended to strengthen equity provisions and improve opportunities for small growers.
He described the legislation as one that “addresses the historical injustice” and adds new programs to earlier drafts, including guaranteed shelf space at medical cannabis dispensaries for micro-enterprise farmers once adult-use sales begin. 
“There’s going to be a lot of new and interesting programs and good stuff in there that will help create a well-regulated market that’s going to be good for everybody,” he said.
Joint cannabis commission holds first meeting amid push for regulated market

Krizek expects meaningful but not sweeping revisions to earlier proposals — changes “around the edges” based on feedback from stakeholders and the public. 
The extra time created by Youngkin’s opposition, he added, allowed lawmakers to refine the legislation. “The only good thing that the current governor has done for us is he has given us more time to perfect this bill,” Krizek said. 
But organized crime, Krizek said, “has had time to get a stranglehold on sales,” making it essential for the state to move quickly while still giving the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority enough time to roll out the marketplace. 
He noted that the strong election results and lessons learned from the commission’s hearings will shape the bill, and he expects those hearings to continue for at least the next two years.
Spanberger said in an interview with The Mercury in August that she would sign the commission’s proposal. 
“I support a legal marketplace for cannabis,” she said at the time. “I want to ensure that it is fully regulated, people know what they’re buying, and revenues go towards education.”
The commission’s summer hearings — its first round of work since its creation — included presentations on public safety, market structure, licensing and regulatory models. 
 A long path to legalization

Virginia legalized simple possession and home cultivation in 2021 under Democratic control and then-Gov. Ralph Northam. But creating a retail market required a second vote under the state’s reenactment clause. 
When Republicans took the House in 2022 and Youngkin expressed opposition to commercial marijuana sales, the process stalled. Still, lawmakers sent multiple versions of a retail bill to Youngkin, who vetoed every proposal, including the one he received earlier this year.
With no legal retail option, unregulated storefronts and delivery services proliferated. Local officials have raised concerns about public safety and product testing, and law enforcement agencies have struggled to distinguish legal CBD products from illegal THC imports. But the refined proposal aims to create a regulated, equitable market after years of uncertainty.

 CCA launches new medical cannabis portal

As lawmakers prepare for a broader retail system, the CCA last week rolled out a new online portal to streamline medical cannabis certification.
“The new CCA Portal was designed with practitioners and patients in mind,” the agency said in a news release. The platform, which is mobile-friendly, “offers stronger protection for personal information, safeguards against fraud, and provides a simpler process,” while maintaining clear records of every change.
Jamie Patten, the CCA’s acting head and chief administrative officer, called the upgrade “a major step forward for Virginia’s medical cannabis program. It’s safer, faster, and easier to use, and it helps us better protect patient information while supporting the integrity of the program.”
Patients will now receive email instructions to view, save or print their certification for dispensary visits. Practitioners can print certifications as needed.
 Federal hemp restrictions unlikely to affect Virginia’s plans

A continuing resolution passed by Congress last week included an agriculture appropriations bill that effectively shut down much of the U.S. hemp industry by reinstating stricter federal enforcement — a move that analysts say reverses the flexibility created under the 2018 Farm Bill.
But Krizek said the federal action does not affect Virginia’s push for adult-use marijuana sales.
“Our legislation is not a hemp bill,” he said. “This is creating a formalized and legal adult marijuana marketplace.”
Cannabis equity advocates say Spanberger’s victory opens the door for stronger protections against market consolidation and more robust investments in communities disproportionately harmed by prohibition.
Chelsea Higgs Wise, co-founder of Marijuana Justice, said the final bill should ensure fair competition by sequencing applications and limiting canopy size for pharmaceutical processors so they cannot dominate the market at launch. 
The legislation should set a uniform Jan. 1, 2027 start date, Wise said, so Virginia entrepreneurs can compete on equal footing, rather than allowing medical operators an early-sales advantage. 
She also urged lawmakers to clearly define what “equal and meaningful opportunity” means in licensing and ensure patient access is protected as the adult-use market comes online.
Wise also called for stronger equity provisions, including updated language that explicitly acknowledges the harm of past prohibition and commits to repairing it through impact licenses, reinvestment programs and measurable small-business ownership goals. 
Lawmakers should include micro-licenses, delivery options, nursery and craft licenses, event permits, and direct-to-consumer sales opportunities for small cultivators, Wise further suggested. She supports a 10,000-plant cap to prevent consolidation by major operators and says half of the Cannabis Equity Reinvestment Fund should go to the Equity Business Loan Fund.
With Spanberger set to take office in January and Democrats maintaining the legislature, lawmakers say Virginia is finally positioned to finish the work that began in 2021.
“We’re going to make some real positive progress,” Krizek said. “This is the opportunity we’ve been waiting for.”

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)State senators are considering asking representatives from the University of Virginia to meet with lawmakers in Richmond after school leaders signed an agreement with the federal government to suspend multiple civil rights investigations, sparking opposition from legislators, alumni and faculty. 
The news comes days after Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger asked the university’s board to wait until she’s in office before selecting a new president, and after former President Jim Ryan’s account of the process that led to his resignation was published Friday. Ryan wrote that his ouster, amid downward pressure from federal officials, “still feels surreal and bewildering.”
Ryan said Rector Rachel Sheridan and Vice Rector Porter Wilkinson worked with the Department of Justice and Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office in pressuring him to resign during the federal agency’s investigations. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to the claims.
 UVA issues may be on the agenda of senators’ meeting

During the spring, the U.S. Department of Justice initiated its investigation of the institution due to its concerns that UVA was violating federal civil rights laws in its admissions, hiring, diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and that its campus culture was inhospitable to Jewish students; the school refuted all these allegations. 
The claims conflicted with President Donald Trump’s executive orders aimed at reforming universities to align with his administration’s views.
UVA, Department of Justice agree to pause civil rights investigations

The situation drew national scrutiny and criticism close to home, with Democratic lawmakers now considering calling the university’s board members to account in the near future. 
Last month, Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, asked Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Higher Education, to consider calling UVA leaders to Richmond. His district encompasses the institution.
During the same time, Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Albemarle, and Deeds wrote a letter to UVA Interim President Paul Mahoney and the Board of Visitors expressing their disappointment with the decision and calling for them to reverse “this surrender of institutional autonomy and reject further federal interference.”
“I’m not doing anything right now, but not that I won’t,” Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Higher Education, said to the Mercury in an interview last week. 
Locke said her colleagues will discuss higher education in Virginia and other subjects at a Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee retreat at Radford University beginning on Thursday. She said the discussion could help determine the Senate’s next steps.
The Mercury asked Sens. Chris Head, R-Botetourt, and Todd Pillion, R-Washington, who sit on the subcommittee, for comment. They did not immediately respond. 
The retreat will convene Thursday and Friday at Radford. 
 Incoming and outgoing governors weigh in

The institution is also navigating calls from Spanberger to suspend its search for a new president until vacant seats on the governing board are filled, likely not until this upcoming General Assembly Session. In her letter, Spanberger claimed the board members “severely undermined” the public’s confidence in their abilities.
Youngkin said Spanberger is attempting to interfere with the hiring process and jumping to conclusions.
“It’s dangerous to wrongfully disparage committed individuals who volunteer to serve on university boards and the serious work they do,” Youngkin wrote in a letter. “Further, the governor of the commonwealth should speak thoughtfully and honor the service of those individuals.” He recommended that the school not delay the process. 
Va. Supreme Court hears appeal to lift suspension of Youngkin appointees from college boards

 DOJ investigations background

To suspend the DOJ investigations, UVA agreed to comply with civil rights laws and to provide quarterly reports to the government on its compliance efforts.
If UVA fails to make “sufficient progress” toward compliance with the DOJ, it will have 15 days to address the issues before the agreement is terminated and investigations resume.
Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, signed a letter to Rector Rachel Sheridan and Mahoney asking them to reconsider the agreement and to “defend the University’s autonomy, Virginia’s sovereignty, and the constitutional limits on federal power.” 
“Thomas Jefferson founded this University to be a beacon of enlightenment and independence,” the senators stated. “It should not become a cautionary tale of capitulation to federal overreach.”
In response, UVA leaders doubled down on their decision, saying the school suspended costly and disruptive investigations, avoided financial and operational risks, preserved institutional autonomy and academic freedom, and that compliance does not require major changes.
UVA leaders said they had “not given up any administrative, statutory, or constitutional protections” after signing the agreement, and said the agreement would allow UVA to litigate only if and when the DOJ’s interpretation of the law diverges from UVA’s policies.

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)Montgomery County, Maryland, is considering exporting its large volume of trash — and the resulting pollution — to a landfill in Virginia. In September, the County issued a request for proposals to long-haul and landfill the county’s approximately 600,000 tons of annually generated waste. County Executive Marc Elrich has long pushed to close the county’s trash incinerator. 
This crucial decision involves complicated environmental, public health, equity and cost tradeoffs, and Montgomery County lacks vital pieces of information. We have summarized what we know and what we don’t know in a report posted by Friends of Sligo Creek, an NGO based in Takoma Park, Maryland.
With respect to equity, a 1995 report from the Virginia General Assembly’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission showed that many of Virginia’s landfills—especially private regional ones—are located in marginalized communities that are disproportionately African American. By contrast, the rural area near Montgomery County’s incinerator is well-off and disproportionately white (75% white alone, as compared with 40% for the whole county). 
A recent, yearslong battle over siting a new mega-landfill in Cumberland County, which is 33% African American, underscores the vulnerability of Virginia’s Black Belt areas to the advances of landfill companies. A prime concern of Cumberland County’s residents was the landfill’s proximity to the historically Black Pine Grove School. Despite sustained citizen protests, this summer the Cumberland County Board of Supervisors approved a permit for a down-sized landfill footprint.
Cumberland County is among the Virginia localities that have agreed to site regional landfills because those jurisdictions are cash starved. Landfill companies pay them host fees and provide waste disposal.
Montgomery County, Maryland, is far from cash starved. But dueling estimates cloud the county’s waste management cost picture.
The county’s 2025 contractor report projects that, in the long term, even with needed upgrades, using the incinerator would be cheaper than landfilling. In 2024, the facility–also called a resource recovery facility, or RRF–generated $24 million in revenues from sales of electricity and recovered metals. Closing the incinerator would mean losing those revenues, generating that electricity from another source and burying metals that, when recycled, save energy and reduce greenhouse gas pollution relative to using virgin materials. 
However, county staff maintain that, in the short term, the landfill-plus-incinerator-closure option would be cheaper than continuing to operate the incinerator. They argue that the incinerator’s expenses would divert resources from efforts to decrease the county’s waste stream and that paying for landfilling on a per ton basis would incentivize waste reduction. But the county has not estimated closure costs for the incinerator.
On the environmental and public health side of the equation, the incinerator’s air pollution controls appear to be working well. The county’s solid waste plan says, “Several health-risk assessment studies have concluded that there are no measurable influences on ambient air concentrations attributable to RRF source emissions.” 
According to information provided by the Maryland Department of the Environment, the incinerator operates well within its permitted air pollution limits and, except for hydrogen chloride, within the Biden Administration’s proposed stricter standards for waste incinerators.
But the incinerator’s ash, a source of toxic metals, currently goes to a Richmond, Virginia, landfill whose surrounding community is 70% African American. County staff say the ash is stabilized so that it remains non-hazardous and that it is tested regularly.
Nearby jurisdictions have arrived at a different ash disposal option. Arlington County, Fairfax County, and the city of Alexandria use an ash monofill, a type of facility that’s designed to prevent the release of metals. That monofill is located in Lorton, Virginia.
In extending the life of their incinerator to 50 years, Arlington and Alexandria said, “it was found to be economically beneficial for both jurisdictions.” They also cited the “stellar” environmental record of the facility. Although incinerators can divert materials from recycling, Arlington and Alexandria report strong recycling rates (53% in 2023), as does Montgomery County (45% in 2022).
Incinerators kill pathogens, but they produce carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Still, our analysis indicates that landfilling the county’s waste could produce much higher amounts of greenhouse gases than the county’s waste incinerator. That’s because landfills emit methane, an especially potent greenhouse gas.
Landfills harbor pathogens. They produce copious amounts of air and water pollution, for decades. Landfill gases contain carcinogens like benzene and vinyl chloride. Landfill leachate (garbage “juice”) is contaminated with many chemicals, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has said that even the best protected landfills will eventually leak. The Shoosmith mega-landfill in Chester, which has been identified as a potential recipient of Montgomery County’s trash, generates almost 400,000 gallons of leachate per week, according to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. That landfill is in bankruptcy proceedings.
Here are some important unknowns for Montgomery County: The likely substantial costs for closing the county’s incinerator and remediating its site; what it would cost to send the incinerator’s ash to a different disposal site; and, what it would cost to extend the life of the incinerator, because no proposal request has been issued to that end. For the landfill option, we don’t know what the impacts on the county’s transfer station might be or whether the county might be liable for landfill contamination problems. 
Montgomery County’s council members say we must keep all options open and express deep unease with — or outright opposition to — exporting our trash. The principles of proximity and self-sufficiency encourage the treatment of waste close to its point of origin. Maryland is already the leading out-of-state contributor to Virginia’s trash imports.
But the council has not scheduled a public hearing. 
Council members and the public deserve to see the full cost, environmental and public health picture, and the council must invite input from affected citizens in both Maryland and Virginia.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)November is National Family Caregivers Month, a time to honor the 63 million Americans who care for loved ones. I can’t think of anyone who deserves that recognition more than you, Mom. Do you remember when I was a child and I said I wanted to live with you forever? You swore I’d change my mind; you said I’d grow up and want to be with my friends. I thought you were crazy.

Truthfully, we were both right. I did eventually want to live independently. I longed to be a mom, making fun memories with my own kids, then dropping them off at their grandma’s house for even more excitement. Missing out on that experience has been a crushing blow. Nevertheless, I can’t imagine a happier, more peaceful home than the one we’ve shared for the past 42 years.

But preschool Nikki never thought “living together forever” would mean you’d be my lifelong caregiver. I never considered my capable, athletic body could fail at all, let alone require about 20 neurosurgeries. That fiercely independent child never envisioned being unable to work or carry out normal daily activities. I was merely picturing an eternity of quiet lunches followed by us hanging out together, just having a good time.

OK, maybe I did nail that part of the vision…

I’ve been thinking a lot about that childhood conversation lately. I bet you wished you could freeze time and keep me forever. Funny how the universe grants wishes with a twist of fate. I’ve been a permanent fixture in your household, but at quite a financial, physical, and emotional cost to you.

A caregiver’s work is tireless and thankless. You’re always there when I need you. Even when you’ve just sat down and I know you want to stay there, you never complain if I need a snack, water, medicine, or a hot pack. You’ve mastered the “Nikki handbook” so well you can anticipate my needs. I know how much brainpower that takes and how exhausting it gets when my condition throws you curveballs. You never stop trying, though.











I’ve been a permanent fixture in your household, but at quite a financial, physical, and emotional cost to you.



You play through the pain — literally — pushing your aching body to do chores it’s no longer built for and staying awake when fatigue is making your eyes heavy. I’ve seen you care for me through illnesses and injuries when I know all you really wanted was someone to take care of you. You’ve rescheduled your own medical appointments and taken hits to your mental health. But you do it willingly, frequently telling people you know my suffering is far worse than yours. Only you show me that level of consideration.

I’m so grateful for your amazing network of friends. But your already infrequent plans will be canceled on moment’s notice if something is wrong with me. I wish you all didn’t have to be so accommodating.

I have watched helplessly as you sacrificed your entire life to prolong and protect mine. You’ve stood by me through every surgery. But as impressive as the critical moments sound, the bigger demonstration of strength and loyalty has been your daily devotion — making good on your promise never to abandon me. You didn’t think twice about prioritizing my wellbeing over your financial security, so you now have none. Unlike many of your peers, you don’t own a home or take even modest vacations. You’re rarely able to spend a day at the beach.

You get frustrated, but not with me. I am so grateful for that. You’re instead exasperated with life and with those who don’t see or understand what you’re going through. This letter is my way of finally reassuring you, I see it all. I understand your struggles and frustrations. I appreciate everything you do, and I love you so much for it.

RICHMOND, Va. – Virginia became the 33rd state to elect a female governor, but the recent race was a rare instance where the two candidates were both women — just the 11th time in the U.S. since 1986.
Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger will be inaugurated in January after a decisive victory that was declared by the Associated Press within an hour of the polls closing. The lieutenant governor’s race also made history on at least two fronts: a woman succeeding another woman in the position and the first Muslim woman in the U.S. elected to a statewide seat.
The election also increased women’s representation in the Virginia House of Delegates.
Forty-two women were elected to House seats, which surpassed the current record of 34, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. Four Democratic women replaced a Republican male incumbent in districts that lean Republican.
Democrats sweep Virginia’s statewide races, reclaiming full control of executive branch

While more women now hold office, they still continue to fight against double standards and additional scrutiny that their male counterparts do not face, according to experts who study women and politics.
The increase in female leadership reflects a few things, according to Hollie Mann, an assistant professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University.
 Why more representation?

A huge influx of female candidates at all levels of government ran for office after Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential bid in 2016, according to Mann. More women are also activated to run for office by national issues such as a rollback on reproductive freedom, education concerns and rising gun violence.
Spanberger and her opponent Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears were not the first women to run for the governor’s office in Virginia.
Virginia had two very close opportunities to have a woman as governor before, according to J. Miles Coleman, media relations coordinator at The Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.
Emily Couric, sister of journalist Katie Couric, was a former state senator representing the Charlottesville area and former chair of the Virginia Democratic Party. She planned to run for lieutenant governor alongside Mark Warner in 2001, but dropped out of the race after a diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic cancer. She died in October of that same year.
“I could have easily seen her becoming governor at some point,” Coleman said.
Before Couric, two-term Attorney General Mary Sue Terry ran in 1993 as the Democratic nominee for governor. In the same year, Democratic president Bill Clinton had a very low approval rating, and federal issues can impact state elections, according to Coleman.
Terry had a more masculine appearance and there were rumors surrounding her sexuality that could also explain her loss, according to Mann.
Regardless of why Terry lost, it took over 30 years to have another woman on the ballot, although U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan ran in 2021 but lost the primary to former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe.
Spanberger in her victory speech thanked the women who came before her, and “Mary Sue Terry in particular.”
 Governance and gender 

Voters hold women to different standards the higher they climb politically, according to Mann. The expectations change for positions such as governor, attorney general and congresswoman, compared to city council or school board seats.
“They have to walk a finer line between conforming to our standards with respect to gender and conforming to our standards and expectations with respect to leadership, which are often at odds,” Mann said.
Both gubernatorial candidates leaned into their previous service records as a way to show their toughness. Earle-Sears, a Marine veteran, posed with an assault-style rifle during her campaign for lieutenant governor. Spanberger, the first former CIA officer to be elected as governor, was able to highlight her service record while assuring supporters she would sign gun safety measures.
A majority of people report that the gender of a government leader is irrelevant, according to Pew Research Center. However, of people who do acknowledge gender differences, 39% said a woman would be better at working out compromises and 37% said a woman would be better at maintaining a respectful tone in politics.
Women tend to have a relational style of politics that is less combative and antagonistic than their male counterparts, according to Mann.
“This is true for both Republican and Democratic senators and congresswomen and governors,” Mann said. “They tend to, not always, certainly not always, govern in a more cooperative fashion.”
Spanberger served as a congresswoman from 2019 to 2025, becoming the first Democrat to win Virginia’s 7th District in nearly 50 years. She was ranked the most bipartisan Virginia member of Congress in 2024.
Traits like assertiveness and leadership have historically been more associated with men than women according to Kelly Dittmar, the director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics. A female candidate has to prove she can meet those stereotypically masculine credentials in a way that men likely do not have to do.
But gendered expectations among women can differ even by race, according to Dittmar.
“So Black women are going to be evaluated differently than Latinas, who are going to be evaluated differently depending on if they’re Republicans or Democrats,” Dittmar said.
Historically, people have questioned women’s expertise in defense and national security issues, according to Dittmar. These issues were assumed to be an area of male strength. Spanberger leaned into her domestic and international counter-terrorism service record on the campaign trail.
On the flip side, women are expected to show compassion and empathy, Dittmar said. That can give them an advantage, because they do not have to work as hard to project those traits as a man might.
When women have more presence in local, state and federal government, they bring new perspectives to policy making, according to Dittmar. Women will hold 40% of seats in Virginia’s 140-seat state legislature in 2026, making it more representative than Congress.
Women also often bring other marginalized voices into political conversations, Dittmar said.
“It does actually make a difference that young girls see women in positions of leadership,” Dittmar said. “But not even just young girls — boys, men and women see a woman in this high-level executive decision-making position and hopefully see her doing it well.”
Voters at polling places throughout Central Virginia had reactions that ranged from Virginia was long overdue for a female governor, to “sex does not mean anything.”
Henrico County voter Kevin Cutro was excited to choose between two female gubernatorial candidates, especially since he has a daughter.
Emily Breeden thought it was “awesome” to have an election between two women, even though she strongly disagreed with one candidate.
“It’s so nice to know that no matter what happens … that there’s going to be a woman in office,” Breeden said.

(Getty Images)If you make a living telling stories, the narrative is never far from your focus. So when I read that members of the House of Representatives were “racing” back to Washington to vote on a measure that would reopen a shuttered U.S. government, I giggled.
Imagine: Nebraska’s House trio in a heated competition against the other 432 House members to get there first. Of course, after being adjourned for 53 days one wondered if they knew where to go.
As we know, the feds reopened for business per the Congress’s vote, but “racing” pols was not the lasting image that I took away from the the longest government shutdown on record, a sketchy achievement, which, given this body’s penchant for capitulation, may again be in play sometime after Jan. 30, 2026, the expiration date on the new continuing resolution, as oxymoronic as that sounds. The Senate was already in D.C, but, if we extend the metaphor, went nowhere for the longest time.
None of which was the most searing story from our latest stint in the monkey barrel that is sometimes Washington politics. Nor was it the shutdown’s impact on air travel, the furloughing of public servants who make the federal government work or even the Epstein sewage all the while bubbling beneath the surface .
For me, the lasting imprint will be the callous vigor with which this administration went after SNAP benefits, government assistance that feeds children, the elderly, the disabled and the working poor. That process included the White House appealing court decisions that would have forced it to use available funds to disburse SNAP payments.
The government has reopened, but the pause of benefits, which sent SNAP recipients scrambling to feed themselves and their children, added an extra layer of uncertainty to already food insecure households.
Perhaps the administration had a legal argument, but they sure as hell didn’t have a moral one.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
You’re right, the optics don’t always tell the story. This one did: A government fighting to avoid feeding its most vulnerable. Moreover, it’s time we finally bury for good the reliable and racist trope that Americans who need government assistance to eat are “welfare queens,” Ronald Reagan’s 1976 reference to a Black woman from Chicago who devised schemes to defraud the government. 
He used the stereotype to argue that welfare abuse was rampant, reasoning that continues today. If you’re keeping score at home, here are U.S. Department of Agriculture numbers reported by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities: Of the one in eight Americans, nearly 42 million people, who use SNAP benefits, more than 62 percent of program participants are in families with children.  
More than a third are in families with members who are older adults or are disabled. Thirty-eight  percent are in working families. And according to a number of studies, the vast majority of those who can, work, a new proof of citizenship and employment requirement — nods to “welfare queen” logic — as of October notwithstanding.
That breaks down to 1 in 13 Nebraskans using SNAP benefits, 155,000 of our neighbors. Sixty-eight percent of Nebraska SNAP participants are in families with children, 30 percent are in families with members who are older adults or are disabled, and, like the national average, 38 percent are in working families.
If you wonder how nearly four in 10 working families still require assistance to put food on the table, the answer has less to do with government benefits and more to do with what we consider a “living wage.” Obviously, each individual family’s budget varies, but just as “welfare queen” is a broad and wildly inaccurate brush, we need a better understanding of what exactly is a “living wage,” especially when astronomically wealthy corporations such as Walmart, McDonald’s and Amazon employ the highest numbers of SNAP recipients.
Some really smart people have been unable to bridge the gulf that seemingly divides us politically. That chasm has now, apparently, reached a depth that means we’d rather watch children go hungry than yield any leverage.
Perhaps one day we’ll tame such mulish intransigence. Perhaps not. None of it will matter, however, if our moral compasses are askew. One obvious plot line of this shutdown, this power play of politicians, was clearly food … and those who would go without it. When that happened, we ceded whatever humane high ground on which we believed to be standing. 
Not a good look for the richest nation on earth.

Dozens of people bundled up in coats gathered at the back of the High Street Congregational church in Auburn Thursday morning, forming lines for food boxes and browsing through folding tables of free clothes and books. 
Volunteers called numbers issued to each person eligible to receive boxes of food, and occasionally when there were extras, put them on a circular leftover table. Half a dozen people who didn’t have numbers gathered around that table, including Stacey Bailey, who goes to the food pantry every week. 
Once a month, Bailey is one of the 65 people chosen to receive a box full of pantry items, produce and meat. But even when she’s not, she still shows up and stands around that circular table to supplement weekly meals for her family. On Thursday morning, Bailey was able to fill two Hannaford freezer totes full of food from the extras table.
Once her bags were full, Bailey passed around bread, chicken salad and squash to others standing around the leftover table until the food pantry started wrapping up for the week. 
“It’s the best thing around here,” she told another man who walked up to the table a few minutes before the pantry closed, passing him food as a church volunteer handed him bags to fill. “It feels friendly around this table.”
Bailey receives federal food assistance, but about a year ago, she started to notice her Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program money was not enough to feed her family, including her two children. That’s when she started her weekly trip to the pantry.
“SNAP is only so much a month, and it goes quick. I also have to use that for Thanksgiving this month,” she said, standing in the church parking lot. “This place is consistently helpful. I’d recommend anyone who needs help to show up.”
Marcel Turcotte, who volunteers at the food pantry and cooks the Sunday night meals, said he’s seen more and more people show up in recent weeks, including to try their luck at the leftover table. 
“That’s supposed to be a supplement, but for some of them, it is all they get,” he said.
The High Street church feeds about 70 people a week, in addition to offering a prepared dinner on the third Sunday of the month. But like most other food pantries in Maine, the uncertainty with SNAP benefits over the last month, increasing grocery prices and holidays coming up has meant an unprecedented demand. There are more than 500 people signed up to receive meals, according to Debbie Duval, the church’s pastor.
Food pantries report increase in donations
In an effort to meet the increased need, local businesses, restaurants and grocery stores have also stepped up to offer free meals or donations to the church in recent weeks, Duval said.
That’s also true for Preble Street, the Portland-based nonprofit that operates a homeless shelter and a food pantry and kitchen for prepared meals. The organization recently expanded its pantry and capacity for prepared meals with the opening of a Food Security Hub, days before demand skyrocketed.
In October, Preble Street sent out 1,066 food boxes to its partners throughout southern Maine, including homeless shelters, recovery centers, mental or behavioral health facilities like Spurwink Services and Opportunity Alliance, and wellness shelters such as Elena’s Way. The organization noticed the demand for boxes increasing each week throughout the month, and the total boxes distributed was 200 more than September, according to Danielle Smaha, senior director of communications for the nonprofit.
The organization has also dramatically increased the number of prepared meals they’re offering every day to 2,600, which are driven to shelters, recovery organizations and other partners who need them, Smaha said.
Corresponding with the increased demand, Preble Street has seen a sharp increase in community contributions, with people dropping off bags of pasta and bottled sauce outside the food hub in South Portland, or through food drives at political events, like U.S. senate candidate Graham Platner’s recent town hall, which collected 1,100 pounds of canned goods to donate to Preble Street, according to advocacy director Terence Miller.
“The crisis was politically created,” Miller said, walking through Preble Street’s food pantry while volunteers and employees assembled custom food boxes. “And it created this outpouring of the best of humanity. But it didn’t have to be like that.”
Food pantries accommodating for choice

Preble Street’s pantry is accessible to caseworkers who deliver boxes directly to their clients, and can accommodate a vast variety of food preferences or dietary restrictions, including gluten free, vegan, kosher or halal options, said Linda Hogan, a volunteer who assembled boxes on Thursday afternoon.
“Here we have great variety, and we’re able to respond to people with cultural needs, with diet needs or just give people what they want, like it might be a chocolate cake for a birthday,” she said.
“We have people that are in recovery from illness or trauma, and we have great variety to respond to their cultural needs or diet needs, and get them what they want.”
As Hogan was finishing up box assembly, Sabina Montminy was walking through wire racks of food with a list and a shopping cart. It was Montminy’s second consecutive day at the food pantry to supplement groceries for the families she represents as a caseworker for Spurwink.
Some families and people she works with regularly need assistance through the food pantry in addition to their SNAP benefits, but recently, almost everyone she works with has had to rely on the Preble Street pantry more, she said. 
That has meant two or three visits a week for Montminy to fill up shopping carts of canned goods, pantry items, dairy, and even pre-made sandwiches for her clients, she said. The Preble Street pantry’s size and variety means her clients’ needs — from including pre-made food for unhoused clients and snacks for families with kids — can be met.  
“This place is great, and it’s given a lot of my clients autonomy, because they’re allowed to have choices,” she said. “It’s really nice that people are allowed to sort of have their preferences because not everything works for everybody.”

The proposal has divided stakeholders and ignited debate about how best to protect both consumers and New Hampshire’s local food system.
“This has to start somewhere, and if it has to start in New Hampshire, so be it,” said prime sponsor Rep. Barbara Comtois, a Barnstead Republican, just before the House Environment and Agriculture Committee voted, 9-3, on Nov. 12 to recommend the bill for passage in the upcoming session.
A seasonal crunch
Farmers and legislators backing the proposal characterized it as a bold approach to dealing with a shortage of USDA slaughterhouses they said is limiting New Hampshire farms. 
Federal food safety laws require that meat sold commercially in the United States is inspected and approved by the USDA or a state agency working in partnership with the department. In New Hampshire, with no dedicated state program, this means that meat destined for sale must be processed at a USDA-approved facility with a federal inspector present during the slaughter.
There are four qualifying slaughterhouses across the state, in Barnstead, Conway, Goffstown, and Haverhill. Some farmers said that was not enough to meet peak demand, especially in autumn, the busiest season for meat processing. 
One reason for the autumn rush on slaughterhouses is that most farms schedule calving for spring and slaughter about 16 to 18 months later. It is also common for smaller farms to cull animals in the fall to avoid overwintering a herd, sometimes because they lack the infrastructure necessary to keep the animals healthy and marketable through the season.
This is the case for Josh Pelletier, who raises cattle, swine, and poultry at Dreamers’ Farm in Litchfield. Though he hopes to someday maintain a year-round herd, he doesn’t currently have the facility to overwinter his animals, Pelletier said in an interview. This leads him to compete with other farmers to secure coveted autumn butchery appointments. 
“It’s an absolute bottleneck in the fall,” he said.
Like most New Hampshire farmers, Pelletier books slots a year or more in advance. This, he said, makes it difficult to respond to fluctuations in customer demand. Paul Gareau, of Arándano Farm in Belmont, agreed.
“I made my appointment a month ago for litters that won’t be born for four to five months in the future. It’s just a little crazy, because we need farms to be growing,” he said.
Being a smaller farm raises costs and makes it even more difficult to book a slot, Pelletier said. Slaughterhouses often give preferential treatment to farmers who consistently bring in dozens of cattle, putting the interests of smaller producers, who have less business to offer, second.
A former chef, Pelletier said he would be interested in setting up a butchery on his farm if the proposal passes. He hopes others would do the same.
“I know that would bring our prices down,” he said. 
Josh Pelletier, of Dreamers’ Farm in Litchfield, said he favors a proposal to loosen regulations on meat processing in New Hampshire. The four USDA slaughterhouses currently operational in the state are not enough, he said, though critics say the proposal would jeopardize food safety and put farmers at risk of federal prosecution.

Safety and reputation concerns
Critics said food safety and reputability were on the line and raised concerns about federal prosecution or other consequences for farmers defying the USDA.
“I am a bit horrified by what you’re attempting to do here,” said New Hampshire Department of Agriculture, Markets, and Food Commissioner Shawn Jasper, expressing opposition to the bill during a work session Nov. 5. “My department is largely about consumer protection, and I think this is a huge step in the wrong direction.”.
Jasper said experience had led him to believe that some form of oversight was necessary to ensure meat is processed safely. The bill, he noted, does not call for inspections or education about safe meat processing.
“If you believe that all people act in the best interest of sanitary conditions, I’d ask you to follow some of my inspectors around for a day or two,” Jasper said at the work session. 
The amendment the committee ultimately voted in favor of Nov. 12 called for a slaughter area on the farm to be “maintained in sanitary condition,” though it neither defined what that would entail nor called for inspections.
Comtois said USDA facilities were not always safer, saying she knew of one New Hampshire facility that had dealt with safety violations, though she later declined to identify the facility. Other proponents, including Fremont Republican Rep. Laurence Miner, said oversight was unnecessary because a desire to protect their reputation would motivate farmers to adhere to safe practices of slaughter and meat storage. 
Some farmers, including Pelletier and Gareau, echoed this. An exemption already exists for poultry, Gareau said. “Poultry is arguably more dangerous than beef and pork,” he said.
Others disagreed.
“I believe farmers are good by nature. I think most of them make a lot of good decisions, but it doesn’t mean they all do,” Scott Mason, of Northwinds Farm in Stratford, said in an interview. 
Farmers are under a lot of pressure, Mason said, and must make many decisions every day that affect animal health, food safety, and their bottom line.
“It’s great to talk about knowing your farmer … but you’re not there at 10 o’clock at night, when they’ve got to make the right decision,” he said. 
Assuming risk
HB 396 calls for farmers to sign a statement acknowledging that they are violating federal law and “could be subject to federal prosecution” if they intend to slaughter their own animals. 
Insurers would be unlikely to protect farmers who violate federal law, Jasper said at the work session. For those who make a living selling meat, taking on liability is a serious concern, said Tim Duval, who raises beef cattle at HT Farm in Belmont with his wife Heidi Loring. 
HT Farm processes more than 40 head of cattle a year. Duval said that though he favored the bill and hoped it would help smaller operations, he would not take on the risk of using a non-USDA butcher himself. The USDA takes liability for issues that arise with meat during processing, Duval said. After hiring a non-USDA butcher, he said, the farmer would be liable.
“For us, that risk is kind of high,” Duval said. “… To throw 48 of them out there a year that way, liability wise, I just can’t take that chance.”
Joyce Brady, president of the New Hampshire Farm Bureau and owner of CJEJ Farm in Stratford, said she believed the bill sought to solve a serious problem, referencing her own experience of losing an appointment she had scheduled a year in advance for Christmas meat orders when the slaughterhouse was overbooked. But the liability it would have farmers take on, she said, is unacceptable.
“Something has to change, but this is not the way to do it,” Brady said. “I am very much against putting farmers and processors at risk.”
In his Nov. 5 testimony, Jasper referred to fallout from the passage of similar legislation in Maine in 2017. That law sought to enable Maine municipalities to permit direct-to-consumer sale of certain farm products without state oversight. 
But because Maine’s state government is responsible for conducting inspections in partnership with the USDA to ensure meat processing meets federal standards, the agency argued its passage would prevent enforcement of federal food safety regulations. A letter from the USDA to the state said the department would recommend federal takeover of the state’s meat processors if the problem was not solved. To avoid that outcome, lawmakers called a special session to amend the law, adding language to require continued enforcement of meat and poultry processing regulations to USDA standards.
In a Nov. 10 email, a USDA spokesperson said HB 396 as proposed “would violate the law, by failing to meet federal food safety requirements under the Federal Meat Inspection Act.” The spokesperson did not address questions about whether or how the department would take enforcement actions for such a violation.
A persistent problem
“My family’s been selling meat longer than I’ve been alive … We’ve been doing it for probably 70 years. It’s not like this is a new phenomenon, right?” Mason said.
He believes the real issue the state should seek to address is the difficulty of sustaining a slaughterhouse business — and adding more slaughterhouses, USDA or not, would not help, he said.
Mason was not compelled by complaints about wait times. Timing slaughter right is important, because as animals get larger they become less efficient at converting grain into muscle. But farming, he said, is about planning ahead, and slaughter is not the only thing a farmer must consider far in advance: from breeding animals to overseeing their pregnancy and raising a calf, a farmer can plan years in advance to slaughter an animal, he said.
“What I’m concerned with is that this is really more about a political movement, you know, less government — or, I should say, no government. And I don’t support that, and I don’t see how that’s going to help my business any,” he said.
Mason said he would support a state partnership with the USDA, like those in place in Vermont and Maine, that would increase the spots available in slaughterhouses without preempting the USDA’s authority and standards.
“God bless the New Hampshire Legislature, they’ll do anything other than come up with a dollar. That, to me, is what we’re seeing here: An attempt to say they’ve done something without really doing something. And ‘really doing something’ means you’re going to invest money in state inspection,” Mason said.
At the Nov. 5 work session, Jasper said such a state program would be expensive. But like Mason, he also questioned whether there was enough year-round demand to justify expanding the slaughterhouse market. He called on organizations like the New Hampshire Farm Bureau to see if smaller farmers could organize together to forge more reliable relationships with slaughterhouses.
At a recent New Hampshire Farm Bureau meeting, members were divided on the issue, Brady said. Ultimately, the group voted down a motion that would have the organization come out in opposition to HB 396. “However, there was no vote to support (the bill),” she added. 
Brady said the New Hampshire Farm Bureau wants to see more action on the federal level to help address the issue without the need for farmers to go against federal law. One possibility is the PRIME Act, which was introduced by Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie in 2019 and would pave the way for states to allow intrastate sale of non-USDA-processed meat.
The PRIME Act stalled then, but Massie and Maine Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree reintroduced it this July. HB 396 supporters, including Environment and Agriculture Chair Judy Aron, said that was promising. But the federal government had stalled on the topic for too long for New Hampshire not to go ahead and take action now, she said.
“Nothing is being done. And so we’ve got to do something as a committee, and as a Legislature, to make a statement that, hey guys, you either fix this in the industry, or you fix this in the federal government, or we have to,” Aron said Nov. 12. “As an intrastate solution, I think this is a good place to start.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/beef0-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 05:57:03.754485

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderAhead of the momentous 2020 presidential election, Georgia’s state leaders faced a choice.
The state’s voting system prior to that year consisted of 27,000 electronic voting machines that had been in use since 2002, which were reaching the end of their life and needed to be replaced. 
The voting machines, officially called direct-recording electronic voting machines, worked by capturing an electronic record of voters’ selections. At their polling place, voters received an activated voter card, which they inserted into a machine and used to make their selections. Once the voter had finished casting their ballot, the card was returned to a poll worker and its memory was wiped clean to be used for the next voter. Voters’ selections were saved electronically to a memory card on the machine, which was later collected by a poll worker and sent to election headquarters to be counted.
Cybersecurity experts had long voiced concerns about the electronic voting machines, which were once used by more than 40% of American voters, but in Georgia, lacked any sort of paper trail that could be used to verify election results after the fact. Additionally, the memory cards were vulnerable to viruses and other computer malfunctions.
Will Georgia join a GOP-led state exodus from a multistate voter accuracy group?

Legislators at the time voted for Georgia’s new election system largely along party lines, with Democrats largely favoring hand-marked paper ballots that require voters to fill out ballots with pencils or pens, and Republicans supporting ballot-marking devices, which still required voters to make selections on a machine but produced a paper ballot that would be scanned to tabulate the results. The new machines, purchased for $107 million and manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems, were used statewide in Georgia for the first time during the 2020 election.
But nearly six years later, Democrats and Republicans have seemingly found themselves on opposite ends of a similar debate. Some GOP lawmakers are now leading a push to replace ballot-marking devices with hand-marked paper ballots, and there are Democrats who are cautioning against abandoning Georgia’s current ballot-marking device system before the end of the state’s 10-year contract in 2029.
Now, with the 2026 midterm elections looming, lawmakers are once again faced with the question of whether to switch voting systems ahead of key statewide races — and they are running out of time to decide.
‘A very expensive pen with a mind of its own’ 
In the landscape of America’s election technology, Georgia is an outlier in a few ways. Ballot-marking devices are available in most parts of the U.S. — even in places that rely primarily on hand-marked paper ballots, federal law stipulates that all precincts have voting machines that can accommodate voters with disabilities — but Georgia is one of the few places where voters primarily rely on ballot-marking devices. And while most states use a patchwork of different election systems, Georgia settled on one type of equipment to use statewide.


Georgia’s current ballot-marking devices work by having voters select their choices on an electronic touchscreen, which prompts them to print out a paper ballot when they are finished making their selections. Voters then feed the paper ballot into a separate machine that tabulates the election results based on a QR code.
Verified Voting, a nonprofit organization that tracks voting equipment across the U.S., recommends that most voters use hand-marked paper ballots counted by machines, which they see as having the fewest risks and ensure that election officials can verify the outcome of an election after the fact.
“A ballot-marking device is basically a very expensive pen with a mind of its own,” said Mark Lindeman, Verified Voting’s policy and strategy director. Though he said Georgia’s switch to ballot-marking devices in 2019 was an improvement, he added that the machines “will not necessarily do what you tell it to do, so that introduces some complexities and some opportunities for things to go wrong that we would advise minimizing.”
However, he acknowledged that there are times when it makes sense for voters to use ballot-marking devices, particularly when it comes to increasing accessibility.
“We firmly believe that ballot-marking devices should be available for voters who need or prefer to use them,” Lindeman said. “We’re not talking about banning the BMDs, but we’re talking about offering in-person voters the opportunity to hand-mark their paper ballots, and we think that’s a better choice for most voters.”
A partisan flip-flop
When Georgia lawmakers advanced a bill to switch from electronic voting machines to ballot-marking devices in 2019, the legislation, House Bill 316, passed through both chambers largely along party lines.

“House Bill 316 will bring our state to the forefront of election technology,” state Rep. Barry Fleming, a Harlem Republican and lead sponsor of the bill, said at the time. “It builds on the successes of our old system and incorporates the best practices of the modern day.”
Democrats largely opposed the move, arguing that implementing the voting machines was estimated to be five times more expensive than a hand-marked paper ballot system, and would be more vulnerable to hacking and tampering, which could endanger election integrity across the state.
But partisan perceptions of voting equipment began to shift in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential race, when President Donald Trump falsely claimed that the ​​election was stolen from him in Georgia and several other swing states.
Dominion Voting Systems, which has since been acquired by Liberty Vote, became caught up in false claims about the validity of the 2020 election results, with conservative media outlets like Fox News, Newsmax and One America News Network accusing the company of rigging the election in favor of former President Joe Biden. Trump-aligned attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell also claimed that Liberty Vote had conspired to switch votes in Biden’s favor.
Liberty Vote has since received millions of dollars in settlements after filing a series of lawsuits against those who claimed the company conspired to rig the 2020 election.
But in Georgia, the claims have fueled distrust in ballot-marking devices among some voters. Groups of conservative election integrity activists have spent years urging lawmakers and the State Election Board to abandon ballot-marking devices in favor of hand-marked paper ballots. 
Other groups have been pushing for hand-marked ballots for even longer, with a group called the Coalition for Good Governance filing a lawsuit against the state in 2017 to try and force a switch to hand-marked paper ballots ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.
Marilyn Marks, the Coalition for Good Governance’s executive director, said that if a ballot-marking device were hacked during an election, it would be difficult to trace the breach back to its source.
“If you’ve got a problem with the ballot-marking devices, you have no real record of what the voter entered into the touchscreen, so you will never know what exactly went wrong,” she said, arguing that a hand-marked paper ballot system would eliminate that risk.
“Now [the voter] could have made a mistake, they could have voted for the wrong candidate, but that would have been their fault,” she added.
State Sen. Sam Watson, a Moultrie Republican who served as one of the cosponsors of the 2019 voting machine measure, said he has received requests from constituents to consider a hand-marked paper ballot system. 
Sen. Sam Watson. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Watson, who now leads the Senate committee that handles election bills, is also a cosponsor of Senate Bill 214, which would make hand-marked paper ballots the primary voting system across the state.
“Obviously there was a lot that we did not know then,” he said of the switch to ballot-marking devices. The 2020 election was also an unusual time in Georgia history, with record numbers of voters using absentee ballots due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It was a different day, a different time,” Watson added. “Everything’s changed since then.”
The bill, introduced earlier this year by state Sen. Max Burns, would require the state to purchase new equipment, including on-demand ballot printers to dispense the ballots to voters and optical scanning systems to tabulate them.
“You can’t hack a paper ballot,” said Burns, a Sylvania Republican, during a March committee meeting. “You can’t alter a paper ballot. At the end of the day, you have the physical document. You have the physical vote that was cast by the elector, and you can verify [the results].”
Burns’ bill passed through the Senate near the end of the 2025 legislative session with a party-line vote. It remains alive, and could be considered by the House when the Legislature reconvenes in January. Burns did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
But Democrats, who favored a hand-marked paper ballot system in 2019, have criticized Republicans’ push to switch voting systems again before the end of Georgia’s contract with Liberty Vote. The state is currently slated to begin bidding on new voting systems in 2028.
Sen. Sally Harrell, an Atlanta Democrat, said she would support a switch to paper ballots, but noted that the current ballot-marking devices were purchased on a 20-year bond, meaning that the Legislature will continue covering the cost of those machines until the 2040 fiscal year, regardless of what voting equipment is in use.
“We, unfortunately, are still paying for those machines,” she said. “That doesn’t seem fiscally responsible.”
Rep. Jasmine Clark. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
State Rep. Jasmine Clark, a Lilburn Democrat who is running for Congress in 2026, said she preferred paper ballots, but cautioned against switching voting systems right before a high-profile election like the 2026 midterms.
“Every time we change something, you now introduce another layer of insecurity,” Clark said, adding, “I think it’s tough to sell something super brand new in a major election, like the election for all of the statewide offices in Georgia.”
Travis Doss, the executive director of the Richmond County Board of Elections and former president of the Georgia Association of Voter Registration and Election Officials, expressed concern about how counties would pay for election changes implemented by the Legislature.
“Funding is a huge concern,” he said, adding that though the state is responsible for paying for voting equipment, the cost of ballot paper, printer ink and other consumables are shouldered by county elections offices. 
“That would be a huge expense on the counties,” he said.
Doss also worries about the feasibility of implementing new equipment on a short timeline. When Georgia switched to ballot-marking devices in 2019, he said, the transition was a difficult one for election officials.
“We had to be ready to go by March of 2020 — which, of course, we had the three weeks of advanced voting, so we really had to be ready to go by mid-February,” he said. “So there was a lot of hurrying and scrambling and whatnot to make sure that everything was ready for when we had to start voting.”
If Georgia were to completely switch systems again, he said, elections administrators would need a minimum of six months to comfortably implement the new technology. Under that timeline, any changes to Georgia’s voting equipment would need to be finalized by mid-April.
“Not only do we as the elections directors have to be trained on the equipment,” he said, “Then we have to turn around and be able to train staff and poll workers as well.”
2025 legislative updates
Regardless of whether Georgia switches voting systems this year, lawmakers may be forced to update certain recently enacted election laws before the end of the 2026 session.
Under Senate Bill 189, which was signed into law in 2024, QR codes can no longer be used to tabulate ballots after next July.  The QR codes have faced criticism from cybersecurity experts and proponents of hand-marked paper ballots, who say that ballots should be counted based on text that can be deciphered by humans.
“None of us can read the QR code,” Marks from the Coalition for Good Governance said. “The machines tabulate those QR code votes, so we have no way of actually knowing who we are voting for.”

During the 2025 legislative session, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger estimated that updating all the necessary equipment to implement that change will require roughly $66 million in state funds, more than double the $32.5 million estimate that was floated when lawmakers considered the proposal in 2023. The money would be used to fund the purchase of 33,000 new ballot printers, along with new optical scanners and updated memory cards needed to tabulate ballots with human-readable text.
However, lawmakers failed to appropriate the funds before the Legislature adjourned in April.
During the 2025 session, Raffensperger also urged state leaders to prioritize software upgrades in the short term, which he says are more cost-effective than spending millions of dollars in new equipment that may be replaced soon after the 2026 election. 
“In two years, this system’s contract with [Liberty Vote] is up,” he told House lawmakers during a committee meeting in February. “At that point you can then consider, what do we want to do? What does the future system look like?”
Secretary of state spokesperson Robert Sinners said the office would follow the laws put in place by the Legislature, but that Raffensperger maintains his confidence in Georgia’s current election equipment.
“The secretary has been firm on his commitment to Georgia’s voting system,” Sinners said.
And though a loyal contingent of activists has continued to lobby for an immediate switch to paper ballots, other Georgia residents are less convinced that changing voting equipment is necessary. 
A May poll by the Democracy Defense Project, a nonprofit aimed at countering election misinformation, found that nearly four in five Georgia voters who cast ballots in the 2024 general election had moderate or high levels of trust in the integrity of Georgia’s elections ahead of 2026. Additionally, only 27% of those surveyed said they support a switch to paper ballots, while 43% opposed the change.
Georgia voters also expressed skepticism about a switch to paper ballots. Laura Dunn, a 27-year-old Fulton County resident, said she had concerns about voter suppression under a hand-marked paper ballot system.
“If we have a system that’s working effectively for people, and counting votes and making it as easy as possible for everybody and transparent, we don’t need to go back to something like that,” she said. 
Daniel Harmon, a 54-year-old Gwinnett County voter, also expressed skepticism about changing Georgia’s voting equipment.
“That’s stupid,” he said when asked about a potential switch to hand-marked paper ballots. “I understand the concern about fraud, but there hasn’t really been any fraud, so it just slows down the process a lot.”
Raffensperger has also praised the accuracy of Georgia’s current system, which includes audits of all the human-readable text to ensure that it matches the QR-code tabulated votes for every race on the ballot. Out of 87 discrepancies found during the 2024 audit, he added, 86 were on hand-marked absentee ballots.
Republican Rep. Tim Fleming of Covington. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The issue of switching to hand-marked paper ballots has also been a central part of a House “blue-ribbon” committee dedicated to examining Georgia’s election policies. The committee, which is expected to provide policy recommendations ahead of the 2026 legislative session, is headed by Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican who is running for secretary of state.
Lindeman of Verified Voting, who provided testimony to the committee during a September meeting, said that the debate about changing voting equipment in Georgia may come down to a matter of timing.
“The question for Georgia or any state, is not whether to change voting systems, but when to change voting systems,” Lindeman said in an interview. “Because the systems age out, you need to replace them sooner or later. And Georgia is heading towards the end of its contract with Liberty Vote, so it naturally comes to a decision point.”

(Getty Images.)One measure used by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland says there’s a 24% chance that the U.S. economy was in recession last month. But the bank warns that the measure has become less reliable in recent years.
Even so, signs are mounting that if the economy isn’t already in recession, it could be soon, with major banks this fall indicating high odds of it.
The Cleveland Fed and 11 other regions conduct surveys on regional economic conditions eight times a year by questioning businesses, community organizations, economists, and other sources for its Beige Book.
The findings from all 12 regions are used by the Federal Open Market Committee as it sets monetary policy, in part by establishing key interest rates. 
The region represented by the Cleveland Fed includes all of Ohio and adjacent parts of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky.
In its Beige Book report published last month, respondents told the Cleveland Fed that President Donald Trump’s shifting array of tariffs are increasing their costs and forcing them to raise prices.
The reserve bank this week reported that a model using data from the Beige Book found that there was a nearly one-in-four chance that the national economy was already in recession as of last month.

However, it accompanied that with new research showing that the model’s track record had gotten significantly worse since 2021, after a global pandemic took hold.
“We attribute this to the historically unusual nature of the post-pandemic economic expansion and to changes in the drivers of regional economic sentiment,” the report said.
Even so, economic warning signs for Ohio appear to be piling up.
Ohioans’ credit card debt is rising faster than in all but four other states, WalletHub reports. 
And the Buckeye State again had the nation’s fifth-highest unemployment in August, despite years of spending billions on taxpayer-financed incentives to attract jobs.
Yahoo Finance this week reported that hiring across the country “has dramatically slowed.” 
And a Harris Poll conducted for Bloomberg News in late October found that 55% of Americans are worried about losing their jobs. 
That’s not a great sign for a consumer-driven economy as we head into the holiday shopping season.
The news organization Reuters last week reported that, amid the government shutdown, consumer sentiment hit a three-and-a-half year low. And inflation has been on the rise since April.
There are also concerns that the deregulatory zeal of the current administration could produce a result even worse than the meltdowns that paralyzed the economy in 2008 and created the Great Recession.
William A. Birdthistle, a top official at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under former President Joe Biden, last week published a column in the New York Times. It was titled “Trump is Pushing us Toward a Crash. It Could be 1929 All Over Again.” 
The reality might not be as bad as all that, but major banks in September predicted high odds of a recession. 
And some experts raised fears that the Trump tariffs could feed “stagflation” — a period of high inflation and weak economic growth.
As the Cleveland Fed report indicates, it can be devilishly hard to know if we’re currently in a recession, much less predict whether one is coming. 
But the New York Times last week reported that some members of the Trump administration are saying some parts of the economy are already in recession, as they pressure the Federal Reserve to again lower interest rates.

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)When local activist Frank Arcoleo found out over the summer that a data center was coming to his neighborhood in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, he said he was furious. There’d been no votes or public hearings.
The first phase of the data center project under development there only required administrative approval from a few city officials, based on the building permit application and state laws.
“So these data centers are going in, and guess what? The public gets nothing to say about it because the city’s already approved it,” Arcoleo said.
Now, Arcoleo is backing a zoning ordinance under consideration by the Lancaster City Council that aims to ensure residents have a say in the future. The ordinance would require data center projects to undergo a special exception hearing from the city’s zoning hearing board. It would also require data centers to adhere to the city’s noise ordinance and for developers to submit a report detailing the project’s planned electricity and water use for the city to review.
Similar efforts are underway across the country, as municipalities move quickly to enact ordinances about where and how data centers are built. A few communities have turned to ballot measures or lawsuits.
But at the same time, some state lawmakers are rushing to pass legislation that would accelerate the development of data center infrastructure.
Lawmakers fear AI data centers will drive up residents’ power bills

More data centers are being built nationwide to meet the demand for digital services, including power-hungry artificial intelligence systems. Data centers, which house thousands of servers, are able to store and transmit the data required for internet services to work.
The facilities support a digital society and can provide increased tax revenue. Data center advocates argue they also can bring new jobs and other benefits for states and local communities. But residents and local leaders in several localities across the country — including cities in Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, Tennessee, Virginia and other states — are concerned about how the facilities could drive up utility bills and harm the environment.
Lancaster’s residents, including Arcoleo, are worried about the amount of energy required to power data centers — which could drive up electricity rates for the entire city, he said.
“Data centers alone will cause dirty electricity sources — coal-fired plants, diesel-fired plants, natural gas-fired plants — that were due to come offline to stay online because we need every kilowatt of power that exists,” said Arcoleo, a member of the progressive advocacy group Lancaster Stands Up. “That affects me too because it ruins my environment.”
But Pennsylvania’s governor has been working to bring more data centers to the state. In June, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro announced that Amazon was planning to invest at least $20 billion to build data center campuses across Pennsylvania — the largest private sector investment in state history. He’s also pushing proposals to encourage more energy production in the state, which would supply data centers. But critics say parts of his plan would sideline local officials.
‘This is moving so quickly’
Data centers require a great deal of electricity to run, which some state officials worry will drive up electricity demand — and utility bills.
Many data centers also require significant amounts of water to cool their servers. Large data centers can consume up to 5 million gallons of water per day — equivalent to the water use of a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people, according to a report from the Environmental and Energy Study Institute, a nonprofit that provides educational resources to policymakers and the public.
Local leaders and advocates across the country are weighing the potential outcomes in their community. In August, Starwood Digital Ventures submitted plans to New Castle County, Delaware, for a data center project that could consume as much power as 875,000 to almost 1 million homes — nearly twice the 449,000 housing units that exist in the state, according to Spotlight Delaware.
Amazon pulls Louisa County data center proposal after strong resistance

The proposed data center sparked strong opposition from residents at a July town hall, including state House Speaker Melissa Minor-Brown, a Democrat, who organized the event. New Castle County Councilman David Carter was already working on an ordinance that would put up guardrails for data center development in the area.
Under the proposed ordinance, data centers could not be built within 1,000 feet of any residential zoning district. Developers would also be required to coordinate with state regulators to ensure enough water is available to cool the facility’s servers. The ordinance also outlines a decommissioning process for data centers that are no longer in use.
“Most of these concerns are things you can manage and plan for, but this is moving so quickly that I think across the country, most jurisdictions are playing catch-up for their codes to best manage these data centers,” Carter told Stateline.
Currently, Virginia leads the country in data center development. In the absence of state laws, Virginia’s localities began to make their own data center rules.
Earlier this year, local leaders in Loudoun County, Virginia, which has one of the highest concentrations of data centers in the world, amended the county’s zoning ordinance to require data center proposals to go through a public hearing process and get approval from the Board of Supervisors.
Loudoun County officials are looking forward to new data center bills coming out of next year’s legislative session, said Michael Turner, vice chair of the Board of Supervisors. But he added that decisions regarding data center development should ultimately be left to localities.
“The decision for how local communities can use their land has to be left to the local communities,” Turner said. “But there’s no question: There’s rising tension between local community government, and state and federal government, as this high demand for both data and energy is continually rising.”
Meanwhile, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill in May that would have required data center developers and energy utilities to disclose information to local governments on noise and environmental impacts of a proposed project.
In DeKalb County, Georgia, in October, county leaders voted to extend a local ​moratorium on new data center applications until Dec. 16 while local leaders assess the impact of the incoming facilities, according to Decaturish. At the same time, county leadership is considering a zoning amendment that would regulate where data centers can be built, how they are designed and other standards.
Local advocates in other areas of the country are pursuing change through the ballot box or lawsuits. Residents in Augusta Charter Township, Michigan, collected enough signatures for a referendum that would let voters decide on rezoning for a proposed data center. Township leaders believe the new facility will generate tax revenue for the community, but residents are concerned about noise and light pollution and higher electric rates, according to Inside Climate News.
In Doña Ana County, New Mexico, residents and an environmental law group filed two lawsuits that allege county commissioners violated state law by approving a data center project that had an incomplete application. Local advocates and state lawmakers representing the county say the developers’ plan to build a natural gas generating station for the data center would exploit a loophole in a state law that requires utilities to use fully renewable energy resources by 2045, according to Source New Mexico.
Data centers’ demand for electricity brings unprecedented opportunity and challenges

Still, some local leaders welcome data centers in their area. In September, AVAIO Digital, a Connecticut-based data center developer, announced that it had broken ground on a $6 billion data center campus in Brandon, Mississippi, about 15 minutes outside of Jackson.
Shortly after the data center was announced, several concerned residents in Rankin County began a petition demanding that county representatives address concerns about utility bills and pollution.
But Brandon Republican Mayor Butch Lee said he sees the project as an opportunity. As more data centers are built, it will prompt more areas to expand and modernize their electrical grid, he said. Local leaders are also working to ensure that the data center uses recycled water for cooling its systems in an effort to promote conservation practices, he said.
“I don’t see any environmental problems,” Lee said. “I don’t see any water problems. I just see a changing national and global landscape of what the next 100 years is going to be like.”
And John Malone, a principal at AVAIO Digital, said the company wants to commit itself to being good neighbors.
“All of these things work better when you’re good neighbors. And so we get it — this is a big project coming into your community,” Malone said. “Of course, people are going to have questions.”
Pennsylvania pushes
Lancaster’s residents are not alone. Local leaders in two Pennsylvania townships, East Vincent and North Middleton, are considering similar rules that would restrict where data centers can be built and operated.
They would establish a special zoning designation for data centers and require developers to study how the structures could affect the local environment, water supply, traffic patterns and more.
And a new zoning ordinance adopted by West Pennsboro Township in August requires those studies and confirmation from developers that an electricity supplier in the area will be able to supply enough power for a data center to serve new data centers in the area.
In Pennsylvania, developers are advertising data centers as an economic opportunity for the state’s local communities, said Livia Garofalo, a researcher with Data & Society’s Trustworthy Infrastructures team. The nonprofit research institute studies the social implications of data-centric technologies.










For some of these communities who are experiencing economic difficulty … some of these townships are saying, ‘Well, why not?’


– Livia Garofalo, researcher with Data & Society’s Trustworthy Infrastructures team


She said that while some local leaders welcome the potential revenue, others are wary of the major changes data centers have brought to other communities like theirs. A lot of Pennsylvania towns have witnessed the rise and fall of other industries — such as steel and coal — that were said to be good opportunities. Now, they must decide if the data center industry is worth it.
“For some of these communities who are experiencing economic difficulty — especially with a federal shutdown — some of these townships are saying, ‘Well, why not?’” Garofalo said.
Lancaster residents are still trying to understand what the new data center means for the city.
But for Josh Nice, who lives in the city’s Stadium District neighborhood, there’s an “anticipatory grief” — the feeling of worry that comes with an impending loss or change.
“Things like this [data centers] are never designed to benefit communities and working people,” said Nice. “They’re only designed to exploit communities and enrich stakeholders and rich people.”
In Virginia, Turner said he hopes that local communities can work alongside state officials and the federal government in the future to make decisions together.
“All the counties are very concerned about the federal government or the state making broad brush decisions about local land use that can really negatively — and, I mean, negatively — affect local communities,” Turner said.

Republish photo only with original story.)People opposed to a bill that would require Ohio public schools show a video produced by an anti-abortion group about fetal development to students questioned the scientific accuracy of the video and criticized Ohio’s lack of sex education standards.
Ohio House Bill 485, also known as the “Enact Baby Olivia Act,” would require schools to show either the ‘Baby Olivia’ video or a similar video to students every year starting in fifth grade all the way up through twelfth grade beginning with the 2026-27 school year. 
The bill originally required viewing to start in third grade, but an amendment to the bill changed it to fifth grade. 
The three-minute “Meet Baby Olivia” video was produced by Live Action, which advocates against abortion, and it shows fertilization and fetal growth.

“Live Action’s Meet ‘Baby Olivia’ video is not scientifically accurate,” Delia Sosa, a fourth-year medical student, said during her testimony during Thursday’s Ohio House Education Committee.
Seven people testified in person against the bill, which was introduced by Ohio State Rep. Melanie Miller, R–Ashland. Nearly 30 people submitted opponent testimony.
“The ‘Baby Olivia’ video does not accurately depict the timeline of growth and development in utero and there is inaccurate data scattered throughout the video, including that fetuses can survive outside the womb at 20 weeks,” Sosa said. 
“The earliest recorded gestational age to survive outside the womb was 22 weeks.”
Planned Parenthood calls the “Baby Olivia” video “inaccurate, misleading, and manipulative.” 
Planned Parenthood notes that the video counts the embryo’s age from conception, which doctors do not do; claims a fetal heartbeat can be detected at six weeks despite there not being a heart formed and this sound actually an electrical flutter where the heart will later form; and inaccurately displays the look of the embryo, mischaracterizes its activity, and leaves out critical information about at what point it can survive outside the womb. 
Fargo Public Schools in North Dakota reportedly stopped showing the “Baby Olivia” video last year after students discovered information in the video was misleading. 
“They also found that Live Action was unable to provide data regarding the effectiveness of the curriculum and I think that’s an incredibly important piece,” said Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio Public Policy Director Danielle Firsich.
Ohio is one of a handful of states without comprehensive sex education standards taught in schools. 
Ohio’s curriculum stresses abstinence as a general policy and requires some instruction about sexually transmitted infections, according to the Ohio Revised Code. 
“The bill does not require any actual, age-appropriate human growth and development curriculum that would give students the context for concepts related to pregnancy and fetal development,” Abortion Forward Deputy Director Jaime Miracle said. 
“It is most certainly not a substitute for comprehensive, age-appropriate health education that equips students with the information they need to make healthy decisions across their life span.” 
Dr. Nick Denton, an education researcher and teaching professor at the Ohio State University College of Pharmacy, offered some evidence-based alternatives to the bill.
“Provide students with medically accurate information on reproductive health, contraception, and maternal health as part of a family planning curriculum,” Denton said. 
“This empowers informed choices far more effectively than a single video.”
Abortion is legal in Ohio up until fetal viability as determined by a patient’s physician. Ohio voters passed an amendment to the Ohio Constitution in 2023 that added protections to abortion care and reproductive rights to the state’s constitution.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)This fall, Plymouth State University launched a flexible new option: a three-year bachelor’s degree.
Students interested in specific areas of study — including cybersecurity, robotics and automation engineering, small business administration, police studies, and outdoor adventure leadership — can now obtain 96 credits and leave with a full degree. 
“Plymouth State University makes it easier to earn your degree and start your career sooner with less student debt,” reads an announcement on the school’s website. 
It’s the kind of offering that some argue is necessary for New Hampshire colleges. As they battle long-term drops in enrollment, state colleges and universities are hoping closer collaboration with community colleges will increase interest and make obtaining degrees easier. 
But the university system is still reeling from a $35 million — 17.6% — two-year cut to state funds imposed by the Legislature last June in the latest two-year budget, says Catherine Provencher, chancellor of the University System of New Hampshire.
“I’m increasingly concerned about Fiscal Year 2027,” said Provencher, addressing lawmakers on the Public Higher Education Study Committee Wednesday and referring to the fiscal year that begins July 2026. 
“We are reducing the number of faculty. There are some early buyouts offered to faculty. We are reducing the size of our footprint, trying to think fast. Do we sell space? Do we lease space out? Do we demolish space?”
In August, the University of New Hampshire eliminated 36 positions, laying off 23 people, in direct response to the cuts. Next week, Keene State College plans to lay off 17 employees and hire five back at lower salaries, according to the Keene Sentinel.
And colleges across the university system increased tuition by between 2.5% and 4.9% this year, with community college tuition rising by 7%.
The funding crunch is not new: An August analysis by the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute found that New Hampshire continues to provide the lowest amount of state funding per student in the country to its public universities, with an average of $4,629 per student compared to the national average of $11,683. That means state higher education funding falls largely to students — 68% of USNH revenue comes from tuition compared to 39% nationally, according to NHFPI. 
But now, top community college and university system officials are under pressure to address the waning attendance rates and do it with fewer resources. And Provencher says there are no easy levers to get more funding. 
“The market will not bear a tuition increase to cover the difference in state support,” she said Wednesday. 
Enrollment challenges persist. A 2023 annual financial report from the University System of New Hampshire revealed a 13.6% drop in enrollment across all public four-year institutions since 2019, reflecting regional trends. That, Provencher says, is driven by fewer K-12 students in the state, the rising cost of tuition, and the large percentage of New Hampshire students who leave the state for higher education. 
Lawmakers have passed laws to require the two systems to collaborate. In 2022, Gov. Chris Sununu signed House Bill 1530, which established “curricular transfer pathways” to allow community college students direct pipelines to bachelor’s degree programs in state colleges and universities.
And last year, lawmakers passed House Bill 1450, which directed the systems to work together to find ways to increase educational opportunities, grow the workforce pipeline, and streamline costs. 
The goal: to push the systems to find ways to share students.
Responding to that directive, USNH and CCSNH have developed more than 100 such pathways, allowing students to spend two years at a community college and then transfer into a state college or university and spend two more years finishing their bachelor’s degree. 
In a briefing to a legislative oversight committee Wednesday, Provencher and Mark Rubinstein, chancellor of the Community College System of New Hampshire, said 44 additional pathways are in development.
Pursuing a pathway helps students save on tuition and is designed to allow them to advance their degree smoothly, they said.
The systems have launched a “direct admission program” that allows community college students to automatically transfer to certain university system programs if they meet GPA requirements. 
And so far, the closer collaboration appears to have made an impact. Between June 2024 and June 2025, the university system saw a 36% increase in the number of transfers from community college associate’s degree holders. 
The state universities and community colleges are also focused on improving the pipeline from high school to college, officials say, though the rollout is far from universal. 
About 40% of New Hampshire high school students have access to early college programs that allow them to enter community college with significant credits. The goal is to encourage more New Hampshire students to pursue higher education within the state, officials say. 
“However, to optimize these efforts, CCSNH would need to develop another mechanism with more comprehensive reach,” an Oct. 31 joint report from the CCSNH and USNH states. Officials have proposed working with individual school districts or the state Department of Education to improve that pipeline.
“What we’d like to try to do this year is get those communications out to students who have applied to graduate but haven’t necessarily graduated yet, to let them know that there is direct admission,” Rubinstein said. 
Meanwhile, CCSNH says 11,000 New Hampshire high school students took part in a high school dual enrollment course in 2024 to 2025, another way to earn college credits early. Those credits collectively amounted to $14 million in savings, according to the community college system .
Similar efforts are ongoing to help students in Career and Technical Education programs transfer into community college and university programs to more quickly obtain certificates and degrees. And Provencher and Rubinstein say they are working to establish credits for “demonstrated college-level learning competencies that can be accomplished outside of classroom settings.”
But those programs have faced their own funding challenges after the Trump administration cut more than $30 million in funding to two programs intended to make it easier for underprivileged children to attend college: the GEAR UP program and the TRIO program.
“We just had to eliminate those positions — those grants were canceled,” said Provencher. 
Looking to the long term, Rubinstein was optimistic about the institutions’ ability to adapt to continue to attract students.
“I expect that higher education — post-secondary education — will grow, but it’s not going to look like full-time undergraduate students between the ages of 18 and 22 who are on college campuses for that longer time,” he said, “It’s going to be working adults throughout their lifetimes who are coming back and cycling through educational opportunities.”
But for Provencher, the immediate task is to navigate the state funding cuts. 
“We are getting back to the core mission and making decisions necessary to ensure that our student success is not negatively impacted,” she said. “And it’s really hard work.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0850-1024x609.jpg,,,2025-11-17 04:58:46.281711

(Getty Images) An Ohio state lawmaker is trying to ensure people, businesses or developers are held accountable for what they do with artificial intelligence. In effect, his bill aims to outlaw “it wasn’t me, the AI did it” as a legal defense.
State Rep. Thaddeus Clagget, R-Licking County, gets there in part by barring artificial intelligence tools from any form of legal personhood.
Part of that is prohibiting Ohioans from marrying an AI partner, and that part earned Claggett some mockery on The Late Show last month. Host Stephen Colbert teased, “No wonder he’s against technology, his name is 200 years old.”

Claggett took the jokes in stride. But after a committee hearing Wednesday, he pulled out his phone to show a post on social media.
“Just yesterday, in Japan, we have a Japanese woman marries her AI boyfriend, the world’s first AI marriage,” he read. “It’s actually happened, okay?”
Claggett readily acknowledges that’s an “amusing” part of his legislation but says he’s trying to get his arms around something much bigger.
“So, the bill is, it’s trying to define what is sentient and what will forever and always be non-sentient,” Claggett said. “It makes no difference the ability of a donkey to speak, that does not make the donkey a human, okay?”


JUST IN: Japanese woman marries her AI boyfriend, the world’s first human x AI marriage.
— Polymarket (@Polymarket) November 12, 2025


‘Imago dei’
Claggett sees a collision in the not-too-distant future.
The western legal cannon is rooted in judging an individual’s responsibility before the court, but AI developers are busy creating tools that mimic an individual’s consciousness.
There’s a fundamental difference, he insists, between the “imago dei,” or in the image of God, nature of humanity and that of a synthetic intelligence — no matter how well developed.
And Claggett thinks Ohio law needs bright-line distinctions between the two before artificial intelligence is fully integrated into our daily lives.
“Our courts are not yet set up for the intrusion of fake systems that portray human activity,” he said. “We have to have the courts, in a clear (way) say it is the human who transgressed, not some machine that somebody hid behind.”
So yes, Ohio House Bill 469 bars AI systems from getting married, but it also prohibits them from holding a decision-making role within a company or owning property.
To ensure the courts can trace liability to a human actor, any direct or indirect harm caused by an AI tool is the responsibility of the user or the developer.
“Let’s be clear, however,” Claggett said, “we’re not gonna blame these companies, if they’re if their software is correct, we’re not gonna blame them for somebody misusing their software.”
“Again,” he added, “the human is responsible before the court.”
Changes coming
Perhaps unsurprisingly a group called TechNet, which counts several leading AI firms among its members, opposes the legislation.
TechNet says the bill’s definition of AI is too broad, potentially roping in “any data-driven or rules-based software,” and its liability provisions pose “an existential risk” for developers.
“Existing product liability law already covers negligent or defective design,” TechNet claimed. “And HB 469’s new, AI-specific liability structure would only increase uncertainty and litigation risk.”
But a different group, The Alliance for Secure AI, praised the measure.
CEO Brendan Steinhauser said the bill’s liability language “close(s) a dangerous loophole where a corporation could deploy an AI system, have it cause financial or physical harm, and then claim it is not responsible for the actions of its “AI agent.’”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
And jokes aside, the bill’s marriage prohibitions serve an important purpose by preventing an AI tool from making financial or medical decision for a human spouse.
Still, others who think the bill is commendable see room for improvement. Cory Scott who heads up the Center for Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection at Cleveland State University highlighted four changes lawmakers should consider.
Like TechNet, Scott said the AI definition is too broad. Spellcheck and GPS navigation would fit within the current version, for instance.
He also said ordering developers to prioritize safety is too abstract. It would be better to require disclosures about how companies modeled risk during development.
Unlike Technet, Scott explained software generally isn’t covered by product liability laws because it’s not considered tangible personal property.
If lawmakers tweak the language to include software, he admits that scope of liability would present a “significant burden” for any software company.
But it could be truly prohibitive for open-source developers, and he urged lawmakers to provide an exemption.
Lastly, Scott said lawmakers should use ‘consciousness’ rather than ‘sentience’ as the term of art in the bill.

Animals are sentient, he reasoned, “but we would not consider them to be rational decision makers on matters of importance.”
Consciousness on the other hand, conveys “autonomy, reflective thought, self-awareness,” he said.
Scott noted AI companies themselves will likely tout the level of consciousness their tools display in promotional materials.
To protect users as those tools become more lifelike and more ubiquitous, he suggested Ohio lawmakers consider provisions from The GUARD Act in the U.S. Senate.
Among its requirements, AI systems would have to regularly disclose their non-human status, which Scott said, “can help break the illusion of consciousness that can be created by extended use of chatbots.”
Claggett said he’s heard the feedback and amendments are coming.
In particular, he’s planning to work on the definition of artificial intelligence — “to tighten up that language on what we mean, what we don’t mean.”

(Leon Neal/Getty Images).One member of Kansas’ U.S. House delegation has stepped up to demand government accountability in the Jeffrey Epstein case. The other three representatives? 
They’re missing in action.
Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat, has signed onto a discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing files about Epstein, his powerful friends and crimes against teenage girls. Reps. Derek Schmidt, Tracey Mann and Ron Estes, all Republicans, have declined to add their names. They will be on the record soon enough; a vote on the petition appears likely this week.
You don’t have to be a conspiracy theorist to believe that something has gone awry in the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein case.
The deceased financier committed sex crimes and boasted of famous pals, including President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton. Official and journalistic inquiries into his depravity have continued for decades, and documents have trickled out throughout that time. The current administration swept into office promising unprecedented disclosure of case files.
Then the administration abruptly declared there was no news there, with Trump dubbing the affair a “Democrat hoax.”
That sounds, well, suspicious.
The stories keep coming. Earlier this year, we learned about a birthday letter to Epstein bearing Trump’s name (the president denies the signature is his). A tranche of email messages to and from Epstein landed just last week. So forgive me, and folks from across the partisan divide, who believe there’s more to learn about case.
In the House, four Republicans have joined all Democrats  in demanding the government release everything it can. Party leadership has opposed the effort, and Trump has lobbied hard to shut it down. He’s denounced GOP supporters Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie online. Neither have been known for liberal views, to say the least. Administration bigwigs apparently lobbied Rep. Lauren Boebert inside the Situation Room.
One might assume our GOP representatives in Washington, D.C., would be front and center demanding answers and accountability. After all, they come from a party that supposedly highlights both family values and a tough on crime stance.
Yet Schmidt, Mann and Estes haven’t supported the petition. They haven’t spoken up. To me, that looks like a missed opportunity.
Estes’ office at least sent a statement: “Rep. Estes appreciates the good work that the House Oversight Committee has done to provide transparency about this despicable person, including the 20,000 pages of documents that were released this past week. He is reviewing the bill that will come before the House to ensure it provides sufficient transparency while protecting innocent victims.”
I’m sure all of these representatives detest Epstein and find his crimes appalling. I’m sure they all want justice for his victims and to understand how far the corruption went among American elites who curried Epstein’s favor. I’m sure that, given their druthers, they would support any and all efforts to seek the full release of information about the case.
How unfortunate that we live during a time when they face political risk for doing so. They know which way the wind blows, and they have seen Trump’s attacks on Greene and Massie. I’m sure they believe it’s safer to avoid the whole mess and stay in the good graces of their party leader — the same man who once stated Epstein was “a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”
(Trump himself has been accused by nearly 30 women of sexual impropriety. His 2016 campaign for president was nearly derailed by of a tape in which he talked about grabbing women by their genetilia. Diehard Trump supporters  have made their peace with all this, however, so let’s move along.)
The real question of the moment is how Schmidt, Mann and Estes justify their position in this moment, right now. They have to know that their votes, and the votes of their colleagues, will be recorded and reported across the nation.
I reached out repeatedly to the offices of all three men before writing this column. As noted above, I heard back from Estes. Good for him, and good for staff members who check their email messages. I didn’t hear back from Mann or Schmidt. That was especially disappointing given that Mann’s staff insisted three months ago that they were committed to communicating.
Apparently not when it comes to Jeffrey Epstein!
Anyway, I don’t want to think poorly of anyone.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)With October finally coming to an end, last week I changed out my rotation of vampire books on tape for my old favorite podcast: Planet Money. 
Each time I spend an extended amount of time away from this podcast, I return wondering why I had. This time was no exception.
The episode I returned to was focused on a new class of remote workers, this time operating from prisons in Maine. 
During the COVID-19 recession, the rise of remote work led to new opportunities for inmates to take classes and work toward getting high school and college degrees. 
Naturally, the rise in remote opportunities and connections made through education also led to interest in having inmates engage in remote work.
Administrators saw remote work as an opportunity to reduce recidivism by helping reintegrate inmates easier and they also saw it as an opportunity for inmates to make money to pay court fees and restitution to victims and their families.
I should make clear: these are not prison workers making nominal amounts in order to qualify their work as employment. These are inmates making market-clearing wages. 
The compensation was so good that both the inmates asked in the story declined to say how much they made, though one software developer confirmed he was making upwards of $100,000.
These wages go toward taxes, court-ordered restitution, child support, room and board, and what is left after that can be kept by the inmate.
In an era when employers are wringing their hands about talent, Ohio’s incarcerated population is a group of people who do not currently have access to many employment opportunities. 
According to the state of Ohio, nearly 46,000 people are currently incarcerated in Ohio prisons, which equals nearly the entire population of Mansfield.
Of those 46,000 inmates, nearly three-quarters are in minimum- or medium-security prisons. 
But most do not have access to opportunities to work for market wages. 
Standard inmate wages as laid out in the Ohio Administrative Code cap at $24 per month. 
About 1,200 inmates (less than 3% of the total prison population) take part in the Ohio Penal Industries program, which is authorized to pay above the $24 per month limit for employment for workers. 
Of these, it is likely only a few hundred took part in the Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program, which pays market wages, and none took part in remote work.
A report from earlier this year says 40 Maine inmates took part in their Resident Remote Work program. 
That is a little over 2% of Maine’s 1,800 inmates. If a program in Ohio had a similar uptake, that would mean about 1,000 Ohio inmates would be taking part in remote work from prison.
Yes, there are some risks associated with remote work. 
But overall, this program has given an opportunity for inmates in Maine to contribute, develop their human capital, escape the recidivism cycle, at the same time that they earn resources that help pay child support, restitution, court fees and taxes, and for investments in the future and provide support for employers who need them. 
Why shouldn’t Ohio have this opportunity, too?

Falling for a scam can lead to losing money and putting your account and personal information at risk, which can be both time consuming and costly.
Here are some common seasonal scams and tips to help protect yourself:
            •           Missed packages or problems with delivery: Expecting a package? Be cautious of phishing messages through email or text impersonating delivery services like UPS or FedEx with links to view “missed deliveries.” These links may lead to fake sign-in pages or malware-infected sites. Do not respond to messages requesting personal or financial information, including money or cryptocurrency. Be wary of unexpected packages and avoid scanning QR codes, as they may be attempts to steal your information.
            •           Online deals that are too good to be true: When shopping online or on social media, buy only from trusted websites and vendors. If purchasing on a platform or marketplace, stay on the platform to complete transactions and communicate with sellers, as protections often only apply when you use the platform. Use payment methods that offer buyer protection, and never send money to strangers or use Zelle for purchases, especially when you can’t confirm the goods exist.
            •           Phony charities preying on your generosity: The holidays are also a season of giving. Before you donate money, double-check contact and payment information for your charity of choice and watch for text, email or phone call solicitations. Like any other unsolicited message, don’t click on links or open attachments that may contain malware or attempt to steal your information.
“Scammers do not discriminate and can target anyone during this festive season. Don’t let your guard down. Always remember that if something seems off, it likely is. By staying alert and informed, we can protect ourselves and our loved ones from falling victim during this holiday season,” said Darius Kingsley, Head of Consumer Banking Practices at Chase.
Tips to Avoid Scams:
            •           Don’t send money to unknown individuals or for goods or services that you can’t confirm exist.
            •           Be cautious of friendly messages from strangers on social apps. Scammers might try to build trust before asking for money.
            •           If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Watch out for deep discounts or low prices that may be scams.
            •           If you shop on social media marketplaces, never pay using Zelle—it is the same as cash and you may not get back if there is an issue.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)New College of Florida is on its intellectual deathbed.
Once an authority-challenging, free-thinking institution for students passionate about learning, a place where difference was celebrated and creativity encouraged.
Now, it is becoming a third-rate jock school with over-paid administrators and under-achieving freshmen, a casualty of Ron DeSantis’ culture wars.
NCF has announced it “will happily be the first college in America to formally embrace and sign President Trump’s vision for higher education,” a document called the “Compact for Academic Excellence.”
This compact has little to do with “excellence” and everything to do with coercion and control.
Universities must give up their First Amendment rights, as well as their right of free assembly. No more academic freedom: The government can assess the political viewpoints of every professor, administrator, librarian, student, and staff member, and mandate the “protection” of “conservative values.” 
Kind of reminds you of China, where universities are instruments of state communism.
In its legal analysis, the Knight First Amendment Institute says the compact allows the government to “‘transform or abolish’ academic departments” and police every aspect of university life, “empowering the government to determine the approved mix of faculty and student viewpoints and the permissible subjects of academic inquiry.”
If Trump or his minions decide they don’t want anyone teaching climate science or the history of Jim Crow, they can kill those subjects stone dead.
Knight says universities may “develop ‘models and values’ different from those of the Trump administration, but only if they ‘forego federal benefits.’”
Nice little college you got here. Be a shame if the Department of Education had to investigate you for criminal wokeness and snatch back your federal funding.
 ‘Ideological differences’
New College wasn’t on Trump’s initial list of nine (much larger, much more prestigious) universities, including Vanderbilt, Brown, MIT, Dartmouth, and the universities of Pennsylvania, Virginia, Southern California, Arizona, and Texas.
UT-Austin, where an administrator was recently fired for “ideological differences,” issued a statement saying it was “honored” to be on the list and was “enthusiastically” reviewing the compact, probably with a view to signing onto the administration’s demands.
Seven of the others have said a flat “no;” Vanderbilt is a probable “no.”
But New College can’t wait to officially obey in advance. It’s already done most of what Trump’s compact mandates.  
President Richard Corcoran has closed departments, shut down diversity initiatives, and attacked the college’s open, tolerant culture. 
Piles of books on LGBTQ+ issues, feminism, and the Holocaust ended up in a campus Dumpster.
The books were not imposed on students by pinko profs, they belonged to a library run by students.
Something like 40% of faculty have resigned; others have been fired or denied tenure.
Some long-serving teachers have even been insulted on their way out.
Amy Reid, a professor of French and founder of NCF’s now-canceled Gender Studies Program, was denied the title of “emerita” when she left after 30 years of teaching.
Emeritus status is honorary. You don’t get any money for it. It’s just a “thank you for your service.”
Reid was beloved by students and faculty but voted against Richard Corcoran becoming president. He vetoed the honor, citing her letter of resignation in which she wrote, “the New College where I once taught no longer exists.”
He sniffed, “She need not be burdened by further association with it.”
Professor of Music and Latin American Studies Hugo Viera-Vargas had the publications, the performance credits, and the support of distinguished scholars that should have assured tenure.
Yet NCF’s president and Board of Trustees refused to tenure him. Corcoran wouldn’t consider the qualitative data, the letters from grateful undergraduates Viera-Vargas helped publish their work in scholarly journals, or his interdisciplinary approach to the history of the Caribbean. 
 Seriously?
According to Corcoran, Viera-Vargas’ classes were too small, never mind that NCF advertises small class sizes as an educational plus. 
Viera-Vargas taught courses on the African diaspora and how race, gender, and music inform Caribbean society: mainstream academic pursuits in the 21st Century.
But Corcoran said he wants the college to move “toward a more traditional liberal arts institution.”
Ron DeSantis and Richard Corcoran’s hand-picked trustees include Trumpists, business people, lawyers, and academics associated with the rightist Claremont Institute, Hillsdale College  and The Heritage Foundation.
Christopher Rufo, the most notorious of the lot, takes credit for creating the moral panic over Critical Race Theory and perpetrated last year’s hysterical (in both senses) nonsense about Hatian immigrants barbecuing cats on their backyard grills.
Students and faculty are supposed to take this person seriously?
Then there’s the money.
You may recall that the governor, who loses no chance to trash higher education, has set up a Florida DOGE, a Mini-Me version of Elon Musk’s barbarian bros, which is supposed to eradicate what he calls the “ideological study stuff” in colleges and universities and ferret out that good old waste, fraud, and abuse.
You may also recall that Republicans have controlled this state for 30 years and DeSantis has been in office since 2019. 
Maybe he’s a little slow; maybe, as one critic said, it’s not so much “a serious policy effort and more like a bizarre attempt to stay relevant in national politics.”
The money
The governor’s attack-DOGEs found the cost of educating each undergraduate at NCF is close to $90,000 per year.
At the University of Florida, the state’s highest-ranking institution, the per-student cost is $45,000.
NCF’s president is one of the highest-paid in the state system, pulling in $1.3 million a year. 
The president of the University of Florida makes $2 million.
UF has 62,000 students; NCF has 881. 
What do New College students get for this lavish outlay of taxpayer money?
Sports! NCF is spending millions on athletic facilities and athletic scholarships for less-than-stellar students.
The SAT scores of the 2024 class are down 170 points from the pre-Corcoran era.
Here’s what else they get: a degree from a college tanking in the ratings.
Since 2023, NCF has plummeted 59 places.
It doesn’t exactly burnish the college’s reputation when it pulls stupid stunts like inviting actor, provocateur, and famous misogynist Russell Brand, soon to be tried on rape and sexual assault charges, to come and talk free speech.
NCF subsequently thought better of it, although it didn’t cancel him entirely.
He’s being “rescheduled.”
Nor does naming as 2024-25 presidential scholars the likes of Joseph Loconte, a Heritage Foundation fellow, and Bruce Gilley, a big fan of western imperialism.
Leconte is getting paid 165 grand for a year’s residency, while Gilley gets $130,000.
(See waste of money above).
When the Guardian newspaper asked Gilley to comment on his appointment at NCF, he responded in the finest tradition of classical scholarly decorum, saying, “F*** you, you ideological midwit.”
Gilley’s scholarship could be called “eccentric.” He argues colonialism was the best thing that ever happened to India, the Congo, and other benighted Third World hell holes.
Prof. Gilley might want to acquaint himself with the Amritsar Massacre of 1919, in which the British killed at least 1,000 Indians demonstrating in favor of independence.
Fringe academics
Or maybe take a look at the Congo under Belgian King Leopold II.
The place was a slave state, the king’s private rubber company.
At least 10 million died of starvation, disease, famine, and summary execution.
For the past two years, NCF has been pre-emptively dumbing itself down, embracing fringe academics, and suppressing speech it doesn’t like.
The college has even promised to erect a statue of Charlie Kirk.
Given all this, does it really matter if New College signs Trump’s compact?
Will anyone even notice? 
Maybe when the lawsuits begin.
Lawyers of all political stripes say the compact is unconstitutional.
Even the decidedly un-woke American Enterprise Institute is horrified: “For a university to bend to this pressure and sacrifice the academic freedom of its faculty is to abandon constitutive institutional commitments essential to both education and the pursuit of knowledge.”
Here’s the thing: Young people are not empty vessels to be filled up with what Florida’s governor calls “ideological stuff.” Not Marxism, not conservatism, not gender ideology, not historical propaganda.
They do not live in a bubble where everyone is white, Christian, and straight.
Sure, there are Kirk acolytes who want to pretend we can go back to the 1950s when men were men, women were housewives, and people of color knew their place.
But for most students, conservative indoctrination won’t work.
They’ve seen racism; they know the climate is in crisis; they are aware of homophobia and other forms of prejudice.
They live in the 21st Century, not the 19th.
New College will have been destroyed for nothing.

Invest in early-childhood education, equitable housing and providing a living wage.","The role of socioeconomic class on cardiovascular health outcome cannot be overemphasized. A child born to parents with college or advanced degrees will likely live an average of ten years longer than another child in the same city whose parents are without high school diplomas.
In Connecticut, adults with lower educational attainment are significantly more likely to be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. In 2021, the state’s age-adjusted heart-disease death rate was 137.6 per 100,000 — a figure that underscores the structural gap in heart outcomes. Essentially, both hearts are on different trajectories largely due to the difference in socioeconomic status. 
The general school of thought in the United States is that cardiovascular problems are largely ascribed to dietary patterns, lifestyle and to some extent, family history. The unspoken truth however is that the prognosis of cardiovascular health is often set even before a patient’s first appearance in a clinic.
Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Despite advancements in treatment and medical innovation, it is surprising that there is still a rise in the burden of cardiovascular mortality as reported by the American Heart Association. Moreover, this burden is highest among individuals without college degrees. According to research, adults with less education are nearly two times more likely to die from heart disease than those with higher educational attainment. These outcomes represent the impact of social and economic status on health and life expectancy.
Social and economic factors influencing health outcomes have been described by public health researchers as “causes of causes.” As sociologists Bruce Link and Jo Phelan argued, diseases and social gradients are inseparable because resources like education, income, housing and power that significantly impact health are unevenly distributed. There is a direct correlation between socioeconomic status and health outcomes; the more advantages one has, the better access to opportunities to reduce cardiovascular risks. Those without these advantages are victims of food insecurity, unsafe neighborhoods, lack of insurance limiting access to preventive care.
Using blood pressure as a case study, an individual with a college degree is more likely to have health insurance and access to primary health care compared to an individual of the same age without a college degree. The individual with better access to health care benefits from regular screening and early detection of hypertension and other comorbidities. The prognosis of chronic diseases like hypertension is largely dependent on the stage of detection before the commencement of treatment. Another individual, for example, a single mother working two jobs without paid time off may be unwilling to take to take out time to see a doctor due to fear of losing wages or job termination. The longer her blood pressure goes untreated, the more likely she develops cardiovascular complications.
Educational disparities are not just a reflection of individual opportunity, they show how power and policy shape health. Environmental hazards, fast-food outlets and insecurity are more likely to be prevalent in communities with lower average education levels. These stressors play a role in contributing to the prevalence of cardiovascular problems like hypertension because disease processes are influenced by biological and environmental factors. Stressors cause the release of certain hormones like cortisol that play a role in the pathophysiology of hypertension.
The consequences of these disparities are evident here in Connecticut. In New Haven, there is a striking difference in neighborhoods a few miles apart not only in life expectancy but in cardiovascular outcomes. According to the Connecticut Department of Public Health, heart diseases are the top causes of death in the city however, this burden is highest in neighborhoods with lower household income and educational status. This difference is not due to chance, it is as a result of structural disparities, reflecting years of disinvestment and educational inequality—the true heart disease epidemic hiding in plain sight.
This is not to disregard the significant role of personal choices on health outcomes. Diet, exercise and smoking all influence cardiovascular risk and individuals have the responsibility of enforcing lifestyle modifications to improve their outcomes. However, these choices are not made in isolation, they are a reflection of environmental realities and health policies. A neighborhood with sidewalks encourages jogging as opposed to one with a high incidence of gun violence. It’s also easier to purchase and consume vegetables if the nearest grocery store isn’t three bus rides away. It’s easier to educate people about personal choices, however, we shouldn’t blame them for predictable outcomes if those personal choices are systematically limited by their environment.
Moving upstream is an effective strategy if the goal is to reduce the burden of heart disease. This involves investment in early-childhood education, equitable housing policies and guaranteeing living wage. These interventions may not be captured within the scope of preventive cardiology but in reality, offer the most effective heart disease prevention strategy. Further research has shown that for every additional year of education, the risk of heart disease and stroke is lower. This is a reflection of how impactful universal access to quality education can be on cardiovascular health.
Policies will drive the next major breakthrough in cardiovascular health. Expanding access to affordable housing, strengthening living wage laws, investing in early childhood education, and ensuring universal health coverage are the kinds of political reforms that can truly lower heart disease risk. 
We cannot stent our way out of structural inequality. Heart diseases may be measured using anatomical and physiological criteria but they are made in systems.

Wes Moore (D) and House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County). (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) has a difficult, but not insurmountable, path to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts — and it may hinge on the first-term Democratic executive’s ability to win votes in the Senate.
With the House of Delegates apparently on board with the governor, Moore needs to find 24 votes in the 47-member Senate to add Maryland to the list of states redrawing their congressional maps to gain partisan advantage ahead of the 2026 elections. But Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) put his 34-member caucus on record against redistricting on Oct. 28 with a three-page letter outlining a series of arguments against it.
The Moore administration has quietly cast doubt on how much support Ferguson has within his own caucus, and insists the field is constantly shifting. But for now at least, based on interviews with a number of Senate Democrats, Ferguson appears to be on solid footing with a majority of his caucus.
“I think that’s right,” said Sen. Cheryl C. Kagan (D-Montgomery County), vice chair of the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee, of the current state of affairs.
Kagan said she is generally supportive of the idea of drawing maps that eliminate the last Republican congressional district — the congressional map currently favors Democrats, who hold seven of the state’s eight U.S. House seats.
“If I had a magic wand, I would like an eight-to-zero map,” Kagan said.
But she said the state is “supremely unlikely” to contribute toward a national majority for her party, which has to be weighed against the threat of losing one or possibly two seats to Republicans, making Maryland “detrimental to the cause of winning a Democratic majority.”
“There’s an opportunity cost to this issue, because the time that we’re spending debating district lines should more wisely be spent on jobs, economic development, the climate crisis, civil rights, voting rights, health care, education and our budget challenges,” Kagan said. “There are so many public policy issues in front of us. At some point, this feels like a risky distraction.”

While the Republican Caucus also opposes midcycle redistricting, it is the Democratic caucus — which holds a 34-13 advantage in the Senate, and elected Ferguson to lead the body — that will determine the fate of the issue.
Maryland Matters sought interviews with more than 20 rank-and-file Senate Democrats — the bulk of the caucus. Roughly half agreed to an interview, though some asked to not be named. Others either declined an interview or did not respond to a request for comment.
Ferguson’s support — a broad term that includes senators who are merely deferential to their leader — appears to fall within a range of 20-25 of the Democratic Caucus’ 34 members,
A portion of that support comes from nearly a dozen lawmakers who make up his leadership team, including committee chairs and vice chairs.
“Clearly, the Senate does not have a strong desire to do redistricting,” said Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick), who described herself as leaning in support of Ferguson but “keeping an open mind.”
Even those who said they favor midcycle redistricting acknowledge Ferguson’s advantage.
“The caucus members were behind the Senate president with that [Oct. 28] letter,” said Sen. Arthur Ellis (D-Charles). “He didn’t do that on his own, lot of discussions before that.”
But Ellis said events nationally have changed since Ferguson sent that letter three weeks ago.
Democrats, and in many cases their constituents, want to oppose President Donald Trump. But that visceral desire is tempered, for some, by concerns that doing so could backfire and inadvertently give Republicans more congressional seats.
“We have to be very pragmatic and thoughtful as we pursue this,” said Sen. Ben Kramer (D-Montgomery). “I get the emotions that are in play. I understand that there’s a lot of desire to push back on the administration. I’m sure there are places where Maryland can participate in that. I’m just not sure that this issue is one of those where we’re ultimately going to be a player.”
Kramer said he opposes the effort because of the risk of losing seats to Republicans or the courts tossing out new maps.
Ferguson has clear opponents, including Sen. Clarence K. Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel), who filed a bill in August calling for midcycle redistricting. Lam declined to comment for this story, but he isn’t alone.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I’m hoping that we will call a special session to get this done right away,” said Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s). “We cannot let Trump continue to do what he’s doing and let Democrats look weak — as though we’re doing nothing.”
Ellis agreed with Muse.
“So to be honest, we’re taking it serious,” Ellis said. “We thought our one seat wasn’t important — our extra one Republican seat — but obviously it is to the national discussion. So a lot of talk, a lot of movement …. I’m not sure what the end result will be, but there’s a lot of discussion going on right now.”
Ellis said he’s hearing from constituents who are “reaching out to me, like: ‘Hey, join California, join the other states who are doing it.’”
“I have to listen to my constituents, and I believe most of my colleagues believe the same, and so we are able to change our mind,” he said. “And if enough members on the caucus, Democratic caucus, change our minds, then it will happen.”
Ellis said he would vote for redistricting if a bill comes to the floor, but he doubts the issue will reach the full Senate.
“If a bill comes on the floor of the Senate, yes, I’ll vote for it,” he said, before adding, “We don’t bring things on the floor, being a super majority, that’s going to fail.”
Moore could decide to call a special session before the legislature is scheduled to convene in mid-January. The governor convened a five-member redistricting advisory commission, led by U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), that held two meetings last week with a third scheduled Tuesday.
If called back into special session, lawmakers will first have to take up any overrides of Moore vetoes, including his veto of a bill creating a commission to study on reparations.

In his veto message, Moore said the reparations commission would be redundant — ironic, Ellis said, given Moore’s position on the creation of a redistricting panel.
“So why is the redistricting commission good for this thing that he wants to do now, but when we pass the reparations commission, he says it’s a waste of time?” Ellis asked.
Ellis said he looks forward to being able to work on a redistricting effort.
“I also look forward to override his veto of the reparations commission bill,” he said.
A spokesperson for the governor did not respond to a request for comment for this story. But supporters of redistricting have other levers to pull to bring senators to their side.
Moore last week announced the creation of a campaign slate that would focus on supporting and electing Democratic lawmakers supportive of his agenda. Redistricting was not specifically highlighted, but the timing of the announcement came as his redistricting advisory panel was holding its first meeting, angering Democrats in the House and Senate.
National Democrats are entering the fray, too. In a letter last Monday to the General Assembly, Reps. Steny Hoyer (D-4th) and Jamie Raskin (D-8th) lobbied hard for redistricting.
“We can redistrict to make Maryland House seats more competitive in a way that counters the Trump national steamroller, and we believe such an effort can survive any legal attack,” the Congressmen wrote.
Ellis said a call from Hoyer solidified his position.
“We’re not stiff, unyielding, people. I mean, we can be influenced, and we can change our minds, right?” Ellis said.

	Muse said he spoke with the governor’s office about redistricting, and got calls from Hoyer and from Rep. Jim Clyburn (D- S.C.). “I just said that: ‘I’m where you are,'” Muse said.
Ferguson’s letter made much of the potential legal challenges associated with drawing a new map.
A court-drawn map would be an extraordinary, but not without precedent. In 2002, the state’s highest court struck down the state’s legislative districts map with less than a month before the filing deadline for candidates, so the court drew its own map rather than send it back to lawmakers.
The congressional districts approved in 2022 followed a process prescribed by the Maryland Constitution. Because of that, it is not known if the court would feel the same sense of urgency if it struck down a new map.
Unspoken in Ferguson’s letter is the real concern that the court would not redraw the map but send it back to lawmakers with restrictions on how districts are drawn and what can and cannot be considered. Such an order could set an unwanted standard for future redistricting.
Hoyer and Raskin argue that the courts are limited in what they can do.
“While Senator Ferguson is obviously right that there is an element of uncertainty in all litigation, there are some well-established doctrines that courts follow out of deference to the legislature’s constitutional power over redistricting,” Hoyer and Raskin wrote. “Chief among these is the principle that, when a court strikes down a newly elected map as unlawful, the legislature must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to remedy the violation.”
Muse agreed, saying: “Whatever the judges do, we’re the Senate, and we write the laws.”

Moore’s redistricting push comes in response to President Donald Trump’s push to get Republican-led states to redistrict early, with the goal of drawing more GOP-friendly districts, easing the party’s effort to retain its hold on the House of Representatives in 2026.
Trump succeeded in Texas, where Gov. Greg Abbott signed a new map into law in August. But California voters this month approved a new map that has the potential to cancel any gains in Texas.
But Republicans have also redrawn maps in Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio. Notably, court challenges are still underway in many red states.
Maryland has only the one seat in GOP hands that it could try to flip, the Eastern Shore-based 1st District held by Republican Andy Harris. Some argue the 6th District, which encompasses part of Montgomery County and the Western Maryland panhandle, is a competitive district. That seat is held by Democratic Rep. April McClain Delaney.
Sen. Charles E. Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County) said that anger from registered Republicans, who are outnumbered 2-1 by registered Democrats in Maryland, would be justified, if the state were to redraw its maps so that all eight districts lean left.
Sydnor said he’s sympathetic because he fought gerrymandering in his own county, after the county council packed voters of color into two majority-Black districts, which a court later overturned, determining that the map diluted the Black vote.
“I’m particularly sensitive to the feeling of one attempting to disenfranchise you. So, I don’t think it’s the right answer,” Sydnor said of midcycle redistricting.
By comparison, Sen. Mary-Dulany James (D-Harford) said that if a redistricting bill reached the floor in the Senate, her vote would depend on the map in front of her. She believes her district in Harford County, District 34, would be better off in a congressional district of Western Shore counties around Baltimore, not lumped in with the Eastern Shore, as it is today.
“I want to protect Harford County,” James said. “Harford County has been thrown about, and District 34 has been thrown about, in various maps over the years.”
The 1st District, in yellow, is the only one currently held by a Republican in Maryland’s congressional delegation. (Screenshot)
Overall though, James said she thinks redistricting is risky, and “the president of the senate has put his finger on the really great challenges facing Maryland if we were to consider redistricting.”
Other Senate Democrats told Maryland Matters they have yet to make up their minds, including Sen. Ben Brooks (D- Baltimore County).
“Are we talking about something that’s going to make a major difference in Maryland? Or are we talking about something that’s going to make an impact statement nationwide? That’s the conundrum,” Brooks said.
Brooks said he hears varying opinions from his constituents, but plenty of people are in favor, largely because they see Trump’s policies as egregious.
“Because of what’s going on now nationally — the shutdown, even the tearing down of the East Wing. It’s got a lot of people exercised,” Brooks said. “The arresting people who are cutting grass, at Home Depot or at McDonald’s. … All of those things weigh heavily on fairness in the minds of people.”
As legislators weigh their decision, they also must consider the political leanings of their district.
In Anne Arundel County, Stephen A. Tillett, a minister, is challenging Senate Finance Chair Sen. Pamela Beidle in next year’s Democratic primary. Tillett was a featured speaker at a recent State House rally demanding Ferguson pass a redistricting bill.
Sen. Nick Charles (D-Prince George’s) said his constituents seem to broadly support redistricting, so he would feel comfortable voting for it. But he is also weighing the fact that the move could put Democrats in danger of losing a seat or two in the House.
“I can vote for it and the people in my district would love it,” Charles said. “But there’s possibilities that things could happen.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC06141-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 00:57:04.596138

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline) Immigrants and their allies gathered in downtown Raleigh Sunday afternoon to protest the federal Border Patrol’s deployment to Charlotte.
Protestors said it was important to mobilize rapidly and demand that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement leave the state while also standing in defense of immigrant families facing escalating threats.
Ariana Perez said she was marching in Raleigh because she was worried about what might happen to her own parents if a similar crackdown were to occur in the Triangle. She was troubled by social media posts claiming to show Border Patrol tactics in Charlotte.
“I don’t think it’s justified,” Perez said. “They are pushing them out of the cars [to the ground] rather than just talking to them.”
Video shared with WBTV show border agents smashing the driver’s side window of one motorist’s vehicle while allegedly searching for undocumented immigrants. The motorist, who was not arrested and says he is a U.S. citizen, said the federal agents were looking for Latino people, not criminals.
In a statement Saturday, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said, “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed. There have been too many victims of criminal illegal aliens.”
The DHS statement listed several detainees the agency claims have criminal records that make them a threat to the Charlotte community. The agency said it made 81 arrests in Charlotte Saturday. No numbers for Sunday were available at the time of publication.
On Saturday, Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners Chair Mark Jerrell and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education Chair Stephanie Sneed issued a joint statement urging people wishing to demonstrate to do so without resorting to the violence witnessed in other cities.
“Our region has thrived and grown because our strength lies in our diversity and our collective commitment to each other and to this community,” they said in the statement. “Let us all — no matter our political allegiance – stand together for all hard working and law-abiding families.”
While Sunday’s gathering in Raleigh was peaceful, Coco Ferguson, who said she worries for immigrant friends and family, said she hopes that many more North Carolinians will  pay attention and raise their voice in the coming weeks.
“It takes every American citizen to fight ICE and to stop them from what they’re doing,” Ferguson said.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Sunday that she would comply with what she described as “unlawful” court orders to reschedule two special elections for vacant legislative seats.
The announcement came four days after the Arkansas Supreme Court denied Sanders’ request to pause two Pulaski County Circuit Court orders to move the elections, originally scheduled for June 9, to an earlier date while she pursued appeals.
UPDATED: Arkansas Supreme Court rejects request to delay court orders in special election cases

Under the new election schedule, which Sanders wrote was being set “under duress and with objection to the unlawful court order,” both Senate District 26 and House District 70 will have special general elections on March 3, 2026, with the special primary newly set for Jan. 6.
“The court has ruled that I must set special election dates that would give overseas military members insufficient time to vote, violating Arkansas law and potentially invalidating the entire election,” Sanders said in the proclamations. 
“While I object to this ruling, I will comply with the court’s order and remain confident that on appeal, the law plainly giving me the authority to set special elections will be upheld, ensure our elections are free, fair, and secure, and protect the right to vote for our heroes who put their lives on the line to keep us free,” she wrote.
Sanders’ proclamations made no mention of the Supreme Court’s ruling against her request for a stay of those orders.
Sanders set special elections for the Senate District 26 and House District 70 seats for June 9, 2026, after the death of Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch and the resignation of Rep. Carlton Wing of North Little Rock to lead Arkansas PBS in September.
But the June date occurs after the Legislature’s fiscal session in April, which generated bipartisan criticism and lawsuits from SD 26 and HD 70 voters, who said it would deprive them of representation for important legislative deliberations on issues like education and prison funding.
The Democratic Party of Arkansas, which is a plaintiff in the HD 70 lawsuit, issued a statement Sunday night calling Sanders’ decision to move the special elections to March “a huge win for democracy and for representation in Arkansas.”
“This proclamation achieves the goal of our lawsuit — to ensure the 30,000 Arkansans in House District 70 have representation,” DPA Chair retired Col. Marcus Jones said in the statement.
“Pulaski County election officials have previously confirmed they are ready and can assure a secure and fair election,” Jones said.
What the law says
Under Arkansas law, the governor is required to schedule a special election date to fill a vacancy within 150 days unless she finds it “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so. Further, if the election can’t be held within 150 days, the law requires it to be held on the earliest practicable date after that statutory deadline.
A June 9 election would be 252 days after Wing’s Sept. 30 resignation — or 152 days after the 150-day mark. The summer election date would be 280 days  after Stubblefield’s seat became vacant. The average number of days a special election has been held after the 150-day mark since 2011 is about 25 days, according to an unpublished Senate memo.
Circuit judges in both lawsuits sided with the plaintiffs and ordered Sanders to schedule the elections earlier, finding that the June dates were impermissible under state law and the U.S. and Arkansas constitutions, though the reasoning varied between the cases. 
In the HD 70 case, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Shawn Johnson explicitly ordered Sanders to set the general special election for March 3, 2026. In the SD 26 case, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Patricia James said Sanders needed to set it “as soon as practicable” after the 150-day deadline, but did not specify when.
While Sanders said she is complying, she wrote in her proclamations that “the circuit court substituted judicially invented election policy for the General Assembly’s lawfully enacted statutes” and usurped her statutory authority.

Richard Blumenthal spoke at a press conference about permanent housing funding on Friday, Nov. 14, 2025, at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford.

(Photo by Josie Reic /CT Mirror)Chris, a Connecticut resident, struggled with homelessness for years as he battled major depression and HIV.
He stayed at the Mercy Housing and Shelter Corporation and was eventually able to get a job and an apartment, which the organization subsidized. The shelter’s help is the “only reason” he is housed, safe, healthy and “living with dignity” today, he said, speaking at a press conference Friday.
But the Trump administration said late Thursday that it planned to cut federal funding for permanent housing programs like the one that helped Chris, who asked to be identified by only his first name.
In Connecticut, the policy change means long-term housing programs could lose as much as $69 million, risking the housing of 6,500 people, according to estimates from the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness and the CT CAN End Homelessness campaign.
A notice from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development posted Thursday announced changes to what’s known as the Continuum of Care program, which provides most federal homelessness relief funding. Having a disability is a condition to receive permanent housing through Continuum of Care.
According to the notice, the Trump administration plans to lower the cap on permanent housing spending from 90% to 30% of all homelessness relief funding. Instead, funding will flow to programs that provide temporary housing with work requirements, treatment mandates and other conditions.
At the Friday event, held by U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, service providers spoke out against the policy, saying that permanent housing is the most effective, proven method for supporting unhoused people.
For decades, U.S. policy has been guided by a theory, known as “Housing First,” that permanent shelter is a necessary first step for people, who can then — from a more stable living situation — move on to finding health care and steady work.
The Trump administration favors a different approach.
A U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in a press release Thursday, “The failed ‘Housing First’ ideology… encourages dependence on endless government handouts while neglecting to address the root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.” The press release described the policy change as an effort to increase accountability for service providers by creating competition between them for grants.
Louis Gill, CEO of housing aid nonprofit Columbus House, said it’s hard for people to improve their lives without first having permanent housing. “When you destabilize housing, you destabilize everything built upon it: medical care, mental health, sobriety, income, employment, community, and safety,” he said.
Gill added that the Trump administration’s policy change will force people who have already become self sufficient to start over, especially those with disabilities.
“These cuts ask providers to look disabled, medically fragile residents in the eye and tell them that the stability they built, the stability our government promised them through this program, may no longer be within reach,” he said.
Sarah Fox, CEO of the CT Coalition to End Homelessness, said it’s not so simple to rework longstanding programs to comply with the new rules. Providers are set up to supply permanent housing and most grants will now be awarded for temporary housing with strings attached, she said. “It is a big separation from our morals.”
 What comes next

Critics of the new policy said they hope to stop it from going into effect — or find other funding.
Jennifer Paradis, executive director of the Beth-El Center shelter, said she believes the change is illegal. For one, she said, the policy directs funding to programs that help police clear homeless camps and mandate mental health or addiction treatment in exchange for housing.
“Nothing in the law authorizes HUD to require criminalization or treatment compliance as a condition of funding,” Paradis said. She also argued it discriminates against disabled people.
Sen. Blumenthal said he expects there to be lawsuits against the policy.
Blumenthal wants Congress to pass a budget appropriation of $4 billion that specifically requires permanent housing. “It’s on us,” he said.
Connecticut legislators said permanent housing could be funded with some of a $500 million emergency fund they approved on Thursday. Gov. Ned Lamont has discretion over how to use the money, though it’s intended generally to backfill federal funding losses for human services.
State Representative Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon, said she wants to “ensure that that $500 million gets spent, and that some of it gets spent on this.”
But she said that the emergency fund isn’t enough to support permanent housing along with other programs that have lost funding. “Do we honestly believe that that will be enough when we are hearing just the numbers for this one issue?” she said.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)Anna Hill first started listening to Dr. Nirav Shah’s daily pandemic updates in 2020 when he was head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and would tune in every day. At the time, she had to live separately from her husband to take care of her aging mother and was overwhelmed with anxiety about COVID-19. Despite the grim news, those daily updates would soothe her. 
“The first day he came on, I felt like I’ve got a friend,” said the Wells resident. “Even when he was talking about deaths, he was still optimistic and reassuring.” 
That year, she bought a “Dr. Nirav Shah for President” shirt, and her daughter’s Christmas gift to her included a candy bar with Shah’s face on it. When Hill learned that Shah was throwing his hat in the ring for governor earlier this year, her decision of whom to vote for was already made. 
Hill attended Shah’s town hall in Portland on Sunday sporting her “Shah for President” shirt. She started crying when she got the chance to meet him after the event.
“He speaks to everyone in a language they can understand,” she said, explaining what makes him a good candidate. “And if they get scared, he has an answer.”

Shah’s first public town hall, which drew more than 100 people, emphasized his public health experience both in Maine and at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
He also discussed priorities for Maine’s future including housing, health care and affordability, and his criticism of President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — specifically what he described as the federal government’s agenda to withhold health care and food from people who need it the most.
“If Donald Trump wants to adversely affect the rights of any single person in Maine, I pledge to you he will have to go through me first,” Shah said to the room, which burst into prolonged applause.
The 48-year former CDC director told the audience they should ask “no easy questions.” He talked for over an hour about his views on the recent government shutdown, priorities for health care spending and his strategy to address rising marketplace insurance premiums, and thoughts on Maine’s affordability crisis. 
In a crowded Democratic field, Shah is facing several establishment politicians, including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, Former Speaker of the Maine House Hannah Pingree and former Senate President Troy Jackson.
Linda Austin, who attended the town hall, hosted Shah and a small group of people at her Topsham home before he announced his campaign to discuss what his candidacy might look like. 
“I worry he’s entering into a field which at this point in time is ugly, so it’ll be interesting to see how he navigates that,” she said.“Politics may not be his arena, but problem-solving is.”
That’s exactly what Shah emphasized Sunday when asked about his lack of political experience.
After serving in the Biden administration as principal deputy director at the U.S. CDC, Shah returned to Maine this year to teach at Colby College. 
His time leading several large public health agencies has taught him a lot about having tough conversations with people who don’t agree with him, he said. He also highlighted his experience managing large budgets and achieving goals, such as Maine’s high COVID-19 vaccination and booster rates.
“The work is running a really big thing, often in a time of crisis, stress and strain, and communicating with folks about it, and that is the work that I have done for the past 12 years in public service,” Shah said.
“We have lived way too long under the notion that bad things can’t happen in Maine,” Shah said, referring to floods, fires, health care crises and mass violence. “But they have all happened and unfortunately will continue to happen, so the next governor needs to be ready to go when the first crisis hits, and I am ready.”.
Supporters favor Shah’s fact-based approach 
Austin, who is an independent, was won over by Shah’s ideas during that exploratory conversation, and plans to vote for him. So does Falmouth-based physician Dr. James Kirsch. He asked Shah during the town hall about some congressional Democrats agreeing to end the shutdown without securing an extension of the tax credits that lower the cost of coverage purchased through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
“I thought the capitulation and the caving by the Democrats was unconscionable, Shah replied.
“They closed the government for 40 days and got nothing in return.”
He said that food and health care are being used as “political pawns.”
“Washington is broken and we here in Maine are going to have to fend for ourselves,” he said, adding that is “yet another reason why the governor’s race matters so much.”
Kirsch said Shah’s plan to prioritize health spending on primary care, vaccine education and reproductive health are part of the reason he is capable of leading the state in times of increasing costs and uncertainty. Shah has a “human approach,” he said.
Observing how Shah managed the pandemic, Kirsch, who is a physician, said he’s convinced that his lack of political experience won’t count against him. 
“I think that’s one of his strong suits; that he hasn’t been an elected politician,” he said. 
The crowded governor’s field doesn’t matter to Marisa Zalmanis and Erik Sulcs, who attended the event together. Nor does the fact that Shah is not from the state, as they are also both transplants to the state.
“We gravitate towards Dr. Shah because of his confidence, experience and intelligence,” Sulcs said. “Unfortunately those traits aren’t always the ones that will win elections, but that’s why we’re here, to listen to him firsthand.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)President Donald Trump on Sunday called out two Indiana “RINO Senators,” as well as Gov. Mike Braun, for the state’s failure to move forward with redrawing congressional boundaries.
Braun worked behind the scenes for months to garner legislative support and eventually called a special session for a new map. Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray on Friday announced the caucus still doesn’t have the necessary votes and that his chamber would not convene Dec. 1, as planned.
“Very disappointed in Indiana State Senate Republicans, led by RINO Senators Rod Bray and Greg Goode, for not wanting to redistrict their State, allowing the United States Congress to perhaps gain two more Republican seats,” Trump posted to Truth Social on Sunday morning.
“The Democrats have done redistricting for years, often illegally, and all other appropriate Republican States have done it,” he continued. “Because of these two politically correct type ‘gentlemen,’ and a few others, they could be depriving Republicans of a Majority in the House, A VERY BIG DEAL!”
The president has been pushing GOP-led states to change their congressional maps to ensure a Republican U.S. House majority in 2026. Some Democratic-controlled states have responded in kind, moving to add more blue seats.
Trump said “no one” is calling out California, which passed a constitutional amendment in the recent election to pick up five seats, and blamed “weak ‘Republicans'” for causing problems — like “crazy Policies and Ideas that are so bad for America.”
Then, Trump turned his attention to Braun, who has been a vocal supporter of his.
“Also, a friend of mine, Governor Mike Braun, perhaps, is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes. Considering that Mike wouldn’t be Governor without me (Not even close!), is disappointing!” Trump wrote.
He ended his lengthy post by saying any Republican voting against redistricting should face a primary opponent.
“Indiana is a State with strong, smart, and patriotic people. They want us to see our Country WIN, and want to, “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Senators Bray, Goode, and the others to be released to the public later this afternoon, should DO THEIR JOB, AND DO IT NOW! If not, let’s get them out of office, ASAP.”
Thirteen Senate Republicans have announced their support with eight publicly against.
Neither Bray nor Goode — along with 17 other Senate Republicans — have said where they stand on the redistricting proposal.
Bray has repeatedly reported a lack of supportive votes among the 40-member caucus, while Goode recently held a town hall to hear from constituents on redistricting. Not one person spoke in support.

For the past 30 years, it’s been clear: Native American children in Washington state are far more likely to be arrested and jailed than white kids. 
The state’s courts and Washington Department of Youth and Families have acknowledged the justice system continues to hold back Native American youth, funding committees and producing action plans to address racial inequities in the juvenile legal system. Advocates have called for fewer arrests, many of which are discretionary. Lawmakers have demanded more data on juvenile arrests.
Yet the gaps have continually worsened. Data from the nonprofit Sentencing Project and the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention from 2019-23, the most recent available, shows that Native American children in Washington are more than 4.5 times more likely to be incarcerated than their white peers on average, up from 2.7 times more in 2001.
“As long as we’ve looked at data for Washington state, Native youth are much, much more likely to be incarcerated than their white peers,” said Joshua Rovner, a senior research analyst and the former youth policy director for the Sentencing Project, which researches incarceration nationwide.
While all youth of color experience unequal treatment in Washington state’s legal system, the inequities among Native American youth are especially stark, exceeding national averages, particularly for nonviolent offenses.
Indigenous children are significantly more likely to be jailed than their white peers in Washington, especially on the lowest level offenses and nonviolent crimes, Rovner said. Even when youth exit the system, courts are more inclined to send them back if they slip up.
Though there aren’t disparities in arrests and referrals present in every county of the state, the gaps, where they do exist, are so great they have shaped the statewide numbers.
In rural counties like Whitman County, the problems are worse — Native American children there are nearly seven times more likely to be arrested than white children, the largest disparity in the state based on 2023 data.
In Okanogan County, near the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Native American children made up 52% of all juvenile arrests in 2022 despite only 8% of the county’s population being Native American. Colville citizens and lawyers representing those kids say many in the community feel that they are unfairly targeted by state law enforcement — pointing to high rates of discretionary searches of Native American drivers and traffic cameras directed at main roads on and off tribal land.
Even before they’re convicted of a crime, Native American children are 6.4 times more likely to be kept in detention than white children. After being tried in court, they’re 6.1 times more likely to be kept in custody rather than being given opportunities to serve their sentence in the community.
Advocates and those who work alongside young people in the state say the disparities are partly the result of structural racism in the criminal legal system rather than an intrinsic difference in behavior.
“I do not know what the solution is,” said Suzanne Hayden, an attorney with the Clallam County Public Defenders office and the sole attorney in the county who works with youth. “I don’t know how to make it different, unless I, you know, call the judge on his rulings afterwards and say, ‘Well, Your Honor, you were really racist.’”
Seattle lawyer Gabe Galanda, an Indigenous rights attorney, advocate and a citizen of the Round Valley Tribe, said Native Americans in Washington are also frequently unable to afford their own representation, and some Indigenous kids go through the system without the support of a parent or guardian.
“They’re going it alone,” Galanda said.
 Overpoliced

As a teenager, Derrick Belgarde was himself stuck in the revolving door of youth incarceration.
“I spent so much time in (detention), I was in and out, in and out, in and out for probation violations,” said Belgarde.
It took years of fighting the unrelenting beast of alcohol addiction — and the support of a rehab program that understood his culture and needs — for Belgarde to make his way to sobriety.
Now, in both his family and community, he sees how young people who lacked proper help and support during their formative years continue to struggle as adults to break that cycle.
“It was like a machine,” Belgarde said. “And it creates more harm than good.”
For kids trying to get on the right path, jail can start to feel like a never-ending cycle, according to Belgarde, a citizen of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians and executive director at the Chief Seattle Club, a Native American-led housing and support services organization.
Early court involvement is closely linked to broader social and health inequities, research shows. Children drawn into the justice system often face poverty, unstable housing and limited access to mental health support, creating a cycle of disadvantage that persists into adulthood.
Belgarde’s repeated arrests caused rifts between him and his mother, who at one point threatened to sue the court system for disruptions in the family.
“It was ruining the household,” Belgarde said.
Native American children are disproportionately more likely than white kids to get caught up in that system.
Though they’re 2.5 times more likely to be arrested for a violent crime, Indigenous children are seven times as likely to be charged for nonviolent property crimes, according to 2023 data from the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.
Inside a youth prison in Marion County, Oregon, harsh conditions intensified Belgarde’s feelings of isolation and despair.
“It was very traumatizing,” he said. “It was very horrendous, and I can see how other kids probably got very damaged from going in and out of that place.”
Advocates say Native American kids are also disproportionately arrested for charges where officers are not mandated by law to make an arrest, such as for obstruction of justice, which is when a person is accused of hindering or delaying a law enforcement officer in doing their duties. 
“Obstruction [of justice] especially is, I feel, the most abused,” said Allie Steinberg, the diversion workshop coordinator with CHOOSE 180, an organization that provides diversion services to young adults in Pierce and King counties.
She added that overpolicing of communities of color leads to more discretionary arrests.
“Maybe nothing illegal actually happened, but the police officer was like, ‘I don’t like the way that you’re talking to me’ or ‘I’ve had a bad day.’”
Washington’s Department of Children, Youth and Families, which oversees the state’s juvenile incarceration system, faces serious overcrowding and complaints of mistreatment at its juvenile rehabilitation facilities, particularly Green Hill School, the state’s only facility equipped to handle boys and young men between the ages of 16 and 25. In an effort to alleviate overcrowding, the child welfare agency has been regularly transferring some incarcerated young people to minimum-security adult prisons. 
 Higher standards

Indigenous children are not only more likely to enter the justice system than white kids, but data shows Indigenous children have less room for error, even after they’ve been released.
“There have been white kids who go in front of a judge for probation violations, and the kids are saying, ‘Just give me another chance, I can prove this to you,’ and those kinds of things,” Hayden said. “And to my amazement and surprise, the judge will say, ‘OK.’”
But Hayden said this summer she had a Native American client sent back to jail over a probation violation, despite the child writing a three-page letter explaining his situation and promising to improve, which the child’s probation officer refused to read. 
“He wouldn’t even give this kid the respect of reading an incredibly well written, well thought out letter, and just went through a litany of everything this kid has ever done wrong in his life,” she said.
Hayden asked for a week for the kid to demonstrate improvement, but the judge refused. The child was sent back to jail for 30 days.
“As far as I was concerned, the court system had just told this kid, ‘We don’t believe what you have to say. We don’t care how well you say it. We don’t have any hope for you. So go sit in detention,’” Hayden said. “I’m appalled that that just happened. … I was so incensed in court that this guy wouldn’t even read the letter.”
Hayden says the boy received “very little” help with community re-entry
According to 2023 data from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Indigenous juveniles in Washington are nearly 30 times more likely to be sent back to detention over an administrative probation violation, like missing a check-in with their probation officer, than white children. 
Wanda Bertram, communications strategist for the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit research group that advocates against incarceration, said the fact that Washington is jailing children over these violations is striking.
“These aren’t even crimes, right?” Bertram said. “These aren’t reasons for kids to be locked up.”
For Hayden, the court failed to look at the full picture of the child’s case before sending him back to jail, she said. 
“I was very upset at the judge for not giving this kid just a one week bump,” Hayden said. “You know, let him show what he can do in one week — he did it for all the little blue-eyed blondes.”
Despite growing evidence that children, particularly those accused of nonviolent crimes, do better in the future when given alternatives to jail like therapy and anger management, Indigenous children are offered fewer opportunities to do so.
“There’s no outcome where formal court processing does better for these kids,” Rovner said. 
 Starting in schools 

School can be another entry point into the criminal legal system, and Native American students in Washington are suspended and expelled at rates significantly higher than their white peers. Despite reforms aimed at promoting equity, statewide discipline data show a continuing trend of exclusionary practices.
In some districts, like Okanogan County, the connection between truancy and juvenile court is particularly stark. Truancy involves long-term, frequent and unexcused absences from school, and if classroom interventions to improve attendance don’t work, a child can be sent to court for it, at the behest of the school district.
Nearly 41% of truancy cases in the county involve Native American youth, primarily from the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, many of whom face barriers like a lack of transportation to school or mental health support. 
Belgarde was assigned a truancy officer in high school, who checked in on his school attendance and saw he was home by a curfew.
It didn’t work, and he kept struggling with school, skipping classes and feeling isolated. These patterns contribute to higher dropout rates and place Native American youth on a trajectory for greater risk of incarceration later in life. According to Washington’s child welfare agency, dropping out of school triples the likelihood of future involvement in the criminal legal system.
Belgarde dropped out of school himself, started working and became a young father by 18.
“When they let me off, I left home, but I didn’t have nowhere to go,” he said.
Native American children make up 26% of the state’s truant children despite making up around 1% of the school population, and they have the highest rate of truancy cases sent to juvenile court in the state, at roughly 10%.
Many Indigenous families have a historical mistrust of school and state systems based on prior abuses of Indigenous children in residential boarding schools and forced separations of Indigenous families by the federal government. When families don’t appear in court for truancy allegations, children are at risk of being placed under state supervision or referred for formal court charges, deepening their contact with the legal system.
Natalie Welch, a citizen of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and the executive director of Rise Above, a Seattle-based nonprofit dedicated to empowering Native American youth, said that providing Native American children with increased support and community connections helps keep them out of the legal system.
“It’s a smart investment to put this money into helping kids upfront instead of trying to solve the problems on the backend,” Welch said.
Rise Above has partnered with school districts with high rates of truancy among Native American students to provide incentives for kids to show up to class. Her organization works with local businesses, schools and organizations to offer free sports clinics, mentorship and community involvement opportunities. Improving accessibility to such programs, particularly for middle school-aged students who are at a critical stage in their development, is important for avoiding bad behavior, she said.
“We’re trying to be there so they build that trust before anything bad happens,” Welch added.
 Left out of reforms

Advocates for Native Americans say Washington lawmakers should revisit a number of reforms, like considering tribal notifications for Indigenous youth involved in a juvenile court case or addressing specific statutes that youth of color are disproportionately charged with.
Still, data gaps exist that limit the understanding of the true scope of disparities involving Native American youth.
Tribal affiliation isn’t regularly recorded when youth are arrested, and courts aren’t required to alert tribes when their youth enter state court systems. That limits any potential cross-jurisdictional collaboration that could connect Native American youth to tribal resources for mental health, substance use or behavioral issues.
Hayden, the public defender, said that in her experience, tribes can step up to provide resources, like housing support or counseling, for kids in a tough spot.
Race data reported to the state and federal government to track youth in the system is typically collected through self-identification or through law enforcement officials’ estimates, which may undercount Native American youth or lump them into a “multiracial” category.
Washington has enacted broad juvenile justice reforms in recent years like allowing juvenile courts to retain jurisdiction until a person is aged 25 for crimes committed before they turned 18, expanding mandatory diversion for children accused of first-time, low-level offenses and ending the automatic use of juvenile “points” during sentencing, which can increase a child’s time in jail and impact sentencing decisions if they’re later charged as an adult.
But measures to explicitly address the disparities Native American children face in the justice system have been few — and recent efforts to address the inequities stemming from past use of juvenile points have died in the Washington Legislature, despite significant endorsement from advocates and groups representing tribes.
In the 2025 session, House Bill 1274 would have allowed for the resentencing of adults whose sentences were influenced by juvenile points, meaning crimes they committed as youths lengthened their sentence as an adult for a different crime. Tribal officials and advocates say Native American people in Washington are disproportionately impacted by the sentencing practice, which effectively punishes people a second time.
The Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, an organization representing the interests of 54 tribal governments in the Northwest, and the American Civil Liberties Union have repeatedly called on the Legislature to change this process, pointing to how Native Americans are disproportionally impacted.
“Overly long state prison sentences resulting from incorrect choices made by Indigenous persons when they were juveniles diminish their hope for forgiveness, redemption, rehabilitation, return to their families, and reentry into their communities,” according to a 2023 resolution by the group.
Although HB 1324 eliminated the automatic application of juvenile points in 2023,  the bill wasn’t retroactive — leaving around 420 Native American people in the state’s prisons whose sentences were lengthened because of points as of 2023, and later bills to make the law retroactive have failed. That’s unlikely to change anytime soon. Advocates like Galanda say there’s little appetite in Olympia to pass legislation in the coming session that would allow their resentencing due to budget constraints.
Some Washington lawyers who work with Native American clients say the state is missing a critical opportunity to notify tribal governments that their minor citizen is involved in a state court case, which could allow the tribe to intervene with meaningful assistance, like legal, financial or spiritual support. A similar mechanism exists under the Indian Child Welfare Act, but for child custody cases.
“There’s really no good news story here because youth of color are treated more harshly than their white peers whenever the system touches them,” Rovner said.

“The senses are very much intensified. And so too are the experiences between people magnified. I think people are more open,” said John Miller, a photographer who documented hunting camp culture in the Northeast Kingdom.

As a young boy, Ben Osha watched his dad and grandfather head off to the backwoods of Orange County, where his family has maintained property since the 1970s, in search of bucks. 
“I remember always seeing the Johnson Wool red checkered shirts heading out to deer camp and thinking ‘I want to do that,’” he said.  “Magically they come back and they have a racker, and you’re like, ‘Whoa!’”
When he got old enough, Osha, now 24, went from hunting the family farm to joining the men at camp. 
“Going from watching it happen to being included, it’s so much more meaningful,” he said. “Each year you’re granted a little more responsibility.”
In Vermont, where almost 1-in-8 people hunt, the 16-day rifle deer season is a collective experience on par with Town Meeting Day or the emergence of black flies in May. For many, the season is defined by a trip to camp. It’s a ritual and coming of age opportunity passed between generations, sacred to those who spend the weeks reconnecting with family and the mountains. 
Though hunters have had the opportunity to harvest deer with a bow for weeks, rifle season, running Nov. 15-30, is far and away the most popular hunting season of the year. Pickup trucks gather at general stores with deer draped on tailgates. Onlookers gawk at the wide-racked bucks hoisted in the air, guessing the final weight as the scales tick upward. 
For some Vermonters, rifle season is their one annual vacation. Families gather not just for the Thanksgiving holiday but in the woods, disconnected from the internet and inaccessible without four-wheel drive. To better find deer, many pray for snow — a wish Mother Nature seems to have granted this year.

Osha, director of workforce and training for the Vermont branch of the Associated General Contractors, said the joy of camp is in the family connection and the quiet of the woods. Those same qualities, far away from the overstimulation of a noisy job site, make the deer hunting tradition important to many contractors and tradespeople, he said. 
“When you look at the construction season, spring and summer is go go go,” Osha said.“Deer season for a lot of these contractors is a time to mentally recharge and kind of get themselves centered again, because you’re alone. The only person you have to talk to is yourself.”
At camp, that time away is heightened. 
“It’s very surreal: The ability to not only be in the wilderness all day but come back to camp and sleep in the wilderness,” Osha said. 
‘To be a child again’
Hunting culture in Vermont — and the Northeast more broadly — revolves around the tradition of deer camps, setting it apart from other regions of the country. 
The phenomenon has drawn anthropological interest from those interested in the unique annual bonding ritual. 
Growing up in Coventry in the 1950s, photographer John Miller remembers people heading out of villages and off to camp during November. They seemed to him to be drawn into the woods by an almost animal urge that accompanied the changing of the seasons.
In the 1980s and 90s, he returned to the area to photograph and study deer season and its people, transforming his observations into the book, Deer Camp: Last Light in the Northeast Kingdom.
“It’s a time of pause from everyday life, spending so much time in the woods by yourself, listening, observing,” Miller, who lives once again in the Northeast Kingdom, said. “The senses are very much intensified. And so too are the experiences between people magnified. I think people are more open.”
That openness earned Miller invitations into deer camps across the Northeast Kingdom, where he documented the families, the antlers and the outhouses of those two November weeks.

The images and accompanying narrative depicting the camps offered a rare window into these secretive backwoods fraternities of 30 years ago, where most would rather stay mum than tell a reporter which ridge holds the biggest bucks.
Explaining the draw of camp life in his book, Miller found himself enchanted by the same forces that attracted his subjects. 
“I am here for similar reasons: to enjoy companionship in a place and time removed from the everyday, repetitive monotony of home, with its responsibilities and stress. To be a child again, curious, open, frightened, and in good physical condition,” he wrote. 
The deer hunting tradition, Miller contended, is one of independence. 
“People here, hunters, (they) want their young people to learn how to survive and take responsibility for generating food,” he said. “Many of the people I’ve worked with, they hunt, they garden, they freeze, they dry, they fish.”
And even for those that didn’t hunt, the 16-day season did not pass unnoticed in 1980s and 90s, with corners of the state shutting down. Miller recalled having his roof replaced one fall, only to find the workers had covered the half-finished project in plastic and decamped to the woods until the Monday after Thanksgiving, when rifle season was over.   
Today, while some small businesses sign off for those two November weeks, others thrive. Deep in Essex County — the heart of deer camp country — David T. Leidy owns the Lake View Store. The shop sits near the Norton-Averill line, two towns with scarcely more than 100 permanent residents combined.
Between Labor Day and rifle season, Leidy might only see one or two people a day. But that will change starting Saturday.

“It’s almost like a county fair,” Leidy said of deer season and the winter months. “There aren’t many bad moods.”
The Lake View Store serves as a big game reporting station, and Leidy said people come to weigh their deer from as far west as Jay and as far south as Burke. The 16 days brings more company than business — snowmobile season is the real money maker, Leidy said — but he enjoys the tradition of November, as people head up to camp in search of deer. 
“Especially if it’s like a son or a grandson, everyone’s very excited,” Leidy said, describing the weighing process, which he might do 100 times a season.  “And I’m excited right there with them, I can’t help it.”
Central to all of it is snow, which many hunters rely on to track down a buck. 
Asked how important snow is to Essex County’s deer season and his business in the winter months, Leidy laughed: “That’s like saying how important is sunshine to the crops.”
Camp culture wanes — and changes, too 
Though many deer camps live on, Miller, the tradition’s chronicler, said the heritage has declined for a slew of reasons, not least a general decline in Vermonters who hunt. Land and property maintenance are expensive, he said, and some camp owners lost their land leases when thousands of acres of paper company land turned into the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge in Essex County. In other cases, people’s interests changed, according to Miller, or the patriarch of a family died. 
Often, the camps were places for two or three generations of men — warmed by wool and woodstoves — to swap stories, cook and play cards.   
“The nurturing would often take place between a grandfather and a grandson, or an uncle and a nephew,” Miller recalled of the unique intimacy of deer season.  

The male-dominated camp culture is apparent to Cheryl Frank Sullivan, a research assistant professor and entomologist in the University of Vermont’s Department of Agriculture, Landscape, and Environment, who started hunting in college. 
“I’ve never been exposed to the camp culture of hunting, and I’m very envious of that traditional camp culture,” she said. “Historically, and even now, it’s always been very male dominated. I think it’d be really cool if there was a camp of women.”
But Sullivan said that history is changing, and she participates in programs that introduce women to hunting, like Doe Camp Nation.  
Camp or not, Sullivan has found joy and success in deer hunting, harvesting bucks in the Midwest and New England. Deer hunting — particularly bowhunting — is a rare opportunity for her to step away from a busy life. 
“I live, eat, breathe, sleep bowhunting for whitetails,” she said, noting the preparation and scouting that makes the hobby a year-round endeavor.  
Sullivan prefers the challenge of bowhunting, the steps needed to have a deer walk within 30 yards, but she walks the woods with a rifle, too. Already this fall she’s had successful hunts in Illinois and New York, and she plans to hunt Vermont’s rifle season this weekend.  
While coworkers take time off to head for warmer climes, for Sullivan, each fall is marked by multiple “hunt-cations.” 
“I can disconnect from my phone and my computer, and I can just go sit in the woods,“ she said. “It’s really the only place I can go and be left alone.”

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)The Summerlin film studio bill currently under consideration by the Nevada State Legislature is expected to lead the state to a fiscal cliff in 2030, according to a fiscal analysis presented to lawmakers by their nonpartisan staff.
The fiscal projections were discussed during an Assembly committee hearing Thursday and have sparked much debate behind the scenes, but the complete set of numbers have not previously been made available to the public.
A copy shared with the Nevada Current shows that expanding the availability of transferable tax credits for film productions to $120 million per year beginning in 2029 will create a $62.1 million structural deficit for the state in fiscal year 2030.
The state is required to maintain a 5% ending fund balance. Legislative Counsel Bureau analysts project the transferable tax credits would result in the state being $102.6 million short of that requirement in 2030.
Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch, a fierce opponent of the bill who forced a surprise vote that almost killed the film studio bill in the first few hours of the special session, said she believes lawmakers will wind up having to make painful budget cuts in a few short years.
Nevada Legislative Counsel Bureau fiscal projections
The Legislative Counsel Bureau is the nonpartisan staff of the Legislature. They do not advocate for or against bills, which lawmakers often see as lending them credence over lobbyists and paid consultants pitching the project.
A separate analysis commissioned by supporters of the film studio project found that for every $1 of transferable tax credits the state received just 22 cents back in direct revenue.
Such fiscal analyses are driving much of the opposition to the bill, which is expected to be voted on by the full Assembly on Sunday.
On Saturday, Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, the chamber’s majority leader and a sponsor of the studio bill, made a motion to declare AB5 an emergency measure. That would have allowed the chamber to immediately vote on the bill and send it to the state Senate for consideration. That motion needed to pass with a two-thirds majority and failed 26-16.
Despite the potential to majorly impact the state budget, the film studio bill only needs a simple majority to pass because it does not raise revenue.
A vote on a previous version of the film studio bill passed the Assembly 22-20 in the final days of the 2025 Legislative Session.
Getting and spending
The Legislative Counsel Bureau’s projection that the state is headed toward a fiscal cliff if it passes the film studio bill assumes that both state spending and state revenues increase by 3% every year.
If state revenues overperform, or if the state spends less, a fiscal cliff could be avoided. A table compiled by LCB shows that if state revenue grew by 4% and spending remained at 3%, there would be a $142.5 million surplus for the state.
Nevada Legislative Counsel Bureau state revenue and spending projections.
Without the massive expansion of the film tax credit program, the state is projected to have a $57.9 million structural surplus in 2030.
LCB staff told lawmakers during the Assembly committee hearing that over the past eight years state spending averaged 5.3%.
But that average includes the “unprecedented” cost of living adjustments for state employees made in 2024 and 2025. In those years, the expenditure growth rate was in the double digits.
With those fiscal years removed as outliers, the average expenditure growth rate was 2.9%.
Opponents of the bill argue that the state is facing additional expenditures as a result of federal policy changes, particularly to major programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
As for state revenue growth, LCB staff told lawmakers the eight-year average was 5.7%.
But that includes the post-pandemic fiscal year 2022, which had an expenditure growth rate of 22%. If you exclude that as an outlier, the average of the other seven most recent years is 3.4%.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC08352-scaled-e1763298711940-1024x602.jpg,,,2025-11-16 08:56:30.875796

Nevada lawmakers responded Saturday by unanimously passing legislation to create a state program that would temporarily support nearly 500,000 Nevadans who depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the event of another shutdown. 
The bill, SB 3, establishes the Silver State General Assistance Program under the Division of Social Services which would allow the state to quickly divert general funds to cover lapses in federally funded public assistance programs.
It was the first Senate bill to make it out of both chambers of the legislature during a jam-packed special session. The bill passed unanimously in both the Senate and the Assembly, and will now head to Gov. Joe Lombardo’s desk for final approval.
“Federal shutdowns and federal program disruptions are no longer hypothetical,” said Democratic Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro during a committee hearing on the bill. “I believe that this is not the first time that we will see this sort of political gamesmanship result in damage to Nevada’s families, and we have to be in a position where we can respond quickly and efficiently.”
Similar programs in other states allowed them to respond more quickly to the withholding of SNAP benefits by the Trump administration. 
“About half of U.S. states have general assistance programs. We did not have one. We had never needed one until this crisis hit,” said Robert Thompson, administrator for the Division of Social Services.
The program would only be triggered under strict conditions, including a gubernatorial declaration of an “extraordinary circumstance.” The state program would determine eligibility and distribute funds using data from existing means-tested public assistance programs like SNAP, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
Debbie Reynolds, deputy chief of staff to Gov. Lombardo, emphasized the program would only provide temporary aid to supplement lapses in federal funding for public assistance programs like the one created by the record-breaking federal shutdown. 
“The intent of this proposal is not to create a permanent entitlement program. It’s not to duplicate federal programs. It’s to ensure that it has a lawful and operational bridge when federal or other aid systems fail that can be implemented quickly,” Reynolds said. 
During the shutdown, the Trump administration refused to use available contingency funds set aside by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for emergencies to fund SNAP, even though those funds could have covered about half of the $8 billion needed for November benefits.
It was the first time in the program’s 60-year history that contingency funds were not used to ensure that SNAP benefits continue without interruption.
Congressional lawmakers sent a letter to Lombardo urging the governor to do more to ensure Nevadans received SNAP benefits during the prolonged government shutdown, including holding a special session to use state funding to hold up the program. 
The Trump administration told Nevada officials it was against federal regulations for the state to tap into the personal data from the SNAP program to provide substitute cash assistance because the state does not have an existing general cash assistance program at the state level.
“With this bill we will be able to access – for lack of a better term – our own data. We had the data, we just did not have a legal authorization to use the data,” Thompson said.
Without a dedicated general assistance program the governor and legislators responded to the lapse in SNAP funding by quickly funneling nearly $40 million in emergency aid to local food banks in hopes fewer Nevadans would go hungry.
Food bank operators warned lawmakers that the charitable food sector would not have the capacity to fill the hole left by disruptions to SNAP funding. For every meal that food banks provide, SNAP provides nine.

BESSEMER — When Yale biologist Thomas Near and members of his research team visited the Yellowhammer State in October, the state’s famous Dreamland BBQ wasn’t the only thing on the agenda, though it was high on the list.
During their trip, the researchers documented the existence of the Birmingham darter, a newly identified fish species, just downstream of the site of a proposed 4.5 million square foot hyperscale data center, the construction of which Near said would put the already imperiled species at risk of extinction.
On Thursday, based in part on Near’s research, the Center for Biological Diversity, a national environmental nonprofit, filed a petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service asking that the agency list the Birmingham darter as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act, providing the fish the legal protections experts have said its precarious existential position demands. The federal agency has 90 days to respond to the nonprofit’s petition and decide “whether the petition presents substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted.”

Developers of the proposed data center have previously asserted that the species is not present on its project site, though neither council members nor the project’s developers have publicly released any environmental assessments related to the project.
The Bessemer City Council is scheduled to vote on final approval of Project Marvel on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
A representative of the developer did not respond to a request for comment on this story.
The presence of the darter is not the only problem ahead for those behind the project. The director of the Alabama Department of Transportation has notified the engineers of the data center proposal, known as Project Marvel, that the current plans for the data center campus conflict with plans for the Northern Beltline, a multi-billion dollar highway project that state and federal officials have pushed for years.
These updates—on both the Birmingham darter and the Northern Beltline—present potential obstacles for Logistic Land Investment, LLC, the developer pushing the data center project, and provide a potential lifeline for nearby residents, who are almost universally opposed to the massive construction project slated for their backyards.

‘All fecal matter rolls downhill’

Near is no stranger to the Birmingham darter. He was part of theresearch team that first identified the small, colorful fish as a species distinct from other, similar species that live in the surrounding areas of north-central Alabama.
Now, Near said he and his colleagues have done the necessary field work to show that the fish, scientific name Etheostoma birminghamense, is present in Little Blue Creek, which flows through the site of the proposed hyperscale data center in Bessemer, a suburb just southwest of Birmingham.
“They’re there,” Near said of the Birmingham darter on Monday. “And anything that happens upstream is going to have an effect on them.”

Near and his colleagues were unable to visit the data center site itself, which is privately owned, but the biologist said there’s little doubt that if the development moves forward, it could put the newly identified species at risk of extinction.
“It’s a crude saying, but all fecal matter rolls downhill,” Near said. “Every impact on the headwaters of Little Blue Creek will have impacts downstream.”
Given what is known about data center construction and operations, Near said, those impacts could include increased turbidity from construction and thermal pollution—an increase in the temperature of the stream that could completely extirpate the population of darters the researchers have now documented in Little Blue Creek.
In a previous interview with Inside Climate News, Near said the data center’s construction would “nuke” Little Blue Creek. “My assessment remains the same,” he said Monday. “And now it’s bolstered by the validation that the species indeed occurs in the creek.”
It’s also possible, Near said, that construction of the data center campus, slated to include 18 buildings, each the size of a Walmart Supercenter, could also put species like the watercress darter, already listed as endangered under federal law, at risk. Part of that risk comes from the possibility that developers may “dewater” aquifers beneath the site in order to level and stabilize the land for construction, Near said.
There’s a lot we don’t know about the data center, Near added, given the lack of transparency from developers and public officials alike. Bessemer’s mayor and city attorney, as well as at least one taxpayer-funded economic development staffer, have signed non-disclosure agreements related to the project.
“It’s shocking,” Near said. “I never fathomed a public servant could be beholden to a non-disclosure agreement. It’s just distasteful.”
Near said he accepts that there are cases where development that “improves the human condition” can be put ahead of the goal of preserving biodiversity: “This just doesn’t seem to be one of those cases.”
The Center for Biological Diversity’s petition requesting endangered status for the Birmingham darter is based in part on Near’s findings and on Inside Climate News’ reporting. The fish currently lacks protection because it has only been identified as a distinct species in the last few years.
Will Harlan, Southeast director for the nonprofit, said that listing the fish as endangered under federal law is critical to preventing the darter’s extinction.
“These phenomenal fish will slide further toward extinction if this data center is built, so we have to act fast,” Harlan said. “They’ve been swimming in these creeks for millions of years, but without immediate protections, they’ll disappear forever.”
The petition outlines the threats to the darter, including the proposed data center, and also points to a 2025 draft assessment by Alabama officials placing the Birmingham darter in its P1 category of “highest conservation concern,” meaning the fish is “critically imperiled and at risk of extinction or extirpation.”

Charles Miller, policy director at the Alabama Rivers Alliance, a statewide environmental organization, said it’s unfortunate that a newly identified species like the darter is already facing a threat to its existence.
“The fact that this and several other rare darter species found only in Alabama, were first described this year is a stark reminder that we are still uncovering the depth of world-class aquatic biodiversity in our state,” he said. “Protecting this irreplicable natural legacy will benefit Alabamians for far longer than allowing out-of-state developers to make a quick buck.”
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not respond to a request for comment on the petition.

A road to nowhere?

In a Nov. 4 letter to data center developer Brad Kaaber, ALDOT Director John Cooper said the data center project “appears to conflict with the planned alignment and interchange location for the Birmingham North Beltline and its connection to Interstate 459.”
Cooper said in the letter that ALDOT recognized the data center project “represents a major opportunity” for new jobs and tax revenue and believes the two projects could coexist if modifications were made.
“While proceeding with development on this site as proposed would create serious challenges for the eventual construction of the Beltline interchange, we believe your development can be planned in such a way as not to conflict with the Beltline,” Cooper wrote.

ALDOT also sent copies of the letter to several local and county officials and the text was widely circulated on social media.
A spokesman for ALDOT confirmed the authenticity of the letter, but said the department had no additional comment on whether it had begun discussions with the developers or whether ALDOT could or would stop the data center project if the conflicts could not be resolved.
The Birmingham Northern Beltline is a planned 52-mile semicircle through sparsely populated areas north and west of Birmingham. The project has been in the planning phase since the 1990s and has generated much controversy from people who call it a massively expensive “road to nowhere” that will do little to solve the area’s most pressing traffic problems.
The highway will also carry a huge environmental cost. The beltline, as currently designed, will cut through huge swaths of hilly, undeveloped forest land, including dozens of river or stream crossings. The first segment involved cutting through a forested hilltop and building massive bridge pilings over stream banks below.
“The entire beltline is 52 miles, and it’s going through some of the most scenic, beautiful mountains in Alabama,” Sarah Stokes, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said last year. “It is going to destroy over 3,000 football fields worth of forest and cross and permanently alter the Black Warrior and Cahaba River tributaries in 90 different places.”
The Birmingham area relies on those rivers for its drinking water, and environmental advocates say the woodlands surrounding the streams provide natural filtration for the city’s drinking water, as well as providing habitat for numerous endangered species.
The Project Marvel data center, a $14.5 billion project according to developers, would likely be completed decades before the Northern Beltline reached it, if at all. The beltline construction began in the northeast segment of the route and will wrap around counter-clockwise toward the Bessemer data center, slated to be located at its western endpoint.
Miller said that ultimately, both the data center and the Northern Beltline pose serious risks to the environment. The difference, he said, is simply their vastly different timelines.
“The lower Valley Creek watershed was already facing a threat decades in the future from the Northern Beltline, but this hyperscale data center poses an imminent threat to the Birmingham darter population in Little Blue Creek,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Birmingham-darter-fish-for-Nov-16-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-16 08:56:30.875796

(Photo courtesy of Blavatnik Awards)The son of a Yankton truck driver took the stage last month at the American Museum of Natural History in New York to accept a $250,000 award for his pioneering work in polymer chemistry.
Frank Leibfarth said his formative South Dakota years helped set him on the path to that stage.
The Blavatnik National Award is the world’s largest unrestricted monetary prize — meaning winners can spend the money on whatever they’d like — for the scientific community. The 41-year-old Leibfarth was chosen as a Blavatnik Chemical Sciences Laureate, one of three people 42 and younger awarded the title by an independent jury of scientists. The field of contenders began with 310 people, representing 161 academic institutions, 18 of whom were chosen as finalists.

Leibfarth is the Royce Murray distinguished term professor of chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He and his team have created technology that can turn the planet’s most commonly discarded plastics into high-value industrial materials. They’ve also created a more effective filter for trapping and removing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances — PFAS, or “forever chemicals” — from municipal water supplies, and put it to use for one of North Carolina’s most polluted water sources.
In a recent interview with South Dakota Searchlight, the University of South Dakota graduate and former kicker for the Coyote football team talked about how his upbringing prepared him to step outside the cultural mores of Ivy League research and chase his curiosity as a top-tier scientist.
The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
How did you wind up in chemistry?
Neither of my parents have a four-year degree, so their goal was always for me just to go to college. I would say in high school I never found my passion. After my sophomore year in college, I took organic chemistry and really loved it. It answered a lot of the questions I had about biology, those molecular-level questions about why some things happen.
I ended up doing a research project at a National Science Foundation-funded program in New York City, at Columbia University. I feel like I was very presumptuous at the time. I said to my professor, “Hey, I really like this organic chemistry. I would love to do research in it, and I would also love to travel. But my family doesn’t have money to let me travel, so I need it to be paid for. Also, I’d like to go out of state.”
Luckily, the NSF had programs that allow you to do exactly that. I applied to 10 of them, got rejected by nine of them, but got into the best one.
So the Columbia experience opened the door for a kid from Yankton whose parents didn’t go to college to become a Ph.D. working on our PFAS problem?
Yeah, I would say that, but I’m also a product of USD. It’s a very good state institution. It allowed me to do lots of different things. I was on the varsity football team, but I also could participate in high-level science. There were people who identified my trajectory early on and gave me quite a bit of individual mentoring.
I contrast that with this world of people who have Ivy League educations, who I interact with now on a day-to-day basis. When you’re in that kind of situation early on, you develop a sense for what’s allowed and what’s not within the academic structure. In some ways, because I was not a part of that, I didn’t know what unwritten rules I was breaking along the way. It allowed me to have a little more creative freedom. I feel like I was able to follow my gut a little more than some of the people who’d grown up in that atmosphere.
What drew you to PFAS and microplastics, to making new things out of our waste?
I really liked the idea of making things, partially because of my dad. He was a truck driver, but he always had a second job where he would refinish basements and things, because he was also a carpenter. I always worked with him and I enjoyed making things with my hands.
Plastics were great, because I would make things and get to hold them after I was done. I could pull them and push them and see what properties they had. That’s what drew me early on. And once I started working in that area, it was very clear to me, and honestly to the whole field, that the sustainability crisis and plastics needed urgent solutions.
Tell us about your work in what you call ‘upcycling’ plastic.
The key challenge is we’re worst at recycling the plastics we make the most of, two related plastics called polyethylene and polypropylene. Polyethylene is like what your milk jug is made out of. Polypropylene is more like the outside of your car, your harder plastic. In two days, we can fill up a football stadium with the amount of these plastics we make in the world.
Q&A: Award-winning SDSU researcher calls his lab a ‘security checkpoint’ for animal diseases

The number and scale of the factories that are already installed to make this stuff is going to be effectively impossible to supplant. So I thought, could we create better recycling technology for that class of plastics? Our idea was to take all the plastic waste that is generated, and to be able to do this chemical process to it, which makes the products of that process more valuable than the original material was. That’s why we call it upcycling.
What gives it its higher value? What’s it used for?
We can take polyethylene, or a milk jug, and turn it into a really durable material that typically is used for high-end plumbing piping, or the outside of really high voltage wires. If you have a new home, it’s the piping that goes from your hot water heater around your house, because copper got too expensive.
We were also able to turn mixed plastic waste into a really tough material that’s typically used as the second layer in a golf ball. That material is pretty unique. So again, if you can make it from waste, there’s a lot of value there.
The key is to be a revenue stream for recycling centers, because currently, recycling plastic is an economically losing proposition.
What can you tell us about your work with PFAS?
That was born out of problems in North Carolina. It was found in 2017 that the Cape Fear River had really high levels of PFAs, and the Cape Fear River feeds the third largest town in our state, Wilmington, North Carolina. A senator from the state Legislature came to our faculty meeting — which is a very odd thing that never happens — and essentially said, “Hey, we recognize this problem.”
I had an idea about how we could remove it from water better than current technologies. I worked on it for two years in our lab, did a small research project, published a paper, and we kind of thought that was going to be the end of it. But when the results came out, we got a call from the state senator. That initiated discussions with a whole group of legislators, and in the 2021-2022 budget cycle, they allocated $10 million to start what we call the NC Pure Center. Our legislative remit was to develop new materials that remove PFAS from water, scale them up and test them in at least three municipal water treatment plants.
How does the technology work?
What we developed is like what’s used in a Brita filter that goes in your fridge. It’s a material that you pack in a column and flow water through it. The water going into that column has PFAS in it. Our material adsorbs or soaks up the PFAS, and the water coming out should be clean. You can have the same amount of material, and it’ll work 35% longer, compared to current technology.
The EPA set regulations for PFAS about a year and a half ago. It’s estimated that there’s over 6,000 treatment plants in the country that are going to have to implement treatment. So our technologies are one option.
What do you plan to do with the proceeds of your award?
The piece of the puzzle we haven’t yet put into place is to get what we make in our lab into the hands of real people to make them healthier and able to live more sustainably. I want to use the unrestricted funding to help push that forward, and in the process learn how to do it so I can repeat the process throughout my career and make the largest positive impact possible.
What do you want to see change as a result of what you’re doing in this area, 50 years from now? 
If my sole job was running a company, my goal would be to run that company well, to make money for the company. And hopefully a byproduct of that would be the sustainability aspect. But since my primary job is in education, my main output is education. If I can educate 50 people, 80 people who can do a similar type of work, that impact can be magnified many times.
Can you talk a little bit about the importance of federal funding for science from that point of view?
The federal government has in the past been really generous with science funding, but also it’s a drop in the bucket. A large pharma company spends more per year in research and development than the entire U.S. budget for science. But a lot of the initial ideas for the innovations that come out of the U.S. that support our economy, make better medicines, make our world more sustainable, those start in academia because of the funding provided by these federal organizations. We’re the ones who can think 10 years out, 20 years out. A pharma company or a chemical company has to think about their next quarter’s profit, their next year, their next two years.
That’s always been the balance that has really kept the U.S. at the forefront of innovation. If we compromise that funding on either end, we’re going to really compromise this delicate balance. Cutting science funding now is going to hurt our economy tremendously in five or 10 years. There’s no way to get around that.

Crossing Yellowstone National Park's protective boundary, an apex predator becomes prey. These wolves don't last long in the modern Mountain West.
The post What happens when wolves leave Yellowstone appeared first on WyoFile .","If not for a series of tones broadcasting her location, no one would’ve known she had died.
Like dozens of other Yellowstone National Park wolves involved in a three-decade-long study, researchers collared wolf 1331F as a pup in 2021 to track her movements. Gray with ribbons of brown fur fading into her pale muzzle and legs, the young wolf lived with the Wapiti Lake Pack, one of the largest in Yellowstone. 
Wildlife photographer V.C. Wald watched 1331 supervise black wolf pups hunting a wounded bison on the shore of the Gibbon River in the winter of 2023-’24. Easily visible from the road, the pups tried to take the bison head-on, only to scatter as it bluff charged. Then, 1331 demonstrated how to approach the massive ungulate more safely from behind, nipping at its hind quarters, Wald recalls, “[she was] a teacher, of young wolves, and of me.”

The scene isn’t out of the ordinary for the Wapiti Lake Pack, whose territory encompasses Yellowstone’s sagebrush-covered Hayden Valley in the center of the park. They chase elk and bison. They play and sun themselves on cold winter days. Much of this activity occurs under the gaze of humans. But every now and then, pack members leave the park. 
In late 2024, Yellowstone Wolf Project telemetry data suggest 1331 started a journey away from her pack. She headed north. First, she spent time around Mammoth Hot Springs. Then she crossed the park’s boundary into Montana. While tourists often lined roads to watch 1331 and her packmates inside the park, wolf watchers are sparser in the rugged and mountainous mix of public and private land just north of Yellowstone. Wolf 1331 had no way of knowing, but she’d crossed an invisible line where the national park gives way to state rule. It’s a consequential threshold: Wolves are protected from hunting on one side, but can be legally killed by gun, trap or snare on the other. 
Park officials don’t know if 1331 was permanently leaving her pack or if she would have eventually returned to Wapiti Lake’s territory; it’s not uncommon for female wolves of her age to disperse for days or even weeks leading up to breeding season in February — sort of a lupine rumspringa. But they do know she’d left the pack far behind. On Jan. 24, 2025, staff with the Yellowstone Wolf Project drove north of the park, wielding bulky telemetry equipment to listen for collared elk and wolves. They heard 1331’s signal, indicating she’d moved farther into Montana than ever. But, the beeps suggested, she hadn’t budged in at least 12 hours. 
Park staff turned the information over to Montana’s fish and game agency. Wolf 1331 would ultimately be found dead in a trap set by a prolific wolf hunter who manages a large ranch about 10 miles north of Yellowstone. The man who trapped 1331 would receive a warning for violating state trap-check laws and no other punishment. Her journey had come to an end roughly a month after it began. 
The Yellowstone bubble
Wolf 1331F’s fate was unusual only in that she made it so far north. When wolves leave the park, they die — often, quickly.
Yellowstone’s roughly 100 wolves are among the most famous and beloved in the world, attracting throngs of wolf-admiring tourists who spend tens of millions of dollars in the region every year. However, protected by federal law and tolerant of their adoring fans, Yellowstone wolves are uniquely vulnerable to hunters and trappers in surrounding states where killing wolves is legal. Their destinies are often shaped by which of the three surrounding state boundaries they cross.

“When we look at the fate of collared wolves that leave Yellowstone, most commonly they don’t survive the next hunting season,” Yellowstone Wolf Project leader Dan Stahler said in a May 2024 interview.  
Heading into Wyoming, wolves encounter wilderness and tightly controlled hunts, but greater danger beyond. Step into Idaho and it’s a free-fire zone, though few wolves go that way. Journeys north into Montana are the most common and have proven the most deadly, despite some state efforts to take it easy on park wolves.    
Yellowstone’s wolves die from hunting and trapping outside the park every season, but things seem to be getting worse. From 2009-2020, about 4.3 wolves from Yellowstone were killed legally by hunters and trappers each year, according to National Park Service data. From 2021-2024, that number nearly tripled when an average of 12.75 wolves died annually, according to Yellowstone Wolf Project data. 
It was clear to Doug Smith, retired lead of the Yellowstone Wolf Project, that the park’s porous boundaries would be an issue almost immediately after wolves were reintroduced in 1995. “This is a long-term problem for wildlife management, and particularly wolves,” Smith said in an interview this fall. 
Inside Yellowstone, wolves are managed “for the benefit and enjoyment of the people,” the now-famous language adorning the top of Roosevelt Arch, a striking stone gateway often surrounded by selfie-taking tourists at the park’s North Entrance. The sentiment springs from the 1916 act creating the National Park Service and stops at the park’s border. Outside Yellowstone, the states take over wolf management. There, wolves can get into trouble. They kill livestock, the occasional pet, and lots and lots of elk. And they’re especially naive to the many dangers in the new world around them.

Even in the early days of reintroduction, Smith remembers phone calls urging him to do the impossible: keep wolves inside the park. Back then, wolves had federal protections both in and out of Yellowstone. Hunting them was illegal, whether in Montana, Wyoming or Idaho, or inside Yellowstone itself. But within a month of releasing the park’s first wolves from their enclosure, a hunter named Chad McKittrick illegally shot and killed a male wolf, numbered 10M, after it left the park and ventured onto private land near Red Lodge, Montana. 
Fast-forward nearly 30 years and death also awaited 1329M, a striking green-eyed black male wolf, when he left Yellowstone. Researchers captured and collared 1329, born into the Wapiti Lake Pack just like 1331F. He was caught and joined the ranks of research wolves in 2021, the same year they collared 1331F as a pup. A year later, park scientists documented the young male, with a touch of silver on his chin, getting into a scuffle with other males, which could have spurred a dispersal. His collar’s GPS data shows he left Yellowstone on May 14, 2022, heading south. “[1329] beelined it all the way down through the trophy game wolf area,” said Stahler, the current Yellowstone Wolf Project leader.

The state of Wyoming tightly regulates wolf hunting in an area where wolves are managed as “trophy game” adjacent to Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, with the area closed to hunting in the spring. But 1329 kept moving. GPS data shows his route, loping straight through the heart of Jackson Hole, then south, looping through the Wyoming and Salt River ranges. The black wolf headed into a valley where, three years later, Sublette County resident Cody Roberts would fight a felony animal cruelty charge for allegedly making a public spectacle of a wounded, juvenile wolf in a bar before the animal died. The incident made international news and divided the small Western Wyoming community. Wolves are fewer here. There’s a reason. 
Within two weeks of leaving Yellowstone, the roughly 2-year-old 1329 crossed another boundary and left Wyoming’s regulated wolf “trophy game” area for its “predator zone,” which covers 85% of the state and where there are virtually no regulations on how wolves can be killed. Running down and bludgeoning wolves with snowmobiles here is legal. The departure meant he could be killed any time of year, by almost any means, and without a license.
Toward the end of June 2022, wolf 1329 stopped moving in the mountains near Salt River Pass, near where the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem transitions into the Great Basin. He’d stepped into a steel-jawed leghold trap. “It had been in the trap about four days,” Stahler says, “based on the location and movement.” By June 26, the trapped wolf was dead. The Yellowstone biologist’s best guess is that 1329 was exposed to the elements and died of dehydration. States surrounding the park require trappers to frequently check their wolf traps to reduce animals’ suffering and minimize harm to non-target species. Negligence is illegal. 
‘Risky life choice’ 
Wolves in the Northern Rockies are no strangers to controversy. Indeed, politicians in all three states surrounding Yellowstone have long seized on wolves as a prime example of federal overreach. “I remain seriously concerned with the uncertainty that continues to surround Yellowstone wolf reintroduction as it moves forward,” former Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer wrote to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt in 1995, after wolves were already on the ground. Former Idaho Gov. Butch Otter said he’d be the first to bid on a wolf tag back in 2007. And Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte was issued a warning for killing a Yellowstone wolf without the proper trapper education in 2021. 
Death by hunting, trapping or wildlife management official is the most common fate for wolves that leave Yellowstone National Park. Even in a natural system, the act of dispersing is already a “risky life choice,” according to Stahler. Solo wolves end up in territories of other wolf packs, where they clash and get killed. In fact, within Yellowstone, wolves are the leading cause of wolf death.

While the number of wolves that spend the vast majority of their time inside Yellowstone has stayed relatively static for more than two decades, wolf populations outside the park have grown by leaps and bounds. That’s in part because some Yellowstone wolves successfully dispersed and survived. At the same time, other wolves reintroduced in Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness established and bred. And yet more wolves filtered down from the north, crossing the Canadian border into the U.S. Today, populations of animals as reclusive as wolves are tough to estimate, but the most recent figures for Montana and Idaho wolf populations are roughly 1,100 and 1,200, respectively. In Wyoming, which has less mountainous, treed habitat, there are fewer wolves — about 350 — and they’re counted with much greater precision.
While those wolf populations outside the park grew, the human population inside Yellowstone expanded, too. Park visitation hovered around 3 million annually at the time of wolf reintroduction in 1995. Today, that number is closer to 5 million, evidenced by the sprawl of souvenir shops in the Yellowstone gateway towns of Jackson, Wyoming and Gardiner, Montana where tourists snap up T-shirts, stuffed bison and elk toys, and art emblazoned with wolves. This increased visitation, wolf biologist Smith says, is the biggest issue facing Yellowstone National Park as a whole.
“It’s the best place in the world to view wild wolves,” says Smith, adding that in the early days of wolf reintroduction, finding wolves inside the park was exclusive, inside information. That’s changed nowadays, he says, with the influx of eager, wolf- and grizzly-watching tourists. “There’s no inside tips anymore. Just look for the traffic jam.”

Wolf-watching tourism alone contributes at least $82 million annually to communities bordering the park, the most recent data show. However, all those people lining the roads and hillsides of Yellowstone come at a cost. “[When wolves] leave the park,” Smith says, “they get shot because they stand there and look at a hunter.”
Some wolves become so accustomed to people that they become habituated, according to Smith, meaning they walk up to humans in search of food or become so bold that they run off with tripods. In rare instances, park officials have euthanized habituated wolves.
The Wapiti Lake Pack, a major draw for wolf watchers and tourists, has been susceptible to human conditioning. These Yellowstone interior wolves, considered bison-killing specialists, often use groomed park roads to get around in winter, at times walking right by snowmobilers buzzing down the road on their way to places like Old Faithful or Tower Junction. They’ve even been hazed with paintballs as a result.  
But the vast majority of park wolves aren’t habituated, Smith says. Rather, they’re tolerant of people. “A wild wolf is avoidant,” he says. “They flee, they run. They know what humans mean: death. That’s not a park wolf.” Tolerance is the curse that leaves them vulnerable outside the park.

Justin Webb, executive director of the Foundation for Wildlife Management, says Yellowstone should do more to instill its wolves with a healthy fear of people.
“Wolves in the park should be given the respect of space, and I think that those wolves shouldn’t be conditioned to people,” says Webb, whose nonprofit makes bounty-like payments to trappers who kill wolves.
On occasion, Yellowstone wolves face circumstances that make them especially prone to human conditioning. The Junction Butte Pack, for example, often dens within eyeshot of Slough Creek, a popular trailhead for hikers and anglers. Tourists and Yellowstone guides have learned about the highly visible location, potentially dooming those pups. 
“Why don’t they close the trailhead down?” Webb asked. 
Yellowstone wolves leave the park for all kinds of reasons. Some, like 1331F, might take a temporary solo hiatus from their pack, while 1329M was likely in the midst of a more permanent dispersal, searching for new territory or a mate. However, the vast majority of Yellowstone’s wolves spend about 96% of their time inside the park, collar data shows. With no time to learn a healthy fear of humans, the 4% of the time they unwittingly leave their protections behind proves deadly. Instead of other wolves, people — either hunters or poachers — become, by far, the leading cause of death for wolves that depart Yellowstone, Stahler said. 
No fear
For the first decade and a half after wolves returned to Yellowstone, the Endangered Species Act outlawed hunting wolves throughout the Lower 48. Protracted legal battles meant the first lawful hunt didn’t occur until 2009, and it revealed the risk facing wolves that spend most of their lives inside Yellowstone. 
“They aren’t showing any fear,” one Montana wolf hunter told the Los Angeles Times after a successful hunt that year. “But they will, I’m sure.” Another hunting guide told the outlet about a wolf his client killed: “He was no more afraid of [the hunter] than the man in the moon.”
In 2011, wolves were permanently “delisted,” or stripped of federal protections under the Endangered Species Act, in Montana, Idaho and portions of three other western states by an act of Congress. In Wyoming, the change came more slowly because of litigation. Wolves were most recently delisted there in 2017.

After years of hunts in surrounding states, the story hasn’t changed much. In late 2024, members of the 8 Mile Pack crossed the park boundary into Montana. Three hunters were waiting. They left with four dead wolves. A fifth was found days later, dead in nearby bushes. That many wolves dying at the same time rather than fleeing at the sound of a gunshot, Smith says, likely means they had no fear of people. “Killing multiple wolves at once is a sure sign of that.”
In this way, 1331 and 1329 are outliers. According to Yellowstone National Park data, over the last few years, approximately 81% of wolves that lived in Yellowstone and were killed by hunters died in Montana. That’s largely due to terrain. Think of the Gardiner Basin just north of Yellowstone like a funnel: Elk migrate to the lower-elevation, arid area in search of forage in winter. Wolves follow. Of all those wolves killed by hunters in Montana, nearly 9 in 10 died within just a mile of the park boundary. The forays of 1331 and 1329 outside Yellowstone — clocking about 10 miles and over 100, respectively — mean they traveled much farther than most of their kind before meeting the same end. 
The lives of long-distance travelers, like the two Wapiti Lake pack members that died in traps, are less understood. Smith attributes the dearth of data to a simple reason: They die. 
“A wolf dispersing has a higher mortality risk because it doesn’t know the landscape,” he says. “So that makes it more vulnerable to getting shot because they’re wandering around going, ‘I don’t know where I am; I don’t know where it’s safe and where it’s unsafe.’” 
Montana and Wyoming’s respective wildlife management agencies investigated the trappings of 1331 and 1329. Both were found only because of their collar mortality signals, and both trappers were found to have violated state “trap-check” laws. Wolf traps must be checked every 48 hours in Montana. Leghold traps must be checked every 72 hours in Wyoming’s predator zone, the only place in the Equality State where wolf trapping is allowed.
The Wyoming trapper, a Cokeville resident named Ezra Cluff, was cited and fined $250 on June 30, 2022. “Cluff stated that he had got busy and had indeed failed to do his trap checks on time,” the warden wrote in a citation slip. Cluff did not respond to an interview request. 
Nearly three years later and on the opposite end of the ecosystem, 1331 was found in a trap about 10 miles, as the crow flies, north of Yellowstone. The trap was registered to Matt Lumley, who was at the time president of the Montana Trappers Association and vice president of the National Trappers Association. Lumley also has close ties to political leadership in Montana. He helped Gov. Gianforte trap and kill another collared Yellowstone wolf in 2021. Gianforte later described Lumley as his wolf hunting “mentor” in an interview with Lee Enterprise’s Statehouse Bureau. In addition, Lumley is a founding member of the Outdoor Heritage Coalition, a group currently suing Montana, arguing that state wildlife managers aren’t setting policy aggressively enough to reduce the wolf population.
Lumley did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But his comments in the Helena Capitol building are in the public record. “I’ve killed a lot of wolves,” he testified at the Montana Legislature just days before Wolf Project staff heard 1331F’s mortality signal. “I’ve never killed a Yellowstone National Park wolf. I’m killing all my wolves in Montana.”

Yellowstone park officials estimate that 1331 died on Jan. 16, 2025. Park staff detected her mortality signal on Jan. 23, and her remains were recovered even later. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks submitted a “request for prosecution” for a trap-check violation to Montana’s Park County Attorney’s Office. Despite the state’s 48-hour trap-check regulation for wolves, the county attorney declined to prosecute.

“After a careful review of the reports, supporting documents, and available evidence, we determined that the facts did not establish a criminal offense that could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,” Park County Attorney Chad Glenn said in an email to Mountain Journal and WyoFile. 
Glenn did not respond to follow-up questions or provide the documents he cited as the basis for his decision. Ultimately, Lumley walked away with a formal warning from FWP. Gianforte also walked away with a warning in 2021 after running afoul of trapping regulations while killing a wolf with Lumley on the same ranch, owned by Robert E. Smith, a co-director of Sinclair Broadcasting Group and contributor to Gianforte’s 2017 congressional campaign.
Elk, livestock and wolves
The saga of Wapiti Lake’s wandering wolves reflects the complexity of managing Yellowstone wolves when they leave protected areas like the park. Over the last few decades, the region has transitioned from an economy based on resource extraction to one heavily reliant on tourism and recreation. Outside the national park, wildlife managers are tasked with balancing hard-to-reconcile viewpoints in states where hunting and ranching have deep roots and large landowners hold sway. 
The overpopulated elk herds of Yellowstone’s Northern Range numbered around 15,000-20,000 in the years leading up to the 1995 wolf reintroduction. Counts are now closer to 5,000, much to the dismay of many a hunter who relied on the area’s abundance of ungulates for meat or trophies. 
“I’ve got an 18-year-old son that I want to get to experience elk camp in the backcountry,” Webb, the wolf-hunting advocate, told a Wyoming audience in 2022. “I want him to sit on a mountaintop on a ridge and listen to bulls bugle below him as the sun comes up, and I believe that if we don’t do something to control wolf populations, he won’t have that experience.”

Meanwhile, Lumley the trapper called the decline of southwest Montana elk “the greatest loss of hunting opportunity in the world” during the same legislative hearing he touted killing “a lot of wolves.” Decades before wolf reintroduction, elk were so numerous in the area that Yellowstone sometimes culled thousands of the animals in a single year. Later, the park took a more hands-off approach. Elk hunting outside the park became the primary management tool to deal with the overpopulated ungulates. Locals recall a “firing line” of hunters as elk moved toward winter range outside the park’s protections. 
Wolves were a factor — but not the only factor — in the region’s decline in elk numbers. Mountain lions and bears eat elk, too. And so do people. A long-running late-season elk hunt in the Gardiner area also played a role in the elk population’s shrinking size. Despite a drastic decrease in numbers from the days before wolves, elk populations north of Yellowstone still remain at or above the state-set goal for elk numbers. Access to elk is yet another important part of the hunting puzzle. Some hunters say the wary ungulates that remain in the area often take shelter from wolves and hunters alike on private land, making them next to impossible to pursue. 
Part of the tension around hunting both wolves and elk also centers on economics. While wolf-watching brings millions of tourist dollars into communities surrounding the park, outfitters north of Yellowstone have lost business as elk herds declined after reintroduction. The lawsuit filed by the Outdoor Heritage Coalition features outfitter Craig Neal, an outfitter in Townsend, Montana, as a plaintiff. Neal, the brief contends, “has been negatively impacted by restrictions on wolf hunting in Montana from a personal and economic perspective … his business opportunities are limited by the insufficient wolf quotas and reduced elk available for hunting.”

Elk aren’t the only hooved creatures wolves impact, either. Outside Yellowstone, they also occasionally kill livestock. Although wolf-killed cattle and sheep are a drop in the bucket among the many factors that kill domestic livestock, the impacts aren’t trivial for individual ranchers in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.   
In Wyoming and Montana each year, wolves typically kill at least a few dozen of the more than 3 million cows in the two states — though many ranchers argue that wolf kills can go unproven since remote carcasses are consumed before the kill can be documented. Depredation numbers in Wyoming notably spiked from 2014 to 2017, topping out at 121 wolf-killed cattle — a pulse of conflict that coincided with the three years Wyoming wolves were relisted under the Endangered Species Act. While those federal protections prohibited hunters from killing wolves at the time, wildlife managers trying to avert conflict could do just that. And they did, killing a record number. In Montana, complaints about wolves eating livestock peaked at 233 in 2009. Since then, in the wake of delisting, the number of reports has dropped off drastically, hovering at 100 or fewer annually from 2015 to 2024.
Pressure cooker 
To control the wolf population and mitigate their impact, hunting has become a fixture of wolf management in the Northern Rockies. Since legal seasons began earlier in the century, some animals that spend most of the year in Yellowstone are always lost to hunters’ bullets and traps outside park boundaries. 
In an attempt to resolve the tension between the park and surrounding states, Montana carved out small areas with more limited hunting called “wolf management units” directly north of the park. Wyoming tightly controls its hunts immediately adjacent to Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and has had minimal overall impact on Yellowstone populations. Idaho takes an aggressive, statewide approach to wolf hunting and trapping, but the topography and location of Yellowstone packs have limited its influence on park populations.

The vast majority of harvested Yellowstone wolves die in Montana, where tensions continue to flare over setting the state’s wolf season. In 2021, the Montana Legislature mandated a reduction in the state’s overall wolf population, numbering roughly 1,177 at the time. The new law simply set a minimum of 15 breeding pairs (corresponding to 450 wolves). In the years since, setting policy to reduce wolf numbers has fallen to the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission, a citizen board appointed by the governor, currently Gianforte. The commission has considered a slew of ways to meet the mandate: lengthening hunting and trapping seasons, instituting a statewide quota, night hunting on private land, and neck snaring, among other approaches. Some of those aggressive tactics have taken effect. Others haven’t. Yet today, four years after the legislative mandate took effect, Montana still hasn’t seen a meaningful reduction in its wolf population. 
In 2021, about six months after Gianforte trapped and killed a Yellowstone wolf north of the park, the commission also removed quotas in the wolf management units, or WMUs, just outside Yellowstone. That winter, hunters killed at least 25 wolves that spent the vast majority of their lives inside the park. Roughly 1 in 5 park wolves perished — more park wolves than in any hunting season before or since. Yellowstone biologists worried about the impact of the hunt on their three-decade-old research project — some packs dissolved due to the hunt, and others formed. Behavior and reproductive rates changed, too. Wildlife guides were furious, concerned they’d lose business or wolf-watching opportunities altogether. 
Ultimately, the quotas were restored. But over the next two years, outcomes for Yellowstone wolves only marginally improved. At least 13 park wolves were killed in the 2023-2024 hunting season. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly voiced his concern to the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission in a 2024 letter. “Wolves that primarily live within Yellowstone are exceedingly valuable to a great number of people across Montana, the country, and the world,” he wrote. “The park generates hundreds of millions of dollars in additional economic activity to Montana economies and wolves and other wildlife rate as a top reason why people visit the park and region.”
The pressure cooker of hunting policy around Yellowstone hasn’t let off steam. At the January 2025 legislative hearing, Lumley complained that the Fish and Wildlife Commission was setting policy that was too protective of wolves and listening only to out-of-state interests, particularly Yellowstone. Just 3% of the national park lies in Montana. “That’s what you are elected to do, protect Montana’s interests,” Lumley testified. “Not Yellowstone National Park’s.” 
In a Fish and Wildlife Commission meeting months later, Chris Morgan, Lumley’s successor at the Montana Trappers Association, made similar claims. He alleged that policy safeguarding wolves in the region around Yellowstone is a “political ploy” and touted the state’s responsibility for wolf reduction rather than wolf watching.

“We don’t have any state mandate that requires us to make sure that ecotourism thrives,” Morgan said. “Our mandate is to reduce the state’s population of wolves. Plain and simple. Period.” 
Wolf advocates were just as fired up in the day-long meeting. Cara McGary, a Yellowstone guide and cofounder of Wild Livelihoods Business Coalition, argued that plenty of Yellowstone wolves — like 1331F— die even outside the protective boundaries of the wolf management units. Southwest Montana receives far more wolf hunting pressure than anywhere else in the state, despite a lower overall wolf density than Montana’s northwest corner, according to Montana FWP data. It’s also the only area in the Treasure State where the wolf population was already on the decline. In 2024 alone, at least six wolves from the park died legally in the Yellowstone-adjacent WMUs and another five outside their boundaries. “That’s almost 10% of the product that our businesses depend on,” she testified. 
At the time of publication, wolf hunting season in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho is well underway. The heat over wolf hunting regulations around Yellowstone in that August commission meeting led to something of a middle-ground approach. But already this year, a Montana hunter legally killed a Yellowstone wolf beloved to the wolf-watching community, which described the dark black 1479F as playful and tolerant of crowds.
“She was one of the few wolves in the park that would walk right through a crowd of people to reach her destination,” wildlife photographer Deby Dixon told Cowboy State Daily.
The National Park Service has two chief goals: preserving and protecting natural systems, and visitor enjoyment. Wolves figure into both, and the scientific gains from studying Yellowstone packs are unparalleled: They’re both uniquely visible and, at least in theory, uninfluenced by humans. But as wolves deal with such direct mortality when they set paw outside the park, Smith wonders: “Do you have a natural wolf population or not?”
Some data suggests not. A 2023 peer-reviewed study led by then-University of Montana PhD student Brenna Cassidy found that Montana’s wolf-hunting regime has a clear effect on the overall survival of Yellowstone wolves. Without hunting, park wolves have a nearly 90% chance of surviving any given year, but the rate falls to about 80% when hunting occurs with quotas. When there’s unlimited hunting outside the boundary, Yellowstone wolves’ chances of surviving a year dip closer to 70%. 
Smith, Yellowstone’s retired wolf biologist, wants to be clear: He’s a hunter as well, and a self-described “gun guy.” At times, though, he worries that all the focus on Yellowstone’s wolves has an overlooked downside. It sucks the air out of the room in wolf management conversations, leaving too little focus on the thousands more wolves in Montana and the rest of the Northern Rockies that don’t have the same vocal proponents as animals in and around the park. Those wolves die too — often very quickly or brutally. In Montana, hunters and trappers can take a total of 458 wolves this season, including six in the WMUs outside Yellowstone and 60 in the larger region where 1331 met her end. There are no limits in Idaho, and it’s a wolf hunting free-for-all in Wyoming’s predator zone, where 1329 died in an illegally monitored trap. 
Thinking about intense hunting pressure throughout the Northern Rockies, Smith thinks wildlife managers should consider a bigger question: “Where do wolves get to be wolves?”

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Chris Campany and Devon Neary: Building the infrastructure necessary to keep Vermonters in Vermont.","This commentary is by Chris Campany, executive director of the Windham Regional Commission, and Devon Neary, chair of the Vermont Association of Planning and Development Agencies.


Vermont has made progress improving pathways to new housing, but an often-overlooked need is the wastewater and water infrastructure to support it. 
We need to create conditions to house Vermonters at all stages of life.  This includes young people moving out of the family home for the first time, couples having children, empty nesters downsizing, seniors and others seeking housing to fit their independent living abilities, and those who have lost their housing to disaster.  This means investing in infrastructure that supports building housing at scale to make it affordable.  
“Affordable” shouldn’t be a loaded term.  Here it means housing for which the household is paying no more than 30% of their monthly gross income for housing costs, be that an individual or a family.  “At scale” means the ability to build enough units at one time to harness economies of scale that minimize per housing unit costs. 
The housing solution does not lie with custom built houses on large lots along town roads.  Barring a collapse in home and land values ‚ and material, labor and construction costs — these homes are well beyond the reach of most Vermonters today and in the future.  
We need investment in existing buildings, development of vacant properties, multi-family housing, and clustered small home neighborhoods to create housing at scale, and it is nearly impossible to build housing that is affordable for Vermonters at scale in the absence of community wastewater systems and drinking water systems. 
For towns with zoning, making sure that zoning does not create unwise and unnecessary roadblocks to building housing, especially multi-family housing, can help.  But the underlying infrastructure is fundamental, especially in areas that have minimal flood risk.
Regional planning commissions play an essential role in supporting municipal land use planning, planning for the infrastructure to make action on those plans possible, and supporting engineering design and project construction, because most communities do not have the capacity to do it on their own. 
This support is necessary not only for the development of new systems, but improvements to the capacity of those that already exist.  We also recognize the challenges faced by municipalities that are already managing wastewater and water systems.  
Through collaboration with the Vermont Bond Bank, we are beginning work to support communities that are struggling to operate their existing drinking water systems.  Our goal is to make system management easier and more efficient and to ultimately identify operations and maintenance models that make more sense for Vermont’s small communities. 
It may be tempting to think that we shouldn’t consider new systems or improve the capacity of existing systems if we can’t handle the ones we already have.  That’s a false choice.  We need to develop effective operations and maintenance models even as we develop the systems we need now and for the future.  
Among Act 181’s reforms are improvements to regional future land use mapping.  The state’s 11 regional planning commissions are working with each of our municipalities to map our future growth areas.  This includes addressing flood adaptation needs. 
These areas should form the basis for a statewide infrastructure investment strategy that supports each step of infrastructure development — from the connection to land use planning to project construction.
Just as the state adopted an “all-in” approach to clean water, it is important for all Vermonters to be invested in the housing infrastructure solution.  We also need to make it easier to scale up operations and maintenance so that towns can more easily work together and towns aren’t left to figure out on their own what an intermunicipal, or regional, system could do more effectively.

Charcoal
is our preferred method
with which to sketch our days:
thick, dark swaths of pigment
that smear and make their mark 
unapologetically,
abstract, flowing, influential,
or as gashes across the page
like wounds that won’t close.
And neither are ugly,
though we can’t erase them.
They are the foundations of your life,
but details make the picture –
the careful lines and smudges;
noticing a twinkling eye,
or smiling with all your teeth. 
And everyone you meet
is drawing their own
conclusions and beginnings,
unfinished works
marbled with messy, rushed greetings
and slow, agonizing goodbyes.
Strapped to our backs and worn on our sleeves are these masterpieces,
every day being dotted
with someone else’s charcoall.
Our sketches are never finished,
but always beautiful.
But we forget, somehow:
We are all art.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-16 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Trump’s concerns about big insurance  could be alleviated with universal health care,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/16/trump-insurance-universal-health-care/,President Trump expressed concern that big insurance companies are getting federal funds. Adopting universal health care would solve that problem.,"Based on their recent comments, perhaps President Donald Trump and some other Republicans are getting ready to embrace universal health care. 
Universal health care involves some form of the government ensuring everyone has medical coverage at little or no out-of-pocket cost, beyond what people pay in taxes. Many countries, including much of western Europe, have some form of universal health care. 
The United States does not, even though various Democrats, ranging from Harry Truman to Barack Obama, from Kamala Harris to Bernie Sanders, have embraced some form of universal health care at some point in time.
Republicans have portrayed universal health care as the bogeyman, as socialism, as the worst thing that could happen to the United States and would eventually lead to capitulation to Russia.
Yet, Trump and others seem to be warming up to the possibility.
In recent weeks, congressional Democrats have been fighting to extend enhanced subsidies for private insurance purchased on the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace exchange – a fight that was at the center of the 43-day federal government shutdown that ended last week. The federal subsidies pay a significant portion of the cost of the health insurance purchased on the exchange.

Trump recently posted on social media, as he is wont to do, that instead of providing these subsidies to big insurance companies, he would prefer to give the money for health care directly to the American people.
How would this work? He didn’t say, but that did not stop many Republicans from embracing the idea. And it does not appear many Republicans voiced concern about such a scheme.
But according to the Congressional Budget Office, as explained in an MSNBC article by Miranda Yaver, a University of Pittsburgh assistant professor of health policy and management, the health insurance companies received about $92 billion in federal ACA subsidies in 2023. During the same year, just the out-of-pocket costs – those not paid by the insurance companies – totaled $500 billion for Americans.
So, in short, if Trump diverts that $92 billion from insurance companies to individuals, there also must be a method to pay for the additional costs of health care Americans will incur.
The amount of the subsidies each individual would receive will not cover the cost of a serious illness or accident. Would the people facing major medical expenses be left to face the impossible-for-most task of paying those tens of thousands of dollars in health care costs by themselves? Or would they need some, gulp, insurance, to help pay for those additional costs?
Insurance, love it or hate it, exists to level the playing field. By having a large number of people on insurance, the costs paid by those with expensive medical needs are held down by those who have insurance but seldom or never have to use it.
So, all this begs the question: What is the answer for those, like President Trump, who don’t like subsidizing big insurance?
The obvious answer to that question is, drum roll please, universal health care coverage, often referred to as Medicaid and Medicare for all or a public option.
Universal health care could be fashioned a number of ways. People could be expected to provide, as Republicans like to say, some “skin in the game” by paying for some of the costs themselves.
It could be a program where, if you have private insurance and you like your private insurance, you can keep it just as long as it is not paid for with federal dollars.
President Trump and others have been obsessed with getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. The president seems upset that it is called Obamacare.
It is important to note that it was first labeled Obamacare by those who opposed the legislation that was passed way back in 2010. But now that polls show it is popular, Trump seems upset that it is called Obamacare.
As a matter of fact, he said that money for health care being sent directly to the American people “would be so exciting. Call it Trumpcare. Call it whatever you want.… Anything but Obamacare.”
Perhaps Democrats, many of whom always supported universal health care as the most logical way to deal with an often broken and complex American system, could achieve that goal by just agreeing to call it Trumpcare.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/14092304/AP25317126616807.jpg,,,2025-11-16 07:56:25.672375

President Chester Arthur is back in the spotlight. It’s been a minute. 
Netflix’s hit new historical series “Death by Lightning” tells the story of the assassination in 1881 of President James Garfield, so it’s only natural that Garfield and his assassin, Charles Guiteau, take center stage. But Arthur is the one who gets the redemption arc. Plus (spoiler alert) he’s the only one of the three still breathing at the end.
Arthur was an extremely unlikely president. He didn’t seek the office and only attained it through a bizarre sequence of events. In the years since his single term, the native of Fairfield, Vermont, has been largely forgotten, so it feels strange to see him get serious screen time in a major production. But the story can’t be told without him.
It seems a minor miracle the story is being told at all. What was the pitch to Netflix like? How did anyone convince the streaming service that viewers today would love a story focusing on a group of 19th-century politicians who can vie with Arthur for the title of “most obscure.” In addition to Garfield, whose name is rarely mentioned today outside of trivia nights, viewers are introduced to such former political heavyweights as Roscoe Conkling and James Blaine. 
Yet somehow the show works. It has its share of ahistorical aspects, such as characters speaking like modern Americans and cursing liberally. But other details that could seem invented to make the show more relatable — Black men serving in positions of power in 1880s Washington, D.C., and Garfield’s intense focus on rooting out political corruption — are drawn from real life.
“Death by Lightning” has a surprising amount of humor, given the topic, which might have helped get the project green lighted. The barrel-chested, heavily sideburned Arthur is played by Nick Offerman and in his early scenes, he provides comic relief as a man of unquenchable appetites, particularly for liquor and sausages. 
His outsized cravings could be a stand-in for the greed that was at the heart of the era’s rampant graft, in which Arthur actively participated. Famously, Chester Arthur served as customs collector for the Port of New York. Seventy-five percent of American imports flowed through New York’s harbor and it was Arthur’s job to collect import duties on those goods. In an era before the federal income tax, those duties provided nearly half of U.S. government revenues. 
Arthur and other top Customs officers were entitled to a “moiety,” or share, of any fines on importers or any seizures his department made. As a result, Arthur’s total annual income was the equivalent of about $1.25 million today, making him the nation’s highest-paid politician, including the president.
Overseeing a workforce of about 1,300 gave Arthur substantial political power too. He used the patronage or spoils system (as in, “to the victor go the spoils”) to dole out well-paid positions to applicants based on their loyalty to the Republican Party, not their qualifications for the actual job. Jobholders were expected to kickback a share of their paychecks to help fund the party. Showing up for work was often optional.
Arthur wasn’t at the top of New York’s political pyramid, however. He owed his job to U.S. Sen. Roscoe Conkling, who enlisted Arthur as his loyal protégé. 
“Death by Lightning” begins with James Garfield, an Ohio representative, attending the Republican Convention in Chicago to nominate another Ohio politician, Sen. John Sherman, for president. This was in the days before political primaries; convention delegates chose who was on a party’s national ticket, not voters.

The delegates divided into factions. Many supported former President Ulysses Grant, who was seeking a third term; presidents weren’t yet term-limited by the Constitution. James Blaine was the other main contender. (Among the lesser candidates, U.S. Sen. George Edmunds of Vermont received a smattering of votes.)
But no one was able to get the required majority. With the convention deadlocked after 33 ballots, 16 Wisconsin delegates voted for a new candidate, James Garfield. Garfield protested, saying the votes for him shouldn’t be counted, because he wasn’t a candidate. The convention chairman disagreed. Two ballots later, a majority of delegates swung their voters to this compromise candidate and Garfield was named the Republican nominee.
New York acted as a kingmaker in those days. As the most populous state, it possessed the most electoral votes. So Republican Party leaders curried favor with New York Republicans, and other supporters of the patronage system nationally, by having one of their own, Chester Arthur, selected as the vice presidential nominee. It was a fraught marriage of convenience, pairing a politician who vowed to fight the spoils system with one who embodied it.
After the Garfield-Arthur ticket won the presidency, things went about as well as you might expect. Once in office, Garfield took aim at the patronage system by appointing a new collector for the Port of New York without first consulting New York’s two U.S. senators.
Seeing this as a direct challenge to his political machine, Conkling resigned his senate seat in a symbolic protest, as did New York’s other senator. The incident highlighted the schism within the Republican Party. When Arthur opted to remain loyal to Conkling, he showed that there was a divide within the White House as well.
Less than four months into his term in office, Garfield was shot by Charles Guiteau. Clearly suffering from some form of mental illness, Guiteau had expected to be the beneficiary of the spoils system by being handed a plum job for his supposedly invaluable support of Garfield during the campaign. In fact, Guiteau believed he deserved to be appointed U.S. consul to Paris, a job for which he was wholly unqualified. 
As he was being arrested, Guiteau said excitedly, “Arthur is president now!” When Guiteau’s comment was widely reported, many Americans suspected Arthur of being involved in the plot. Arthur received death threats and was deeply troubled by the accusation. 
But Garfield wasn’t dead yet. 
He survived for weeks with the bullet lodged in his abdomen. Doctors tried repeatedly to remove it. Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln, son of the late president, summoned Dr. Doctor Willard Bliss (yes, Doctor was his first name) to tend to the president. 
Dr. Charles Purvis, a Black physician who was among the doctors treating the president, urged Bliss to employ the relatively new practice of surgeons’ washing their hands and using sterilizing instruments, but Bliss brushed him off. Garfield suffered through multiple attempts to locate the bullet, all without anesthesia.
When he died 79 days after being shot, an autopsy determined that the bullet hadn’t damaged any major organs and could safely have been left in place. The president had died of a massive infection, sepsis, caused by the unsanitary conditions under which he was treated.
Arthur had taken no executive actions while Garfield lingered, not daring to feed the rumors of a power grab.
In fact, the assassination seems to have reawakened Arthur’s long-dormant political integrity. Once in office, Arthur set his mind to reform, both of the political system and of himself. He worked to fulfill Garfield’s mission of dismantling the patronage system, by successfully championing the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, which introduced competitive exams for many federal positions and made it illegal to fire federal employees for political reasons.  
People who had only known Arthur as a linchpin in the political machine might have thought these impulses came out of the blue. But as a younger man, Arthur had shown he could be highly principled. Like his Baptist preacher father, Arthur was an abolitionist. Early in his legal career, he represented a Black woman who had been accosted and thrown off a “whites only” New York City streetcar, winning a sizable judgement in her favor. 
As president, Arthur ultimately defied public expectations, running an administration free of major scandal.  
“No man ever entered the presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted,” Pennsylvania newspaper editor Alexander K. McClure noted at the time. “And no one ever retired more generally respected.”  
Or, as Mark Twain quipped: “I am but one of 55 million; still, in the opinion of this 1/55 millionth of the country’s population, it would be hard to better President Arthur’s administration. But don’t decide till you hear from the rest.”
While Arthur is the most significant Vermont appearing in “Death by Lightning,” alert viewers might note a couple other Vermont cameos. U.S. Rep. Levi Morton, born in Shoreham, appears in all four episodes, though as a minor character. In one scene, he tells Garfield he can’t accept the position of Secretary of the Navy (Conkling had pressured him to reject the position).
In real life, it was hardly the end of Morton’s career. Garfield soon appointed him U.S. minister to France. He was later elected governor of New York and, in 1888, vice president of the United States—along with Arthur and Calvin Coolidge, one of only three Vermonters ever to hold that position.  
Another Vermonter, John Humphrey Noyes, also appears briefly. Born and raised in Brattleboro, Noyes started a utopian commune in nearby Putney. His neighbors were outraged to learn of the commune’s belief in free love and he soon moved the community to Oneida, New York. 
Noyes appears in flashbacks with the future assassin Guiteau, who spent six years as a member of what people in series call a “sex cult.” Guiteau is depicted as getting on people’s nerves because he believes he is too good for the manual labor expected of all community members.
Despite the commune’s free-love edict, the women of Oneida want nothing to do with Guiteau, who they nickname “Charles Git Out.” That unlikely detail — like so many other startling aspects of “Death by Lightning”— is true.

This story by Patrick Billow was first published in News & Citizen on Nov. 13, 2025.
An 1850s Morristown home and barn, which raised a family and thousands of exotic plant species over the last four decades, will soon be wiped from the land — the home by an excavator and the barn by several eager members of the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps.
Don and Lela Avery met in Big Sur, California before they moved with their two sons to a 22-acre property on Duhamel Road in 1979. Leveraging fertile soil next to the Kenfield Brook, they started propagating famously stubborn plants with success, a hobby that blossomed into a renowned business, the Cadys Falls Nursery.
Customers from around the country visited Morristown to purchase rare plant species from Don and Lela. In elaborate gardens around their home, they planted more than 1,400 plant varieties — from showy Lady’s Slippers to dwarf conifers — complemented by paths, sculptures and rock walls that Don built over the years.
The Averys closed the nursery at the onset of the pandemic and opened their beloved gardens to the public. Don and Lela, unbothered and welcoming, would go about their day while guests, plant-savvy or simply seeking serenity, wandered the gardens freely.

But living at the confluence of the Kenfield Brook and Lamoille River has its disadvantages. In terms of 100-year floods— dramatic events that might occur once a century — the Averys have experienced eight in 40 years.
They hoped the flood of 1995 was the worst of it, and after initial concerns that they couldn’t live in the home, the flooding relaxed for decades, and the Averys decided to hunker down.
Then, the Flood of 2023 raised the water level to the first-floor windows of their home.
“We made a decision to stay there and get old there and die there, or whatever you can do,” Don Avery said. “But then 2023 came around and it just slammed us. We weren’t young anymore. We couldn’t really deal with it.”
After a two-year search for a new home, Don and Lela last week signed their property over to the State of Vermont. Vermont Emergency Management purchased the property through a flood-plain buyout for $850,000, and Vermont Fish and Wildlife will restore the land to its natural environment. That money covers the town’s assessed value of the property as well as the cost of removing the home and barn. Including the nursery, there are three active buyouts in Morristown and about 300 in the state.
While the home will be demolished and dragged away, the barn, with its historic features and towering timber frame, is getting a decidedly different treatment. Under the guidance of Huntington-based Building Heritage, volunteers with the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps are taking the structure apart piece by piece and rebuilding it at a different location.
By the end of the year, every structure and piece of material on the property will have been removed, down to bare soil, except for Don and Lela’s plants, which they have three years to relocate, a courtesy likewise granted to farms during a buyout.
The land will become public, rip rap in the river removed; beavers will move in, and the area will continue to flood, but that could improve flooding conditions downstream, according to Will Eldridge, an aquatic habitat biologist with Vermont Fish and Wildlife.
“This is really best for everybody, so I’m not as heartbroken as some people would think,” Don Avery said.
Built to last
Last Friday, volunteers with the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps climbed high into the barn’s rafters and used L-shaped metal rods to pry wooden pegs from timber-frame joints. Tyler Hadar, one volunteer, had devised a system for labeling the timbers with silver placards, so they’d know how to put the barn back together.

The volunteers work through different Conservation Corps programs, but they all have an appreciation for the structure they are disassembling. Hadar is with the timber framing program and other volunteers came from the farming and conservation program.
Working under the guidance of Building Heritage, a historic preservation company, the barn is the first project of its kind for several of the volunteers, and its new territory for the company as well. Interstate 89 travelers might recognize the massive red East Monitor barn off the highway near Richmond, one of the largest barns in the state, which the preservation company rehabilitated in 2023.
“We’ve renovated lots of old barns, but this is our first time taking one down,” Elliot Nathrop of Building Heritage said.
The barn should be disassembled and gone in five weeks, then rebuilt at Building Heritage’s headquarters in Huntington. Its next home has not been determined, but Nathrop said the company has a host of private and public connections for the structure.

As winter rolls in, the volunteers and three workers with Building Heritage are stripping the two-story barn down to the historic timber frame. Accessory structures attached to the barn, like greenhouses and out-barns, have been torn away and demolished, and the old clapboards and metal roofing thrown away, but the hand-hewn timbers and inside-facing boards will be repurposed.
For volunteers in the timber framing program, the project is a practical look at age-old building practices they’re learning about. For farming and conservation volunteers, it’s a lesson on how to deal with ancient structures that are common throughout Vermont’s landscape.
Jessie Gustafson, another volunteer with the timber framing program, is happy the barn is being saved, and she’s found a type of serenity among the hand-hewn timbers from 150 years ago.
“I feel like it’s a lot of respect for the trees that went into making this, and the people that took the time to make it,” Gustafson said. “It’s just such a beautiful barn, and it’s fun to be in here. It’s also fun just, like, ripping stuff up.”
Repurposing structures like the barn also cuts down on the amount of material deposited in a landfill, fulfilling a state mandate to reduce waste after a buyout. On Wednesday, King Construction knocked down the Avery’s home of 40 years with an excavator, and the remains will be thrown away.
Although it’s a historic structure with its own timber frame skeleton, layers of plaster and other material in the home rendered it too difficult and expensive to renovate.
Prior to the demolition, the Averys asked friends and neighbors to raid their home. Building material and appliances, including marble windows, a wood stove and hardwood went to seven surrounding counties in Vermont.
It was nice because it all went to people we knew, people who were building a house or renovating their house, so we knew it was all going to get used,” Lela Avery said.

Don’t whither away
With the structures slated for removal by the end of the year, the only thing remaining of the nursery will be Don and Avery’s gardens, but they have three years to remove them from the property.
Vermont Fish and Wildlife doesn’t want to manage the gardens, but the Averys wanted to break it up anyways. They’ve seen some private gardens wither once they become public.
“It’s too personal,” Don Avery said. “We always knew this wouldn’t be here forever, but we wanted someone who would take care of the plants after us.”
They don’t have a plan for all the species, but some of the rare conifers will return to Greg Williams, a Wolcott plant master who taught the Averys how to graft trees decades ago.
“It was a good long run,” Lela Avery said. “We really enjoyed it. We loved our little place there. We loved our business, and we loved our customers.”

REPORTING HIGHLIGHTSMoving Cars Fast: An analysis of 6,000 forms that Connecticut towing companies submitted to sell cars found firms regularly listed low values, which allows them to sell vehicles quickly.Some Companies Had Patterns: One company valued about 90% of the cars it tried to sell at exactly $1,500, the DMV cutoff to start the sales process after 15 days.Luxury Cars: Towers sought permission to sell about 150 luxury cars for less than a third of their book value despite the cars having no accident record in the state crash database.
The first time Ruedean Harvey saw the white Range Rover Autobiography at a New York City dealership, she fell in love.
“They took me up on this escalator, and the car was enclosed in a glass room, and I was like, ‘Yep, that’s the car for me,’” she said. The dealership arranged to have a limousine take her from their offices to get the bank check, she said, and when she got back, the salespeople had Champagne ready to pop.
Harvey, a construction contractor who now lives in New Britain, Connecticut, paid almost $135,000 in 2012 to buy her dream car. It had a handcrafted leather interior, walnut wood paneling and massaging seats with televisions built into the headrests.
But after the vehicle was towed from a public street in 2023, a tow truck company tried to sell it without her knowledge, writing on a form to the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles that it was worth only $1,475.
The value happened to be just under a $1,500 DMV threshold that allows towing companies to seek the agency’s permission to sell cars they tow after 15 days if the owner doesn’t claim it or says they can’t afford the fees.
Over the past year, The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica have reported on how Connecticut’s laws have come to favor towing companies over drivers, including the 15-day provision, which was one of the shortest windows in the country. A law that took effect in October says towers must wait at least 30 days to sell cars.
Connecticut towers have publicly insisted that most of the cars they sell are junk. To sell a car, towing companies need to get DMV approval by filling out a form estimating the value, which the agency is supposed to check against the book value.
But a new CT Mirror and ProPublica analysis of more than 6,000 forms processed by the DMV in 2022-23 and obtained in a public records request found patterns of low values listed by tow companies. And it highlights the DMV’s lack of oversight of the process.
To analyze the towers’ and DMV’s handling of the sales process, the news organizations spent more than a year building a database from the forms, some of which are handwritten. That involved sorting through thousands of scanned documents and manually entering DMV employees’ handwritten vehicle values. Together, the records allow the public to know for the first time what kinds of cars are being sold after tows, who’s towing them and what happens to the vehicles.
The data shows towing companies frequently take advantage of the provision to start the sales process for lower-value cars after just 15 days. About 60% of the forms requested these fast-track sales. By valuing cars under $1,500, towers can sell cars privately and avoid a more cumbersome process that requires them to wait 45 days and sell vehicles at a public auction.
One West Hartford towing company, Elmwood Automotive, valued about 90% of the 33 cars it tried to sell in the past few years at exactly $1,500, our analysis found. The next highest, Lone Star Repair Service and East Coast Towing, both of Stamford, listed around half their cars at exactly that amount. None of those companies responded to requests for comment.
Attorney Eric L. Foster, who specializes in repossession cases and sits on a DMV task force studying towing regulations, said the odds of 9 out of 10 cars being worth exactly $1,500 is “zero.” Foster said it’s on the DMV to call out such data discrepancies and reject the tow companies’ forms because “until you get slapped on the wrist, you just keep doing the behavior.”
Many large companies value their cars below $1,500 and move the vehicles fast, the data showed. Nine companies that submitted more than 50 forms sought permission to sell over 90% of those towed cars after 15 days, as opposed to the longer 45-day process.
Even when towing companies do value vehicles over $1,500 and wait the 45 days, undervaluing cars helps. Under the law, towers are supposed to hold onto proceeds for a year, then hand the money over to the state for owners or lenders to claim later. Using a lower value allows towers to claim they had no profits after subtracting their storage fees.
It’s impossible to know the conditions of all the cars. But CT Mirror and ProPublica found that in nearly half the cases, the tower’s value was less than or equal to 50% of the book value.
In one of the starkest examples, towers sought permission to sell about 150 luxury cars, including nearly 40 BMWs and 20 Mercedes, for less than a third of their book value despite the vehicles having no accident record in the state’s crash database.
DMV spokesperson Shaun Formica said that the agency has reviewed its process for tows. She added that “recent discussions along with legislative changes have reshaped our process” for evaluating the values of vehicles.
At a meeting late last month, DMV program director Johnnine Dominique said employees review forms and make a call about whether differences between the towers’ estimates and the book values are large enough to cause alarm. Sometimes, they ask towing companies to submit evidence supporting the lower value.
“It’s not a good system regardless,” Dominique said, noting that it relies on judgment calls.
In Harvey’s case, the tow company filed the form exactly 15 days after it was towed. The car was having engine trouble, and the DMV approved the tower’s value even though an agency document examiner listed the book value at $17,250. Used car listings show several Range Rover Autobiographies, with more mileage and fewer features than Harvey’s, for sale at higher prices.
Lack of Data
CT Mirror and ProPublica’s initial investigation of towing company practices prompted a legislative overhaul of the state’s law that makes it harder to tow vehicles from private property and easier for drivers to retrieve their vehicles after a tow. As part of the new law, the DMV also had to create a task force to discuss more measures to address how sales occur and what happens to the proceeds.
At the task force’s first meeting in September, Sal Sena, whose company was authorized to sell more towed cars than any other in Connecticut in 2022-23, said nearly half the vehicles he tows aren’t registered, and many of them never get picked up.
But when Raphael Podolsky, a consumer advocate and attorney, pressed for data, neither the DMV nor towers on the task force could provide any.
“The implication was there was no way we could find these things out,” he said.

In fact, Sena’s company, Sena Brothers, which operates as Cross Country Automotive, used the 15-day process for 98% of the towed cars it wanted to sell in 2022-23. Two other companies — Corona’s Auto Parts and Friendly Auto Body & Towing, both of Hartford — used the fast-track sales process 99% of the time.
Sena said he isn’t surprised that he’s the highest-volume company or that most of his forms are filed after 15 days because of the condition of the vehicles he tows. “The majority of the cars that we tow are unregistered and inoperable,” he said. “We do everything from city of Hartford towing to the housing authority towing in multiple towns, and we’re cleaning the parking lots all day long.”
Tom Amenta, owner of Friendly Auto Body, said that his company follows “the letter of the law,” and that low values are a result of towing cars in poor condition. “We can only apply” for the sale, Amenta added. “DMV is the ultimate judge.”
Corona’s did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.
Of the 6,000 forms processed in 2022-23 that the newsrooms reviewed, more than 2,000 listed values between $500 and $600. In addition, there were 362 where towing companies estimated the car’s value to be exactly $1,500. Metro Auto Body & Towing of Hartford submitted the most forms at exactly $1,500, with 60. Many of those were cars they towed for parking meter violations for the Hartford Parking Authority and not for crashes, which could significantly reduce the value.
Metro also did not return calls or emails.
Bristol resident Jason Trelli wondered how his 2011 Jaguar got such a low value after it was towed in May 2023. He was moving out of his rental home and loaded his possessions into a U-Haul, planning to return to get his car in a few hours.
“So I go to get the Jaguar back, and it’s not there,” Trelli said.
Trelli called the police, who told him the car was towed by Nelcon, which is also registered with the DMV as Maple Avenue Repair Service. But he said the company’s Plainville office repeatedly told him it didn’t have his car.
After several weeks, Nelcon acknowledged it had the car, Trelli said. He spent several more weeks calling the company. But he said Nelcon refused to waive the storage fees, which eventually mounted to $1,900, according to a text message his sister sent him right after speaking to the company herself in August 2023.
In a written statement, Nelcon’s owner, Saleem Khan, disputed portions of Trelli’s account and said, “No employee told Mr. Trelli we did not tow his vehicle.” He said, “Our records show Mr. Trelli was quoted a total price of $665,” when he initially called about his car.
Nelcon submitted a form to the DMV in August 2023 to sell the Jaguar at a public auction. Khan wrote the car was worth $3,500 — about $3,000 less than the book value a DMV employee wrote on the form.
Khan said he used the National Automobile Dealers Association value for the car, adding that the company sold the car to a salvage yard last month.
If Nelcon had written the DMV’s book value and sold it for that, the company would have owed Trelli the profits.
“I never felt so helpless and angry,” Trelli said.

Over the Limit
In addition to some companies valuing high numbers of vehicles at $1,500, some towers submitted forms for 15-day sales even though they listed a value above the $1,500 limit for shorter sales. The CT Mirror and ProPublica found more than 200 forms that listed higher values than allowed.
Rather than rejecting those forms, Formica, the DMV spokesperson, said the agency typically just holds onto the forms until the 45-day mark has passed.
“We generally put them aside, and then once it’s time, we’ll process them,” Formica said, adding that “nothing is getting through.”
That’s what occurred in the cases of Saundra Magana and her niece Eloise Bennett this summer. They had been fighting with the New Britain Parking Ticket Department about payment for their spaces in a city garage for months when Magana went to get something out of her red 2008 Hummer H3 in early July and discovered her car was gone. Gone too were Bennett’s Chrysler PT Cruiser and Jeep Cherokee with a Dallas Cowboys star custom-painted on the hood.
New Britain police told Magana that the city had hired Skytop Motors to tow the vehicles because she and her niece owed thousands of dollars in parking tickets.
Skytop requested the DMV’s permission to sell Magana’s Hummer on July 22. On the form they wrote the car was worth $5,900, well over the $1,500 limit to sell a car after 15 days. But Skytop still checked the 15-day box.
Records show the DMV gave Skytop permission to sell the three cars in August — 47 days after the tows.
Magana said Skytop never notified her that her car would be sold. Both women said they never got an itemized towing bill, and Bennett said she never got any notice from Skytop that it had towed her vehicles. The form Skytop submitted to the DMV listed Bennett at an address that was on her registration but that she hadn’t lived at for several years.

Magana and Bennett filed complaints with the DMV, which closed their cases because it was a civil matter that needed to be handled in the courts, according to letters they received.
A Skytop official said in a statement that the company had been “cleared” by the DMV and the state Department of Consumer Protection. “All cases have been dropped and found out we did no wrong doing,” the company said, without addressing specific questions.
Under the law, towing companies are required to provide evidence that they notified the registered owner and any lienholders, but relying on registration isn’t foolproof.
Foster, the attorney, said the biggest problem with the system is that owners aren’t notified about tows and pending sales because towing companies rely on the address used for registration, which is sometimes out of date.
The result is drivers lose their cars, and “the penalty should not be punitive,” Foster said.
Properly notifying people their cars have been towed is also one of the biggest issues towers face, Sena told consumer advocates at the task force meeting in September.
“If we could create a system where they’re being notified and everybody is aware of the situation, then half the problems you guys are dealing with — and half the problems we are — are going to go away,” Sena said.
As of the last week of October, at least two of Magana’s and Bennett’s vehicles, the Hummer and the PT Cruiser, could be seen sitting in Skytop’s tow lot. It’s unclear what happened to the Jeep.

“This Freaking Car”
For Podolsky, the problem that remains, even after the revised law went into effect last month, is making sure that people who want to get their car back can do so.
Consumer advocates and towing companies remain far apart as they try to agree on solutions to recommend to the legislature by a February deadline.
At the October task force meeting, Podolsky recommended stopping the fees from accumulating once a person notifies the tower they want the car back. Minnesota, for example, allows extra time for vehicle owners who notify the tower to pay. Towers proposed getting rid of valuing cars altogether and holding all vehicles for 30 days, regardless of the value.
Other states don’t rely on towing companies to value vehicles, according to a survey the Connecticut DMV conducted this year. Florida considers the age of the vehicle, for example, while Oregon requires certified appraisers to value vehicles.
“The end result should be they get the car back because they need the car and they don’t abandon the car because they don’t have the money,” Podolsky said.
Harvey was lucky enough to get her luxury Range Rover back.
Her ordeal started in 2023 when the SUV had an engine problem. She took it to a mechanic an acquaintance recommended in Bloomfield. But town officials closed the repair shop because of building code violations.
Somehow, the car was moved to a street in Hartford, where police noticed it sitting for weeks and, assuming it was abandoned, had it towed by Modern Garage.
Exactly 15 days after towing it, Modern Garage submitted a form seeking to sell it. Modern Garage used the 15-day process in 85% of its sales requests in 2022-23. Harvey said she was never notified her car had been towed, but after finding out the repair shop had closed, she called the Hartford Police, who told her that her car was at Modern Garage.
Harvey said when she got there, a man who identified himself as co-owner acknowledged her Range Rover was still there but that it was “leaving today.”
“My partner’s gonna be very upset; he was keeping the car for himself,” Harvey said the man told her.
Modern Garage owner Michael Sardelli denied anyone was planning to keep the car. “Nobody would have told her that,” he said.
Sardelli said the $1,475 value on the form was accurate because “there was a massive puddle of oil under it. It was clearly disabled.”
“They’re a dime a dozen,” Sardelli said of Range Rovers on the marketplace. “They are just so expensive to maintain and once they get mileage on them, the repairs of the car supersede its value tenfold.”
Harvey ended up paying nearly $2,600 that same day to get her car back. Still inoperable, it sits in her garage needing expensive engine repairs.
“I worked my whole life for this freaking car,” Harvey said.

How We Analyzed the DMV’s Forms
To build our database of more than 6,000 forms processed by the Connecticut DMV in 2022-23, CT Mirror and ProPublica extracted and manually entered information from over 10,000 scanned documents obtained through public records requests.
The forms, known as H-100s, were difficult to read, with illegible handwriting and inconsistent redactions, making it difficult to sort through thousands of duplicates across 11 batches.
Reporters manually reviewed the forms, recording the DMV’s listed book value, towing company name, tower license number, tow date, if the tower was selling within 15 or 45 days, the tower’s estimated value and the date a DMV employee signed the form. The vehicle identification number is included on the form but was sometimes illegible or redacted.
We removed rows that were not unique. It is possible that we are undercounting a situation in which two cars were towed and submitted to the DMV for sale approval on the same days and were valued exactly the same by the tower and by the DMV. The inherent inaccuracy of manual transcription meant some duplicate rows were not identical because of human error. We rereviewed nearly 2,000 rows where all but one variable matched, dropping an additional 900 duplicates.
Sometimes, a towing company submitted a new form for the same vehicle. We removed the first form and kept the resubmission when the tow date and VIN matched. Sometimes, it was impossible to decipher a handwritten number. We used our best judgment, generally picking interpretations closest to other dates visible on the form.
To check if high-value luxury cars were in disrepair, we joined our database with the Connecticut Crash Data Repository. Because we could only join the data by tow date, make and year, our counts of cars that were not involved in crashes is an undercount.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from hesstongrocerystore.com)A grocery store like you’ve never seen.
Sometimes there’s a small-town voice in my head that wants to believe, that chides me for being too skeptical, that wants me to join the boosterism chorus. It’s me from another dimension. And it whispers things like this:
I mean, it was going to be a grocery store like the Ritz is a hotel. Yeah, it would be a place where you could buy milk and eggs and maybe some Hamburger Helper for dinner, but that’s like saying you go to Vegas to buy a lottery ticket. Know what I mean? The damn grocery store was going to be a certifiable work of art, a place — no, a destination! — that would draw people from all over just to say they shopped there.
You wouldn’t even have to park outside.
All underground parking, so you don’t have to get wet in the rain or cold in the snow. Lots of lighting and climate-controlled. Even parking and charging stations for your golf carts. No stairs to climb. An elevator would take you up to the store, just like you was going to heaven.
That was the pitch, right down to the parking. You can look it up yourself. Jobs for up to 50 people, a “Delicatessen-style restaurant,” a bakery and German food items in keeping with local heritage. The price tag was something like $20 million, and while there are cheaper ways to get a grocery store, they lacked the vision of this one rich guy.
It would be smack in the middle of this town in Kansas, a little place called Hesston that has 3,500 people tops, a nice town founded in 1886. It’s about 40 minutes north of Wichita. You know the kind of place, full of nice folks where you’d feel safe raising your kids. But like a lot of these burgs it’s been struggling lately, and the last grocery store went bust a few years ago.
That’s where the rich guy comes in.
His name is Brad Heppner. He’s 59 and lives in Texas, but he grew up at Hesston. There’s a video of him at a town meeting last year, and he talks about his connection to the town, about how he’s a sixth-generation Kansan and his people were one of the three founding families of the town way back when, and it’s like listening to somebody read all those begats from Genesis. It’s easy to understand why people trusted him.
He’s kind of a Sunflower Gatsby, see?
He made a lot of money in finance. Started a company and sold it to Lehman Brothers — yeah, the firm that went bust in 2008 — and he has a mansion in Dallas called “Sunfields Manor” where he has these big parties for his rich friends. He also has an estate named after himself out in the middle of nowhere Texas with its own heliport. Can you imagine that?
He founded this other company with a funny name — Beneficial or Beneficient or something, but Brad just calls it “Ben” — with this genius idea of creating a pawnshop for the rich. No, really. I guess the rich need pawnshops like the rest of us do, except instead of your dad’s Stratocaster they’re hocking their private equity or art treasures or vintage Duesenbergs for quick cash.
Brad came back to Kansas and set up a subsidiary for this pawnshop deal because his 80-something mom told him there wasn’t a grocery store in town anymore. He promised to build her one. That’s the story he told just about everyone. He told it to the town, to lawmakers, to the governor. You can look at this video of him saying it. He convinced just about everybody to get on board with the idea, and four years ago he convinced the state Legislature to let him launch the world’s first TEFFI — that’s the name for this kind of pawnshop, and it stands for technology and fiduciary and some other things, but it kind of makes my head hurt to think about it. See, the lawmakers were smart and ignored the Kansas bank commissioner who said there ought to be more regulation, because regulation just stifles business. It was all fine, because 2.5% of every transaction would be earmarked for economic development and, you know, the grocery store.
It would all go through a private nonprofit foundation run by Brad and his wife and their friends and associates, so you knew the money would be safe. Heck, the Heppners even gave $6.5 million to get it started. I mean, this was a great deal, and although nobody really understood how the pawnshop worked, everybody could see the potential. This is why there was such bipartisan support for it in Topeka.
What could go wrong?
Brad said Ben would be so successful there would be lots of TEFFIs popping up in Kansas, maybe 40 or 50 in a couple of years, and the money would roll in, all at no risk to Kansans. That money would come from rich people all over the world, maybe even people in Russia, he said. Imagine that! All those rubles helping to fund a grocery store in Kansas. Only in America!
There was going to be so much money to burn that the plan for the grocery store kept getting bigger and bigger. And it wasn’t just going to be a grocery store, it was going to be an entire shopping experience in downtown Hesston, with buildings made to look like they were straight out of 1886 and new spaces for the city offices. There would be child care and public transportation and all sorts of family-friendly fun.
Then Ben — the big company out of Texas — merged with an even bigger company and its stock went public and was being traded on the NASDAQ. That was a couple of years ago, and shares were going for more than $600. But you know, things have been tough since then, and last time I checked the price of a share was about 50 cents. That might sound bad, but it’s really a great opportunity to invest. Got a buck in your pocket? You could own a couple of shares of Ben.
And I hate to even mention this part, but the feds were looking into some of Brad’s past deals, right from the start. Then this summer some attorneys began asking questions about accounting procedures, and Brad was like, Hey, don’t you know all I’ve done for you? So he resigned rather than answer questions. Can you blame him? Talk about ingratitude. Brad even said it might be about time to shut down the company.
Even after Brad left, people wouldn’t leave him alone. You know how people are. Especially the government.
The feds arrested Brad on Nov. 4 and charged him with securities fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy, making false statements to auditors and falsification of records. Can you believe it?
The indictment alleges Brad misappropriated more than $150 million from a firm, GWG Holdings, forcing it into bankruptcy and causing $1 billion in losses to its investors. The feds claim the money was funneled through a shell company, and about $40 million was used to renovate the mansion in Dallas and his ranch estate. The feds also say he spent half a million bucks on jewelry.
Get this, here’s what the federal prosecutor, a guy named Jay Clayton, said:
“As alleged, Heppner abused his role as a public company executive to loot the company and to funnel money into his own pockets. When executives like Heppner lie and cheat to enrich themselves at the expense of everyday investors, they corrupt the integrity of our public markets.”
Whoa! Where does this guy get off? He just doesn’t get that Heppner is a job creator, somebody who gets things done, an individual who just wanted to help his hometown. I don’t see the feds rushing to build a grocery store for Hesston.
Now the foundation that’s in charge of building the grocery store says it’s going to have to scale back the plans. No climate-controlled underground parking.
For crying out loud, they’re going to ruin things for all of us.
Beneficient is run by different folks now, and they admit that Brad might have oversold the pawnshop idea. But, they said, the idea might still work and that they were committed to building “fundamental value,” whatever that is. They seem like nice folks. The interim CEO told lawmakers that the company was on the same side as law enforcement.
“You don’t have to be a Venezuelan drug cartel boat driver to know that you want to be on the government side of that,” he said, which I thought was kind of a weird thing to say, if you want to know the truth.
Brad entered a “not guilty” plea on Monday, Nov. 10, so I guess he’s going to fight. The feds arrested him in Texas but hauled him to New York, where the charges were filed. Figures. According to the indictment, they’re looking to take away Brad’s mansion and the ranch.
He’s presumed innocent until proven guilty.
Damn right!
This all reminds me somehow of a book I was made to read in high school about a guy named Gatsby. You know the story. Gatsby’s the hero, and he gets the girl and has this big house and has all these parties. I didn’t make it to the end of the book because it was so long, but I do remember something about a green light.
That’s what we all want out of life, right? A green light.
That’s not what it means. And Gatsby winds up dead.
Shut up!
When I was a kid, the highlight of my week was when I’d go with my mom to the local Piggly Wiggly and maybe be allowed to get a comic book from the rack near the front. Imagining the $20 million grocery store Brad was going to build, I had kind of the same feeling. You didn’t know if you were going to get a Fantastic Four or a Spider-Man, but you knew it was going to be good.
There won’t be any comic books for us now, just a lousy Bazooka Joe wrapper.
But the thing that bothers me most is thinking about Brad’s mom. She’s in her 80s, and everybody says she’s a great lady. It looks like she’ll never have the chance to go to the dream grocery store with Brad and park underground and go up the elevator. That makes me sad in the same way as when I think about when I learned there wasn’t a Santa Claus. I’ll bet it makes her sad, too.
Okay, we finally agree.

But are they always honest  when flyers face delays?","You ever get the sense the airlines are lying to you?
Sure, the government shutdown wasn’t their fault. But are they always honest — in this instance and others — when flyers face delays?


How often has a promised 20-minute delay morphed into an hour?  And then another hour?  And maybe even a cancellation?
Because these most recent delays were beyond their control (they can blame Congress), airlines were not required to do much… aside from apologize.  Some did offer meal vouchers and hotel rooms, but for the most part travelers were on their own as schedules and staff were juggled.
Overall, the federal shutdown is estimated to have cost airlines, hotels, and car-rental companies about $1 billion a week.  And that’s not even counting the cost to travelers for their time and expenses.
But when the airlines say, “We apologize for the delay, but it’s not our fault,” there are some things they can and do control, especially as they drive for maximum revenue on every flight… like paid-for seat assignments, one of the so called “junk fees.”
A U.S. Senate report says one airline alone, United, raked in $1.3 billion just for letting passengers pick their seats… more than the $1.2 billion they earned for handling checked bags.
Assigned seats ease the boarding process and give fliers what they want… aisle access, that comfy middle seat or, my favorite, the window seat.  I want to see where I’m flying and I’ll pay to get it.
So imagine the outrage of passengers on several airlines who paid $15 – $30 for a window seat and found it had no window!
United and Delta airlines are now facing a class action suit potentially affecting more than a million passengers who were affected, paying for window seats with no windows.  It’s just the way the aircraft were built and the seats were laid out, so the airlines knew before offering those seat reservations.
If they knew the ‘window seats’ had no windows, why not warn passengers before they click?
(I encountered the same problem on Amtrak on its new NextGen Acela, choosing a window seat in advance only to board the new train and find a bulkhead and no window.) 
What’s the airline’s defense?  Well, they say that just because it’s called a window seat doesn’t mean you get a window… that the seat name refers more to its placement nearest the fuselage vs the aisle.
In its defense, United’s attorneys literally said “The use of the word ‘window’ in reference to a particular seat cannot reasonably be interpreted as a promise that the seat will have an exterior window view.”
Really. That’s what they said.
All of which reminds me of former bosses at Metro-North in the bad old pre-COVID days of over-crowded, standing-room-only trains.  When one passenger suggested a refund for not getting a seat he was told, “You’re paying for transportation.  We never promised you a seat.”
Such customer service!",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/window-view-1024x894.jpg,,,2025-11-16 04:56:28.249955

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)Calvin Duncan, who was wrongfully convicted of murder 40 years ago and sentenced to life in prison, was elected clerk of Orleans Parish Criminal Court Saturday night, handily defeating established incumbent Darren Lombard.
Duncan claimed 68% of the vote with all precincts reporting their results. Turnout for the election was 21.5%. 
The campaign between two Democrats saw Republican state Attorney General Liz Murrill challenge Duncan’s claim that he had been exonerated. She sent him a letter before the October primary election, saying he needed to “cease representing to the public that you were ‘exonerated’ to avoid further action from this office.” 
Court records confirm Duncan’s name was cleared in 2021.
Lombard also called into question Duncan’s criminal status during public debates and in a lawsuit that accused his opponent of making false claims in violation of state election laws. An Orleans Parish judge denied Lombard’s request for a temporary restraining order to halt Duncan’s campaign advertising. 
In addition to his own experience as a defendant, Duncan was a “jailhouse lawyer” while serving time at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, helping other incarcerated people with their post-conviction filings. 
After his release, Duncan earned a bachelor’s degree in paralegal studies from Tulane University and received his law degree from Lewis and Clark Law School. He founded the Light of Justice Program, which provides assistance to the incarcerated.
Duncan was given a life sentence for the shooting death of  David Yeager, 23, during an Aug. 7, 1981, armed robbery in the Tremé neighborhood. Yeager’s girlfriend, Kristi Emberling, was with him when he was shot and identified Duncan as his killer in March 1982. Police showed her a mugshot of Duncan, who was 18 at the time Yaeger was killed, taken when he was 14 years old.
The Innocence Project of New Orleans, now known as Innocence and Justice Louisiana, began representing Duncan in 2004. Its attorneys questioned the accuracy of Emberling’s identification, noting she said she was convinced that Duncan was the shooter only after she was him on television in handcuffs after being arrested. 
The defense team also compelled the release of withheld police documents in New Orleans in Portland, Oregon, where Duncan had moved to join a Job Corps program and was arrested. 
The documents revealed discrepancies in the investigation, which was led in Clackemas County by a detective who would later be convicted of illegal wire tapping in a separate case. The same detective had told Duncan he has been identified by his two prominent gold front teeth, which wasn’t true.
Mounting issues with the case led then Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro to vacate Duncan’s murder conviction in 2011 and allow him to plead guilty to manslaughter and attempted armed robbery. Duncan was resentenced to 49 years in prison but released for the time he had served. Cannizzaro, who now leads the criminal division in Murrill’s office, was an assistant DA involved in Duncan’s prosecution in 1985.
In 2021, the Louisiana Legislature approved a law to allow defendants who’ve pleaded guilty to challenge their convictions if evidence of their innocence was withheld from court. Duncan sought such relief and after a judge vacated his 2011 conviction, current Orleans District Attorney Jason Williams dropped the charges against him. 
The clerk’s post puts Duncan in charge of record keeping for Orleans Parish Criminal Court, and he’ll oversee all elections in the city. 
Lombard will leave office after one term, having won the citywide post in 2021 after serving as clerk of the city court in Algiers since 2012. 
The incumbent’s chances to stay office in took a hit over the summer when it was discovered that several boxes of criminal court records, some dating back to the 1950s, were mistaken taken to a city landfill. Lombard blamed Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration for trashing the documents without his approval. The city had provided space to store records for the clerk’s office, which had run out of room for storage. Lombard said he and his staff scoured the landfill and recovered a significant portion of the paperwork.
Williams has been critical of Lombard’s financial management, claiming the clerk is responsible for failing to secure $500,000 in bail revenue intended for the court and the district attorney. Lombard said he has worked with Williams to resolve the fiscal issues, according to a report from Verite.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20250926_CZB_CalvinDuncan_05-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-16 00:56:54.109721

RANDOLPH — Vermont’s state chapter of the Democratic Party has a new leader — and he’s taking the helm at a challenging moment for the party in Vermont and across the country. 
Lachlan Francis, a political consultant from Westminster and former chair of the Windham County Democratic committee, was elected state party chair on Saturday at Vermont Democrats’ biennial reorganization meeting. Francis beat out one other candidate for the job — Justin Willeau of Vershire, the former secretary of Orange County’s Democratic committee and owner of a coffee business — by 33 votes to 12.
The two candidates were vying to succeed outgoing party chair Jim Ramsey, who’d held the job on an interim basis since February but opted not to seek it again. Ramsey took on the role with less than a full, two-year term left after former chair David Glidden resigned.
Also on Saturday, the party reelected its current vice chair — Amanda Gustin of Barre City — to another two-year term, as well as a slate of other statewide officers who oversee the party’s electoral strategy and manage its finances.
Only the race for chair was contested. The roughly four dozen people who voted in Saturday’s election, held on the Vermont State University campus in Randolph, were largely members of county Democratic committees from across the state. 
Francis steps into the job a week after Vermont’s Republican Party also elected a slate of top officers for the next two years. A key focus for Democrats — who are likely to maintain control in the 2026 election of both the state House and Senate — will be winning back seats the party lost in 2024. That’s when the state GOP flipped a historic number of seats in both chambers, dismantling powerful Democratic supermajorities.
Many of those races were colored by voters’ concerns over the cost of living and how safe they feel in their communities. The extent of Democrats’ success in 2026 will hinge on the party’s ability to find messages that resonate with many of the voters who spurned its candidates — some of them incumbents — in races a year ago. 
Meanwhile, at the national level, Democrats are grappling with what flavor of left-wing politics could appeal to the most voters as they attempt to win back control of both houses of Congress next year and set the stage for a White House win in 2028. 
The national party has also been divided in recent days over decisions by some members of its Congressional caucuses to break ranks and join most Republicans on a spending deal that ended the federal government shutdown, but without a guaranteed extension of enhanced health insurance tax credits. (All three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation voted against the measure.)
“Obviously, we’ve got a lot on our plate — to say the least,” Francis said Saturday in brief remarks after the results of the vote were announced. He added in a press release issued later Saturday that, as chair, he would “strengthen our grassroots infrastructure across the state, support candidates who put people first, and ensure that we make Democratic values winning values in every election, in every community.”Francis previously managed now-U.S. Rep. Becca Balint’s first campaign for Vermont state Senate and worked on one of former Vermont Attorney General TJ Donovan’s campaigns for that office. More recently, he has worked as a researcher at Global Strategy Group, a national Democratic polling firm based in New York City.

At age 29, Francis also brings more youth to Vermont Democrats’ ranks. His election Saturday makes him one of the youngest state Democratic Party chairs in the country, according to May Hanlon, the Vermont Democrats’ executive director. Hanlon herself is 26, which makes her the youngest Democrat in her role in the country, she said. 
To be sure, much of the state GOP’s success in last year’s election was thanks to campaigning by Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who continues to be among the country’s most popular governors. In recent polling Scott also remains popular with Vermont Democratic voters who have a propensity to split their tickets on Election Day. 
A major question facing the state Democratic Party in the first half of 2026 is whether it will run a challenger to Scott, assuming he runs for reelection, who would make for substantial competition. In the last two election cycles, Scott trounced his Democratic opponents, both of whom had relatively little name recognition across the state. 
Two state Democratic heavyweights — Treasurer Mike Pieciak and Attorney General Charity Clark — have been rumored to be eyeing the Fifth Floor job though have not publicly said yet whether they’re running.
Both Pieciak and the state party have been especially critical of many of Scott’s responses to actions taken by President Donald Trump’s administration in recent months.
Willeau, in his pitch to the room on Saturday, suggested the party take a less offensive stance against Scott — whom he called “our favorite punching bag” — because of the five-term governor’s popularity with Democratic voters.
“I think the question is, does this committee represent Democratic voters the way they actually vote?” he asked. “And, if it doesn’t — how well do we know ourselves?”

GLACIER — For going on three decades, Patricia “Patty” Davis was a fixture in the Glacier post office.
Her son said she always had music playing as she worked and used to bring her black dog, Bear, with her behind the counter.
“She was just a pillar of the community,” co-worker Jennie Ablondi said. “She was like the second mom to everyone.”
Davis, 70, died of heart complications on Nov. 1. Her passing has left Glacier residents not only mourning her loss, but also fearing for the future of the post office.
Rumors that the United States Postal Service plans to shut it down completely caused alarm this week in the rural community that relies heavily on physical mail. Cell service in the town is poor, while landline phones and WiFi are cut off during frequent power outages.
Glacier’s post office was not accepting outgoing mail on Monday, Nov. 10. The next closest post offices are in Maple Falls, almost 8 miles away, and in Deming, almost 20 miles away. Many locals do not get mail service to their homes.

Using the Maple Falls post office would present additional logistical challenges, in part because it is in a different zip code, said Glacier Water District Commissioner Deborah Ellen Baker. And she noted businesses having to change their address to another area would cause confusion. There are 215 mailboxes at the Glacier location, according to Baker.
“Currently, there is no updated information to provide” about plans for the Glacier post office, USPS spokesperson Janella Herron wrote in an email Wednesday, Nov. 12. She added she would respond again “as soon as I have any further feedback.”
In a Wednesday statement, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray wrote, “The post office in Glacier is not only an important part of the town’s history, but it’s essential to residents who visit every day to send and receive mail, get their medications, and so much else.”
“If this post office shuts down,” she added, “people in Glacier will be forced to travel much longer to get the basic mail services they rely on — I’m reaching out to USPS for more information and answers.”
On Monday, about 19 residents gathered in front of the post office entrance, some holding signs with messages like, “Save Glacier’s post office,” and “Deliver us from closure.”
Glacier Water District, which owns the building, doesn’t charge USPS for the space, Baker said. In fact, Davis paid a monthly $40 utility fee — the minimum the district could charge, Baker said — out of her own pocket.
Fay Catron, who joined the protest Monday, has lived in the area for almost 15 years. When her family first moved into their remote home, getting an address took some time, she said.
“Being out here, we don’t have a whole lot,” Catron said. “And so we — I — rely on this post office a lot.”
If the post office shuts down, Catron said, she may have to take time off work to get packages. She gets things by mail, she explained, because in this remote area it’s “an hour to anything.”
Some, like Diane Gilbraith, rely on the post office for prescriptions. Gilbraith, 80, said as she gets older, “I know my world is getting smaller. But the essentials are here.”
Getting medication by mail is “really important,” she said, “because I know it’s going to get to the point where I won’t be able to drive into town.”
There’s also a social aspect to the significance of the small office, which has a bulletin board for the town and a bookshelf that serves as a mini library.
“It’s our lifeline,” 50-year Glacier resident Jan Eskola said of the post office. “When the mail comes in, it’s a place where we can all gather and share information and ideas.”
After the protest dispersed, all was quiet again at the post office. Kodi Sortino stopped by to pick up her mail. The town has many elderly residents, Sortino said, for whom it would be hard to travel far for mail.
“Why make them go all that way and go through all the hassle of changing their town and all that nonsense?” she asked. Sortino, who’s lived in Glacier for 15 years, has most of her mail delivered to the post office.
Even if the post office stays open, locals will feel Davis’ absence. She took over running the post office in 1999 and had been there ever since.
“It’s just a small community,” Sortino said. “Everybody’s like family.”
Graham Davis said his mom was “my best friend since the day I was born.” She loved music, from The Beatles to Roy Orbison to Enya. Everybody knew Bear, her late dog and work companion.
Gilbraith said she never saw Davis lose her temper. “She just took care of people,” Gilbraith said. “That’s what she did.”
Sortino described Davis as a “free spirit,” someone who “just told you how it was.” It was always fun to chat with Davis on Ablondi on Sortino’s daily post office visits, she said.
“She was like — I don’t want to say a mom, more like an auntie to me,” Sortino said.
“I miss her,” she added. “It will be different without her.”
Graham Davis noted his mother “specifically requested that people celebrate her memory by listening to the song ‘Spirit in the Sky’ by Norman Greenbaum.”

It would abandon our 2030 emissions targets, gut our most effective programs, and lock Massachusetts into the very fossil fuel dependence that has driven today’s affordability crisis.","MASSACHUSETTS IS KNOWN as a leader in clean energy and climate action. Our policies have lowered emissions, created jobs, and helped families save money on energy. But a bill currently under consideration in the House of Representatives on Beacon Hill threatens to undo that progress and would be a damaging mistake for our state.  
This bill, proposed by Rep. Mark Cusack, the co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, is essentially a fossil fuel industry wish list. It rolls back the Commonwealth’s enforceable 2030 climate targets, weakens the Mass Save energy efficiency program, eliminates efforts designed to make energy efficiency more affordable for working families, and even resurrects the disastrous “pipeline tax” that would allow utilities to charge residents for unnecessary gas infrastructure. In short, it hands fossil fuel companies a gift while leaving Massachusetts households to foot the bill.  
At a moment when President Trump is dismantling federal climate policy, this bill would do the work for him. It would abandon our 2030 emissions targets, gut our most effective programs, and lock Massachusetts into the very fossil fuel dependence that has driven today’s affordability crisis. It would cede our hard-earned reputation as a clean energy innovator and put our economy, our health, and our climate at risk.  
Our lawmakers must be clear on what’s really driving high energy costs: it’s not clean energy. It’s fossil fuels, gas infrastructure, and aging transmission systems.  
In 2023 alone, Massachusetts consumers spent $20 billion on energy in their homes and businesses. Programs like Mass Save delivered over $34 billion in savings between 2012 and 2023 and generated more than $3 for every $1 invested. The program is the only tool we have that actively reduces energy burden for all of us, including low- and moderate-income households that are hardest hit by rising energy costs. 
Mass Save has weatherized 350,000 homes (including 70,000 low-income homes), created nearly 76,000 jobs, and saved the equivalent output of five power plants. Even if you’ve never used it directly, you’ve benefited from lower wholesale energy prices because your neighbors did. These are real savings in people’s wallets.  
By rolling back these programs and weakening enforceable climate targets, House members would lock the state into an outdated, expensive fossil fuel system. Weakening the 2030 climate target removes enforceable benchmarks that ensure our government takes the action we demand.  
Without those benchmarks, Massachusetts risks falling behind while other states, and the world, invest in the clean energy technologies of the future. Communities that are already most vulnerable to pollution and climate impacts—low-income and environmental justice communities—will feel the consequences first.  
The House also risks undermining the thriving clean energy economy Massachusetts has built.  
Our clean energy sector supports more than 115,000 workers, there are over 7,500 energy businesses statewide, and the clean energy industry has added more than $15.9 billion to the state’s economy since 2012. Clean energy is not just good for our planet; it’s good for our wallets. Weakening climate laws now would send a chilling signal to investors, slow innovation, and damage our long-term economic growth, not to mention dirty the clean air and water we deserve.  
This bill tells the rest of the nation that when federal leadership falters, Massachusetts folds. It tells clean energy workers that their jobs don’t matter. It tells communities on the front lines of climate and pollution that their health is negotiable.  
But that’s not who we are. Massachusetts became a clean energy and climate leader by setting ambitious goals. We still have five years to hit our 2030 targets. Our legislators must reject this fossil fuel gift and recommit to a future built on affordability, innovation, and climate responsibility. A vote for this bill is a vote to cede our leadership to the Trump administration and the fossil fuel lobby. A vote against it is a vote for Massachusetts – to protect our progress, our economy, and our environment.  
The choice is simple: Massachusetts can lead, or we can go back. The people of Massachusetts deserve leadership.

(Photo by Tracy Brooks | courtesy of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service).Lawyers for multiple conservation organizations argued during a hearing in Helena on Friday new Montana regulations around wolves could harm the species long term.
Several new state regulations, including new rules allowing for the killing of up to 558 wolves during the current hunting season, could put the species at risk of “severe population depletion,” they argued.
The conservation groups, WildEarth Guardians, the Earth and Land Institute, Footloose Montana, and the Gallatin Wildlife Association are asking First Judicial District Court Judge Christopher Abbott for a preliminary injunction to stop the 2025-2026 wold hunting regulations from going into effect. 
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission, which sets policy and regulations for the department, are the defendants in the suit, which is attached to a legal battle stretching back to 2022 over state wolf laws. The Outdoor Heritage Coalition and Montana Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife are intervenors due to a similar lawsuit they brought against the state, but arguing wolf hunting regulations are too lenient.
“We’re here today because the state’s own population projections indicate that Montana’s wolf population will plummet if defendants are permitted to implement their plan,” Jessica Blome, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told the court on Friday.
Those new rules include increased wolf pelt reimbursement maximums and usage of night vision scopes on private land, in addition to an increased hunting quota. In arguments, the state said just one wolf has been killed this year at night. There have been 62 wolves killed so far this hunting season. Attorneys for the conservation groups also argued it’s a violation of the state constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment.
The state is operating on the assumption that 15 breeding pairs and 450 total wolves in Montana is enough for the species to survive. In their verbal arguments on Friday, a state lawyer said there are a little more than 1,000 wolves in Montana. That number is in dispute and lawyers for the conservation groups said only about half that number is confirmed to exist.
“Expert evidence will also show the defendants do not know how many wolves are in the state of Montana,” Susann Bradford, an attorney for the conservation groups said. “They will not know when they achieve the arbitrary number of 450 wolves, and they cannot ensure that the population will stay above this number, or that it is sufficient to sustain the necessary breeding population to ensure genetic health and is sustainable.”
The state’s arguments centered around defending its scientific practices and that the conservation groups can’t prove that 2025-26 wolf hunting regulations will harm the species long term. 
The state — in this case, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks — also argued they’re being told to bring the wolf population down.
“The reason that the quota was so high this year was due to the fact that we have not recognized a decent reduction in the population in our eyes, that it has remained stable,” said Alex Scolavino, a lawyer for the state. “And we are statutorily mandated to reduce the wolf population.”
An attorney the intervenors, Gary Leistico also spoke in the state’s defense during the hearing. Outdoor Heritage Coalition is wrapped up in a separate lawsuit in Sanders County saying the state hasn’t reduced the wolf population.
Abbott said he would rule on the preliminary injunction soon. The wolf hunting season goes until March 15, and the trapping season begins Dec. 1 in some areas pf the state.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RSGrayWolf_Tracy_Brooks_Mission_Wolf_USFWS_FPWC_HIGHRES-hpr-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-11-15 13:56:57.395623

It’s not a novel observation to say that supporters of President Donald Trump and supporters of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders find common ground on many issues. They often share a skepticism of entrenched power and a desire to dismantle systems that they think have ceased to serve everyday people.
In Indiana, this agreement includes a distrust of data centers.
“The MAGA crowd and the Bernie bros have both figured out that they’ve been getting duped,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, an Indianapolis-based consumer and environmental advocacy nonprofit. “It was data centers that really brought it all together.”
Olson’s organization is running a campaign to persuade Indiana lawmakers to place a moratorium on new data centers and to redesign electricity rates to protect residential consumers from rate increases related to data center development.
He has received an emphatic response, with groups from the left, right and in-between booking him for speaking engagements and offering their assistance.
Election results last week confirm a similar dynamic in much of the country. Democrats won races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia and for two open seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, campaigns in which data centers and rising electricity costs were issues. Media outlets noted this pattern, including in an insightful report from Jael Holzman of Heatmap and a look ahead to next year’s elections from Marc Levy and Jesse Bedayn of the Associated Press.
Much of the discussion is about data centers, which are often large developments used to support cloud computing or artificial intelligence. But the underlying issues are broader, touching on the power of tech companies. For people who live near proposed data centers, there is an additional sense of powerlessness, which Inside Climate News has documented across the country, including the backlash to a plan for a huge data center in Bessemer, Alabama.
“It’s about big tech,” Olson said. “To steal Bernie’s words, [it’s about] these big tech oligarchs that are calling all the shots at every single level of government right now.”
I also see some similarities with local opposition to large wind and solar projects, a subject I’ve written a lot about over the years. A common theme is that residents feel frustrated when powerful companies want to make changes that would alter local landscapes.
Olson said he agrees that there is some overlap between opposition to data centers and large renewable energy development, but he views the latter as more of a rural phenomenon, while concern about data centers is rising almost everywhere.
Google scrapped its plans for a large data center in Indianapolis in September amid local backlash. In northwest Indiana, residents in the small city of Hobart have organized to oppose two data centers, raising concerns about the projects’ electricity and water consumption.
It’s notable that the opposition tends to highlight concerns about high electricity bills, but doesn’t talk as much about data centers’ negative climate impacts. Indiana can see the ramifications as officials push to delay the retirement of coal-fired power plants so the state can meet an expected surge in electricity demand, driven, in part, by data centers.
Political candidates can harness this mounting opposition and data center companies will need to devote more resources to engaging with the public.
Vivek Shastry, a senior research associate at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told me that it’s important for the AI and data center industries to find ways to provide local benefits to host communities and to minimize any negative effects on household electricity costs.
He touched on these subjects in a recent blog post, co-written with his colleague Diana Hernández. When I read this, my first thought was, “Wait, there are local benefits?”
He explained that there are opportunities in terms of energy and money. He pointed to examples in Denmark and Finland of data centers harnessing their waste heat to contribute to district heating systems for local communities.
Beyond that—which I think would be a challenge to do in the United States—he said AI and data center developers can make community benefits part of their proposals. This could mean working with local leaders to find ways to address local needs through philanthropy.
“To the extent that there is a partnership with communities, and there are these pathways to enable tangible co-benefits,” he said.
The opposite can also be true, with local communities feeling like they are bearing the burden of a data center with few, if any, benefits.
Shastry’s larger point is that government officials and corporate leaders need to make sure that development does not harm the most vulnerable consumers by driving up costs of water and electricity. To do otherwise would feed into consumer unrest.
“It’s important to get those processes and protections right early on, because the pace of this growth is such that once you lock into certain kinds of rates and other pathways, it then becomes harder to reverse,” Shastry said.
Voters are already getting upset about electricity rate increases that they blame on data centers, even though the AI industry is in its infancy. The negative effects, if left to fester, could get much worse.
But there also is evidence that state officials have a sense of the challenge before them. The NC Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University shows this in its most recent quarterly report, the 50 States of Power Decarbonization.
From July to September, state regulators or legislators took 55 actions in 29 states related to laws or rules for large electricity users, which were usually motivated by the growth of data centers.
Some highlights:

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved a proposal from the utility American Electric Power to create a new rate category for data centers that have electricity demand of at least 25 megawatts. Businesses in this category have special requirements, including that they must sign a 12-year contract. The practical effect is that data centers that close or use much less power than planned will still need to pay, which can help to shield other customers from covering the costs of lines and other infrastructure built to serve these large projects.


Florida Power & Light, a utility, entered into a settlement with other parties in a rate case that includes new rate categories for large power users such as data centers. The rates would cover new projects that need at least 50 megawatts, with provisions requiring companies to pay even if they use less power than planned. The Office of Public Counsel has said the settlement is “disproportionately favorable” to corporate interests.


In Delaware, the Public Service Commission staff and the Division of the Public Advocate jointly requested that the utility, Delmarva Power and Light, institute a new rate category for customers that need at least 25 megawatts. Delmarva responded by saying it would like the commission to hold a hearing on the subject.

As recently as two years ago, there was almost no activity in this policy area. Next year at this time, I expect to see action in nearly every state.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:
IEA Report Points to Oil Peak and Continuing Renewables Surge, But Trump Has Hurt Progress: The world remains on track to reach peak oil in about 2030 if countries stick to their stated policies, according to the new edition of the World Energy Outlook from the International Energy Agency. But this outlook is worse for the climate than the one issued last year, due in large part to changes in climate policy by President Donald Trump, as my colleague Blanca Begert reports. One key difference is that the drop-off from the peak would be more gradual than the agency had previously indicated. The peak and ensuing decline in fossil fuels would be driven by the rapid growth of carbon-free electricity sources such as wind and solar.
How the Trump Administration Is Seeking to Gut the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations: The Trump administration is proposing a $0 budget for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, underscoring how far the office has fallen since it was a key part of planning for the country’s energy future, as Maria Gallucci reports for Canary Media. The office, which is part of the Department of Energy, was created by Congress in 2021 and received $27 billion to fund projects to scale up clean energy technologies. The sudden shift in funding priorities is ceding leadership to other countries, especially China, and is baffling to people who were connected to the office.
Sunrun Reports a Quadrupling of Participation in Virtual Power Plants: Sunrun, the rooftop solar and battery company, said 106,000 of its customers are now participating in home-to-grid virtual power plant programs, which is an increase of more than 400 percent from a year ago, as Brian Martucci reports for Utility Dive. Sunrun also said its business model, which encourages solar leasing and monthly subscription fees, positions the company to maintain growth even after an expected sales cliff in the rooftop solar industry when federal tax credits expire at the end of the year.
Green Steelmaking Advocates Look for Paths Forward Without U.S. Government Support: The Trump administration’s policies are reducing support for green steelmaking, leading companies and advocates to figure out how to maintain momentum in the short run, as my colleague Kiley Bense reports. The Ohio River Valley Institute, a nonprofit that promotes economic growth and clean energy in Appalachia, issued a report summarizing the effects of federal actions, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s phaseout of a tax credit for clean hydrogen in 2027 rather than the previous 2032.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS — A decade of court oversight of special education services in New Orleans public schools, the result of a legal settlement, will most likely cease by the end of the year, the judge presiding over the legal settlement said Wednesday.
The decision, if it comes to pass, would come at the request of the Louisiana Department of Education and the Orleans Parish School Board, which have been subjected to intensive monitoring under a consent decree since 2015. The agreement settled a 2010 class-action lawsuit that alleged the city’s charter schools discriminated against special education students in their application processes and did not provide them appropriate educational services, as federal law requires.
The case was brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center on behalf of parents and guardians of special-needs students in New Orleans schools. Though problems with special education continue to be identified at some New Orleans charter schools, the consent decree was intended to address systemic issues — whether the state and district are catching those issues and implementing plans to correct them — not individual students’ experiences, said U.S. District Judge Jay Zainey.

For the past eight years, an independent monitor assigned by the court has found the defendants — the Department of Education and OPSB — in substantial compliance with all provisions outlined in consent decree. Citing those findings, the state and school board earlier this year formally requested an end to the agreement.
The plaintiffs oppose terminating the settlement, arguing that the state and NOLA Public Schools district have not created sufficient monitoring, oversight or complaint systems. Their opposition hinges on a 2024 report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor that found faults in the state’s monitoring of special education programs — most districts self-reported their compliance with federal rules dictating education plans, without on-site monitoring. (However, some of those problems resulted from the fact that much of the state’s monitoring capacity has been directed toward New Orleans schools, possibly as a result of the consent decree, according to the audit report.) The audit also noted that the agency reduced the number of workers dedicated to special education between 2012 and 2019.
Lauren Winkler, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said her team has asked the district to make it easier for parents to bring issues about schools forward to the central office through creating an open complaint system on their website. That was never implemented.
“[There are] really simple solutions that are not super costly,” Winkler said. “We tried to meet with them to agree to some and they just wouldn’t.”
Winkler said noncompliance still exists in the schools. More than people contacted the Southern Poverty Law Center about their negative experiences with New Orleans schools’ special education programs ahead of this week’s hearing.
“If we didn’t have any parents coming forward with issues, we’d maybe have a different position,” Winkler said. “With the breadth of issues in the amount of people that came to us, as we’ve been preparing for this, I think that’s indicative of the systemic issues that are still here.”
But in a court filing last week, Zainey wrote that the court anticipates ending federal oversight by the end of the year.
“The consent judgement was a temporary measure and was never meant to be a permanent fixture of the school system,” Zainey said in court. “Things have been much improved from how they used to be in Orleans Parish.”
Zainey invited parents to share their experiences with the court and representatives from the Louisiana Department of Education and Orleans Parish School Board during informal hearings on Nov. 12 and 13. Most parents asked the court to continue the federal monitoring of New Orleans schools, but it’s unclear whether their statements will change Zainey’s plans. Zainey encouraged the state’s ombudsman, who connects families with resources and informs them of their rights in relation to special education, to connect with parents following their statements.
But most of the parents speaking at the informal hearing were those who had already tried, and were still trying, to seek recourse through communication with district or state officials.
Grace Thompson spoke in front of the judge Wednesday morning about her son’s experience at Audubon Gentilly. According to Thompson, her son was supposed to receive speech therapy and a one-on-one aide to help in class, but never received them. Thompson said she’s tried to seek help through the district’s accountability office, which, she said, has offered little guidance and has been “slow” and “inconsistent” in its communications.
“I’ve literally been calling them for the last year and a half,” Thompson told the judge. “They know who I am.”
Steve Corbett, CEO of Audubon Schools, said Audubon Gentilly has provided students with all necessary services and has been found fully compliant with federal special education law. The most recent state special education monitoring report found “no unresolved areas of noncompliance” at the school.
Other parents also spoke of slow communication with the district and the schools their children attend. They said their children weren’t receiving the services outlined in their individualized education plans, that their learning has regressed, that schools were slow in performing evaluations and reevaluations, and that oversight was only afforded to children with parents that could be there to actively fight for them.
District Superintendent Fateama Fulmore and state representatives were present at the hearing. In response to hearing parent concerns, Fulmore said she appreciated the opportunity to hear from them directly and that her team will follow up.
“We have an obligation to every child in this system to get this right,” Fulmore said. “We are doing better.”
Lyric Lee, a former student at Morris Jeff Community School who had an Individualized Education Program and graduated last year, said she learned at a young age how to advocate for herself, her brother and other students who have special needs. She said the consent decree should continue.
“I’ve learned when people are not kept on a watch, they feel like they don’t have to do it, and they’ll do everything possible to make sure they don’t have to,” Lee said.

The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries reported the arrests Nov. 10 following its enforcement efforts with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Coast Guard. The agencies conducted their operation Nov. 3-4. 
Wildlife and Fisheries personnel boarded oyster vessels to check oyster fishing regulation compliance, and Coast Guard and Border Protection agents reviewed crew members’ immigration status, according to an LDWF news release. 
No additional information about the immigration arrests was provided.
LDWF agents issued three citations to fishermen who did not possess seed ground gear permits and two citations for failing to report oyster harvest data. Agents seized 27 sacks of oysters and returned them to the oyster seed ground.
Oyster harvesting violations can result in a fine reaching $350 fine for each offense.

But it's also a day to think about solutions to this deadly problem.","A memorial bike for Sarah Langenkamp. (Photo by Luke Lukert/WTOP)I’ll never forget the elegant solution my wife, Sarah, came up with the day she died. She needed to get to the open house at our kids’ new elementary school while I went out of town, but our car was being shipped from abroad.  “I’ll just ride my bike,” she said.
That was not a surprising solution for Sarah, whose fitness came not just from a love of yoga and salads, but from prioritizing movement — almost any movement — in her daily life. She took the stairs, she walked a lot, and on this day, rode her bike to our kids’ school.
She was killed because of it. Literally run over by the negligent driver of a 40,000-pound truck.
I later learned that more cyclists died on U.S. roads that year, 2022, than any in U.S. history. The number in 2022, at 1,086, has only been exceeded by the number that died in 2023: 1,166.
But it isn’t just cyclists who are dying. More than 7,300 people died walking on roads in America in 2023, close to a 40-year high. Some 40,000 people die every year in vehicle crashes overall. That’s more than 100 people per day, as many as a commercial airliner, making vehicle crashes a top form of preventable death in America.

Last week, the Montgomery County Council passed a new law outlawing parking and driving in bike lanes. I thought about Sarah’s final ride when I read the flood of vitriol online responding to the news: “Another useless law … All of the biker lanes need to be removed … bicycles have no business being on the road … ”
Wow.
This Sunday is World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. It’s a day to remember people like Sarah, and a day to think about solutions to this deadly problem.
Until my retirement and before Sarah died, she and I were U.S. diplomats — State Department foreign service officers — who had lived around the world. One thing I learned living abroad is that countries that are more pleasant and safer all do a good job of making it easy to walk, ride a bike, and get around in things other than cars.
Just before her death, Sarah and I spent six months in a city in a Polish city named Rzeszow (pronounced like JESH-ohv). It was a relatively mundane town by Polish standards, but it was wonderful to us Americans, boasting a lovely town plaza, a long walking street surrounded by cafes, restaurants and stores, and clean, punctual buses and trains that could whisk you almost anywhere in Europe.
Not only was this city pleasant, it was safe. And for most of the developed world outside the United States, it is normal.
Contrast this with the vast majority of American cities today, where you are between three and four times more likely to get killed walking on a road. Here in Bethesda, there is no way for my kids to ride their bikes to school without riding on a state highway. The walking street (Bethesda Row) is a single block long. And redesigning streets can set off battles that threaten political careers.
It makes sense that people care about their roads and infrastructure. But my view is that our debate shouldn’t be about bike lanes. It should be about the type of community we want to live in.
Do we want our kids to be able to roam freely in our neighborhoods? Do we want to be able to walk to the market and church on weekends? Or do we want to be entirely dependent on our cars to go everywhere?
Americans are making their choices, and the results are visible in our dangerous and congested roads, our less healthy lifestyles, our degraded environment, and our less pleasant cities.
Sarah made the right choice the day she died. I hope one day our community will catch up to her.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/LANGENKAMP-1-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-11-15 09:56:27.938323

(Photo: Howard Hughes Holdings)Half of the $1.8 billion in private capital investment promised in the film tax credit bill may occur not at the proposed 31-acre film studio site itself but instead at Downtown Summerlin, drawing criticisms that the bill is as much a giveaway to a real estate corporation as it is a “Hollywood handout.”
The inclusion of the existing retail and office space area known as Downtown Summerlin was highlighted Friday during an Assembly Committee on Jobs meeting as lawmakers continued to debate what could be the State of Nevada’s largest ever public subsidy — $1.65 billion in transferable tax credits over 15 years to film productions. Lawmakers are currently considering the proposal, Assembly Bill 5, in a special legislative session that began Thursday.
AB5 advanced out of the Assembly committee on a 9-5 vote with a lengthy amendment, but the bill was not considered by the full chamber.
Assemblymember Gregory Koenig — a rural Republican who noted he’d only been to Summerlin “twice in his life” — asked why developments in Downtown Summerlin counted toward the capital investment requirements in the bill.
“Doing a little bit of research, there was a vast difference between the corner of Town Center (Drive) and Flamingo” Road, where the planned studio and special entertainment district would be, “and Downtown Summerlin,” the border of which is two miles down Town Center and separated from the studio site by residential neighborhoods, said Koenig.
Matt Walker with Howard Hughes Holdings said the studio is expected to bring in more business than will fit within the studio site.
“We have the ability within the entertainment district to develop the studios and the associated infrastructure. That’s about 31 acres.”
Additional acreage will include hotels, and office space for businesses “with a nexus to the studios.”
“We need to prove to the GOED board, through the proactive approval, that there is a concrete nexus between that development at Downtown Summerlin and the studios,” he added. “It’s not as if we just build a new office building and call it connected.”
AB5 has faced fierce opposition from the first hour of the special session. A surprise vote taken by the full Assembly in the early hours of the special session suggested the chamber was nearly split in support and opposition.
Opponents characterize it as a corporate giveaway to the developer Howard Hughes Holdings, the mega studios Sony Entertainment and Warner Brothers Discovery who would earn up to $120 million in transferable tax credits for shooting in state, and other large companies who would purchase the transferable tax credits and apply them to their own gaming, insurance or modified business taxes.
The lengthy amendment adopted by the Assembly committee was clearly designed to address some of the concerns raised by opponents to the bill. It included banning gaming establishments within the project, diverting the majority of the room tax generated in the studio entertainment district into an account to fund certain medical expenses for retired state employees on the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, and expanding disclosure requirements.
Also amended were requirements around diversity. Production companies will be required to submit with its application “a workforce plan” with specific goals.
Assemblymember Selena Torres Fossett, who voted against the bill in committee, characterized it as a “watering down” of diversity goals. The earlier version of the bill had diversity targets for specific professions, which the Democrat from Las Vegas said was designed to insure that diversity in hiring wasn’t limited to the lowest paying jobs associated with any film production.
Walker from Howard Hughes said the amendment aligned the bill’s diversity requirements with previous economic development programs in the state and said the amendment represented a “compromise.”
Some other notable bills
Assembly Bill 4, Gov. Joe Lombardo’s wide-ranging crime bill advanced out of an Assembly committee Friday after lawmakers adopted several minor amendments. Like the film studio bill, it can now be considered by the full Assembly.
Senate Bill 3 establishes the Silver State General Assistance Program and authorizes the state to use general funds to provide temporary support for vulnerable residents when federal funding falters. Similar programs in other states allowed them to respond more quickly to the withholding of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits by the Trump administration. SB3 passed the Senate unanimously Thursday.
Assembly Bill 1 establishes a statewide Security Operations Center to better handle cybersecurity issues, like the massive hack that brought many state services to a grinding halt in late August. The bill passed an Assembly committee Friday.
Assembly Bill 2 would exempt major gaming companies from newly established payment rules related to purchasing alcohol from wholesale liquor dealers.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Reform for something as delicately interconnected as the state’s tax system should probably be handled with a scalpel. For the second year in a row, lawmakers have instead chosen to use a scattergun.
That scattershot approach was evident at the most recent meeting of the Legislature’s Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force. At that meeting, the task force approved 19 property tax reform proposals that will be forwarded to the Legislature. Those proposals were pared down from more than two dozen. Some of the proposals that didn’t earn task force approval will likely be offered as legislation as well.
In the Legislature, it seems that ideas about how to cut property taxes are like eyebrows, everybody has one or two.
Lower spending, higher sales tax, revenue shifts: A closer look at 19 ways to reduce property taxes

It looks for all the world like lawmakers are throwing property tax reforms against the wall, hoping that one sticks. That’s a trick they learned with mixed results in this year’s session when 30 property tax bills were introduced. The only one left stuck to the wall was from Gov. Larry Rhoden. His legislation was full of enough limits, caps, exemptions and expansions to make Rube Goldberg dizzy.
At the start of the summer, the task force members had high hopes. They said they wanted to find a way to cut property taxes for homeowners by 50%. They have been hearing an ever-increasing clamor from homeowners whose total property tax payments increased by 38.8% between 2020 and 2024.
Anyone hoping that a summer’s worth of work would lead the task force to come up with a single, simple solution to property tax reform has to be disappointed. Some of the solutions considered by the task force included: school tax limits, online relief applications, formula adjustments, a new education fund, capital outlay limits, tax relief for veterans, municipal rebates, tax increment financing restrictions, school levy elections, capital outlay elections, cutting general fund spending, an owner-occupied relief fund and a $500 property tax credit.
Even the simplest of property tax reform solutions face an uphill fight in the Legislature. One simple solution was considered and rejected by the Legislature in February. If approved, House Bill 1019 would have raised the state sales tax from 4.2% to 5%.
According to Tim Goodwin, a Rapid City Republican and one of the bill’s sponsors, the excess money generated by the sales tax increase would total $280 million. Those funds would be used to pay $417 of property tax relief per each $100,000 of valuation on owner-occupied dwellings in the state.
The bill was rejected by the House State Affairs Committee on a vote of 9-2. Its rejection offers an insight into what lawmakers in the next session will be up against with their own reform proposals.
Rep. Greg Jamison, a Sioux Falls Republican, kicked off committee discussion of the bill with praise for the $417 payment per $100,000 of valuation: “That’s a healthy reduction in their property taxes. It’s probably what people want.”
Moments later, Jamison would vote against the bill.
Despite his characterization of the bill as offering taxpayers exactly what they want, Jamison reasoned that it didn’t mesh with the mood of the Legislature. His colleagues, he said, would rather cut spending than raise a tax to generate new revenue.

If legislation that gives aggrieved taxpayers exactly what they want can’t make it out of committee, it’s hard to believe that other property tax reforms are likely to succeed. With so many proposals to consider, lawmakers who want to create true reform may be forced to vote for measures that go against the grain of what they believe.
The hard decisions they face will be a test of their political courage. They may have to put aside their dismay about raising taxes so that the revenue from one tax can be used to lower another. They may need to look past their belief in local control to put new restrictions on how and when school districts and county governments can raise taxes.  No matter how much pride they take in their role running state government, they may have to take a meat cleaver to the budget with the savings earmarked for property tax relief.
The endorsement by the task force of 19 property tax reform proposals points to the complexity of the problem and a lack of clarity on how to tackle it. It doesn’t take much of a crystal ball to know that the next legislative session will see a cluster of property tax reform bills. Here’s hoping that with so many ideas on the table, lawmakers can find one that offers true, lasting property tax reform.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/591A0214e-1024x677.jpg,,,2025-11-15 07:56:34.801212

It’s still not back online yet, and the senators who worked to pass the law are furious.
The Not One More Report was the product of The Not Invisible Act of 2020, which intends to provide tribes with solutions to combat the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous people and educate the general public about the crisis. The act was signed into law by President Donald Trump in his first term.
Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a moderate Democrat from Nevada who sits on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and introduced that act, said she was “outraged” to see the report had vanished from the federal forum.
“It is astounding that an administration that actually signed these bills into law, that wants to address the issue of keeping our communities safe from violent criminals, including our tribal communities, thinks that this isn’t an important issue,” Cortez Masto told NOTUS during an interview in her Capitol Hill office.
The report was taken down amid a purge of material from federal websites that the Trump administration deemed DEI-related. Both Cortez Masto and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican senator from Alaska who chairs the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, told NOTUS that they reached out to the administration to inquire about restoring the Not One More Report.
Murkowski said that she wants the report restored “so that the information is out there.”
“If we don’t know what we don’t know, it’s pretty tough to say it’s a problem,” she said.
A commission including tribal leaders, human trafficking survivors, relatives of victims, and federal partners compiled the report from over 250 testimonies from tribal members about how the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people has affected their lives. It also gave recommendations on how to alleviate the crisis — like having the U.S. Marshals Service help tribal law enforcement address the MMIP crisis, the premise of legislation that Cortez Masto recently introduced alongside Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma.
On Feb. 3, over a dozen tribal leadership and advocacy organizations sent a letter to the administration and several high-ranking lawmakers who work on tribal affairs, urging them to preserve tribal members’ “legal status as a political class rather than a suspect racial class,” and exempt tribal nations from DEI-related crack downs. Less than a week later, Cortez Masto’s office noticed the Not One More Report was no longer available on the DOJ’s website.
“It’s an epidemic of violence against Native women, Native people,” Senate Indian Affairs Committee member Tina Smith told NOTUS. “If you want to solve a problem, you first have to see it and understand it, and that’s what that work was all about.”
Cortez Masto said that she and Murkowski sent a letter to the administration asking why the report was taken down. The White House responded it was taken down in compliance with the executive order, which Cortez Masto’s office specified was the “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” order issued on Jan. 20. Cortez Masto said she’s received no other information from the administration or an explanation on why it sees this report as a DEI issue.
The White House did not answer NOTUS’ question about whether or not it believes issues regarding missing and murdered Native Americans qualify as “DEI” issues and directed NOTUS to the DOJ. A DOJ spokesperson told NOTUS in a statement that the “report was removed to ensure compliance with OPM guidance regarding President Trump’s Executive Order Defending Women. The Commission’s report is still available on numerous external websites.”
The spokesperson added that the “joint DOJ/DOI response continues to be posted on the DOJ’s Tribal Justice and Safety website,” and included this link to a page of “archived content” that does not include the report itself. The DOJ did not answer NOTUS’ questions about whether it intends to restore the report.
The Wayback Machine shows a PDF of the report was last available on Feb. 8. A “Page not found” message appears in its place on Feb. 9. An error message was still present on that page as of Nov. 13.
When NOTUS asked Cortez Masto why she thinks the administration has kept the report off the DOJ’s website, she said: “They think they’re a race. They are ignorant to the fact of the trust and treaty obligation that we have to our tribal communities.”
“They don’t really care about addressing the violent crime in our tribal communities and Indigenous communities, and that has been very clear to me based on their reaction to the bipartisan letter from both [Murkowski] and I, to the comments that I get in the hearings when [nominees are] before me,” she continued.
Smith also described the administration’s re-classification of Native American nations from sovereign states to groups subjected to DEI.
“The Trump administration continually, and seems to me, purposefully, misunderstands the difference between Native people and tribal nations and other important and big groups in this country,” Smith said. “Tribal nations are not just another constituency. They’re sovereign nations, sovereign people, and it’s just so offensive to see that the administration isn’t interested in understanding what’s causing this epidemic of violence and what we should do about it.”
Cortez Masto said she wanted to “make it very clear to this administration” that this is not a DEI issue, and that the recommendations in the report will still continue to inspire more of her legislation.
“They can try to keep it off of the website, but the report’s there. The recommendations are there. The commission, I’m assuming, is still happening, and we’re still going to move forward to address it,” she said.

(Courtesy of Fass family)SYRACUSE, Neb. — Life on the Fass farm was a lot different before that final day of the 2021 Otoe County Fair.
Eric Fass was just one year into his role as the town’s volunteer fire chief. He and wife Amanda also had been growing a small farm they bought eight years earlier. Their three kids, like many rural youths around this city of about 2,000, were showing 4-H livestock at the fair.

But a noise spooked the leashed heifer Jaden Fass was walking with alongside her dad and others. And in a chase to regain control of the runaway animal, Eric Fass was flipped on his head. Resuscitated on the spot in an alleyway, he was rushed to a hospital with traumatic brain injury.
Doctors advised Amanda to summon family and friends — that nothing short of a miracle would pull her first responder and farmer husband, then age 37, through the night.
Four years later, the Nebraska Examiner met with the couple determined to keep pushing through. Eric is trying to regain further mobility on his left side, depends on a wheelchair and breathes through a trach tube. 
Throughout it all, the Nebraska natives have refused to give up on their shared passion to farm. But a fund that helped keep their dream alive is on uncertain ground after next year.
Nebraska AgrAbility, a 30-year-old initiative that helps farmers and ranchers with disabilities stay active in the state’s top industry, was key to opening doors to modified equipment and other support that allowed Fass to get out in the field again to do certain chores.

Led by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln extension and Easterseals Nebraska, a primary AgrAbility funding source is the U.S. Department of Agriculture. States compete for four-year grants from the USDA, and the federal government awards for current participants expire next summer.
A new slate of awardees has yet to be selected.
“It helped us get the things we needed to stay on the farm and keep doing what we love to do,” Amanda said of the program. “And to give Eric a purpose.” 
A bale buggy, five cows and a big dream
Emily Jacobson, an Easterseals rural rehab specialist and program manager for Nebraska AgrAbility, said she realized quickly upon talking to the Fasses after the July 24, 2021, injury that their goal was to keep farming. 
The couple had launched their operation in 2013 with 20 acres, a blue tractor, a bale buggy, five mama cows and, as Amanda put it, “a big dream.” Today, in partnership with other families, they own or rent a couple of hundred acres and raise a small herd that fuels a direct-to-consumer beef business.

Before the accident, Eric also had other side gigs such as underground trenching, seed cleaning and custom hay businesses. Amanda worked for the Natural Resources Conservation Service.
“It was obviously going to look different with Eric’s injuries,” said Jacobson, herself a farm-raised Nebraskan. “But they wanted to create a legacy they could pass on down to their kids.”
AgrAbility does not directly buy equipment, but a free comprehensive needs assessment by Jacobson connected the Fasses to partner agencies and resources that largely paid for such tools as a side-by-side all-terrain vehicle tailored to Eric’s needs, a pickup truck with a wheelchair lift and a specialized skid loader with options to control by hand. 
For the Fasses, the Syracuse community raised additional funds that covered costs for a motorized chair that can maneuver over tough spots and for various medical and home adaptation needs.

“There was this huge momentum for Eric to begin to realize the possibilities,” Jacobson said. “I always tell people, ‘We’re gonna modify your practices, not your dreams.’”
While Jacobson says she provides in-depth assessment and connector services to 25 to 30 Nebraska farm and ranch families challenged by health and injury setbacks each year, the program reaches several thousand a year through education-related outreach.
AgrAbility salary and operational expenses are funded by the four-year $735,000 grant from the USDA, which provides similar support to about 20 other states that also must enlist a university and a nonprofit partner to oversee the local program. Local officials are gearing up to apply for the next round of funding, and are optimistic.
The Nebraska Legislature directed a total of $600,000 to the State Department of Agriculture for this year and next to help cover costs of assistive technology for eligible farmers served by AgrAbility. The farmer is expected to contribute to the equipment expense.
However, the state is facing a $451 million projected deficit in the two-year budget cycle, and the state Ag Department, in its mid-biennium budget request submitted last month, included a $300,000 cut for the program, saying the proposed reduction was not a reflection of the program but that department officials believe it could be funded by an alternative source.











Agriculture, it’s in our blood. ... We gotta keep hanging on. 


– Amanda Fass



State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, himself a farmer who has championed AgrAbility in the Legislature, said he would do whatever possible to ensure state funding continues. 
“I know how important it is to the mental health of a farmer to continue doing what they like to do and still be productive,” he said. Murman said he wants Nebraska farmers to keep operating on their land whenever possible.

The state-federal Nebraska Vocational Rehabilitation program also provides equipment and other support to AgrAbility clients, Jacobson said.
AgrAbility participants range from ranchers suffering from arthritis to amputation or paralysis. Jacobson described Eric Fass as one of the more severe cases.
She gets choked up talking about what the family has gone through, including difficulty and expense of finding rural in-home health care workers. 
At one point, an urgent call went out to friends to locate a “sit to stand lift” to replace a broken one used to get Eric to the toilet. Even with specialized farm tools and equipment donated by AgrAbility partners and other resources, extra help and time is necessary, for example, to transfer Eric from wheelchair to farm vehicles.
“It’s put a load on Amanda’s shoulders,” Jacobson said. “Their story is quite amazing, to watch how they’ve overcome challenges and how they continue to work together.”
Work takes more time, planning
On a recent day, Amanda hoisted Eric up from his wheelchair into the driver’s seat of the modified side-by-side utility vehicle. She hopped in, and with Eric’s good arm steering, the two drove off to feed cattle.

“We do things a lot differently,” Amanda said. “Everything takes, I would say, three times longer … we have to be more careful, strategize and be really organized.”
After the accident, the Fasses downsized before starting to grow their operation again with local firefighter and friend Schuylar Argo as a partner. He lives in a camper trailer on the Fass land. 
Part of Fass Farms is the rebranded Down Home Beef business, which uses a local meat locker to process meat that’s marketed directly to consumers interested in knowing how the animal was raised. Amanda says the operation manages roughly 60 cow-calf pairs. They also source from other producers and recently bought A&E Feeds LLC. 
The Fasses have seen progress in the four years since doctors put part of Eric’s skull in his abdomen to preserve it while brain swelling went down. For example, Eric sometimes can walk short distances with a walker. Challenges continue.
“Everything we’re still doing requires someone’s assistance,” said Amanda. The left side immobility keeps Eric from running large equipment. He tires easily. Speech is created through a vibration device he holds to his neck to produce mechanical-sounding words. Amanda typically helps with conversations.
Amanda said she has at times been physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist and more to help her husband. 
Medicaid-related battles to access skilled nursing care had her in tears, she said, before an Easterseals representative came to the rescue.
Ultimately, Amanda resigned from her 20-year conservation career job due to difficulty of finding reliable in-home health care aides, she said.
Agriculture ‘in our blood’
Despite frustration, the Fasses haven’t thrown in the towel on a profession both grew up around.

“Agriculture, it’s in our blood,” Amanda said.
The couple credited programs such as AgrAbility, Easterseals and community support for offering help and hope. Jaden now is in college, sons Abe and Braxton are ages 14 and 12. More recently, a Medicaid waiver program has stabilized in-home caregiving services.
From a medical standpoint, Amanda said, the farther Eric gets from the traumatic brain injury, the less likely he is expected to improve. But the family has overcome odds so far, she noted, and “we just keep working at it.”
Amanda said the Fasses view their operation as “helping to feed the world one family at a time.”
“We gotta keep hanging on,” she said.

Meyer and others reached agreements with the county Monday for its role in the raids. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA, Kan. — The county involved in a small-town Kansas newspaper raid in 2023 will pay a cumulative $3 million to three journalists and a city councilor.
In two of the four agreements, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office also crafted a statement admitting regret.
“The Sheriff’s Office wishes to express its sincere regrets to Eric and Joan Meyer and Ruth and Ronald Herbel for its participation in the drafting and execution of the Marion Police Department’s search warrants on their homes and the Marion County Record. This likely would not have happened if established law had been reviewed and applied prior to the execution of the warrants,” the statement reads.
Marion County’s board of commissioners approved agreements Monday with Eric Meyer, the owner and editor of the Marion County Record, and Ruth Herbel, the Marion city councilor whose home was raided in tandem with the newspaper office, and two other journalists. The agreements coincide with consent judgments expected to be submitted in their federal cases against the county.
The county was a secondary player in the raids, in Meyer’s eyes, but the agreements could play a part in the paper’s ongoing cases against the city.
“Everybody involved in this is 100% convinced we are going to go to trial with the city,” Meyer said. “This will make that easier in some regard.”
The county’s agreements with Deb Gruver and Phyllis Zorn, local journalists whose lives were upended by the raids, are more akin to settlements and don’t include admissions of regret.
The county agreed to pay Meyer $1.5 million, Herbel $650,000, Zorn $600,000, and Gruver $250,000, according to copies of the agreements obtained by Kansas Reflector.
Insurance covers most of those funds, but the county must pay Meyer $50,000.
In another lawsuit against former Marion police chief Gideon Cody, who is also facing criminal charges, Gruver settled last year for $235,000.
According to Meyer, Zorn has retired from her position at the Marion County Record, effective immediately.
Monday’s deals settle the county’s obligations within four federal lawsuits against the city of Marion and Marion County governments and officials in the wake of the raids. Five cases were consolidated into a single federal lawsuit, and the four agreements give the county and the sheriff’s office immunity from any future legal action related to the Aug. 11, 2023, searches and seizures at the Marion County Record, Meyer’s home and Herbel’s home.
The county agreed to make available Marion County Sheriff Jeff Soyez, Detective Aaron Christner, and Undersheriff Larry Starkey for official interviews, which could be used in other legal disputes. Previously, the cases were stalled, preventing interviews from taking place.
Claims against the city of Marion, its police department and other officials, including former Mayor David Mayfield and former police chief Gideon Cody, are not involved in the agreements.
Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the total sum of Phyllis Zorn’s and Deb Gruver’s settlements and Zorn’s position at the Marion County Record.

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)Something deadly is happening all over the world, as well as Kansas. That something deadly is domestic violence.
Too often, women are abused emotionally or physically or both by their partners. Sometimes, women are the abusers. Whatever the case, domestic violence is horrible and it should stop.
My wonderful and beautiful grandma in Kingfisher, Oklahoma, endured domestic violence. She was married to my wonderful grandpa, my father’s father, until he passed away due to a heart attack. Then she married a farmer in Kingfisher and the hell began.
He hurt her over and over. At one point, we went shopping for a wig for her because he ripped out almost all of her hair. I really didn’t understand what was happening in that house on the farm. Finally, she moved into town in a small home someone provided for her. She was safe. I was thankful she was safe.
Abuse is wrong. There are too many men who are into their power and they exert it on their partners who are only trying to live their life. The counselors at the YWCA truly help these many women and they offer hope and healing for women in battered situations.
No one deserves domestic violence. No one deserves to be hit or demeaned or belittled. No one deserves that.
It’s also a spiritual issue. Domestic violence is also spiritual abuse. A woman may never see her relationship with God in a positive way after having been beaten or mistreated.
Our nation is at a crisis point. People are just plain cruel. They are mean spirited, and they are abusive. They run people off the road in their big monster trucks, and they scream at people in the drive through. Tempers are high, and anger is evident. People are stressed out. Too many people are taking that anger out on their partners.
The economy is terrible. Maybe someone lost his job and he comes home and takes out his anger on his wife and children. The pain is so real. It makes me furious and sad.
I have a friend who used to be in an abusive relationship. She is so kind and loves people. When I think of her being mistreated, it angers me. To get out of abusive relationships is very difficult. Too many times, the abusive partner is also financially abusive, and if the wife leaves, she loses her income. This is very challenging.
How can we reach out and help these abused partners? I feel like we can listen and offer a place to stay if that is safe. We can donate to the YWCA and other nonprofit organizations that help women in need. We can pray. We can be a friend. We can offer a listening ear.
Domestic violence is a stain on the moral fabric of America. This anger that is blazing through our cities must stop. Women are not sex objects or punching bags. The time is now to reach out and help these abused partners. Let’s start the healing.

Jim Pillen held a press conference to announce that he would opt Nebraska into the newly created federal school-choice tax credit program.

Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area participate in a debate on Nebraska education policy, including school choice, at the 50th annual Nebraska Ecumenical Legislative Briefing Day at Christ United Methodist Church in Lincoln. Feb. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)In late September, Gov. Jim Pillen held a press conference to announce that he would opt Nebraska into the newly created federal school-choice tax credit program.
He could have used that moment to rally Nebraskans around a shared belief that every student in our state deserves support, no matter where they receive their education. Instead, he chose to push a polarizing narrative and double down on his attacks on Nebraska voters.
While the new federal program is similar to the state tax credit scheme repealed by voters in 2024, there is one crucial difference: unlike Nebraska’s now-defunct program, which was built to exclusively subsidize private-school tuition, the federal program allows approved organizations to support all students — including those attending public schools.
If that surprises you, you can thank the governor. He staged his press conference at a private school, deliberately framed the program as a private-school benefit and ignored the broader opportunities available to Nebraska students.
Worse yet, in his executive order he claimed he was opting Nebraska into the program because the Nebraska State Education Association had “stolen these opportunities for students” by supporting the repeal of Legislative Bill 1402 — an accusation that not only distorts the truth but also dismisses the clear mandate delivered by Nebraska voters.
Nebraskans will support keeping federal tax dollars in Nebraska

When asked how he could justify the move less than a year after voters rejected school-choice measures, Pillen insisted Nebraskans “totally agree” with such policies and even claimed some counties voted “unanimously” to keep LB 1402.
But more than 80 of Nebraska’s 93 counties voted to repeal the law, and even in the handful that supported it, fewer than 60 percent of voters backed keeping the voucher program. Rather than acknowledge the clear message his constituents sent and level with the public about what this federal program actually does, Pillen has instead chosen to advance a political narrative that serves his agenda, not our students.
The reality is that 57 percent of Nebraska voters chose to repeal LB 1402 – marking the fourth time Nebraskans have rejected efforts to divert public resources to private schools. Most Nebraskans understand that public resources should stay with our public schools so they can continue serving as the strong community pillars they are.
That’s why, when the “Big, Beautiful Bill” was debated in the U.S. Senate this summer, Nebraska U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer was one of three Republicans who voted for a bipartisan amendment removing this federal tax credit program from the legislation.
Now that Pillen has proudly “cannonballed” this federal tax credit program into Nebraska, the genie is out of the bottle. Our priority must be ensuring the program is used in a way that benefits all Nebraska students.
Under federal law, approved organizations can receive donations for expenses such as tutoring, technology and extended-day programs – costs that impact families regardless of where their children attend school.
Just imagine the good that could be done if the private foundations that support local public schools could apply to become approved organizations and donors could receive a full dollar-for-dollar federal tax credit for supporting students in their own communities.
Unfortunately, while states may approve organizations that serve public schools, nothing requires them to do so. That means Nebraskans will have to again raise their voices and urge the governor to approve organizations that support the overwhelming majority of our students – those attending public schools.
Our focus moving forward is to work with lawmakers to ensure Nebraska has approved organizations that serve all students, regardless of how they receive their education.
The governor had an opportunity to unite Nebraskans behind that shared goal. Instead, he used the moment to defy a clear message from voters and sow confusion about how this federal program can truly be used.
Every day, hundreds of thousands of students walk through the doors of our public schools to learn and grow. Here at NSEA, we will continue doing everything we can to ensure their needs remain at the center of decision-making in Nebraska.

Wes Moore wanted to hear from Maryland residents about the state's congressional district maps. At a Friday night virtual meeting of the Governor's Redistricting Advisory Commission, many opposed the idea.","Members of the Governor's Redistricting Advisory Committee took public testimony for the first time Friday night. A majority of speakers opposed redrawing the state's three-year old congressional maps. (screenshot)Gov. Wes Moore wanted to hear from Maryland residents about the state’s congressional district maps. At the first public comment session of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission on Friday night, many opposed the idea.
Moore created the panel 10 days ago and charged it with a “pressure test” of the state’s current congressional district map to ensure it is fair. He’s never defined the term and instead talked about Republican-led states that are engaged in hyper-partisan midcycle redistricting to send more Republicans to Congress in 2026.
But many of those who spoke during Friday’s nearly two-hour meeting said the redistricting scheme has less to do with fairness than with partisanship.
“Attempting to disenfranchise one-third of Maryland’s voters and deny them a seat in Congress is a vain attempt to capture the one remaining seat held by a Republican is not only a fool’s errand, it’s wrong,”said Gary Hodge. “This shouldn’t be the Maryland way.”
Hodge described himself as a lifelong Democrat who is interested in electing more Democrats, but he called on the panel to resist the urge to join the national redistricting frenzy.
“In these troubled times for our democracy, it’s more important than ever to set an example, remain true to our principles of representative government, and not be lured into a tawdry pursuit of base partisanship that has compromised the integrity and reputation of the Congress in the eyes of the American people and poisoned the civility of our politics,” he said.
The 40 speakers at Friday’s hearing, who included Republicans, Democrats and others, spoke against midcycle redistricting by a 2-1 margin. But supporters of redistricting said it’s necessary to respond to other states, like Texas, that are redrawing their congressional district lines for partisan advantage.
GOP counters Democrats’ push for redistricting with call for ‘fair and principled’ process

“We are at a moment where it’s not just Texas, but it’s North Carolina and Missouri, and other states are moving ahead,” said Hadley Anthony, a Baltimore City resident who lives in the district of Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) a prominent opponent of redistricting.
“Those three I mentioned have already changed the rules and changed their maps to consolidate power there, and this disenfranchises not just the residents of those states, but here in Maryland as well, because we are the United States of America,” Anthony said. “We have to stand up in this moment and move forward with this redistricting to make sure that we have fair representation, not just here in the state, but more broadly at the federal level.”
The virtual meeting of the five-member panel led by U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D) was the second meeting of the panel and the first at which the public was allowed to speak.
Alsobrooks and the panel are scheduled to hold a second public comment session Tuesday. Alsobrooks said she hoped to get two more meetings in in early December and possibly produce a map on which the public can comment.
The panel is expected to make a recommendation to Moore. That recommendation could lead to legislation drawing up new maps, possibly in a special session in December.
Moore has not committed to a special session nor taken the idea off the table.
Hodge was one of nearly a dozen who told the panel to reject redrawing the three-year old districts. He praised Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) for opposing calls to redistrict.
Ferguson, in a letter earlier this month, said midcycle redistricting was “too risky” and could backfire in a way that spawns court scrutiny or as many as three Republican seats instead of an 8-0 plan that eliminates Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st).
Ferguson, in a radio interview earlier this week, said his office received over 6000 calls. Less than 100 of those were said to be from Maryland residents, he said.
Hodge said the Senate leader offered “a wise, principled and practical argument against it.” This commission should heed his advice instead of getting down in the mud and wrestling with our political adversaries. Let’s beat them at the polls with better ideas for serving the people and solving the nation’s problems.”

Maryland has roughly 6.1 million residents, of which more than 4 million are registered voters. It’s hard to characterize the 40 speakers who were offered a chance to weigh in a representative sample. Especially when less than 40 spoke during the nearly two-hour meeting.
Pearl Seidman, a Howard County resident who once worked for Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a 10-term Missouri Democrat, said she also opposed midcycle redistricting.
“I understand the concept of fighting fire with fire. I also know that humans have a less than stellar record in divining the future. I close with two questions for this esteemed panel. Can you anticipate the outcomes in Maryland of fighting fire with fire? How can you ensure a controlled burn?”
Hodge and Seidman were joined by Republicans who also decried an effort to eliminate the last Republican Maryland Congress member. A quarter century ago, the eight districts were split evenly between the two parties.
A small number of speakers called on the panel to recommend a nonpartisan or independent panel to oversee future redistricting efforts.
Eric Rockel said Maryland already has a reputation for its gerrymandered districts.
“This is not something that we should be proud of, and this is not simply an exercise to outdo the efforts by Republicans in Texas because Maryland, along with states like Illinois, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey are already highly gerrymandered,” Rockel said. “I would urge this commission, as one of its findings, to recommend that a non-partisan redistricting commission be established in time for the next census, so that we can have a little more objective and not as partisan a process in 2030.”
It is unclear how much of the testimony was heard live by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, the chair. Alsobrooks opened the meeting and made brief remarks including a schedule of future meetings.
Then, about 9 minutes in as the first speaker began his remarks, Alsobrooks turned off her camera. The other four members remained on screen. Alsobrooks did not announce that she would turn off the camera.
A spokesperson for Alsobrooks’ campaign initially said that the senator was present but off camera. Later, the same spokesperson said Alsobrooks “left near the end and didn’t make it back for her closing.” She will not attend Tuesday’s meeting because the Senate is in session, the spokesperson said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-4.30.10 PM-1024x639.png,,,2025-11-15 08:56:35.516031

In the past, say immigration advocates and community leaders, ICE tactics have become increasingly brazen under the anti-immigration administration of President Donald Trump (R), which has aggressively sought to expand federal involvement in local police enforcement.
So far this year, according to the immigrant rights group CASA, Maryland law enforcement agencies have transferred 119 immigrants from local jails into ICE custody.
“This bill is about community,” Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s) said Friday, backed by dozens of supporters at the CASA Welcome Center in Baltimore. “This bill is about ensuring that every community here in the state of Maryland is seen and is heard and is protected. This is about ensuring that our law enforcement is acting in the best interest of all of our communities throughout this entire state.”

Williams sponsored legislation this year on immigration protections that did pass that included language to help “sensitive locations” like churches and schools decide how to respond if immigration agents show, and it includes some privacy protections for migrant data. However, the 287(g) provision to bar local jurisdictions into ICE agreements was taken out on the last day of the session by the Senate.
For the upcoming session that begins Jan. 14, Williams said similar language may be incorporated into legislation for jurisdictions with current agreements with ICE would have a year to terminate them.
On Friday, Sen. President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) expressed support of the ban on social media.
“Now is the time to prohibit 287(g) agreements between ICE and law enforcement agencies in Maryland,” he said. “Recent months demonstrate that ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security are operating with impunity, violating constitutional rights of American citizens and immigrants alike. For our law enforcement agencies to maintain the public trust, they cannot aid and abet that lawlessness.”
To amplify that message, Maryland House Democrats posted a video Thursday on social media to emphasize they voted to ban the agreements – twice.
“Maryland law enforcement should not be an arm of [President Donald] Trump’s extreme agenda,” the post said.
Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) issued guidance last month to remind what local law enforcement agencies can do when working with federal authorities. One provision noted in the document prohibits civil immigration enforcement and for Maryland officers to perform “the functions of an immigration officer.”
As immigration arrests surge, so does number of Maryland sheriffs agreeing to work with ICE

Five sheriff’s office in Maryland signed 287(g) agreements with ICE this year: Allegany, Carroll, Garrett, St. Mary’s and Washington counties. Three others in Cecil, Frederick and Harford counties already had agreements in place.
Law enforcement officials have said the program ensures partnership with federal authorizes and protects communities from criminals.
Del. Chris Tomlinson (R-Frederick and Carroll) said in an interview Friday the program in Frederick has “worked great.”
Tomlinson highlighted a Prince George’s County case when a 19-year-old woman got killed this summer. Last month, 35-year-old Hugo Hernandez-Mendez was indicted for the murder of DaCara Thompson.
Immigration officials said Hernandez-Mendez is a Guatemalan native who has lived and worked in the U.S. illegally for more than three years. According to various news reports, Hernandez-Mendez was pulled over by U.S. Park Police in April and arrested for driving under the influence and other charges but was released.
“We have a serious issue where we have people in our country who shouldn’t be here,” Tomlinson said. “Not only is it a crime just to be here illegally, but they have convicted other illegal acts. Maybe if they [Prince George’s County] had a 287(g) program, maybe that guy would not have ever got out of that DUI and that girl would still be alive.”
Tomlinson continued: “It’s just appalling that Democrats turn a blind eye to stories like that in Prince George’s County.”
One jurisdiction on the Eastern Shore – Wicomico County – discussed about the possibility of entering a 287(g) agreement during a workshop session Nov. 4.

Because of certain changes the General Assembly may make in terms of the 287(g) program, Wicomico County Executive Julie Giordano (R) suggested to table, or hold off, on making any decisions.
Wicomico County Sheriff Michael A. Lewis said the attorney general’s office recent guidance “has made it very difficult, if not impossible, for our county executive working with my office to move forward to further protect the American people. A partnership that would continue to prioritize public safety over Maryland politics.”
Monica Brooks, president of the Wicomico County NAACP, said Friday at the CASA center in Baltimore that the community in her jurisdiction was a major reason the County Council “backed down” to not enter a 287(g) agreement.
“We call on a ban for 287(g), period,” Brooks said. “Let’s be humane and let’s act like we give a darn about the people that we’re supposed to represent. If you don’t agree with this, then you need to be voted out.”

This could become a more common sight at a state inspection program for EV chargers ramps up. (Photo courtesy Lanny Hartmann)Key players in the electric vehicle industry said they’re concerned that state-imposed costs to fund a new charger inspection program could suppress the budding EV industry in Maryland.
At a virtual meeting Thursday, EV companies, drivers and local government officials told the Maryland Department of Agriculture that the $150-per-port fee it will levy to pay for the cost of inspections could make it too expensive for companies or others to offer EV charging.
“This feels like such a sock in the gut to me,” said Lynn Parsons, an EV driver who testified at the hearing. “I hope I’m wrong. But for someone who has struggled to find EV charging stations, this just feels like it’s going to slow down the advancement of adding additional charging stations.”
But Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks defended the testing, which will be administered by the weights and measures division that already tests gas pumps, grocery store scales and other equipment around the state for accuracy. That division relies on fees to fund its operations, he said. And state oversight is something drivers are asking for, Atticks said.
“We heard from a number of owners and drivers of EVs about the need for not only registration, but inspection — and then inspection as a prompt for remediation,” he said.
Atticks said lawmakers gave his department the authority to levy inspection fees as part of the annual Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act this year. The department prepared the regulation, passed it to the legislature’s regulations committee and then opened a 30-day public comment period — that drew zero comments.
Some speakers at Thursday’s meeting said they felt blindsided by the news of the fees, which came in late September. They argued that the regulation was quietly ushered toward the finish line, and there wasn’t an effort to solicit robust comment from the public until Thursday’s meeting — after the regulation had already taken effect, and the department heard pushback.
Maryland joins suit against Trump administration on electric vehicles

Atticks said that the department did not directly notify any stakeholders, because the law doesn’t require it. The department followed its typical procedure for rule-making, he said.
The new policy requires that all EV chargers that offer a charge in exchange for payment be registered with the state by Jan. 1, and pay the $150 fee for each port at the station. Inspectors will begin visual checks in January, Atticks said, ensuring that chargers are registered (and affixing decals confirming that) and clearly display key information like the responsible party and the method of sale.
They’ll also tag and shut down any chargers that are inoperable, said Atticks, who recounted his own misadventures driving his state-owned electric vehicle around Maryland.
“There have been numerous examples that I have experienced where getting to a charger, the charger is not working and it is not easily possible — with the device or with the app that is associated with the device — to somehow prompt that it be refreshed,” he said. “I think over time, systems upgrade to allow that. Until we’re at that point, these inspections are going to be pretty critical.”
Sometime in the spring, he said the department hopes to begin testing the charging ports for accuracy, using a roughly $135,000 piece of equipment, known as a “standard,”  that will check whether chargers are accurately tabulating the amount of electricity dispensed.
The cost of the standard is just one factor that went into the department’s decision to charge $150 per port, Atticks said. The fee also needs to cover the cost of electricity for each test session, which can take up to 30 minutes per port, garage or parking lot entry fees, travel costs and the potential need for return trips if chargers are in use.
In short, “it will take a lot” to inspect the chargers, Atticks said.
In an early October letter signed by industry heavyweights, including Tesla and Rivian, the companies asked that the fee be paused, and ultimately lowered to $25 per port. They also asked to limit the total fees levied at any one location. Their letter said other states have set fees at $20-$25 per device. Connecticut charges $50 per device, and Florida $100, but Maryland would still be top of the pack.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Maryland’s new EV charging device registration fee — the highest in the nation — will discourage EV charging deployment, will impose additional expenses on Maryland businesses, and will further hinder the state from achieving its EV adoption commitments,” the letter reads.
But Atticks said not all those states have to fund their operations through fees, as Maryland does. And some states have realized they “underestimated the amount of time and expense that it would take to accurately inspect EV chargers, and so they are going back to adjust their fees,” he said.
Atticks also pushed back against speakers who compared the EV inspection fee to the $20 annual fee the department charges for gas pumps. That fee is not per pump but per meter, he said, and with each gas pump having between four and 10 meters, the actual cost is $80-$200 per gas pump.
The new fees will leave businesses that offer EV charging with three options, according to the EV companies’ letter: Try to eat the cost, pass the cost on to customers, or cut costs by decommissioning chargers.
The changes come as the state grapples with ambitious commitments to electric vehicles — and ambitious climate goals.
Maryland is one of several states that follow California’s emissions standards, which require an increasing share of car sales be EVs, until model year 2035, when all new cars would have to be zero-emission.
But Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order in April that allows the state to delay penalties for car manufacturers under the rule for model years 2027 and 2028. The EV charging companies point to that as evidence that the industry cannot afford additional stumbling blocks.
Moore issues executive order that could delay EV sales penalties

“The State has acknowledged the market challenges facing ZEV [zero-emission vehicle] adoption; now is not the time to impose a new annual registration fee on EV chargers that is the highest such fee in the nation,” their letter said.
Parsons and others Thursday were particularly concerned that the same fee will be levied for all types of commercial chargers, whether they are DC fast chargers at highway rest stops or slower Level 2 chargers at isolated condo or apartment complexes, which typically generate considerably less revenue.
Robert Borkowski, owner of EV charging company Plug IO, which focuses on installing chargers at multi-unit dwellings, said in an interview that many charging ports at housing complexes may not break even financially, because of the new fees.
“We do not have enough EVs to offset that cost, because right now, we are still in a very early [stage] of building out the infrastructure,” said Borkowski, who also spoke at Thursday’s meeting. “There may be not enough EVs, just even to generate the revenue to cover $150 per year.”
Others ech0ed the cost concerns. Anthony Willingham, public policy manager for charging company Electrify America, argued that the new fee structure will make it harder for his company to find welcoming sites for chargers, such as gas stations.
“It just makes the idea and the product much less attractive, especially when the registration fee is much higher than it is — or then it would be — in other jurisdictions,” Willingham said.
He said his company began installing chargers in 2017, some of which are still operational today. They are faltering not because of neglect but because of high demand, said Willingham, who compared it to :putting your dishwasher in a commercial kitchen. It’s going to struggle.”
Baltimore Gas & Electric, which operates hundreds of chargers around the state, also complained during Thursday’s meeting. Utilities are already required to report to the state’s Public Service Commission on the reliability of their chargers, and are required to maintain 97% uptime, said BGE’s Stephanie Leach. Charger shutoffs by Agriculture Department inspectors could make the PSC’s uptime standard harder to reach, she said.
And, like the others, she also bemoaned the inspection cost.
“We have over 700 chargers in the ground —public chargers and then additional multifamily chargers. So we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars that will we will incur in registration fees this year,” said Leach, strategic programs manager at BGE.










This feels like such a sock in the gut to me. I hope I’m wrong. But for someone who has struggled to find EV charging stations, this just feels like it’s going to slow down the advancement of adding additional charging stations.


– Maryland EV driver Lynn Parsons, on her concerns that new inspection fees will reduce the number of EV charging stations


Several speakers asked whether the department could cut inspection costs by inspecting less often, for example, or bypassing the expensive equipment and conducting visual inspections only.? But department staffers seemed resolute, and didn’t indicate that any changes would be made to their inspection plans.
Borkowski said he worries that condos and apartments with EV chargers that aren’t used very much will rip them out, to avoid the registration fee, or a fee for an inoperable charger. It would take a homeowners association or condo board that is “really pro EVs” to convince residents they should keep paying for costly charging stations because it’s “going to benefit you in the future,” he said.
Borkowski said he is already considering lowering the number of chargers in two upcoming projects at multi-unit complexes, because of the new fees.
Brian Booher, an EV specialist with the Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection, agreed with Borkowski about the risk of charger shutdowns. He said the department should focus on fast-chargers being used by travelers in need of rapid power, rather than slower chargers used by building residents who are not necessarily in a rush to find a charge.
“The issues that we’ve encountered with reliability really apply and are most frustrating when we’re trying to find that fast charging — when we need power quick and it just doesn’t work,” Booher said. “The Level 2s around the county are really often there for convenience or you need them overnight.”
Atticks said concerns with multi-unit dwellings would be “one of our priorities to take back and just consider: What is the path forward?” But he also noted that other states don’t seem to differentiate between types of chargers in their programs.
“Now, look, this is new. We’re only, at best, a few years into any state regulating EV chargers,” Atticks said. “If we can be the ones to innovate and come up with the newest, best alternative, we’ll be happy to do that.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54486116423_04fa1b1fa3_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 22:56:52.203555

The latest ruling is arguably the most sweeping yet.,"In summary
The judge has previously sided with UC scholars several times since June in halting Trump’s termination of science and health research funding. The latest ruling is arguably the most sweeping yet. 


A California federal judge ruled today that Donald Trump cannot demand that UCLA pay a $1.2 billion settlement that would have imposed severe limits on the campus’s academic freedoms and efforts to enroll an economically and culturally diverse student body or risk continued funding freezes on grants the system relies on for research
The decision by Judge Rita Lin is a preliminary injunction and represents a significant victory for University of California scientists, professors, graduate students and other researchers. They and a national professors association sued Trump in September, claiming that his settlement demand — the most sweeping to date in his war on exclusive universities — represents an “unlawful threat” of funding cuts to coerce the university system into “suppressing free speech and academic freedom rights.”Lin agreed with that assessment, calling Trump’s actions toward the university “coercive and retaliatory.” Her ruling doesn’t just apply to UCLA. It largely ties the hands of the Trump administration to target the rest of the UC system for current and future research grants.
“Agency officials, as well as the President and Vice President, have repeatedly and publicly announced a playbook of initiating civil rights investigations of preeminent universities to justify cutting off federal funding, with the goal of bringing universities to their knees and forcing them to change their ideological tune,” Lin wrote in her ruling.Lin wrote that this same playbook is occurring at the UC.“With every day that passes, UCLA continues to be denied the chance to win new grants, ratchetting up Defendants’ pressure campaign,” she wrote. “And numerous UC faculty and staff have submitted declarations describing how (the Trump administration’s) actions have already chilled speech throughout the UC system.”
Lawyers for the federal government had argued that a federal court cannot block a federal agency from making a decision that hasn’t occurred yet, such as whether to approve new funding for a pending grant.“Notably, Plaintiffs’ fears about future grant suspensions and their claims about the likelihood of constitutional violations are entirely based on speculation about an opening settlement offer between the federal government and UC,” U.S. Department of Justice attorneys wrote to Lin.The legal documents in the case spanned 700 pages and included written testimony from more than 70 UC professors, staff workers and graduate students. 
The settlement demand and lawsuit
Trump’s settlement demand is a 27-page document sent to UCLA in early August that would have required the top-ranked public university to hire a senior administrator to review diversity, equity and inclusion efforts; limit campus protest; bar the campus’s medical center from performing gender affirming surgeries or hormone therapy on minors; deny admissions to foreign students with “anti-Western” sentiment and other restrictions.
The public was first able to see the document in late October after some scholars filed a separate lawsuit in state court to force UC officials to disclose the settlement demand.The settlement demand emerged a few days after the Trump administration froze more than $500 million in health and science research funding to UCLA over allegations that the campus tolerated antisemitism and enrolled students using racial preferences. Had UC agreed to its terms, the Trump administration would have released the frozen funds back to UCLA.
However, months before Trump sought the settlement, UCLA had already taken steps to address antisemitism on campus after its leaders commissioned a task force to recommend ways to create a more welcoming environment for Jewish students.Lin faulted the administration for disregarding UCLA’s efforts. The agencies did not “mention the remedial steps UCLA had already taken to address the issues described,” Lin wrote.UCLA is legally barred by state and federal law from admitting students using racial preferences. Trump’s demands would have also blocked UCLA from a practice the U.S. Supreme Court condoned: allowing students to discuss their racial identity in their personal essays. 
But almost all of that funding that Trump froze in July had since been restored after a separate wave of legal filings prompted Lin to temporarily undo Trump’s cuts in August and September.Lin has emerged as a key bulwark for UC researchers as she’s ordered the Trump administration several times to undo hundreds of millions of dollars in science funding cuts to the University of California, including roughly $500 million in science and health grant funding suspensions to UCLA alone. Between June and today, she’s sided with UC researchers and staff four times in rebuffing the Trump administration’s efforts to halt funding to scholars. Her initial ruling that has served as a basis for other preliminary injunctions against Trump was upheld by a panel of judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.UC faculty associations, among the plaintiffs in the case, wrote to Lin that some of its members who don’t have tenure and are international scholars now hesitate to teach issues related to Israel and Palestine or lead lessons on the health effects of climate change. Other scholars say they fear taking part in protests or other free speech activity due to fears about the government’s reprisals.“I am a mother, and the threat of jail time or federal involvement or oversight in campus policing would give me new fear” about protesting, wrote Hannah Appel, an anthropology professor at UC Santa Cruz, in a court document.
Faculty groups also argued that a $1.2 billion hit to UCLA would affect the whole system, as UC leaders would likely pull funding from other campuses to help UCLA absorb the loss. UCLA’s budget is around $13 billion, including its medical and hospital programs, while the UC system’s  is more than $50 billion — and a third of that comes from federal sources.UC President James Milliken called the situation “one of the gravest threats in UC’s 157-year history.” 
The ruling and evidence in detail
Lin’s written ruling mirrors the comments she made during a 90-minute hearing last week, in which she said that the Trump administration has told universities, including the UC, that “if you want the funding restored, then agree to change what you teach, change how you handle student protests (and) endorse the administration’s preferred views on gender.”“Defendants have submitted nothing to refute this,” she said then..
Twenty-one labor unions and faculty associations sued Trump and 15 agencies, including the top providers of science research funding — the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, NASA and the Department of Education that together award the UC more than $4 billion annually. The UC system itself is not part of this suit but has received sustained pressure from students, staff and faculty — including hundreds of Jewish ones — to reject Trump’s settlement.
“This agreement violates the very foundations of higher education,” the UC undergraduate student association wrote to Gov. Gavin Newsom, UC’s president and campus chancellors in November. 
Faculty and staff wanted a return of all terminated grants and a block on denying funding to any pending grants that were preliminarily approved by science panels but were stalled for seemingly political reasons.  
Other faculty, staff impact
The UC has cut the hours or laid off more than 250 lecturers and librarians since Trump began his term this year, said Katie Rodger, the president of UC-AFT, the union of lecturers and librarians at the UC. Lecturers are a core part of the instructional staff at UC but generally lack guarantees of continuous employment that other professors enjoy.
The federal fiscal picture is a reason why at least some lecturers have received pink slips. The “School of Humanities has incurred budget reductions over the last four years, which have been compounded this year by national and state level budgetary impacts and planning projections indicate substantial future budget shortfalls,” said a termination letter at UC Irvine this past spring. 
And while lecturers do not lead labs that receive federal grant funding, they work in them. The loss of grant funding “already has and it will continue to impact us going forward,” Rodger said of lecturers during an interview. The union in August wrote a letter to UC’s director of labor relations leadership demanding that the system cease negotiations with Trump over the settlement.
Meanwhile, the dean of the largest college at the UC — the College of Letters and Science at UC Davis — wrote to faculty last month that it’s dealing with a $20 million budget shortfall across this year and next, after absorbing a loss of $6.7 million the past five years. “Budgets for faculty and graduate student employment will reflect these reductions,” the dean, Estella Atekwana, wrote. That would affect most lecturers.Several scholars and staffers wrote to Lin that the administration was freezing funding on pending grants that UCLA researchers would have likely received if Trump didn’t target the campus. One of those projects was supposed to go to Marcus Roper, a mathematics and computational medicine professor who submitted a grant to research how to better predict vision loss in adults with diabetes. 
The proposal also included a program to teach K-12 students how to apply algebra to analyze eye health. Roper showed in court filings that two grants he submitted won the recommendations of the agency’s program directors, but those were pulled when the Trump administration suspended all of UCLA’s existing NSF and National Institutes of Health grants. Even after Lin ordered Trump to restore the existing grants the agency suspended at UCLA, NSF personnel told Roper they were ordered to pause approval of funding for new grants.Also at UCLA, the NSF preliminarily approved the renewal grant for a math research program that’s been funded for 25 years, but also pulled it in July. If the program isn’t reupped again, Richard Bartlebaugh, a video producer, will lose his job months before he’s eligible for his pension and the program will close in May of 2026, he wrote to Lin. “In this scenario, my time at (the institute) will have represented a four-year and eleven-month career misstep.”
Trump didn’t follow rules, lawsuit said
Catherine Lhamon, formerly the top official during the Obama and Biden administrations at the Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education, wrote to Lin that the way the Trump administration pulled funds was illegal. 
“What (the office) cannot do under the law — and what we never did — is move to immediate fund termination.”But that’s what the administration did. And as Lin noted in her ruling and comments during last week’s hearing, Trump officials bragged about it.“We’re going to bankrupt these universities, we’re going to take away every single federal dollar,” said Leo Terrell on a FOX News program in March. Terrell heads the Trump administration’s multi-agency Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism. His interview was submitted by lawyers for the UC workers as evidence. “The academic system in this country has been hijacked by the left, has been hijacked by the Marxists” he also said.
Llamon, who’s now a faculty member at UC Berkeley, wrote that federal law requires the agency to go through a lengthy process of warning a campus of any civil rights violations, such as ones dealing with antisemitism, and allow the campus to come to a settlement with an action plan. Sometimes the Office for Civil Rights leads an investigation at the school and encourages campus leaders to undertake policy changes. All of that occurs before the federal government pulls funding from a school.  While in charge, her office struck deals to combat allegations of antisemitism at numerous universities, including the UC.“Termination of funds was, as is required in statute and regulation, a last resort, and in the thousands of complaints my office received, we never needed to take this step,” she wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/040825_UCLA-Funding-Cuts_JH_CM_27.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 21:01:22.005075

More than three dozen Hamtramck voters have been disenfranchised after three non-election officials walked into the city clerk’s sealed office on election night, compromising the security of absentee ballots that were mistakenly left there.
The Wayne County Board of Canvassers deadlocked Friday on whether to count the 37 ballots, which were discovered in that office the day after Election Day, having been opened but not removed from their envelopes. Because the board didn’t have a majority of votes in favor of counting them, the ballots will not be included in the final tallies of the election.
It’s not clear whether officials at any level are obligated to tell those 37 voters about the fate of their ballots. Greg Mahar, Wayne County’s director of elections, said he wasn’t aware of any requirements around that. State officials said they weren’t aware of any regulations on that either.
Those uncounted ballots could have been pivotal for the result of the closely contested, open-seat mayoral election in the city, which borders Detroit. According to unofficial results, engineer Adam Alharbi currently leads City Council member Muhith Mahmood in the race by only 11 votes.
At issue in the canvassing board’s deliberations was the ballots’ chain of custody, which must be maintained to ensure the results of the election are accurate and legitimate. Clerk’s offices are sealed around the time of elections, meaning only election officials come into and out of places where ballots are stored.
Due to what officials have said was human error by those who were counting absentee ballots on election night, the 37 ballots in question were opened but never counted. Upon noting a discrepancy in the numbers, election officials looked for the ballots, City Clerk Rana Faraj told the canvassers at their meeting Thursday, but did not find them until the next day. Those ballots were then sealed in a secure envelope and brought to the county.
But the clerk and her team later realized that three other city officials, including interim City Manager Alex Lagrou, walked into the office late on election night, Faraj said. That broke the chain of custody of those ballots, casting doubt onto whether they could be counted.
It’s uncertain why Lagrou and the other officials entered the office. Lagrou could not be reached for comment Friday. It’s not clear who the other non-election officials were.
Becki Carmargo, assistant corporation counsel for Wayne County, told the canvassers on Friday that the board had precedent to reject the ballots based on similar cases in the past. She recommended that the ballots be rejected.
The Democrats on the board, Richard Preuss and Edward Keelean, both argued the votes should be counted. Preuss, the board’s vice chair, said he would like to see affidavits or sworn testimony from the officials who entered the office, because “throwing out votes without having evidence is reckless.”
“I haven’t seen any evidence saying there’s any fraud,” he said, “and to say that these 37 don’t count because of an allegation of potential fraud is completely contrary to this board’s sworn duty.”
Lisa Capatina, a Republican and the chair of the board, argued that such an investigation would be outside of the power of the canvassers. The canvassers are ministerial, she said, meaning their primary job is to confirm the election results.
The canvassers ultimately voted along party lines, and the 2-2 deadlock means the ballots will not be counted.
The mayoral election now hinges on 120 cured ballots tabulated during the canvasser’s meeting Thursday. Those will be taken into the count on Tuesday as the board finalizes the canvas.
Mahmood, the currently trailing mayoral candidate, told Votebeat before the meeting that he hoped the canvassers “did the right thing.”
“At the end of the day, those are people’s votes,” he said. He declined to comment further after the meeting.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota is the fourth state in the country to commit to President Donald Trump’s federal education tax credit program, Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden announced Friday in Sioux Falls.
Under the program, South Dakotans who owe federal income taxes can either send up to $1,700 to the federal government, or they can donate that $1,700 to a government-recognized scholarship granting organization to public, private or homeschool entities in the state. The program starts in 2027.
Nebraska’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen announced the state’s commitment in September. Republican governors for North Carolina and Tennessee announced their commitment this summer. Oregon, New Mexico and Wisconsin officials said they do not intend to opt into the program. Some critics nationally have questioned whether there will be proper guardrails, accountability and “quality control” in place.
Rhoden called the imminent program a “winning situation” for South Dakota taxpayers.
“I’d just as soon give those dollars to a private school than Uncle Sam,” Rhoden said at the announcement, standing in front of a row of students attending the St. Joseph Academy. “I think they know how to spend it a little wiser than the federal government.”
Rhoden added that the federal tax credit will “pair well” with South Dakota’s existing tax credit program, which allows insurance companies to donate up to a total of $5 million to a private school scholarship program for students whose families have low incomes.

The program will further support the state’s growing alternative instruction movement, Rhoden said, including homeschooling and microschools popping up throughout the state. Alternative instruction enrollment has nearly tripled in South Dakota in the last decade, making up about 7% of school-age children in the state.
Sara Hofflander, founder of St. Joseph Academy, said the school is “grateful” for the potential extra funding, though she plans to “approach everything cautiously.”
“Running an independent school obviously requires a heavy commitment from families,” Hoffman said, adding that the extra funding would “lift some of that burden, so we can focus more on the needs of our students.” 
Historically, “school choice” efforts in the state have met resistance from the public school industry. 
Advocates vehemently fought former Gov. Kristi Noem’s effort to introduce Education Savings Accounts, which would have provided public funding for private education and homeschool options during the last legislative session, calling the failed effort an attack on public education. Those same advocates referred to the state’s education tax credit program as “backdoor school voucher program.”
But Rob Monson, executive director for the School Administrators of South Dakota, said the program will benefit public and private education. South Dakotans can direct their tax credit dollars to organizations representing public schools in the state. The funding could be spent on not only tuition and fees for private schools, but tutoring, special needs services for students with disabilities, transportation (such as busing), afterschool care and computers.
South Dakota Department of Education fails to reach goals in legislative performance review

“That’s a huge win for taxpayers of South Dakota, but also every form of education across the state,” Monson said.
South Dakota Education Secretary Joe Graves said the program will support education innovations and a “robust competitive system.”
Graves told lawmakers on Thursday, while presenting lackluster test scores to a committee, that “innovation” would be key to improving student outcomes, especially for Native American students and children living in “education deserts.”
“We’re not doing well enough, and we need to do better,” Graves said at Friday’s announcement.
If more students attend private or alternative schooling options, that would mean less state funding for public schools because of decreased student enrollment. Monson told South Dakota Searchlight that state revenues could be impacted by participation in the tax credit program, since it would remove federal tax dollars used to support other programs or go toward states. The federal government would still be obligated to fund some federal education programs, Monson added.
The scholarship funds would be available to families whose household incomes do not exceed 300% of their area’s median gross income. The U.S. Department of Treasury is expected to issue proposed rules detailing the program’s operation.
Graves said he assumes there will be reporting “at some level” of how the funds are spent.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/591A2359-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 19:57:21.188237

Col. David “Boar” Gunter told the Idaho Legislature’s Committee on Federalism that the number of personnel could increase to perhaps 300 people – in Qatari personnel and U.S. personnel – as the training program reaches its full operational capabilities. Overall the training program could last for 10 years, he said. 
Gunter told Idaho legislators that plans for the Qatari training program have been under development for several years, and the squadron would be a U.S. flag squadron under the leadership of the U.S. Air Force.
“The program builds on the United States Air Force’s long standing tradition of hosting allies and partner nations for training with similar programs as to several Air Force bases here in the United States,” Gunter said.
 Training with allies to prepare for combat

Gunter said the ability to train with allies with Qatari Emiri Air Force at Mountain Home Air Force Base helps ensure they will be prepared to serve with multinational forces during more stressful, high stakes combat missions in the future.
“The United States Air Force and United States government relies on our allies and partners to multiply our capabilities and to continue to provide the safety and security that we provide around the world,” Gunter said. 
Gunter made a sports analogy to describe the training, saying a team of football players who practice and train together will perform at a higher level with better unity during high-stakes game situations.
“That is very similar to the advantages that we get by training with our partners and allies before we are in a very stressful situation that is air-to-air combat,” Gunter said. 
In addition to Qatari Emiri Air Force personnel, Gunter told Idaho legislators the Qatari personnel may bring dependents such as spouses or family members with them, but Gunter said it was too early to know details.
 Idaho’s elected officials were surprised by Qatari facility announcement

On Oct. 10, Hegseth announced the deal to train Qatari Emiri Air Force personnel at Idaho’s Mountain Home Air Force Base. 
In televised remarks, Hegseth said, “Today we are announcing that we are signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force Facility at the Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho.”

That same day, Hegseth took to social media to clarify his remarks, writing “Qatar will not have their own base in the United States – nor anything like a base.”
The announcement caught U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, Gov. Brad Little and other officials off guard, records obtained by the Idaho Capital Sun revealed. 
Late last month, Risch, Little, U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo and U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, all R-Idaho, wrote letters asking Hegseth for a briefing on the Qatari training deal and answers questions about logistics and national security.  
Risch also spoke to the Idaho Legislature’s Federalism Committee on Friday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
Risch, who serves as chairman of the U.S Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Idaho’s entire congressional delegation’s staff was meeting Friday morning with the Department of Defense to “find out exactly what happened” with the training program announcement.

Risch said the purpose of the Mountain Home Air Force Base is to provide training for aviators from the United States and its allies. Risch said U.S. allies from all over the world train on F-15 and F-16 aircraft at Mountain Home Air Force Base.

“People come from all over the world – not our adversaries – but people who are allies,” Risch said Friday. 
“Go out there any day and you’ll find people from all over the world training out there,” Risch said. 
Risch told committee members that Qatar is a U.S. ally and the U.S. operates a military base there. 
“Being careful of what I say here, they are not a perfect ally of ours,” Risch said. “But we have a huge military base in Qatar. It’s got thousands of soldiers, sailors, Marines, aircraft, ships – everything. If there’s ever a blow up in the Middle East, our war will be fought from Qatar because they host our base there.”
When it comes to the Mountain Home Air Force Base training deal, Risch stressed that the United States controls that base and Hegseth’s announcement doesn’t change that. 
“Nobody has control of that except the American government,” Risch said. 
 Several Idaho legislators voice concerns about Qatari Emiri Air Force training deal

After Gunter delivered his prepared remarks to the committee, several Idaho legislators voiced concerns about the training partnership with Qatar.

“I would assure you that Idaho has an unwavering support for you and the members of our Air Force, but when it comes to this, the support is waning greatly in the population,” Rep. Dale Hawkins, R-Fernwood, said. “I’m getting dozens and dozens and dozens of emails and phone calls with great concern that we are yoking ourselves and bringing people here that have been speculated to be a major funder of terrorism in other parts of the world.”
Sen. Cindy Carlson, R-Riggins, also told Gunter that she has concerns and has heard from many concerned constituents.
“I just want to go on record that I have concerns about this process about aligning ourselves with a known country of … sponsoring terrorism,” Carlson said. 
Gunter told the Idaho legislators there is a rigorous vetting process for everyone brought on the Mountain Home Air Force Base that takes about 30 days to complete. Gunter said there would be certain areas on the base and certain information the Qatari Emiri Air Force personnel would not have access to. Gunter also said there are numerous other security measures in place on the base that he could not disclose but that he said he had total confidence in.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The General Assembly’s Democratic and Republican leaders assembled for a rare committee meeting Friday afternoon to consider requests to audit state waste, both fiscal and physical.
But any action on those asks before the Joint Committee on Legislative Services will have to wait for a future meeting. The five-member panel agreed to postpone action on a GOP request to probe the state’s quasi-governmental affordable-housing finance agency and a separate proposal seeking an assessment of  how much trash and recycling the State House generates.
Lawmakers began their hour-long hearing with a request by House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale to have the state’s Office of Auditor General investigate RIHousing. In September, Chippendale, a Foster Republican who sits on the committee, called for an audit of the housing agency he characterized as “bloated” and inefficient in its mission of tackling the state’s housing crisis. 
“The request for the entertainment of a performance audit is not a reflection of hostility, distrust, or personal criticism of the agency or its staff,” Chippendale told the committee. “On the contrary, it’s rooted in respect for the importance of their work and a deep desire to strengthen the systems that support it.” 
Chippendale provided fellow legislative leaders with a 17-page report by the House Minority Office that “reveals significant concerns related to transparency.” It’s separate from the six-page analysis Chippendale’s office produced in September, which mostly compared RIHousing to its peer agencies in the region.
The report handed out Friday looked at how much RIHousing spent in subsidizing new construction projects with $206 million federal pandemic aid over the last five fiscal years. 
The GOP’s latest findings mirror those in a 2024 analysis by the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (RIPEC), which found the state’s return on investment for its housing policies and programs has fallen short.
RIPEC in its report had proposed structural changes, such as setting up “strict cost standards” for housing projects seeking state funds and eliminating duplication of state and federal funding programs with a single, streamlined and easily trackable program. 
Chippendale said his office was inspired to independently crunch numbers to analyze RIHousing’s results in increasing housing production in the state.
Out of 42 projects reviewed by the House GOP, 14 of them — 33% — exceeded RIHousing’s own internal cost limits. According to the report, many of those projects exceeded limits by 20% to 140%, with per-unit costs ranging from $514,000 to $639,000. 
“We’ve seen various reporting inconsistencies when it relates to these monies,” Chippendale said. 
Chippendale acknowledged that RIHousing posts annual audits to its website, but he said they’re all purely financial.
“It does not look at efficiency, it does not look at performance, it does not look at output,” he said.
Chippendale said he did not expect any action to immediately be taken as the report had been given to the panel, along with RIHousing the same day as the meeting. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, the Warwick Democrat who chairs the panel, agreed that was fair.
Shekarchi did give RIHousing the chance to respond to Chippendale’s remarks. RIHousing Deputy Director James Comer attended the meeting while Executive Director Carol Ventura was absent.
Comer read a statement from Ventura highlighting $1.4 billion in financing the agency made available in 2024 for affordable housing, first home mortgages and rental assistance.
In addition to publishing financial audits, Comer said RIHousing provides monthly reports on its activities to the state’s Pandemic Recovery Office — which disburses shares of Rhode Island’s remaining federal aid funds for its financing programs.
“That’s what accountability looks like in practice,” he told the committee. “We welcome this hearing as an opportunity to reaffirm who we are — Rhode Islanders can and should have full confidence in how their statewide housing financing agency operates.”

Tackling State House waste
The Joint Committee on Legislative Services similarly held off on voting on a request by Rep. Lauren Carson, a Newport Democrat, to allow a nonprofit that has been setting up ​​composting programs in all of Rhode Island’s schools to find ways to reduce trash inside the State House.
Carson’s proposal calls for the Rhode Island School Recycling Project to look around the Capitol building’s waste receptacles and locate sources of food waste. The idea is to set up a waste sorting program inside the State House.
“We have an obligation in the State House to comply with state law and recycle, to lead by example and to demonstrate to the citizens of Rhode Island that we’re doing the right thing when it comes to waste,” Carson told the committee.
On hand to further sell the idea was Warren Heyman, organizing director of the Rhode Island School Recycling Project.. Heyman told legislative leaders not only would the Rhode Island School Recycling Project do the work for free, but reducing waste in the building could save the state some money once the Central Landfill in Johnston fills up — which is expected to happen in 2046.
“The cost of shipping our trash out of state will only increase,” Heyman said. “Everything we can do — whether it’s in our public schools, this building, or hospitals or nursing homes — that can reduce the amount of trash going to landfill is a dollar saved on behalf of the taxpayers.”
Shekarchi told Carson and Heyman that while legislative leaders have exclusive control over certain rooms in the building, responsibility is shared with the state’s Division of Capital Asset Management & Maintenance.
He suggested Carson and the Rhode Island School Recycling Project connect with the capital asset division before the next meeting, which has yet to be scheduled. Despite the delay, members of the committee underscored the need for a cleaner State House — including Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson.
“We need to consider here in this building what we can be part of this process,” Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, said.

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Two state panels charged with setting legislative and statewide elected official pay are set to meet again Tuesday after it was determined an ineligible member voted to raise pay.
The Board on Legislative Compensation and Statewide Official Compensation Commission both posted special meeting notices Friday afternoon after concerns were raised that one of the board’s members was a registered lobbyist. 
According to state law, lobbyists are barred from serving on the Board on Legislative Compensation, which meets in odd-numbered years to set lawmaker pay and leadership stipends.
“It does appear that a board member was prohibited from serving in that position,” said Leslie Berger, a spokesperson for Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, whose office advises both panels. “It is our understanding that House leadership is aware and working to remedy the matter.”
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, appointed James Leewright to the Board on Legislative Compensation. Both panels have the same members.
Leewright is a former Republican member of the House and Senate. He participated and cast votes in both meetings.
Leewright currently is a registered lobbyist, online news outlet NonDoc reported. He serves as the president and CEO of the Oklahoma Restaurant Association and CEO of the Oklahoma Hotel and Lodging Association and the Oklahoma Travel Industry Association.
Caroline Estes, Hilbert’s press secretary, said the special meetings were set after it was determined Leewright was ineligible to serve.
Tuesday would mark the third time the legislative compensation board will have met. Under state law, Tuesday is the final day it can legally convene.
The panels met earlier this week and increased by at least 25% the pay for nearly all statewide elected officials with the exception of the governor. Members also hiked stipends for legislative leaders, but kept legislative pay the same. The pay hikes would not take effect until after the November 2026 elections.
As of late Friday, the agendas for the meetings had not been posted.
Estes said she did not know if every item would be voted on again because each panel sets their agenda.
But Hilbert wanted “to do whatever is fair,” she said.
“Along with the replacement of an appointee, there are multiple outstanding items that need to be addressed,” Estes said. She did not elaborate.
Hilbert has appointed Krista Ratliff, president and CEO of FISTA Innovation Park in Lawton, to serve on the boards.
The legislative compensation board has set its special meeting for 2 p.m. in Room 230 of the state Capitol. The Statewide Official Compensation Commission has set a special meeting for 3 p.m. in the same location.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)Salt Lake County says its first confirmed case of measles this year is worrying because it suggests the virus is spreading in the community. 
“This case is especially concerning because the source of the patient’s infection is unknown,” said Dorothy Adams, executive director of the Salt Lake County Health Department. “They have not knowingly had contact with anyone who had measles, which means their infection is the result of transmission somewhere out in the community.”
The county warned that anyone who went to Intermountain Health’s Taylorsville urgent care clinic on Nov. 7 from 3 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. may have been exposed. The virus is highly contagious and can linger in the air for up to two hours, so it doesn’t need direct contact to spread.
Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

With that in mind, health department employees were getting in touch with people who might have been in close contact with the patient or visited the same spaces within a few hours. 
The department first learned Wednesday night that someone tested positive. Citing patient privacy reasons, it did not give the patient’s age or gender, or say where the person lives. 
On Oct. 27, the county announced a likely case based on the symptoms of a patient who refused testing. The last time the county recorded a positive test was in 2023, when a Utah resident got infected while traveling out of state, said spokesperson Gabriel Moreno.

Outbreaks happened earlier this year in rural parts of the state, including along the Utah-Arizona border and in Cache County. 
Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine prevent more than 97% of infections, the health department said, and those who are vaccinated and still get sick tend to have milder symptoms. Unvaccinated people — including babies too young to be eligible and immune-compromised Utahns — are more likely to experience severe complications. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red or watery eyes, followed by a rash that typically begins days later on the head or face.  
For those who don’t know if they’re immune, the county said receiving an additional dose of the MMR vaccine is safe and widely available, including at its vaccine clinics.

After receiving feedback from mental health providers who said the change would put a significant dent in their bottom line, the insurer is taking a step back to evaluate the proposal.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Blue Cross Blue Shield VT postpones controversial change to therapy billing .","Savannah Lord, the clinical director of a Burlington nonprofit mental health clinic, got an email from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont this month and was immediately alarmed, as were many of her colleagues across the state.
What transpired since then provides a small window into the highly complicated world of health insurance in the United States, where even the insurers who set reimbursement rates, and the providers who bill for them, can become confused. That complexity can also get in the way of efforts to improve patient care.
The Nov. 5 email from Tom Weigel, the chief medical officer for the state’s largest private insurer, explained a billing change the insurer planned to implement. Starting in January 2026, unlicensed mental health providers would receive 24% less in payment for services than their licensed counterparts.
The change, Weigel wrote, was intended to encourage those unlicensed providers to complete their licensing requirements, and to align the private insurer’s reimbursement practices for mental health services with those of Vermont Medicaid. The insurer had found upon review that “trainees were practicing for many years without clear progress toward licensure. Some even practicing more than 10 years as trainees.” 
Lord knew right away the change would be a massive financial blow to her clinic, called Eden Valley, which treats patients of all ages. Four of the clinic’s six staff members are pre-licensed supervisees. Nearly 75% of Eden Valley’s revenue comes from patients covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont. 
“This is how we keep the lights on; this is how we pay utilities. This is how we pay our taxes. This is how we function,” Lord said.
Also, something didn’t sit right with Lord about the letter’s explanation of mirroring Vermont Medicaid rates for mental health: The state’s program for lower-income Vermonters has paid the same rate for all of Eden Valley’s practitioners, licensed or not.
“The insinuation that we have been overpaid all of these years is quite scary,” Lord added. 
In the days that followed, mental health providers in and around Burlington quickly rallied against that Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT proposal. They circulated a protest form letter among patients and other clinicians and on the popular Burlington Facebook group Sensi-Babeington. The letters said that the reduction would result in fewer therapists entering training and even further reducing the number of therapists and social workers in a state where they are already scarce, particularly those who take insurance.
This week Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT informed mental health providers that it would pause implementation of the policy to gather more information. 
“We’ve received feedback from some of our network providers who disagree with the change, and we take that feedback seriously,” company Vice President Andrew Garland said in an emailed statement to VTDigger.
“We think we have this right, but we are going to postpone the policy start date so we have more time to discuss the policy change with our network providers and community leaders,” he wrote.

(Mis)alignment with Medicaid
The licensure process is an important part of consumer protection, said Lynn Currier, a licensed inpatient clinical social worker and the executive director of the Vermont and New Hampshire chapters of the National Association of Social Workers. 
The process ensures that practitioners have passed their qualifying exam and that they are participating in the continuing education required to maintain a license, she said.
“When I look at Blue Cross Blue Shield’s reasoning, (and) that they’re seeing people who never get out of the trainee status, they’re not wrong,” Currier said. “There are clinicians who’ve been working decades without a license, because they can work under the license of somebody else, and that’s a problem.” 
But ensuring that insurers and regulators have the tools to assess a provider’s licensure status is complicated. 
One issue is that many types of mental health professionals can practice in the state of Vermont without a license, explained Lauren Hibbert, deputy secretary of state. To practice this way, a provider is required to enroll in what her office calls the roster of non-licensed, non-certified clinicians, giving the state a way outside of licensure to monitor who is providing mental health care in Vermont. 
Some of the mental health professionals on the roster have degrees in psychology, social work or counseling and are working toward full licensure. To achieve that, a trainee must log around two years of practice, meeting with clients and providing clinical care under the supervision of an already-licensed clinician. 
Another group of therapists on the roster may be career-long unlicensed practitioners, who might offer different kinds of mental health therapy, may not be able to pass the licensure exam, or may have not completed their education. There are many mental health care professionals who may never intend to pursue licensure, Hibbert said.

The distinction between the two tracks — those who are working toward licensure and those who stay in this unlicensed, rostered status for long periods — can easily become muddled. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield’s Weigel wrote that the reduction in reimbursements for pre-licensed clinicians “aligns with Medicaid to create consistency, reduce incentives for trainees to remain unlicensed, and focus resources on high-quality, well-supervised care that benefits members.”
But, in fact, it did not align with Medicaid’s rates for unlicensed therapists.
Vermont Medicaid does indeed reimburse many trainees at 76% of the program’s set fee schedule, which does seem to parallel what BCBS VT initially proposed. But, the state program also reimburses many fully licensed therapists the same percentage.
Medicaid distinguishes its billing rates based on the provider’s education status, not their licensure status, explained Alex McCracken, a spokesperson for the Department of Vermont Health Access, which administers Medicaid. 
A psychiatric physician or nurse practitioner receives 100% of the Medicaid set rate for a clinical mental health service. A psychologist with a PhD receives 93% of that full fee; a psychologist with a master’s level degree receives 76% of that allowed amount. This is true regardless of whether they have achieved their license yet. 
This has been the case since the inception of this supervised billing structure, nearly a decade ago, in 2016, McCracken said. DVHA has no plans to change that, she added.
‘We need to get this right’
Still, the concerns of long-rostered, unlicensed clinicians that Blue Cross Blue Shield initially set out to address remain.
Both DVHA and the state’s Office of Professional Regulation are trying to make it easier to tell who is working toward their license and for how long, officials there said. 
Starting in 2026, DVHA will require non-licensed providers to enroll individually with Vermont Medicaid and appear on the claims submitted for reimbursement — rather than submitting under their supervisor.
“This change helps DVHA ensure providers billing under the supervised billing system are working towards licensure,” McCracken explained. 
Previously, the department had tried to address this by implementing a five-year billing limit for rostered professionals. That rule will sunset at the end of 2025, after DVHA received feedback from providers who found the rule difficult to operate under, as it took some people longer to complete their training.
The Office of Professional Regulation is exploring proposals from a 2024 report that recommends changes to better streamline licensure in the state.
One idea, that would require a legislative change, could be implementing two different types of credentials for unlicensed clinicians — one for people training toward licensure and another for individuals who intend to only stay on the roster. Other states, like New Hampshire and Massachusetts, have conditional licenses for trainees working toward full licensure. 
“The public needs to understand that there is a difference between seeing someone who is licensed or someone who is on their way to being licensed than someone who is not licensed and not on their way to being licensed,” Hibbert said. “It makes sense to me that reimbursement follows that.”
In Weigel’s letter to providers, he cited another concern. There is no cap on how many trainees a provider can oversee, “raising concerns about real-time oversight.” The insurer said that some supervisors had reported retaining “all or part” of the reimbursement from their supervisees, leading to worries that hosting trainees might become “a profit center.”
In his statement to VTDigger, Garland said he did not know yet how long this postponement of the rate change will last, but that the insurer will spend the time listening and sharing information with trainees and supervisors. “In the end, we need to get this right for our members. Many Vermonters, including many of our members, are struggling with the cost of healthcare,” he wrote.
Clinicians have their own concerns and criticisms of the current system. Some worry that reducing the amount a supervisee can make will discourage licensed professionals from taking on the administrative burden of a trainee. 
“Supervising a supervisee who’s not yet licensed requires a significant amount of oversight,” said Danielle Bergeron Ingram, a licensed psychologist and the owner of Green Mountain Psychological Associates, in Middlebury. She also sits on the board of directors for the Vermont Psychological Association. 
Bergeron supervises one trainee in her private practice. “Working under my license, there’s a significant amount of time spent reviewing notes, ensuring quality of care,” she said. “I’m reading my supervisee’s notes, any treatment plans, any documents that are produced by the client.” 
With the high overhead cost of going through undergraduate and graduate school to become a therapist, Bergeron Ingram also worries that a lower reimbursement rate will be yet another economic barrier for those trying to become therapists. 
“We are absolutely going to lose people going into the field in the first place.” she asked. “If they’re not compensated fairly, why go into the field?”

Called debris flows, these fast-moving slurries of floodwater and sediment can hurtle down slopes carrying cars, trees and even boulders with them.
They’re like “a flood on steroids,” said Jason Kean, a research hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey’s landslide hazards program. “It’s really hard to stop these things. The best thing to do is get out of the way.” 
Forecasters expect the heaviest rain Friday into Saturday night; predictions are for wet days through next week. Storms may stretch from Santa Barbara County south to Los Angeles County, and could spread inland to parts of Orange County and the Inland Empire. 
Burn scars — slicked by fire and stripped of plants — are especially vulnerable. A storm after the Thomas Fire in 2018 spurred debris flows in Montecito that killed 23 people. And in February, a debris flow in the Palisades Fire burn zone swept a Los Angeles Fire Department member and his SUV into the Pacific Ocean. 
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works warns that there’s a risk of moderate debris and mudflows capable of blocking roadways and endangering some structures in the burn scars of almost a dozen fires — including January’s Eaton, Hurst and Palisades fires. 
The county has issued evacuation warnings, as well as some targeted evacuation orders for specific properties “at higher risk for mud and debris flows impacts.”
The public works department says that most burned properties have been cleared of fire debris, and the rest have been shored up with gravel bags and other materials to keep debris in place. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom also announced today that more than 400 personnel and resources including fire engines, helicopters and search and rescue teams have been pre-deployed to Southern California counties. 
“It’s a pretty serious situation,”  said National Weather Service meteorologist David Gomberg.
By Friday morning, the storm had already unleashed up to 5 inches of rain in parts of Santa Barbara County, Gomberg said, and Southern California is bracing for more. 
There’s also the possibility of thunderstorms, small tornadoes, and a worrying amount of rain hitting the Eaton and Palisades burn scars. Even just a half-an-inch to 0.6 inches of rain could trigger a debris flow in these areas, said Gomberg, who added that his office is forecasting between half an inch to one inch per hour in these areas. 
“And the more you exceed the threshold, the probability of a more damaging debris flow increases,” he said.
We spoke with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Kean, an expert on debris flows after wildfires, about what to expect. This conversation has been edited and condensed. 
As this storm really takes hold in LA and Southern California, I’m hearing a lot of concern about it hitting areas that burned this past year, including in the Eaton and Palisades fires. Why is this such a big concern? What could happen?
Last January those fires removed much of the vegetation on really steep slopes, and that made those slopes really vulnerable to erosion during intense rainfall. That protective blanket of vegetation is gone, and heavy rain can rapidly make a flash flood. And that flood, in some cases, can pick up material and turn into what we call a debris flow — which is like a flood on steroids.

These burn areas are still vulnerable, even though it’s now many months after the fire and there have been flows already. There’s still plenty of material that could be mobilized. So the threat’s still there. And so we know they’re bad actors, and we’re concerned they could be bad actors again. 
I’m hearing a lot of different terms: mudslide, debris flows, landslide. What are the differences, and which ones are the burn scars at risk for? 
Landslide is an umbrella term that captures all kinds of mass movements, from rock falls to debris flows — these floods on steroids — to big, slow movers. The type of flow that we’re most concerned about in a recent burn area is a debris flow. It’s also called a mudslide. But geologists don’t like to use the word mudslide as much because it sounds like there’s some mud on your driveway — not a big issue, not something that could kill you. And these things, if you’re in the wrong spot at the wrong time, they can cause serious damage.
You called it a flood on steroids. What happens in a debris flow? 
Flash floods are bad, and they can cause lots of problems, too. They can get even worse if they pick up enough sediment to turn into the consistency of wet concrete. But it’s worse than just concrete, because it can contain boulders the size of cars. And, very close to the mountain front, it can move very quickly — faster than you can run. And when it gets all bulked up with debris, the rocks, the gravel, the mud, trees, the flow can be a lot bigger. It just turns into a different animal. 
Now, debris flows pack a bigger punch than floods, but thankfully, they don’t have as long of reach. So usually, the debris flows are confined really close to the mountain fronts. That’s where they put those debris basins to catch them. But if there isn’t one protection like that, then they can travel downslope and impact neighborhoods, and then flooding can extend even further down. 
Is there something about Southern California that makes it higher risk?
Southern California’s kind of the world capital for these kinds of events. It’s got this combination of very steep topography, like the San Gabriel Mountains that just shoot right up, Santa Monica mountains, Santa Ynez — very steep topography. It burns fairly frequently. And then there are a lot of people living very close to the mountain front, so that’s what puts the risk up. 
The thing about a burn area is it takes much less rainfall to cause a problem than it would in unburned conditions. So we’ve now made the slopes really vulnerable. They’re extra steep. There’s a lot of people there. That’s why the risk is so high. 
We’ve seen debris flows in Northern California burn areas as well. It’s not just a Southern California problem, and it’s not just a California problem. 
Is there anything that could have been done to reduce this risk? Anything that should be done now? 
Not long after the fires, in particular the Palisades Fire, (there were) a number of fairly widespread debris flows that disrupted the roads. There were also, in the Eaton fire, floods and debris flows there. Thankfully there’s a dense network of LA County debris basins, which are designed to catch the material before it enters neighborhoods, and those largely saved the day. 
Planners have planned ahead and put in these debris basins — these big, giant holes in the ground — designed to catch the material. That’s the best defense against these. They’re not everywhere, but there is a good network of protection. Other than that, it’s really hard to stop these things. 
What should people who live near the recent burn scars know? What should they do now, as the rain starts? 
The best thing you could do is, if you’re really close to a drainage in one of these burn areas, is to get out of the way. You’re going to get a heads up from the National Weather Service, who’s closely monitoring the rainstorms. They know how much rain it’s going to take to cause a problem, and they’ll get out warnings, and local authorities will reach out to get people out of the way. So there’s a lot of eyes on the situation. And so at this point, the best thing to do is listen to the weather service, listen to local authorities. 
If they ask you to get out of the way, take their advice. These things can happen really fast if there is an intense burst of rain, a flash flood, where debris flow can start within minutes. 
So there is no escaping a debris flow once it starts? 
It’s pretty difficult. If you have a two-story home and you happen to be there at the wrong time, get up to that second floor for sure. Fight like heck if you get trapped in one. But best to be out of the way.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021425-EatonFireMudslides-JAJ-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 18:58:27.084444

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas State Library Board approved disbursing $1.37 million in state aid to local and regional libraries on Friday with little discussion.
The board approves payments of state funds to libraries each quarter, and the amount approved Friday was for the second quarter of state fiscal year 2026. The state Department of Education had authorized payment of the first quarter in September, when members of the newly constituted board had not yet been confirmed by legislators and could not officially act.
The State Library operates independently under the umbrella of the education department, and the board’s primary responsibility is to disburse state funds to local public libraries.
The meeting marked the board’s second since Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ appointed them under Act 903 of 2025, which dissolved the previous seven-member board and required the governor to appoint new members. Sanders appointed six members in August and has yet to appoint the seventh.
The previous board had clashed with some lawmakers as well as one of its members, National Association of Christian Lawmakers founder and former state senator Jason Rapert, over withholding funds from libraries that do not restrict minors’ access to “sexually explicit” content.
The appointment of an entirely new board came after the previous board fought for more than a year over whether it should withhold funding from libraries that do not restrict minors’ access to “sexually explicit” content. Elected officials at the state and local levels have tried to regulate public library leadership, funding and content for the past few years.
At Friday’s meeting, board member and former state lawmaker Jack Fortner of Yellville asked whether criteria other than population could be used to determine how much money individual libraries can receive. The state funds currently are apportioned based on the population served by a library.
Saying he thought some smaller, rural libraries are used more often than those serving larger populations, Fortner asked whether data on library usage might help provide more funds for libraries serving fewer people.
State Librarian Jennifer Chilcoat replied that such data might be available and said she’d have staff try to gather it.
Most of the remainder of the board meeting was spent hearing reports from various State Library department heads and a presentation from education department attorney Daniel Shults on state laws affecting the board and its duties.

The casino knew for years  that gambler Mathew Bowyer, an illegal bookmaker from California, lacked a source of funds to support his vociferous appetite for gambling.   
Bowyer, best known for taking sports bets from baseball star Shohei Ohtani’s interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, who stole millions of dollars from Ohtani, gambled for years at Caesars Palace, despite the hotel’s knowledge that he lacked the income to support his gambling. 
He is currently in prison serving a 20-month sentence for bookmaking and money laundering.
Bowyer was a patron at Caesars Palace from before 2017 until January 2024, the complaint says. The company and its subsidiaries identified “suspicions” about Bowyer as early as 2017, such as his lack of an apparent source of funds. Multiple due diligence checks by the casino revealed Bowyer did not have a source of funds to support his play. 
In 2017, Bowyer made front money deposits of more than $4 million on multiple visits to Caesars Palace. The same year, the casino noted “source of funds/employment could not be determined for Bowyer.” 
The casino received an anonymous call in June 2019, in which the caller identified Bowyer as a “bookie.” The same month, Caesars deemed Bowyer to be “high risk” and once again was unable to verify his source of funds. His play was “elevated” to a Caesars anti-money laundering  because of his “lack of occupation/source of wealth” and “over $2 million in actual loss over the last 12 months.”
The next month, Caesars suspended Bowyer’s account. Bowyer, in response, presented his 2018 tax return to the hotel, which did not lift the suspension. He then provided a statement indicating winnings of just under $3 million from the Cosmopolitan in 2018, and Caesars lifted its suspension of his account. 
In November 2020, the casino again noted Bowyer’s high risk status based on “undetermined/unverifiable” income. 
In May 2021, the casino again noted Bowyer was high risk because of “undetermined current income level” and a “314b request,” a financial form affiliated with the U.S. Patriot Act. 
Caesars suspended Bowyer’s account again in July 2021, noting he may be a bookie. Bowyer, the complaint says, provided tax returns for 2019 and 2020, resulting in the lifting of his suspension in September 2021.
The casinos reported “no revenue found” for three of Bowyer’s businesses in 2022. 
Finally in 2024, he was banned. The company was aware since 2017 that two other casinos had banned the gambler. 
The complaint says Caesars only banned Bowyer in 2024 after news reports surfaced that his Orange County home had been raided by federal agents investigating gambling by unsavory characters in Las Vegas casinos. The Current was first to report Bowyer’s home had been raided in October of 2023.  
“Media outlets reported extensively on Bowyer, including his activities in Las Vegas casinos, his operation of an illegal bookmaking business, and his money laundering activities,” the complaint says. 
Caesars is the second resort company disciplined by the GCB for taking Bowyer’s action. 
Resorts World agreed to a $10.5 million fine earlier this year. 
The GCB is investigating Foutainebleau, where Bowyer gambled, as well.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2211848134-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 18:58:27.084444

In the Linn County case, the Iowa Board of Pharmacy alleges that on Dec. 24, 2024, a 22-month-old child was prescribed antibiotics to treat pneumonia. A pharmacy technician at the CVS Pharmacy in Marion allegedly gave the child’s mother azithromycin tablets instead of a liquid and failed to provide counseling on use of the medication. The tablets were subsequently returned when the mother discovered the error, according to the board.
The CVS Pharmacy was charged by the board with failing to provide pharmacist counseling upon receipt of a new prescription drug order; failing to review records to identify any issues such as incorrect drug dosages; and dispensing an incorrect prescription.

In order to resolve the matter, the CVS Pharmacy and the board agreed to settlement that calls for the pharmacy to accept a warning and pay a civil penalty of $5,000.
In addition, the pharmacy must also implement a training and remediation plan, specifically with regard to pediatric dosing and milligram/kilogram dosing and the maintenance of a “proper computerized system protocol” that has the capability to catch errors. Pharmacists will be required to double-check the system to ensure errors do not occur.
Board settles case with Fairfield pharmacy
In the Jefferson County case, the Board of Pharmacy charged Summit Pharmacy of Fairfield with willful or gross negligence, alleging that over the previous several years, many controlled substances had been diverted from the pharmacy’s inventory for the personal use of the pharmacist owner at the time.
Since the initial investigation of that matter, Summit Pharmacy has changed ownership and, according to the board, has “embraced changes” to come into compliance with pharmacy regulations. The pharmacy and the board agreed to resolve the charge of willful or gross negligence with a warning.
The board records do not identify the pharmacy’s current owner.
Board records indicate the former owner, Bryan Vander Linden, admitted in 2024 that he had intentionally diverted controlled substances “for personal use” over the course of six years while working at a Hy-Vee pharmacy in Fairfield.
According to the board, Vander Linden’s admission came about after federal agents with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration launched an investigation into some form of unspecified “discrepancies” at Summit Pharmacy.
The board charged Vander Linden with knowingly making misleading or untrue statements in the practice of pharmacy; habitual intoxication or addiction to drugs; being convicted of a state or federal law related to drugs or the practice of pharmacy; stealing prescription drugs from a pharmacy for one’s personal use; and practicing pharmacy while under the influence of illegally obtained drugs or while impaired by legitimately prescribed drugs.
Vander Linden’s license was suspended last year when he signed an agreement to refrain from practicing. Earlier this year, the board agreed to settle the charges, in part by lifting the May 2024 license suspension and allowing Vander Linden to “return to practicing as a pharmacist at Summit Pharmacy.”
The settlement also stipulated that Vander Linden must pay a $500 civil penalty and participate in the state’s Impaired Practitioners’ Health Program for Pharmacy and submit to any required drug screenings.
As a result of the DEA investigation, Vander Linden was criminally charged last year with acquiring controlled substances through fraud, deception or misrepresentation. Prosecutors alleged he stole 3,800 doses of Oxycodone, 1,001 doses of Hydrocodone, and 428 doses of Carisoprodol.
Earlier this year, he was convicted of the charged offense and sentenced to four years of probation and fined $9,500.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality revived its Natural State Stewardship Program (NSTEP) after a brief hiatus Thursday, inducting a Fort Smith motor factory into the program for its commitments to reduce emissions.
ABB Inc. manufactures electric motors for everything from conveyor belts to solar panels and was inducted into NSTEP’s diamond tier this past summer, but its addition to the program’s ranks was not announced until this week.
The NSTEP program started in 2019 to incentivize environmental stewardship, according to DEQ. Those who commit to voluntarily reducing their emissions, completing energy efficiency projects or other environmentally friendly initiatives can be inducted into one of the program’s three tiers. Members can be considered for perks such as expedited technical assistance for permit renewals or modifications, reduced reporting requirements or advance notice of inspections “on a case-by-case basis,” according to the programs handbook.
Prior to this year, the program had four inductees — Dassault Falcon Jet and Pratt and Whitney, both in the aviation industry; the Arkansas Department of the Military; and ECCI, an engineering and environmental consulting firm. But until this year, the last induction into the program happened in 2022.
To be inducted into NSTEP, companies have to meet permit compliance and “beyond compliance” requirements. Facilities that had “serious violations” of their DEQ-issued permits within a year of applying for the program are not eligible, nor are facilities that have been convicted of law violations or have entered into out-of-court settlements within three years.
The additional, “beyond compliance” requirements vary by the tier a facility applies for. For the diamond tier, the highest tier, a facility has to commit to completing two environmental stewardship projects within a three-year period. At least one of the projects has to be community-based, and at least one “must demonstrate an improvement of performance of either the facility, its activities, products, or services.”
As part of its induction into the program, ABB committed to significantly reducing emissions from its Fort Smith manufacturing facility. It plans to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, “a central element of its stewardship,” a press release from DEQ said.
ABB will also reduce Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 90%. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from sources not directly controlled or owned by ABB, such as employee travel and contracted waste disposal.
The company’s local initiative is a garden project with a nearby Boys and Girls Club to teach hands-on gardening skills and reduce food waste.
“What makes this recognition meaningful is not just the title, but the measurable, ambitious commitments behind it,” Department of Energy and Environment Secretary Shane Khoury said at the induction ceremony at ABB’s Fort Smith manufacturing plant. “These are not just abstract goals. They are measurable, time-bound actions that reflect true leadership and responsible stewardship.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5944-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, resigned from the Alaska Senate on Friday to pursue her gubernatorial candidacy, according to a news release from her campaign.
Her resignation follows that of fellow Senate minority caucus member Mike Shower, who represented Wasilla and resigned at the end of last month to focus on his run for lieutenant governor.
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, confirmed he received Hughes’ resignation letter Friday.
Hughes’ resignation was expected. She told the Alaska Beacon in October she planned to resign in time for her replacement to be in place before the legislative session begins in January.
“My constituents, they’ve been my peeps all these years. I want to make sure that they have representation from the get-go,” she said on Friday afternoon.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy will select her replacement from among a number of nominees to be selected by Republican party officials in her district. Republican Senators must confirm his choice before that person is seated.
Hughes’ replacement must be a Republican and meet the state Constitution’s requirements to hold office.
Hughes said she expects that Rep. Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, will be among the nominees for her seat because Tilton has already filed to run for senator in the district. If Tilton were appointed, the governor would then have to select someone to fill the empty House seat.
Hughes was initially appointed to her seat in 2012 by then-Gov. Sean Parnell, which she credits, in part, to the fact that she was already running.
“I think that when a candidate does that, that shows real interest,” she said.
She said she does not expect her departure to cause significant changes because her district reliably produces “reasonable conservative” lawmakers.
Hughes is one of 12 Republicans and 14 total candidates that seek to be elected governor in 2026. Gov. Mike Dunleavy is termed out and cannot seek reelection.
Hughes said she has fond memories of her time in the Capitol.
“It’s a big change, stepping into the gubernatorial race,” she said. “You know, there are unknowns with that, but I have tremendous peace about this. I really did feel that my chapter was closing in the Senate.”
She represented her district for 12 years.

Late Friday, lawyers representing Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris and other elected officials who originally challenged the Guard’s presence filed court papers highlighting the need for the court’s urgent intervention. 
“The upscaling of Governor Lee’s arbitrary and unlawful deployment exacerbates ongoing irreparable injuries to the Plaintiffs and their communities,” the lawyers wrote. 
“The expanding scope of this indefinite military occupation underscores the urgent need for injunctive relief,” they wrote.
Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Moskal has been weighing the request for a temporary injunction to halt the Guard’s activities in Memphis since she held a court hearing in the case on Nov. 5. 
Stockard on the Stump: National Guard could roam Memphis streets for a year

Harris, two state representatives, a state senator and members of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners and Memphis City Council originally filed suit on Oct. 17 seeking to oust the guard, arguing Lee’s deployment of the men and women to Memphis to combat crime and illegal immigration violates the Tennessee constitution and state law. 
The Tennessee Constitution permits the Guard only in “circumstances amounting to a rebellion or invasion,” they argued. “Even then, the legislature must declare, by law, that the public safety requires it.”
The lawsuit also cites state law that entrusts local officials with the authority to determine whether there has been a breakdown in law and order requiring the presence of the guard. 
Guardsmen have been deployed to the city since Oct. 10. Agents with state and federal law enforcement agencies — among them the Tennessee Highway Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security — have conducted traffic stops and made arrests in support of the effort.

Legislators say they will remember Eklund for his mentorship, kind spirit and thoughtful approach to lawmaking. 
The post Wyoming Rep. John Eklund dies appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming State Rep. John Eklund, a Laramie County Republican and rancher, died Friday after a battle with cancer. He was 74. 
First elected to the House in 2011, Eklund focused much of his tenure on agricultural issues and water policy. His colleagues told WyoFile they’ll remember him for his mentorship, kind spirit and his thoughtful approach to lawmaking. 
“John Eklund was one of the finest people I have ever known,” said former Speaker of the House Albert Sommers, who served alongside Eklund for 11 years. “It was an honor to serve with someone who had his incredible heart and integrity.”
Gov. Mark Gordon ordered the Wyoming State Flag to remain at half-staff at the Capitol and in Laramie County until sunset on the date of Eklund’s internment. It was already at half-staff in honor of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who died Nov. 3.
“Wyoming has lost a dedicated public servant, a steadfast advocate for agriculture, and a man whose kindness touched everyone who had the privilege to know him,” Gordon said in a statement. “Jennie and I hold his wife, Suzi, and the entire Eklund family close in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.” 
Eklund “brought a steady hand, a gentle spirit, and a deep commitment to Wyoming’s agricultural community, work that earned him respect on both sides of the aisle,” Gordon said. 
That respect included Laramie Democrat Rep. Karlee Provenza, who served with Eklund on the House Agriculture, State and Public Lands and Water Resources Committee. 
“There was never a doubt in anyone’s mind that John Eklund cared deeply for the people of Wyoming and his district,” Provenza told WyoFile. “He led with his heart and treated everyone with compassion and kindness despite any contention our chamber was grappling with. I will miss his calming and loving presence and think about him often.” 
Jackson Democrat Mike Yin said, “it’s going to be hard for Laramie County to replace him,” and “I am thinking about Suzi and their family during this time.”
In the 2025 general session, Eklund co-sponsored successful bills to limit eminent domain for energy collector systems, to bolster private landowners’ rights to build fencing along state land and to create easements for local roads on state lands. 
He also brought legislation earlier this year to support veterans, including a bill to update the Wyoming Veterans Memorial Museum in Casper and to build a new veterans’ home in Buffalo.

Eklund chaired several committees throughout his time in the Legislature, including the House Agriculture Committee, Select Water Committee, as well as the House Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee. 
During its Friday meeting in Cheyenne, the Joint Education Committee took time to reflect on Eklund’s service to the state. 
Eklund and Sen. Chris Rothfuss, D-Laramie, were part of the same freshmen class of lawmakers in 2011. 
“So I’ve served with him my entire time I’ve served in the Legislature,” Rothfuss told the committee. “He was such an incredibly positive, kind, friendly, supportive person that really thought highly of the Wyoming Legislature, the institution. And so he served with class and with honor and certainly with endless hard work.”
“John was kind of a mentor to me, a great encourager in my first term,” Rep. Martha Lawley, R-Worland, told the committee. 
“He cared about new legislators, and he was willing to step in if you were open and receive that encouragement, guidance, those kinds of things. So it’s a loss, and we need more men and women like him in the Legislature,” she said.
Rep. Bob Davis, R-Baggs, told WyoFile he also benefited from Eklund’s mentorship. The two had first met about a decade earlier when Davis was a conservation district representative. 
“But then it was really unique when I got elected as a representative. John was there to greet me as a freshman,” Davis said. “And he helped me, showed me the path in the House, and what to look for and things like that. His insight was tremendously helpful to me.”
Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, said that he admired Eklund for his kindness and his devotion to his community — as was shown, Neiman said, by his district’s decision to have him represent them for so many years. 
“I think he did a wonderful job of trying to be very fair, and really kept his constituents, I believe, at the forefront of his mind,” Neiman told WyoFile
The Wyoming Republican Party, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and Secretary of State Chuck Gray also issued statements of remembrance. 
Long before he was a legislator, Eklund grew up in Albin, where he was boyhood friends with former lawmaker Dan Kirkbride. The two played sports and did FFA together. 
“He was just one of your nice friends from a good, rural family growing up,” Kirkbride told WyoFile. “And that’s who he was, and then he became all of that when he was an adult.”
As a lawmaker, Kirkbride said, “for him, it wasn’t war. It was an opportunity to serve.” 
“His family should be very proud of the man that he was,” Kirbride said. “I’m sure that they are.”
(Disclosure: Kirkbride serves on WyoFile’s board, which does not have authority to direct news coverage or news content.)
Sen. Barry Crago, R-Buffalo, served with Eklund when he was in the House. The two ranchers would go on to become family friends. 
“He was the epitome of a family man,” Crago said, adding that Eklund would travel all across the state to watch his grandkids run track and play sports. 
“He was just a great human being,” Crago said. “It’s a huge loss for the Legislature. Huge loss for the state. We were lucky to have him while we did.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)In the first days of the federal government shutdown, North Carolina officials were wary of an already extensive recovery from Hurricane Helene hitting even more obstacles.
Over 43 days, the longest shutdown in history, state leaders rushed to prevent key federal programs from lapsing and ensure that rebuilding in the mountains could continue, even as Washington stood still.
Now, with the shutdown in the rearview mirror and federal workers back on the clock, North Carolina appears to have avoided any major stumbling blocks in hurricane recovery.
“Time is of the essence, always, with recovery,” Matt Calabria, who leads Gov. Josh Stein’s recovery office for western North Carolina, told reporters Friday. “So delays in getting reimbursements are material, to local governments in particular. But a lot of the broader … concerns that we had we’ve worked really hard to figure out how to avoid.”
Two programs paid for with federal dollars were set to lapse during the shutdown: one that provided crisis counseling, and another to hire displaced workers for recovery-related jobs. Both have since been extended.
U.S. Department of Agriculture county offices are reopening across the state. And the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development, which oversees a $1.4 billion pool of money to rebuild homes destroyed by the storm, is back to full capacity after weeks of skeleton staffing.
North Carolina officials have not been able to use that HUD money, but have been able to lean on a separate bundle of state dollars to keep their homebuilding program, Renew NC, running.
“Our folks estimate that has cut months off the clock,” said Calabria.

While the state has managed to tread water during the shutdown, many local governments are struggling to stay afloat.
The already laborious process to get paid back for rebuilding costs slowed to a crawl during the shutdown, leaving cash-strapped communities desperate for repayment. FEMA assistance continues to flow — the agency announced $155 million in aid last week — but bureaucratic hurdles are frustrating local officials.
Kevin Leonard, executive director of the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners, said the federal repayment process had effectively created a “recovery gap.”
“Accountability should not become red tape,” Leonard told state leaders during a meeting of the governor’s advisory committee on Helene recovery. “It’s resulting in major cash flow strains across our cities and counties.”
Local governments would benefit, he said, from waivers that would allow them to bypass reviews for routine payments like debris cleanup. DHS requires any payment over $100,000 to be signed off on by Secretary Kristi Noem and be cleared by the Department of Government Efficiency. Leonard says that’s leading to longer waits.
Ryan Cody, the town administrator for Marshall in Madison County, said Friday it was “really frustrating” to navigate the extensive reimbursement justification process when the results are already tangible — in the form of parks, sidewalks and a water treatment plant. He asked state officials to search for solutions to get money “directly appropriated” so projects wouldn’t face further delays.
“We have advocated for not having to jump through those additional hoops,” Calabria said, emphasizing that conversations with federal officials are ongoing.
A flurry of deadlines are approaching for local leaders and groups to apply for more funding. Over the next two months, applications are due for local government capital grants, recreation projects, broadband repairs and volunteer-led rebuild grants.
And the state’s most expansive program — single-family home rebuilding and repairs — stops accepting applications at the end of the year. As of Friday afternoon, the program has almost 4,700 active applications, according to state data.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3427-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

More than half of the University of Alaska system schools attend UAA or one of its satellite campuses. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The University of Alaska is anticipating an increase of up to 10% for health care costs this fiscal year, on par with what employers are anticipating nationally, according to officials presenting to the Board of Regents at their meeting on Nov. 6. 
Nikole Conley, chief of human resources for the university system, gave a presentation outlining the university system’s health care costs so far, and projections for the rest of this fiscal year, ending in July 2026. Her presentation included medical, dental and pharmacy care. 
“We do see health care costs across the nation going up and increasing, and we’re not necessarily expecting this to decline anytime soon,” she said.
The university is projecting 8% to 10% overall cost increases across the system for this fiscal year. That means health coverage for 3,442 employees is estimated to cost $85.5 million.     

A screenshot from a University of Alaska presentation on health care costs on Nov. 6, 2025, shows a rise in costs in recent years.
 

“​​We are seeing trend increases of 8% for medical, 13% for pharmacy and 4% for dental. We’ll do another recast in January of 2026 and hopefully try to firm up that figure and what that’s going to look like,” Conley said. 
Nationally, employers are expecting an 8.5% increase in medical costs and an 11% increase in pharmacy costs, she said, so the university’s costs and projections are mirroring that trend. 
Health care costs in Alaska are among the highest in the nation, according to state data. Since 2023, the average cost of a health insurance marketplace plan in Alaska rose by more than 16% each year. In 2023 alone, the cost went up by an average of 18.4%.
The university has a cost split for health care with 18% paid by employees in premiums, and 82% paid by the universities. Conley presented total cost projections to the board. 
Conley said the number of university employees isn’t growing, but more people are opting into the university’s health care plan. She said system-wide the largest cost increase is in pharmacy claims, but her department is expecting to renegotiate pharmacy costs, which could save the university about $3 million. 
Last year, the university saw pharmacy spending increase 11.2% from the year before. Over the last five years, overall pharmacy costs more than doubled from $9.2 million to $19.2 million, she said.
Conley said that’s partly due to a rise in prescriptions for drugs used for weight loss and to treat diabetes, known as GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic. They were the second highest pharmacy claim within the university’s plan, totaling $4.1 million last fiscal year.
“We’re also looking at the potential elimination of GLP-1s, because they are a major cost driver for us,” she added.
University of Alaska Regent Karen Perdue pushed back against that idea, pointing out that weight loss can also improve employees’ health outcomes and result in less health care costs. “It’s not just a plus, there can be a minus on the bottom line as well,” she said.     

A screenshot from a University of Alaska presentation on health care costs on Nov. 6, 2025 shows the highest claims for medical and pharmacy care
 

University of Alaska President Pat Pitney also pointed out other high pharmacy costs last year. The largest costs were on inflammatory diseases, with the highest cost at $4.3 million, and cancer treatments at $1.3 million.
The highest medical costs for the university last fiscal year were for muscle, joint and bone claims at $10.7 million, followed by cancer at $7 million, and behavioral health and disorder treatments at $5.3 million.
Last year, the university’s total costs came in at $80.1 million, which was $1.1 million over the university’s projection. Conley said next year’s premiums will go up to recover those costs. 
Conley said her department is working to push more education and use of wellness programs and preventative health care.
“Not only are we seeing this growth of 8% to 10% in cost, but we’re also seeing less use, for some reason, of our preventative health care. And so we’re really trying to encourage folks to use preventative health care, because that will help minimize some of our costs in the future,” she said. 
According to university data presented by Conley, only half of health care participants used preventative screenings, like annual physical exams or checkups; nearly 38% of emergency room visits could have been avoided with better primary care or urgent care use; and 38% of participants are categorized as pre-obese or obese. 
The university is insured through Premera Blue Cross, and Conley said her department discusses health care plan changes with the university’s Joint Health Care Committee, an advisory committee made up of representatives from the faculty union, management and staff. 
The university is also expecting a health care rebate, which is a benefit paid back to employees if they utilize the prevention programs throughout the year, like cancer screenings, dental care, and regular check ups. 
“We’re estimating about a $1.5 million rebate,” Conley said, for this year, ending in July 2026. “We’re going to see up to a $2.5 million rebate increase in FY27 with new rates. So that’s a good positive.”
The debate around national health care, federal tax credits, and costs for Americans has been at the heart of bitter negotiations around ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. This week, the U.S Congress approved a stopgap spending bill ending the shutdown. Democrats have introduced a discharge petition to force a vote to extend tax credits for three years under the Affordable Care Act. White the Senate Majority leader has promised a vote by the end of the year, leaders of the Republican-majority House have remained opposed, and discussions on health care are ongoing.

Kim Reynolds and Iowa State University President Wendy Wintersteen celebrated the expansion of bioindustrial manufacturing in Iowa as they joined executives of BioMADE at the ISU BioCentury Research Farm Friday for a groundbreaking ceremony.
The event celebrated the kickoff of the $40 million project to bring BioMADE, a Manufacturing Innovation Institute backed by the U.S. Department of War, to the ISU facility. The Iowa facility was funded using $10 million from the Iowa Economic Development Authority, $10 million from ISU and $20 million from BioMADE, in addition to receiving support from the U.S. Department of War.
The site, which measures 15,000 square feet, will be a pilot-scale biomanufacturing plant in Boone, designed to support the development and research of bioindustrial products to bring them to commercial and defense markets. The project includes plans to expand the ISU’s fermentation facilities, with 5,000 and 10,000-liter industrial fermenters, as well as lab space and downstream processing capabilities, for businesses to use to test products before deciding whether to move ahead with investing in their own manufacturing facilities for a product.
Reynolds said that nearly a year prior to the event ISU and BioMADE leaders visited her office to showcase their vision for the project.
“It was a bold, practical plan to bring together Iowa’s strengths in agriculture, research and manufacturing to build something truly transformative — and what an incredible moment it is to see all of that take shape today,” Reynolds said. “Today’s milestone is a reflection of the power of partnerships and the potential that it creates when government, industry and academia work side by side.”
Reynolds said Iowa and ISU in particular are a great fit for the project, as the university is already a leader on biomanufacturing, production and research, saying “the type of expertise and infrastructure that’s needed already exists” for BioMADE’s goals at the ISU BioCentury Research Farm.
“This new pilot (and) scaled-up facility helps complete Iowa’s biomanufacturing ecosystem,” Reynolds said. “It will take the discoveries from the lab and scale them into real world applications, accelerating American research and development, creating great new jobs and ensuring that breakthroughs developed in this country are made in this country.”
BioMADE CEO Douglas Friedman said that alongside the Iowa facility, the organization has also launched similar pilot projects in California and Minnesota with different production capacities and equipment, filling “a critical gap” in pilot and demonstration infrastructure, allowing for businesses to experiment with different products and materials throughout the country.
Wintersteen said much of the work already being done by researchers and faculty at the ISU facility is already focused on “identifying and fulfilling the critical gaps” in bringing products to market in bioindustrial fields, and that there will be opportunities for collaboration between the university and BioMADE.
“It will also serve as a hub for hands-on training and workforce development, preparing the next generation of bio-processing engineers and scientists,” Wintersteen said. “So we’re excited about what’s going to happen here, and the faculty that will be working here, and their efforts and efforts of many others that will produce key breakthroughs in bio-manufacturing.”
Friedman also said these pilot projects are crucial for “leading the way to more bio-based products being manufactured right here in America.” In Iowa, there will be a specific focus on food-grade capabilities — “ingredients like prebiotics, probiotics, sweeteners, flavors,” he said.
“We’ll be able to tie into the robust biomanufacturing ecosystem that is already present here in Iowa,” Friedman said.
Friedman also praised state government and ISU leaders for allowing the project to move forward quickly, “at a speed that makes sense in this era of global competition.” The facility is scheduled to open in 2027.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/biomade2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

Jeff Landry has established a new government efficiency task force to look at ways to cut state government spending.  (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)A task force Gov. Jeff Landry assembled is recommending that Louisiana’s colleges and universities join six other university systems from Southern states in a new conservative accrediting body. 
The governor’s Task Force on Public Higher Education Reform voted Thursday to request the Board of Regents, which oversees higher education in the state, ask for state money to pursue membership and a board seat on the Commission for Public Higher Education
The alternative accreditor is being formed by state university systems in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Accreditors are necessary to ensure schools meet minimum educational standards. 
The task force did not provide public notice of its meeting, which is a violation of the state’s Open Meetings Law. The statute requires all public bodies to take basic steps to ensure the public’s right to observe government proceedings. The Illuminator, which had requested notice to be sent, only learned of the meeting after it occurred when an attendee shared a copy of its recommendations. 
Louisiana’s move to change accreditors comes as conservatives have sparred with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, which evaluates colleges and universities in Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. 
Conservative politicians have taken issue with traditional accreditors at times because of their standards related to diversity, equity and inclusion. They also require safeguards that are intended to limit the influence of external forces, including politicians, in public higher education. 
The Southern Association does not require any DEI measures on its members’ campuses.
The Commission for Public Higher Education is seeking expedited recognition from the U.S. Department of Education, which is required for any school it approves to receive federal financial aid. 
The task force also recommended state legislation that would allow colleges and universities in Louisiana to be accredited by any group with the U.S. Department of Education’s recognition. The governor’s panel also recommended the removal of all references to the Southern Association from state law and higher education policy. 
Landry’s task force is also seeking legislation to prohibit any accreditor from having required standards that would violate state law. Legislators have previously filed legislation that conflicts with accrediting standards, but typically scale back or pull the bills once they are made aware they could risk universities’ accreditation status. 
In 2024, a bill that would have given the governor the power to directly hire university system presidents was significantly rolled back after good governance groups voiced concerns it would risk violating standards that prohibit undue external influence on universities. 
Task force members also recommended legislation to require schools post on their websites any documentation they submit to their accreditors to gain or maintain approval. 
Every member of the task force has been directly appointed to their job by Landry or his conservative allies except two: Commissioner of Higher Education Kim Hunter Reed and Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, who served as chairman. 
Besides Reed and Brumley, the other members are: 

 Misti Cordell, Board of Regents chairwoman
 Mark Romero, University of Louisiana System board chairman
 Scott Ballard, LSU System board chairman
 Tony Clayton, Southern University System board chairman
 Tim Hardy, Louisiana Community and Technical College System chairman 
 Sen. Rick Edmonds, R-Central, Senate Education Committee chairman

This story by Liz Sauchelli was first published in the Valley News on Nov. 13, 2025.
WINDSOR — The federal shutdown ended late Wednesday night with a bill that extends the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP benefits, through the end of next September.
Even in spite of the restoration of these benefits, however, those who use SNAP and those who work to address food insecurity in the Upper Valley remain concerned about the program’s future.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” Maria Rogers, who, to supplement her SNAP benefits, uses and volunteers at the food pantry at Trinity Free Evangelical Church in downtown Windsor. “Not just a little. A lot.”
Rogers and others interviewed this week before the shutdown ended said that their concerns would persist even after the shutdown ended.
When the shutdown started on Oct. 1, the federal government paused SNAP payments for Rogers and millions of others who receive the monthly benefit. States tried to make up the difference, but the uncertainty and lack of payments led to growing food insecurity for residents.
Each month, when Rogers, a 65-year-old Windsor resident, gets $166 from SNAP, she starts looking at what area grocery stores have on sale. Then, she asks herself a question: “Is the gas worth it?”
Brenda Egbert, of Fairlee, supplements her grocery shopping with produce and other items from the food pantry at at the Orford Congregational Church, which is run by the organization Orford Cares and the Orford, N.H., Democratic Committee on Tuesday, Nov. 11. This year an average of more than 40 people each week visit the pantry to pick up non-perishable food donated by community members or purchased with donated funds, and produce provided by Willing Hands. “It definitely makes a dent in the grocery bill,” said Egbert.

This month that math was harder to do because of the delay in SNAP benefits. Rogers received half — $83 — from the state of Vermont on Nov. 7, but she had yet to receive the remainder. (A Vermont official told lawmakers on Thursday that a full month’s benefits were set to go to recipients on Friday via Electronic Benefit Transfer cards, though the process could take until Monday for direct deposit into bank accounts.)
Rogers and her husband are both disabled. She has also volunteered and cooked meals for Upper Valley food pantries for close to 40 years.
“Oh no,” Rogers, of Windsor, said when asked if the money covers her monthly grocery bills. “Especially if you get meat, that barely covers for a month.”
The number of families the Trinity food shelf serves in Windsor has grown by about a third over the last couple of months, said Nan Pariseau, a church member who also serves as operations director for the food shelf.
“We’ve been expecting it,” Pariseau, 56, of Claremont, said during an interview at the food pantry. “We’ve been preparing for it.”
Fall and the upcoming holiday season are typically busy for food pantries. The colder temperatures and shorter days mean fuel and electricity costs rise. Children are home from school for vacations and families are trying to create special holiday memories. Even with SNAP benefits fully restored, those other stressors do not go away, Pariseau said. “It’s a storm brewing,” she said.
The Trinity food pantry is averaging 52 families per week. Usually the number is around 34 families per week, with more showing up toward the end of the month as SNAP benefits run low. Many of the new patrons are older adults with one- or two-person households and families with more than five people. “Those are the ones that are really struggling,” Pariseau said.
The Trinity food pantry spends around $2,500 a month on food and is projected to spend about 15% more than that this month, Pariseau said.

She has been applying for more grants, in addition to working with other community groups and food pantries. She and food pantry volunteers are also working to spread the word that Trinity’s doors are open for anyone in need. “The biggest barrier we have is shame,” Pariseau said. She noted that she used SNAP herself years ago while she was raising three children and going through a divorce.
Shame shouldn’t be a barrier, said Shawn Dennett, a Windsor resident and single father of two children, ages 11 and 9, who volunteers at the Trinity food pantry. He uses SNAP to help feed his children. “How am I going to do this?” was his first thought Dennett, 38, said when the shutdown started. “I told my kids that whatever is in the apartment, you guys have at it.”
When his children asked him what he would do, he said he’d manage. He and his family got $287 in SNAP benefits on Nov. 7, half of their usual allotment, and are making it work, including by using the food pantry.
“It’s scary,” he said about the uncertainty surrounding SNAP. “After this shutdown … even if it does get lifted, going forward, what’s going to happen?”
Dennett works as a landscaper during the warmer months, but the jobs dry up as it gets colder. He also wants to be able to spend time with his children, including being home when they get home from school and to cook dinner for them every night.
Pasta dishes are a hit and his 11-year-old son is a fan of T-bone steak. Some nights, when he’s too tired to cook or had a rough day at work, the kids get microwavable Chef Boyardee ravioli cups as a treat. Meat takes up the biggest share of the budget, Dennett said, and he’s noticed costs are rising. He noted that eggs and dairy products have also gone up in price.
“SNAP is out there to help families,” he said.
Food pantries are too. Dennett is a member of Trinity Evangelical Free Church. “I was a little wary at first” to use the food pantry, but thinks differently now. “Nobody needs to go hungry,” he said.

Many patrons are older and some struggle to prepare meals for themselves. Others are working multiple jobs while caring for family members and don’t have the time.
“A lot of people want prepared food,” Rogers said. She cooks using items donated or purchased by the food pantry. Beef Stroganoff, spaghetti with sauce, macaroni and cheese and salmon pea wiggle are among the more popular dishes. The food shelf prepares meals that are portioned out that people can then take home to heat up later.
Patrons who liked a dish often ask for the recipe. Sometimes, Rogers will teach them how to cook it in Trinity’s kitchen.
Each year, the food pantry puts together 65 Thanksgiving baskets — filled with all the fixings for a Thanksgiving meal — and as of Wednesday had 91 families signed up, with the Nov. 14 deadline a few days away. Panty staff are currently working on figuring out how to get turkeys, which cost around $15 each, for each of the baskets.
“We are digging deep,” Pariseau said.

The community is as well. The food pantry has seen an influx in donations. There are some products that are harder to come by and more expensive that patrons need, including gluten-free items. Many of the older patrons are coping with health challenges and need low-sodium and sugar-free options. There’s also a need for canned fruit and cooking oils.
“They really need more fruits and vegetables in their lives but if they can’t afford it, they should come here and get it,” said Ginny Barr, 75, of Reading, a longtime food pantry volunteer. She noted that there are no barriers to getting help: the food pantry does not ask patrons for income information or other proof that they’re in need.
“They’re here for a reason,” Barr said at the food pantry. “They’ve got their reasons. We don’t have [to] know their reasons. We just serve them.”
Even before the shutdown, other Upper Valley food pantries were experiencing similar increases: In the last year, the Upper Valley Haven has seen a 20% increase in patrons, said Jennifer Fontaine, director of operations at the White River Junction-based nonprofit organization. “In October 2025 alone, there were 2,099 visits — a 16% increase over September’s numbers, continuing a steady rise that began in August,” she wrote in an email.
The Haven saw 108 new households in October and another 103 households who hadn’t stopped by in more than a year — “[c]lear signs that many neighbors are still struggling with high costs and ongoing financial strain,” Fontaine wrote.
To meet patrons increased needs, the Haven ran a fundraising campaign. Food donations are still needed, including items such as cooking oils, spices, baking supplies, shelf-stable milk and jams or jellies. “Many individuals and groups have reached out to host food drives or volunteer, and we hope that enthusiasm continues even when the government reopens and SNAP benefits resume,” Fontaine wrote. “With food and consumer costs remaining high, the need for assistance will still be there.”

(Photo via Providence Warwick CVB)A proposed $300-per-tenant annual fee for landlords who provide student-only housing drew strong reactions during a public hearing before a Providence City Council committee Thursday night, mostly from opponents.
In June 2025, Councilors Shelley Peterson and John Goncalves introduced the proposal to amend the city’s housing laws and allow for the fee for owners of off-campus buildings rented solely to college students. Noncompliant landlords could face fines of up to $500 a day. The ordinance would require the city’s colleges and universities to supply lists of students living off campus. 
There was no vote at Thursday’s meeting of the Committee on Ordinances, which was held expressly for committee members to hear residents’ thoughts on the proposed “student impact fee.” In her opening remarks, Peterson acknowledged her proposal was controversial, adding that disagreement is an ingredient in the democratic process. 
“What we’re discussing tonight isn’t about politics or personalities,” Peterson said. “It’s about whether we believe that everyone who benefits from our city should also share in the responsibility of taking care of it.” 
Peterson — who presides over Ward 14, home to Providence College (PC) and dense with off-campus housing —  then went on to “dispel a very immediate rumor” that the fee is “about punishing students.” 
“It’s about holding accountable the landlords and developers who profit most from student housing while contributing the least to the neighborhoods that they reshape,” Peterson said, and cited the example of Ward 14, where the city has had to install more than 200 new parking signs, clear drains, and “respond to more police and sanitation calls [near student housing] than any other part of the ward.”
The council’s ordinances committee first took up the issue at its July 17 meeting, and planned for a future public hearing. Before Thursday’s meeting, Goncalves removed himself as a sponsor. Goncalves did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. 
Peterson told the students who turned out to testify in opposition that they’re being misled by landlords. A handout at the meeting also sought to counter the claims made by landlords about the ordinance.      
“Contrary to everything that they’ve told you, the city does value you,” Peterson said. “You are part of the fabric of Providence. You do support our businesses. You do volunteer your time, and you do bring life to our streets.” 
“You’re not the problem,” Peterson continued. “The problem is an unchecked housing system that treats you as a product and your neighborhood as a profit margin.”
There’s much profit to be made off students living off Providence’s many campuses, which include Brown University, Providence College, Rhode Island College, Rhode Island School of Design and Johnson & Wales University.
But most of the 150 pages of written testimony the council received leaned heavily against the measure, with 135 pages of opposition to 15 pages of support. A good chunk of the opposition letters were names from a petition.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley submitted a letter in opposition to the ordinance as drafted, citing “serious operational and enforcement concerns.” Forcing colleges to share information on students’ addresses might conflict with federal privacy laws, Smiley suggested, and matching anonymized student data to specific properties could prove tricky and time-consuming.

Broke college students
The proposal is another chapter in what’s been a woeful year for the finances of Rhode Island’s capital city. A November 2024 settlement with the state education department forced city officials to come up with $11 million, leading the city to ask for the General Assembly’s permission to increase its overall tax levy. The successful maneuver nevertheless offered a rare moment at the State House where landlords and tenants decried the effect the legislation would have on property taxes, which had skyrocketed in the latest cycle of property reevaluations.   
The levy increased 5.85% for fiscal year 2026 only, but the increases fell upon homeowners in unequal ways. Non-owner occupied, multifamily homes with two to five units — the kinds of housing inhabited by college students — were subject to an average 13% increase in property taxes for fiscal year 2026.
That trickles down, argued Kevin Keaveney, a Providence College senior studying finance and business management. He told the committee Thursday that students “are genuinely worried about the financial strain this proposed plan would place on them.” 
“The stereotype that college students are broke exists for a reason,” Keaveney said. 
Peterson actually voted against final passage of the fiscal year 2026 budget in July, one of only two councilors to do so. The additional student fee money would not go into general revenue or municipal services, however. Instead, Peterson said the fees would be directed to the city’s new home repair program, which she said “helps our low-income homeowners fix code violations by making repairs and staying in their homes in a city where the median household income is $66,000.”
“The money collected here won’t go to the general fund,” Peterson said. “It’s not going to get lost in red tape.”
Peterson said the ordinance targets landlords, not students, and she cited the largest off-campus landlord in Ward 14’s Elmhurst neighborhood who provides housing for roughly 1,200 students, pulling in an estimated $7 million a year in rent. Add in fees — “There’s added fees for pretty much everything that you guys have, right?” Peterson said — and the landlord could rake in $660,000 monthly in fees alone, in the councilor’s estimate. 
That business model incensed Peterson and Councilor Justin Roias, a co-sponsor who strongly defended the ordinance. Toward the end of the meeting, Roias observed Keaveney said his rent was $1,290 a month in an eight-person house. Roias did some rough math and argued that a triple decker could pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in rent income.
“I would argue that the student housing developers in Ward 14 specifically have had a monopolizing effect on the neighborhood,” Roias said. “They’ve actually set the market…I look at this ordinance as one of very few tools that we even have as a city to discourage student developers from continuing this business model.”
The ordinance, Roias said, is not against “mixed” housing, with “a student on the first floor and a family on the second floor,” he said. “This is exclusively student housing that this ordinance targets.”
‘It’s economics 101’
Perhaps most targeted by councilors’ ire were companies like the 02908 Club, a student rental business near Providence College in Ward 14. The Club had recently sent out multiple emails regarding the hearing and public comment period to students. While Peterson did not name the company in her opening remarks, her handout did, and she called the email blasts “a waste of time.”  
Shannon Russell, who sent those emails as part of her job as operations manager for the 02908 Club, disagreed.
“It’s my company that’s being attacked and lied about here tonight, just to put that out there,” Russell said in her turn at the podium.










I would argue that the student housing developers in Ward 14 specifically have had a monopolizing effect on the neighborhood.


– Providence City Councilor Justin Roias


She said the fees could absolutely be passed onto students. Distributors’ costs are passed onto sellers who pass those increased costs onto customers, she said. 
“It’s economics 101,” Russell said. “It’s simple. It’s basic.”
But ordinance supporter Joanne Rich argued the $300 fee was modest compared to the rents being charged.
Rich said the situation near Providence College — such as a highly publicized incident on Halloween night, which Russell and the college claimed did not involve PC students— was evidence that Ward 14 “has already been converted to an unruly, unmonitored extension of the PC campus.” 
Rich then apologized for being “a little snarky” but pressed ahead anyway. She said that if landlords pass along the fees, “I would suggest that the students impacted spend $8 less a week on alcohol, which might go a little way toward lessening the nuisance towards their neighbors as well.”
A date for a committee vote has not been set as of Friday.
“Having the public hearing was really the only planned next step,” City Council Chief of Staff June Rose said in an email Friday. “The sponsor will now consider the feedback from the community, decide on any amendments, and then she would request from the chair that it be scheduled for a vote.”

“The plaintiffs likewise acknowledge that the affected students can protect their own interests, which Jaclyn Hall is attempting to do by joining the lawsuit on behalf of her minor child Z.H.2,” the filing said.

The lawsuit, filed by Ivey and Ledbetter in September in Montgomery County Circuit Court, alleges that AHSAA is discriminating against CHOOSE Act athletes who transfer to another school by having them not participate in athletics for a year.
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like program that allows families to claim up to $7,000 in tax credits for non-public education expenses including private school tuition. 
Student athletes that receive CHOOSE Act funds and transfer to another school are required to be ineligible for sports for one year.  AHSAA considers it financial aid that brings its transfer policies into play, which AHSAA said ensures fairness.
Attorneys for Ivey and Ledbetter filed a preliminary injunction to replace the temporary restraining order they were granted on Sept. 5 and also added an additional plaintiff to the lawsuit in September.
The court is scheduled to hold a hearing in the lawsuit on Nov. 21.
Attorneys for AHSAA also argued that neither Ivey or Ledbetter have been harmed in their roles as governor and speaker of the House.
“Gov. Ivey and Speaker Ledbetter do not identify actual, concrete and particularized injury in fact either has suffered personally in his or her official capacities,” the rebuttal said.
A message seeking comment was left with the AHSAA Friday. Gina Maiola, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a statement Friday Ivey will continue to advocate for CHOOSE Act families affected by AHSAA’s regulations.
“Gov. Ivey’s mission is to simply let the kids play, and she refuses to stand by while the AHSAA unfairly and unlawfully discriminates against CHOOSE Act student-athletes,” she said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Nathaniel-Ledbetter-Kay-Ivey-Feb-12-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

He stayed at the Mercy Housing and Shelter Corporation and was eventually able to get a job and an apartment, which the organization subsidized. The shelter’s help is the “only reason” he is housed, safe, healthy and “living with dignity” today, he said, speaking at a press conference Friday.
But the Trump administration said late Thursday that it planned to cut federal funding for permanent housing programs like the one that helped Chris, who asked to be identified by only his first name.
In Connecticut, the policy change means long-term housing programs could lose as much as $69 million, risking the housing of 6,500 people, according to estimates from the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness and the CT CAN End Homelessness campaign. 
A notice from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development posted Thursday announced changes to what’s known as the Continuum of Care program, which provides most federal homelessness relief funding. Having a disability is a condition to receive permanent housing through Continuum of Care.
According to the notice, the Trump administration plans to lower the cap on permanent housing spending from 90% to 30% of all homelessness relief funding. Instead, funding will flow to programs that provide temporary housing with work requirements, treatment mandates and other conditions.
At the Friday event, held by U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, service providers spoke out against the policy, saying that permanent housing is the most effective, proven method for supporting unhoused people.
For decades, U.S. policy has been guided by a theory, known as “Housing First,” that permanent shelter is a necessary first step for people, who can then — from a more stable living situation — move on to finding health care and steady work. 
The Trump administration favors a different approach.
A U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in a press release Thursday, “The failed ‘Housing First’ ideology… encourages dependence on endless government handouts while neglecting to address the root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.” The press release described the policy change as an effort to increase accountability for service providers by creating competition between them for grants. 
Louis Gill, CEO of housing aid nonprofit Columbus House, said it’s hard for people to improve their lives without first having permanent housing. “When you destabilize housing, you destabilize everything built upon it: medical care, mental health, sobriety, income, employment, community, and safety,” he said.
Gill added that the Trump administration’s policy change will force people who have already become self sufficient to start over, especially those with disabilities.
“These cuts ask providers to look disabled, medically fragile residents in the eye and tell them that the stability they built, the stability our government promised them through this program, may no longer be within reach,” he said.
Sarah Fox, CEO of the CT Coalition to End Homelessness, said it’s not so simple to rework longstanding programs to comply with the new rules. Providers are set up to supply permanent housing and most grants will now be awarded for temporary housing with strings attached, she said. “It is a big separation from our morals.”
What comes next
Critics of the new policy said they hope to stop it from going into effect — or find other funding.
Jennifer Paradis, executive director of the Beth-El Center shelter, said she believes the change is illegal. For one, she said, the policy directs funding to programs that help police clear homeless camps and mandate mental health or addiction treatment in exchange for housing. 
“Nothing in the law authorizes HUD to require criminalization or treatment compliance as a condition of funding,” Paradis said. She also argued it discriminates against disabled people.
Sen. Blumenthal said he expects there to be lawsuits against the policy. 
Blumenthal wants Congress to pass a budget appropriation of $4 billion that specifically requires permanent housing. “It’s on us,” he said.
Connecticut legislators said permanent housing could be funded with some of a $500 million emergency fund they approved on Thursday. Gov. Ned Lamont has discretion over how to use the money, though it’s intended generally to backfill federal funding losses for human services.
State Representative Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon, said she wants to “ensure that that $500 million gets spent, and that some of it gets spent on this.”
But she said that the emergency fund isn’t enough to support permanent housing along with other programs that have lost funding. “Do we honestly believe that that will be enough when we are hearing just the numbers for this one issue?” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0266-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Democratic lawmakers in each chamber of the Florida Legisature have re-introduced a bill that would establish a protocol allowing schools to search for students with autism who wander off.
The bills requires public schools to create plans and a cohort of personnel to address situations in which students with autism “elope,” or wander away from safe areas. 
“This long-overdue measure would finally bring Florida in line with states that have already taken action on this issue,” Sen. Kristen Arrington, a Democrat from Kissimmee, said in a news release. 
“By establishing clear, statewide guidelines, we can equip school districts with the tools and support they need to protect our most vulnerable children. It also gives parents confidence that, in an emergency, their child’s school will be prepared to respond quickly and effectively.”
The bill calls for creating school elopement plans involving immediately contacting the parent of the student, conducting “an immediate, coordinated on-campus search and contacting emergency services only when the student is reasonably believed, based on verified information or direct observation, to have left school grounds and to be at risk of harm.”
The School Staff Assistance for Emergencies teams would annually update the school elopement plan, respond to all elopements, and train school personnel on response. The bill would require a student-specific “quick reference guide” for students prone to eloping.

“As a society, we need to be more assertive in protecting the needs, safety, and dignity of the neurodiverse population. All special needs students in Florida deserve the same protection,” Monica Carretero said in the news release. Carretero is the mother of a child with autism who once was found at an outdoor basketball court after eloping from his classroom.
The identical bills, HB 423 and SB 494, were filed by Rep. Anna Eskamani, an Orlando Democrat, and Arrington. 
Nearly half of children with autism attempt to elope from safe environments, according to the National Autism Association. Some of those children have accidentally drowned. 
“With nearly half of children with autism attempting to elope from safe environments, these safeguards are urgently needed,” Eskamani said in a news release. “Every student deserves to be safe at school, and every parent deserves peace of mind.”
Arrington filed the bill in the 2024 and 2025 sessions. Neither received a committee hearing. 
Eskamani filed the bill in 2023, 2024, and 2025. The 2023 and 2025 bills made it through one subcommittee but died, while her 2024 bill did not receive a hearing.
Lawmakers last session took a particular interest in addressing problems faced by Floridians with autism and their families.
During the 2025 session, the first bill to pass the Senate increases early detection opportunities and educational interventions for children with autism, a top priority for Senate President Ben Albritton, a Republican from Wauchula. That bill, SB 112, is now law.
That bill was among others last session that created a workforce credential for students with autism, and another relating to employers covering benefits for children with autism.
The session starts Jan. 13.

Purdue developed and patented the drug OxyContin in 1996. The prescription painkiller is an opioid, a class of drugs that can relieve pain but can also be highly addictive and debilitating. For years, company officials and the Sacklers, the family that owned the company, downplayed the risk of OxyContin, even as evidence mounted that its frequent prescriptions were leading to more overdose deaths across the country.
Although physicians prescribed fewer bottles of OxyContin and other opioid painkillers over the last decade, research indicates the legacy of Purdue’s marketing campaigns continues to jeopardize American lives. People addicted to prescription painkillers often switched to using illicit opioids, like heroin and fentanyl, when pills became less available. A 2023 Yale study found that states where the company’s marketing was less regulated continue to have higher rates of fentanyl overdoses and infections related to injection drug use, like hepatitis C.

Each year since 2022, Mississippi has been paid tens of millions of opioid settlement dollars, money that is supposed to help respond to the overdose public health crisis. But 15% of those dollars — the money controlled by the state’s towns, cities and counties — is unrestricted and being spent with almost no public knowledge. Mississippi Today spent the summer finding out how almost every local government receiving money has been managing the money over the past three years.Read The Series

The company has pleaded guilty for its marketing of OxyContin in the past, but it and the Sackler family have largely avoided the large national lawsuit payouts other companies have agreed to by filing for bankruptcy in 2019. A previous proposal would have required the family to pay up to $6 billion throughout the United States, but the Supreme Court rejected that settlement in June 2024 because of its civil lawsuit protections for the Sacklers. 
The new settlement, agreed to by state attorneys general in June, instructs the Sacklers to pay $7.4 billion to the states and doesn’t include the same legal shields for the Sacklers. Mississippi is set to receive its nearly $41 million share of that over the next 15 years. 
If finalized, Purdue’s payout brings Mississippi’s contributions from companies to around $421 million in reparations for their roles in the opioid epidemic — a public health catastrophe that has killed over 10,000 Mississippians. Health services in the state responded to close to 5,500 non-fatal overdoses just in the first seven months of 2025, according to the Mississippi State Department of Health.
Purdue’s settlement is subject to similar rules as the previous opioid lawsuits — 70% must be used for future strategies to address addiction, and the remaining 30% can be used for any other public purpose. 
The Legislature and 147 Mississippi local governments will split that 30%, or $12.3 million. So far, few of those local governments’ leaders have chosen to use their money to address the crisis Purdue and the other companies contributed to. Those decisions and delays in the state portion of the opioid settlements have led to Mississippi having committed less lawsuit money to prevent overdoses than every other state in the country as of this summer — both in total dollars and as a percentage of settlement shares.
The 70%, or $28.7 million, that does need to be spent on addiction-related purposes will be overseen by Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council. The council has been meeting over the past few months, and state law says the council is required to recommend how the Legislature should spend the funds by Dec. 7 of this year.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/07043334/AP_17227561183611.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

TerraGen, a renewable energy developer, opened the Monte Cristo I Windpower Project in Hidalgo County, Texas this week. The facility has a 238.5-megawatt capacity — equivalent to powering 81,000 homes a year. And, 78.5 of those megawatts are committed to the copper mine outside Salt Lake City. 
The agreement strengthens the company’s renewable energy portfolio in the country, Rio Tinto Kennecott managing director Nate Foster said in a statement.

“It’s the latest in a series of renewable energy projects for Kennecott, following the installation of a 5MW solar plant in 2023, and a second 25MW solar plant nearing completion,” Foster wrote. “We continue to look for ways to power our operations while also lowering our emissions to help achieve Rio Tinto’s long-term decarbonisation goals.”
Kennecott’s Bingham Canyon mine has been in operation for over 120 years and currently is ready to remain active until 2026. Up until recently, there were plans in place to extend mining until 2032, but the company is also preparing feasibility studies to prolong the mine’s life until 2040.

The agreement also follows a switch to renewable diesel to power haul trucks and other heavy machinery equipment at the open-pit mine. In the past, the company also made efforts to reduce emissions, including the full closure of its coal-powered energy plant in 2019 in favor of solar and wind power sources. 
“Around 78% of the electricity Rio Tinto uses globally comes from renewable sources, and the company is making investment and supply decisions to increase this to around 90% by 2030,” Rio Tinto said in a news release.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)For Hannah DeLange, the most rewarding part of managing Redhead Hemp’s Durham location has been “creating a space for people to feel comfortable and confident” — crafting an inviting social setting much like a coffee shop or bar.
The shelves are lined with CBD gummies, Delta-9 sangrias, and THC caramels, among a host of other drinks and candies with promises like “sleep with benefits” and “lower calories, higher vibes.”
The shop interior has a cozy feel, with plants lining brick walls flush with brightly colored artwork, and plush sofas and chairs to relax on. At the store’s “Canna Cafe,” customers can sit down with hemp-infused teas and coffee.
“It’s just kind of a space for all,” DeLange said. “It should be a plant for all the people, and it should be accessible — and just creating a space that’s able to really just personify that.”
Now, the future of that space and many others like it are in doubt, with the vast majority of their hemp-based cannabinoid products set to become illegal in November 2026.
North Carolina hemp business owners and their counterparts across the U.S. are bracing for the ban’s impact, with some pursuing advocacy efforts to reverse the ban and others working to pivot to the narrow slice of CBD products that will remain legal.

‘I think there’s a lot of fearmongering’
“We found out the morning of the Senate vote that this was occurring,” said Emma MacAdam, the owner of Redhead Hemp. “It was pretty clear when they slipped it in the bill that that bill was going to pass, so it kind of felt like a really sleazy way for them to just slide their agenda into a bill that was very necessary and important for so many people.”

Hemp and marijuana are both varieties of the cannabis plant, differentiated mainly by the levels of the psychoactive compound THC, with hemp having far less of it. CBD, another chemical produced by the cannabis plant, does not have intoxicating effects by itself but produces a calming effect and has been shown to help treat pain and anxiety.
The ban, which sharply decreases the allowable level of THC in hemp products, passed earlier this week as part of an Agriculture appropriations bill that was paired with the stopgap funding agreement to end the federal government shutdown.
It bars the sale of any hemp product, including CBD products, containing more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per container, which DeLange and MacAdam said represents about 99.5% of their stock. This would eliminate “full spectrum” hemp products, which they said make up most typical CBD products.
“Basically, they’re saying we can only use the parts of the plant that are not intoxicating,” DeLange said. “For a lot of people, the THC compound — even that small amount that you see in full spectrum — is what’s really important for pain relief, anxiety, sleep, things like that.”
DeLange said that using CBD products has also helped some customers stop using opioids or drinking heavily. “The drinks have been a really great resource for a lot of people who want to have a healthier alternative for that.”
The ban comes after years of lobbying by the marijuana industry and state law enforcement, who argued the hemp industry exploited a loophole to sell products with many of the same effects of marijuana but none of the regulatory oversight. Senators say they never intended to open a recreational hemp market and only desired to enable industrial hemp farming.
The rationale, according to Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other backers of the Agriculture bill is to “keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children while preserving the hemp industry for farmers” by closing the loophole that allows the sale of CBD products with less than 0.3% THC, the threshold originally set by the 2018 Farm Bill he helped pass.

“Unfortunately, companies have exploited a loophole in the 2018 legislation by taking legal amounts of THC from hemp and turning it into intoxicating substances, and then marketing it to children in candy-like packaging and selling it in easily accessible places, like gas stations and convenience stores all across our country,” McConnell said Monday.
MacAdam and DeLange pushed back on the claim that the products target young customers. They said their shop has a strict over-21 policy.
“It’s very easy to use the ‘save the children’ flagship banner for a lot of things, I think there’s a lot of fearmongering surrounding cannabis — that’s the history of cannabis, period,” DeLange said.
“And absolutely no talk of parent responsibility in that matter, also no talk of how liquor is not childproof, and a lot of new liquor companies are just as cute and colorful,” MacAdam added. “I think it’s a complete cop-out.”
‘The wild west’
The rapid shift to prohibition represents a marked change for an industry that has had little to no regulation for the past seven years in many states, including North Carolina.
North Carolina, has failed to enact any regulations on intoxicating hemp products, even basic age restrictions, despite bipartisan backing from the state Senate, Gov. Josh Stein and Attorney General Jeff Jackson.
In February, the state’s child care task force reported a 600% increase in emergency room visits for minors related to cannabis use since 2019. Stein launched an advisory council on cannabis products in June, urging that “our state’s unregulated cannabis market is the wild west and is crying out for order.”

Last month, Jackson joined 38 states’ attorneys general to call for regulation from Congress on the sale of CBD products, asking lawmakers to “clarify the federal definition of hemp” during the appropriations process.
“State efforts to outlaw hemp-derived psychoactive products to protect their citizens cannot solve this problem,” the letter from the attorneys general read. “Such efforts can only lead to an uneven and ineffectual patchwork of bans and regulations that differ from State to State and will not stop the flood of mail-order THC products from streaming through interstate commerce.”
Bills proposed in North Carolina this year that failed to advance include bans on selling to minors and sales permit requirements as well as childproof packaging and printed warnings. A bill that passed the Senate in June, which Jackson spoke in support of, would forbid sales of hemp-derived drinks, gummies, and other products to anyone under 21 and ban their use on school grounds, among other regulations like a licensing process.
That bill and many others died in the powerful House Rules Committee, now chaired by Rep. John Bell (R-Wayne), who became the president of hemp company Asterra Labs in 2024. Bell did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
MacAdam said the lack of regulation has been a benefit in some ways, such as making the industry more accessible to those with relatively few resources, creating greater opportunity for nontraditional business owners.
“It’s really cool to see what an industry can do when there’s no barrier to entry. There’s no license you need to pay $100,000 for. I started this business with a tiny bit of money and a big goal, and I’m very grateful for all the people that we’ve met along the way,” she said.
‘That’s part of our livelihood’
Also left in the lurch are farm owners who grow floral, or smokable, hemp — the crop grown to make CBD products. Dana Rider, co-owner of Otherside Farm in rural Buncombe County, said the industry had become “kind of jaded” by close calls on potential bans since the legalization of hemp products in 2018.
“We’d be freaking out and then everything would be okay, or they would postpone it for another year,” Rider said. “Obviously, [the ban is] going to strike a chord somewhere, because, you know, that’s part of our livelihood.”
He said his family started growing hemp a year after starting their farm. Other farmers he knows switched to hemp to revitalize old tobacco farms and dairies that had fallen into disrepair. They now operate an online shop, Otherside Hemp, and also sell their products in stores around the state. “It’s part of our income and helps keep the farm afloat,” he said.
He said for many customers, the goal isn’t to experience a chemical high but instead to manage pain and other conditions like insomnia and anxiety.

“Your grandmother and your great aunt and your parents, they don’t want to feel different, they don’t want to have this altered consciousness,” Rider said. “They just want to feel better.”
MacAdam and Rider both say they have been in conversation with other business owners working to push back against the ban in the year before it takes effect.
“We carry a lot of small businesses, a lot of family-run businesses, so we’re really worried about our friends,” MacAdam said.
Otherside Farm plans to urge its supporters to contact their state and local representatives about the ban, Rider said. “We have a year to either figure it out or we have a year to just like, crush it and fight for the plant and hope that we can change this with legislation.”
“We’re going to kind of wait it out,” he added. “Until they tell us that we can’t sell our stuff anymore, we’re going to keep selling our stuff and growing and producing our products.”
While some farms and shops will be able to continue to legally sell products processed to remove any THC, also known as “CBD isolates,” Rider said his farm lacks the equipment to produce them. Because they sell full-spectrum products only, their entire array of products would be wiped out by the ban.
“For us, we can’t really pivot, right?” Rider said. “We would not be around anymore, basically, which is sad to think about.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Redhead-Hemp-Product-Rack-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

(Canva image)The Louisiana Department of Health wants caretakers to stop using ByHeart baby formula, which federal officials say might be contaminated with a bacteria that can make children sick. 

Anyone who’s purchased ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula should throw it away immediately or return it to the store where it was purchased, state health officials said in a news release Friday. 

At least 23 infants in 13 states have been sickened with infant botulism traced to ByHeart formula since August. There have been no deaths attributed to the outbreak, and none of the cases were in Louisiana. 
ByHeart Inc. started a recall of its powdered formula earlier this week. Two couples whose babies have developed the infection have also filed lawsuits against ByHeart in Arizona and Kentucky, according to the Associated Press. 
Louisiana officials advise families who have purchased ByHeart to take a photo or write down the product’s lot number, found on the bottom of the can, before disposing of it. Containers and surfaces the formula might have touched should also be washed with hot soapy water, they said. 

Babies who have injuested the bacteria might not get sick for days or weeks. They should be monitored for 30 days after their last exposure to the formula for signs of illness. There is no testing that can be done to see if a baby has ingested the bacteria unless symptoms surface. 
Signs of infant botulism include constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control, difficulty swallowing, decreased facial expression, a weak or altered cry and muscle weakness. Babies who develop these behaviors should be seen by a medical professional immediately, according to the state health department. 

The Louisiana health department is working with retail businesses and others to ensure ByHeart formula is taken off shelves in stores. ByHeart only makes up 1% of the baby formula market nationwide, so federal officials do not expect its recall to trigger a larger shortage of infant formula.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/infant-formula6-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A political fight among Republicans in Ravalli County that resulted in the ousting of Freedom Caucus allies from local leadership posts earlier this year may serve as a warning to the Montana Republican Party.
In March 2025, Ravalli County District Court Judge Jennifer Lint found the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee had disenfranchised voters and infringed on their constitutional rights by failing to hold an election of officers.
In the complaint, Stevensville Republican Tony Hudson alleged the local party chairman, influenced by hardline members of the GOP, was failing to hold a central committee election contrary to state law, and was illegally holding onto power.
Defendant Ron Stoltz, then chairman of the Ravalli County central committee, argued state GOP bylaws, amended in June 2024, precluded a local election until after Dec. 1, 2026, and he said he had held off at the direction of the state GOP.
But the judge said that stance ran contrary to state law.
Without a local election, precinct captains elected in June 2024 wouldn’t have the chance to run for leadership or select officers or delegates to the state convention, and the judge ordered Stoltz to hold one.
The results ushered in new leadership on the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee, and some Republicans say the case helped end a caustic period within the local GOP, one pushed by  power-hungry members of the Freedom Caucus.
But shrapnel from the case could still hit the Montana Republican Party.
Hudson, who filed the lawsuit, and his lawyer, Joan Mell, said the case could open the door to legal action that challenges election outcomes from the June 2025 state GOP convention — an organization that itself trumpets concerns about election integrity.
The case also raises questions about how the Montana GOP will move forward.
In a July email and memo obtained by the Daily Montanan, Montana GOP Chairman Art Wittich told central committees to hold off on local conventions and officer elections until December 2026, as the state GOP advised the Ravalli County chairman prior to the lawsuit.
Through a spokesperson, Wittich declined an interview for this story.
Hudson, though, said the state GOP has misled “good Republicans,” it has let bullies from the Freedom Caucus run roughshod over the organization, and it needs a similar restoration of order for which he fought in Ravalli County.
“We need to follow the law in the Republican Party,” Hudson said. “If we are going to be the party of law and order, then we must.”
 Takeover, fighting in Ravalli County Republican Central Committee

The Covid-19 pandemic ratcheted up anti-government sentiment among some members of the hard right in the Bitterroot Valley, deepening political divisions and opening the door to new leadership on the central committee.
Terry Nelson, selected this year to replace a resigning state legislator, had served as chairperson of the central committee for more than a decade.
In 2023, state Sen. Theresa Manzella, a Hamilton Republican and flashy hardliner, successfully nominated Stoltz as chairperson of the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee.
The 2023 central committee election put control of the executive board in the hands of the more extreme members of the Republican Party.
Hudson, on the Stevensville Public Schools board, said under the influence of Manzella and other activist hardliners, local GOP leadership ostracized Republicans who didn’t fall in line.
Manzella declined an interview and did not answer written questions in time for this story. 










We need to follow the law in the Republican Party. If we are going to be the party of law and order, then we must.


– Tony Hudson


At central committee meetings, Hudson said Stoltz would cut off public comment if he didn’t agree with the speaker.
“It was their beliefs 100% or nothing,” Hudson said. “There was no dialogue. There was no communication.”
Patty Franklin, current vice chairperson of the central committee, said local GOP leaders took actions that were out of step with party tradition, such as spending money on primary races.
But Franklin said when members who weren’t in lockstep with leadership tried to raise a collective voice and reason with elected officers, they were met with animosity.
“This group was very hostile,” Franklin said.
 Hudson mobilizes new members, ‘Dirty Thirty’ accusation flies

Hudson decided he had seen enough of the central committee leadership and its influencers.
In 2024, within two weeks of the deadline for Ravalli County Republicans to sign up to run for precinct captain, Hudson said he recruited 30 or so fellow Republicans for the positions.

“I just made up my mind I was going to do it,” Hudson said.
In 2018, Hudson’s son Wyatt died at the age of 19 in a car accident, and Hudson decided he could “crawl into the bottle,” or he could honor his son and family and improve the world. He’s also a rancher with a bias for action.
“​​As ranchers say, ‘We’ve been doing so much with so little for so long, we can do anything with nothing at all,’” Hudson said.
Hudson turned the names of GOP recruits into the county clerk five minutes before 5 p.m. on filing day, he said, and he turned to face the wrath of the central committee.
“These people went apoplectic,” Hudson said.
The Ravalli County Republican Central Committee took out a full page advertisement in the Bitterroot Star calling the new recruits “The Dirty Thirty.”
The letter, addressed “Dear neighbor,” said historically, the seats are difficult to fill, and “there are virtually never multiple candidates interested in the job.”
It accused Hudson’s recruits of using “dirty tricks” to try to “retake” the committee.
Most won at the ballot box anyway.
Typically, the central committee holds elections among precinct captains to select leadership positions, as state law and its bylaws require, but Stoltz, the chairman, never called for one.
“There was never a formal conversation about elections, but the implication always was, ‘We’re not going to have elections because the state party had decided to not have elections until basically the fall of 2026,’” Hudson said.
 Hudson takes Stoltz, central committee to court

In February 2025, Hudson took the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee and Stoltz to court, and he asked the judge to grant a type of relief legally defined as “an extraordinary remedy.”
He asked the court for a writ of mandate, an order that forces a public official to take action the person has a legal obligation to take, in this case, to hold the local election.
As he saw it, if the state GOP could amend its bylaws to preclude elections for a couple of years, he wasn’t sure what would stop it from doing so for longer.
In the complaint, Hudson alleged Stoltz had no authority to continue serving as chairman past April 1, 2025, but intended to control the local central committee “without election to office in 2025 through 2027.”
He alleged members of the Freedom Caucus intended to control the Republican platform and had taken control of many local committees, but its members knew local committees still weren’t “stacked in their favor.”
And he said Freedom Caucus members sought to extend their power anyway.
At the 2024 state convention, as outlined in court documents, GOP delegates amended party bylaws to say local elections should take place between Dec. 1 of each even-numbered year and March 31 of each odd-numbered year — starting on Dec. 1, 2026.
State convention delegates Paul Fielder, a Thompson Falls legislator, and Brad Tschida, former legislator from Missoula and former Public Service Commission director, drove the changes, according to the complaint. 
Stoltz did not respond to an email requesting comment, but according to the district court order, he argued the amendments meant no central committee election could be held until Dec. 1, 2026, and none could be held “until the State Chair authorizes” it.
The judge disagreed.
Until Dec. 1, 2026, the judge said the current rules for local elections remained in place, as did state statute, and she ordered Stoltz to hold one by April 1, 2025.
 Activists out, ‘old guard’ returns

To his credit, Stoltz complied with the district court order and called for the local election, said Matt Roth, current chairman of the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee.
He and others said Stoltz never showed up for it, nor did his allies.

In holding off on the local election, Roth said Stoltz was only following the directive of the state GOP, but the results contravened the rights of the people.
“It’s fundamentally against the law, fundamentally against the Constitution of the United States, and fundamentally against our republic,” Roth said.
He said he had hoped the new board would be mixed and include GOP members from across the political spectrum, but the Freedom Caucus activists did not show up.
Franklin, vice chairwoman, said in one way, the extremists sidelined themselves. She said she talked to eight people at a recent dinner who used to support Manzella and will no longer do so.
“They got too noisy and too obnoxious, and people stopped taking them as seriously as they used to,” Franklin said.
Roth said he took the helm of the local central committee reluctantly. He said he’s aligned with much of the Freedom Caucus ideology, but not with its means.
“My hope and prayer is that all conservatives in the valley come back to the table and have a good heartfelt discussion of how we move forward in 2026,” Roth said.
How the state GOP moves ahead is another matter.
 Order appealed, found moot

The case went to the Montana Supreme Court, and last month, the justices issued an order finding the matter was moot; the original controversy over the election in Ravalli County had ended.
It said Stoltz had not demonstrated the disputed part of the state Republican Party bylaws — “subject to amendment or clarification by the Party” — were likely to be applied in the same manner again.
“(Stoltz’s) suggestion that the other central committees might so apply the bylaws is speculative,” the order said.
The state Supreme Court also said the statute the district court relied on remained in place.
“The county central committee shall meet prior to the state convention of its political party and organize by electing a presiding officer and one or more vice presiding officers,” says the state statute.
In Ravalli County, the central committee bylaws require the local convention take place between Feb. 1 and April 1 of odd-numbered years, the order said.
Lawyer Abby Moscatel represented Stoltz in the appeal, and when reached by phone about Hudson vs. Stoltz, Moscatel stated she had no comment and hung up.
The Montana Republican Party did not answer questions about the guidance it gave to central committees, but a July 14 email and memo from Wittich told central committees that Montana GOP bylaws “trump county bylaws.”
In the email, Wittich said any county bylaws that conflict should be amended to be in compliance with state GOP bylaws.
“Please be advised that no county conventions will be called until December 1, 2026,” the email said.
The attached memo, also dated July 14 and marked “draft,” said GOP rules had been subject to “conflicting interpretations” and central committees may be “confused.” It did not reference the district court order or appeal.
Wittich did not answer questions for this story, including about any subsequent guidance the state GOP has given central committees.
“MT GOP wasn’t a party to the case and didn’t appear in the case, so we don’t have comment to provide,” Wittich said through a spokesperson.
 Moving forward

Some Ravalli County Republicans believe the results of the state GOP convention in June could be called into question if other counties also should have held local elections and had the chance to select state delegates.
In other words, if county central committees sent illegitimate delegates to the state convention, what does that mean for the results of elections at the state GOP?
“That’s a serious issue within the GOP that needs to be looked at,” Franklin said.
Mell said in the lawsuit, the party was trying to override statute and take the will of the people away. 
She said not every county has “a Tony,” but Republicans shouldn’t sit on their rights and assume those in control of the state party are controlling precincts as well.
A breadth of voices is needed to fairly represent the party, but people need to work for it, Mell said. 
“Complacency is death,” Mell said. “People need to know their rights and get involved and question — and not be afraid to question — the leadership of the GOP.
“It’s not a foregone conclusion. The local voices matter. And participation really matters.”
Hudson believes that without some change at the state GOP, a powerful minority will retain dominance at the expense of a party that once boasted about a big tent.
“(But) this is not their private club,” Hudson said.
Freedom Caucus Chairman Jerry Schillinger, a Republican legislator from Circle, said every party and group has different factions, and he isn’t concerned some members of his group may have besmirched its cause.
He said to be a member of any group is to accept the bumps and bruises it brings along the way and to be willing to have the backs of others despite their imperfections.
“If it ever came to an issue, whether it’s a Freedom Caucus or any other group, that some member is totally out of step with the goals and the ideals of that group, then likely that person will find themselves sitting on the outside,” Schillinger said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6127-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

The plaintiffs — Nicole White, Brent Smeins, Miria Schuster, Dave Wedeking, Devontez Roberts, Jeff Mason, Kimberly Browning, Anthony Haubrich, Gayle Robinson, Leland Williams and Kerigan Kammeyer — are each current or former emergency medical technicians or paramedics employed by the ambulance department of the Waverly Health Center.
WHC operates an array of medical clinics located in Waverly, Janesville, Nashua and Shell Rock.
The plaintiffs allege that while employed by WHC, they had a regular rotating schedule in which they worked a 24-hour shift and then received 48 hours off, while occasionally working additional hours beyond their regular shift.
In May 2022 and again in April 2023, WHC allegedly announced a policy to begin paying hourly employees who worked nights and weekends a “shift differential” in addition to their regular rate of pay. In August 2024, the policy was allegedly revised to state that hourly employees who worked nights and weekends would receive a shift differential of $2 to $15 per hour depending on when the hours were worked.
The lawsuit claims the 2022, 2023 and 2024 shift differential policies were communicated to the paramedics and EMTs by email, with each recipient required to review and acknowledge the policies electronically.
Despite this, the lawsuit claims, the EMTs and paramedics never were paid the applicable shift differentials.
The lawsuit, filed in state court before being transferred this week to federal court, seeks unspecified damages for alleged violations of Iowa’s wage laws and the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.

(Screen capture by Kansas Reflector from MPSC meeting)Missouri utility regulators on Thursday approved electric rates to ensure large power users on its system are responsible for paying their fair share of the effect their usage has on the power grid and other customers.
The Missouri Public Service Commission approved a large-load rate submitted by Evergy, which operates in Kansas and Missouri, and that was supported by most parties in the case.
Unlike in Kansas, where a large-user rate was unanimously agreed to by all intervenors, including business, environmental groups and a data service coalition, two groups did not support the Missouri order.
Missouri Public Service Commission staff and the Missouri Office of Public Counsel, an organization that advocates for small business and residential customers, did not support the order.
In fact, the staff and OPC submitted a separate proposal that commission chairwoman Kayla Hahn said was too confusing and could cause large users to avoid locating in Missouri.
“Staff’s proposal requires upwards of 25 different charges that a large user could be subject to paying,” she said. “The evidence showed us the vast amount of charges and uncertainty make it unclear if a large user would be paying too much, too little or more likely if a large user would forgo locating in Missouri altogether as even a sophisticated user would be unable to predict what its ultimate bill responsibility would be.”
The tariff reflects broad stakeholder consensus and “contains strong safeguards to ensure that large new loads pay their fair share while enabling growth that benefits Missouri,” the commissioners said in the order.
Large-load users were defined in the order as those requiring 75 megawatts per month at peak times, a parallel to the Kansas order approved Nov. 6 by the Kansas Corporation Commission.
“I’m satisfied that this will result in the large-load customers bearing the financial responsibility for the costs that are incurred for infrastructure improvement, be they transmission or generation,” said commissioner John Mitchell. “I’m also satisfied that the agreement does establish reasonable protections both for the existing customers and for the large-load customers, and ensure that the large-load customers will pay their fair share.”
Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said Missouri rates include similar protections to those put in place in Kansas for existing customers by ensuring that companies pay their fair share for access to the grid. The rate for these new large customers is higher than that paid by existing commercial and industrial customers.
“This premium rate helps pay for modernization and maintenance of the power grid that is shared by all our customers,” she said. “In both Kansas and Missouri the commissions have recognized the value of attracting large energy users and the importance of making sure existing customers don’t foot the bill.”

It’s impossible to fully grasp food insecurity in Vermont without showing up and talking to people in pantries, churches and community centers across the state. During the government shutdown, when thousands of Vermonters faced a painful gap in benefits, the issue gained new urgency.
What I witnessed in recent weeks reminded me why this work matters, and why we depend on readers like you. Your support today powers fact-based local reporting and, through our partnership with the Vermont Foodbank, sends three meals to a neighbor.

Donate and send 3 meals

In the Statehouse, I watched officials debate and approve a $6 million plan to help combat hunger. In the days that followed, I met Vermonters who still had to wait a week for that relief, and heard reports of people watering down meals or skipping them altogether to make food last. Often, people were willing to share their stories, generously offering a window into their hardships.
With federal food benefits to resume, but many challenges still ahead, I will continue to follow the impacts of state programs and federal changes to food assistance. I will keep showing up and listening, not just to lawmakers and judges, but also to those their decisions impact most.
This Thanksgiving, your donation powers this kind of reporting. Reporting grounded in facts, informed by real experiences, and freely available to everyone. And through VTDigger’s partnership with the Vermont Foodbank, your gift also sends three meals to a neighbor in need.

Noel Frame, D-Seattle, makes remarks during a Washington State Budget and Policy Center panel discussion on Nov. 12, 2025. (Photo courtesy of Washington State Budget and Policy Center)SEATTLE — Democratic state Sen. Noel Frame traces her interest in tax policy to her time as a teenager in the 1990s, concerned about scarce funding for her school district in Battle Ground, Washington.
“There was something there about taxes that I needed to figure out,” she recalled to a room packed with progressives here this week. “Here I am, I’m 45, and I’m fighting the same exact fight that I was fighting when I was 16.”
The upcoming bouts will be high-stakes, with lawmakers vexed by a budget shortfall that billions of dollars of tax increases, coupled with spending cuts, failed to resolve this year.
In the state Senate, Frame, who is from Seattle, is running point for Democrats on tax policy.
“The Revenue Queen.” That’s how Eli Taylor Goss, who leads the Washington State Budget and Policy Center, described her at the group’s Budget Matters Policy Summit, held this week at the Northwest African American Museum.
It was a crowd brimming with the belief that the state’s corporate titans and tech executives are not paying their fair share, and must shoulder more of the financial burden for publicly funded education and human services.
Pressure is building for Democrats to take a big swing on taxes, beyond this year’s hikes. How far Frame and her allies can deliver on that goal in 2026 is an open question. Next year’s legislative session, which begins in January, is just 60 days and happening ahead of an election.
“I want to have a future for Washington state where it’s not just a rich person’s playground,” Frame said. “I don’t want to be called the Cayman Islands of the United States.” (The Cayman Islands are considered a tax haven.)
One of the hotter ideas percolating is a possible income tax on wealthier individual earners. Early descriptions suggest a 9.9% tax on adjusted gross income above $1 million.
Senate Democrats have discussed the concept, and it’s circulating among insiders. There’s no draft bill or firm plan on paper yet, Frame told the Standard.
Two other significant — and controversial —  revenue bills are already on the table. One, the so-called wealth tax, sponsored by Frame, would tax certain assets, like stocks and bonds, over $50 million. Another would apply a payroll tax to large companies with higher earners.
‘Be prepared to win three times over’
Washington is one of nine states nationwide that do not tax individual wage and salary income.
For progressives, changing that is a holy grail in their quest to rebalance the state’s tax code so it falls less heavily on low-income households. It’s also a third rail. A concept Washington voters have repeatedly rejected and that the state Supreme Court has blocked.
Frame said during a panel discussion Wednesday that she’s “heard more chatter about the income tax in the last six months than I’ve heard in the last 15 years.” 
Cynics question if this surging interest has to do with businesses looking to prevent their taxes from climbing further by generating state revenue elsewhere.
That aside, Frame had a cautionary message for the audience — many of whom would be counted on to help enact such a tax.
“Passing that bill in the Legislature is the first step, not the last. We will need to fight and defend this in court. We will have to defend this at the ballot,” she said. “If we do it, we’d better be prepared to win three times over.”
“If we are going to do this, we need to do it right,” the senator added. “And all of you in this room know what that means, what it looks like, and we are going to be the ones that do the work.”
Wealth tax still in play
Frame’s still bullish on the wealth tax.
Her bill cleared the Senate on a 26-21 vote on the final day of this year’s session. The House didn’t debate it, and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson objected to relying on the tax to balance the budget, citing the likelihood it would get tied up in court.
Frame points to its strong public support and years of refining the legislation since it was first introduced in 2021.
“We have done everything to this bill that we could possibly do, and there is only one argument left,” she said. It’s that rich people will leave the state if the tax is imposed, she explained, adding that research indicates that’s not likely to happen.
Frame doesn’t shy away from her role as a tax champion, even though it puts her at the center of some of the toughest debates in Olympia. “Somebody’s got to do it,” she said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/noel-frame-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

Rick Hoheisel, a Republican from Wichita and chair of a House-Senate oversight committee, says indictment of the former CEO of Texas-based Beneficient is sufficient cause to evaluate the state's issuance of a bank charter to Beneficient in 2021. The idea of an inquiry has bipartisan support. (Photo by Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Bipartisan support exists in the Kansas Legislature to scrutinize a state bank charter issued to a company whose founder has been indicted and accused of syphoning millions of dollars from a now-bankrupt business to finance his opulent lifestyle.
Rep. Nick Hoheisel, a Republican from Wichita, said the Legislature should examine results of state law that guaranteed a charter in 2021 for Texas-based Beneficient, an alternative investment company relying on the banking credential to attract wealthy clients to its business of exchanging cash or stock for illiquid assets.
“Frankly, my committee will be looking at the TEFFI Act as we get into session,” Hoheisel said. “We will be taking a look at this whole thing.”
Hoheisel serves as chair of the House Financial Institutions and Pensions Committee, as well as the joint House and Senate oversight committee responsible for supervision of the TEFFI Act, which opened the door to Beneficent’s bank charter.
He said he wasn’t eager to pull the plug on Beneficient, because he wanted to offer the company’s executives “an opportunity to get this right.” The 2026 Legislature convenes in January.
Official exploration of Beneficient didn’t gain bipartisan traction until a federal indictment against Beneficient founder Brad Heppner for alleged securities and wire fraud. He was arrested in early November after a grand jury approved a five-count indictment alleging approximately $300 million had been transferred from GWG Holdings to Beneficient and that Heppner subsequently funneled more than $150 million of that total to a shell company he secretly controlled. Heppner was chairman of Beneficient and GWG Holdings from 2019 to 2021.
The FBI said Heppner “allegedly falsified documents, made misleading statements to investors and auditors, and obstructed an investigation by regulatory authorities.” He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
The indictment says Heppner purportedly spent $40 million on his Dallas home, $10 million for upkeep at the mansion and an East Texas ranch, $20 million to pay tax liabilities, $10 million for personal credit card debt and private air travel expenses, and $500,000 on jewelry.
In wake of the indictment, Democratic Rep. Rui Xu of Mission Hills said it was time the Legislature considered ending the state’s alliance with Beneficient by revoking the state bank charter.
The charter was authorized in April 2021 as a pilot project. The Legislature adopted a bill in 2022 requiring the charter be made permanent retroactive to December 2021. That bill was championed by Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Wichita, and signed into law by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.
“All this stemmed from a poison seed, if you will. We just kept trying to water and water it,” Xu said. “Just from its inception this has smelled a little funny and continues to smell a little funny. This is not a thing, I think, Kansans want the state to be involved with.”
Sen. Brenda Dietrich, R-Topeka, said legislation ought to be introduced in the House and Senate to forbid state agencies from accepting receivership of any portion of Beneficient if the company filed for bankruptcy or was declared insolvent.
“I think we need to protect our state, protect our constituents,” Deitrich said. “That just makes sense.”
The TEFFI law was controversial because Kansas Bank Commissioner David Herndon opposed the unique arrangement with Beneficient, complained the Legislature placed unreasonable limits on state regulation of Beneficient and its subsidiaries. He also expressed frustration the Legislature wouldn’t consider revocation of Beneficient’s charter. Herndon’s pleas generally fell on deaf ears at the Statehouse.
To gain traction for legislation tied to Beneficient’s bank charter, the company’s allies donated thousands of dollars to Republican and Democratic politicians and directed cash to partisan political action committees in Kansas. The original bank charter bill unanimously passed by the Senate and was endorsed 103-20 in the House.
Lobbying led by Herndon, until he resigned from Beneficient in summer of 2025, included promises the partnership between the state and Beneficient would create an economic windfall for Kansas and trigger a surge in business development in rural Kansas.
In the past several years, questions were raised about Heppner, or others associated with Beneficient, possibly engaging in financial misconduct. Trustees working on behalf of investors in GWG Holdings, which filed for bankruptcy in 2022, pursued lawsuits to claw back millions of dollars drained from GWG Holdings. In March, Beneficient’s executives and officers settled claims with GWG Holdings for $50.5 million. In addition, GWG Holdings’ litigation led to settlements of $30 million with a law firm and $8.5 million with an accounting firm.
Sen. Stephen Owens, a Hesston Republican who relentlessly championed the public-private partnership with Beneficient, said at one point the state’s association with Beneficient would enable $1 billion in global investment to flow through Kansas within a decade.
Owens said it would be folly to withdraw Beneficient’s bank charter by repealing the TEFFI Act, which stands for Technology-Enabled Fiduciary Financial Institutions Act.
“I absolutely reject this notion,” he said. “I reject the idea that right now is the time to repeal the TEFFI Act.”
He said legislation giving the bank commissioner the power to revoke Beneficient’s charter should include an appeal process to the Legislature.
Owens said he was frustrated the Kansas bank commissioner hadn’t been more supportive of the Beneficient venture. He complained the commissioner declined to develop regulations that might have encouraged other financial companies to locate in Kansas.
“It is my opinion that the office of state bank commissioner is hostile towards this act as a whole,” Owens said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/4F5A0379jpg.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

The Republican governor, speaking to reporters, chastised the task force on Thursday for failing to put forward a map of new school districts, adding uncertainty to the upcoming legislative session.

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott had some strong words for the school redistricting task force after the group endorsed a proposal on Monday to incentivize voluntary mergers of the state’s 119 school districts. The task force members, he told reporters, “didn’t fulfill their obligation.”
“They didn’t redraw the lines, and they were supposed to put forward three maps for consideration, and they failed,” Scott said.
Asked by a reporter where that leaves the state, Scott said that “it would appear that those who didn’t fulfill their obligation are OK with the ever-increasing property taxes, cost of education, and they don’t want to see change, or at least not immediately.”

“So, I think it puts us in a tough position, but I think the majority of people — I’ll include the speaker and the pro tem — understand we need change,” he said. “We need to do something. So, they’re going to have to act as soon as they get back in.”
Scott’s comments Monday underscore a growing sense of uncertainty around efforts to reform Vermont’s public education system.
Debate around public education reform will feature prominently in the next legislative session, set to begin in January. And while Act 73, the state’s sweeping education reform law, was signed in July, launching that reform will depend on the Legislature agreeing to a new district map.
But on Monday, the 11-member task force voted 8-3 to endorse a proposal that defied a core directive of Act 73: that the group put forward at least one and no more than three new maps by Dec. 1 for the Vermont Legislature to consider in the upcoming session.
Task force members Rep. Beth Quimby, R-Lyndon; Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia; and Dave Wolk, who is Scott’s appointee, voted no on the proposal.
The nearly 170-page proposal the group endorsed lays out a 10-year plan. Districts would be incentivized to merge to access state construction aid and to coordinate on developing regional high schools, while utilizing regional boards of cooperative educational services, or BOCES, to share the cost of services.
The only map contained within the proposal shows how the five regional cooperative service agencies proposed in the plan would layer over the state’s existing 119 school districts and 52 supervisory districts and supervisory unions.
Vermont Education Secretary Zoie Saunders said during the meeting Monday the proposal did not adhere to the intent of the law.
Sen. Martine Gulick, D-Chittenden Central, the co-chair of the task force, said in an interview that task force members did not “see evidence that there is cost savings and improvements to quality in merging districts.”
“As we peeled back the layers, as we dug deeper into the complexity of education in Vermont and the complexity of lowering costs and improving quality, we decided it would be irresponsible just to draw lines on a map,” Gulick said.
She continued that their proposal “could save money immediately” by allowing the state’s 119 school districts to share resources and create economies of scale through shared contracting.
“In three months to dig into this level of specificity, we did a great job given those parameters, and I’m really proud of the work that we did,” she said.
Senate Pro Tem Phil Baruth said in a text message that he was waiting for the task force to issue its final report before commenting.
Speaker of the House Jill Krowinski in an email said she was “focused on ensuring our kids have the best educational opportunities at a price Vermonters can afford.”
“That is my focus for the upcoming session, and it is the mission we have had since the beginning of our education transformation work,” she said. “We’ll continue to work with the education community, the Scott administration, and all Vermonters to consider the options before us and next steps to meet our education transformation goals.”
Another proposal considered by the task force, developed by Beck and Wolk, more closely adhered to those guidelines, and had Saunders’ apparent stamp of approval.
That proposal — now discontinued, at least as far as the task force is concerned — used career and technical education regions as an organizing principle to draw lines for 13 new school districts.
But the majority of task force members declined to support that proposal and raised concerns about the size of the map’s proposed district in Chittenden County. Nearly 22,000 students would be consolidated into a single district there under the plan.
Gulick in an interview said that map did not adhere to Act 73’s parameters that new districts have anywhere from 4,000 to 8,000 students.
“It’s supposed to be logistically feasible and create the least amount of disruption,” she said. “I just don’t think that that map did those things.”
The task force will meet for the last time on Nov. 20, where it will refine and finalize its final report due to the Legislature in December.
“I do hope the Legislature looks at what we’ve done. I hope they take our recommendations to heart,” Gulick said. “But there’s no guarantee that that will happen.”

Officials with the State Court Administrative Office and the legislatively-created Trial Court Funding Commission issued implementation recommendations last week to outline how the new model could work for the state, and the benefits of a new funding model both for the judiciary itself and the courts’ largest stakeholders – the people of Michigan.
The funding issues facing the trial courts now stem from the Michigan Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in People v. Cunningham, which found it was unconstitutional to assess defendants additional fees solely to fund court operations. The commission was formed as a way to find solutions to that problem.
The new model proposed by the commission would ask the Legislature to appropriate a larger share of state funding to the trial courts in order to equalize the amount and take pressure off local units of government to sustain trial court funding. Officials with the state court office and the commission call it a “maintenance of effort” requirement, which would ensure that local units of government contribute no more than that their historic average level of funding, with the state stepping in to appropriate additional funding as needed.

final-trial-court-funding-concept-paper-for-publication 
That would create a cost-sharing model between the state Legislature and the judiciary, especially when it concerns the cost of building new court facilities or making major renovations. The commission and the state court office are also proposing a court facility grant program to support that effort.
“For too long, local governments have borne the burden of funding Michigan’s trial courts, with the state contributing less than 15%,” Michael Bosanac, administrator and chief financial officer of Monroe County. “Having the state as a more balanced funding partner will reduce pressure on local governments as the primary funding source for trial courts.”
Bosanac said the model would provide local governments with financial predictability and reduce the need for local courts to assess excessive costs on court users to generate revenue.
“The plan strives to create better outcomes for all stakeholders – especially citizens of this state,” he added.
Additionally, the recommendations call for all court-generated revenue to be moved to a new fund managed not by the courts themselves but by the state’s Department of Treasury. The plan, if given the green light by the Legislature, would give the Treasury the duty to distribute court revenues to local governments solely for judiciary functions based on costs to run the courts. The local units of government, their courts and the state court office would develop and approve court budgets moving forward if the plan is enacted.
Although funding and sustainability are among some of the top reasons for the recommendations, a big piece of the change would alleviate the conflict of interest that exists between judges administering justice and the need to impose and collect court fees and fines as a way to generate revenue for the courts they serve.
In an interview with Michigan Advance, State Court Administrator Tom Boyd said stakeholder trust, and equal access to justice without the influence of revenue collection on a judge’s sentencing decisions, were top of mind for those devising the recommendations.
“Right now, we have profit motivated policing and profit motivated court systems,” he said. “Why do we need that tension between us and the community? The idea here is that the assessment of the court costs, we can figure out, not only the cost of the plaintiff and a speeding ticket, but the cost of the court in a criminal case, we can create formulas or have flat fees so that, again, there’s no incentive for the judge to inflate those numbers.”
Boyd and Bosanac presented the recommendations on Thursday to a joint session of the House Judiciary Committee and the Senate Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety Committee.

State Sen. Ruth Johnson (R-Groveland Township) asked if the plan would address situations where there were too many staff in a given court system, particularly concerning quasi-judicial staffers.
Boyd said there wasn’t a set of recommendations for individual counties yet, but local control would still run the court.
“We’re just going to tell you how many people you need,” Boyd said. “So there is a possibility that a court or two has more people than they need.”
Johnson noted that although the state court office and the commission had support from some stakeholders, the Michigan Association of Counties voiced concerns. She wondered if the judiciary was ready to move forward with the plan given that there were some who were wary of the changes.
Boyd said the consternation centered around the shifting away from guaranteed court revenue to a possible reliance on legislative appropriations.
“Is there the level of comfort with the annual appropriations process that they have with just waiting for the people in black robes to bring the cash in? There isn’t that level of comfort. We all live in this environment. We all watch the annual appropriations process,” Boyd said. “Many of us are involved in it. We trust that process. The question becomes, is it comfortable? No, as Mike [Bosanac] said, there’s going to be concern, because we’re moving from a steady stream of revenue coming from the judicial branch to back to the legislative branch, to say it’s your responsibility and your authority that’s being exercised on an annual basis. There will be concern about that.”
State Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport), chair of the House committee, said she had concerns about some of the recommendations, but saw this plan as a good first step. She wondered about the phase in period of the new fund and other aspects. If the part of the plan aimed to avoid another round of kicking the sunset date down the line, Lightner said the heavy lift of the request would require another legislative vote to extend the sunset.
“There’s going to be more robust conversation on the function of some of these because … assessments and stuff like that don’t even fall under the judiciary budget. It’s under the Department of Corrections or general government, or whatever it may be,” Lightner said. “And I’m just curious what the plan is to kind of back fill some of the assessments, because it does end up being a lot of money, especially when you talk about in the trial court fund that no monies will ever lapse.”
Lightner added that she did have a desire to make the plan work.
On Friday, state Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township), a member of the House committee, questioned the commission’s assessment that inadequate funding resulted in abuses of broad sentencing discretion and the imposition of fees to make up budget deficits.
DeBoyer said the proposed changes refuse to delve into root causes of poorly run county court systems and that well-run courts shouldn’t see their funding impacted.
“This would require good actors who do not run a budget deficit to continually subsidize irresponsible actors. There are a handful of counties in our state that struggle with their court operations costs due to a variety of factors, including rampant mismanagement, ineffective collection methods, and other things,” DeBoyer said in a statement. “Counties like ones I represent should not be forced to pay for other counties who do not have their acts together and aren’t operating effectively. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is not a plan, and it is a gateway to use this same approach with other funding shortfalls.”

(Photo: Greg Childress/NC Newsline)Siembra NC, a North Carolina immigrant rights group, has launched a digital map showing where federal immigration officials have been sighted across the state.The goal is to help immigrants make informed decisions about their routes to school and work.
The website, called Ojo Obrero (“Look out, workers”), compiles sightings of immigration enforcement activity into a single, statewide map. Organizers say the tool is meant to counter misinformation and give communities a better sense of where enforcement activity has taken place as federal operations continue to disrupt daily life.
“We want this to be a resource for people to get a clear picture and make decisions accordingly,” Emanuel Gomez Gonzalez, Siembra NC communications strategist, told reporters during a virtual press conference. 
The map includes only verified sightings of federal immigration operations. Each report must be backed by video or testimonial evidence reviewed by attorneys and volunteer networks. Organizers said most initial reports don’t meet that standard and are left out. 
The information is not updated in real time. It can take several days to verify whether an incident involved federal agents or whether it was just local law enforcement activity.
“This is a tool designed to provide a point of reference for how those patterns are actually taking place in our state,” Gonzalez said, “to allow people to continue to go about their day to day lives, even as we anticipate rumors and sightings of federal immigration agents to increase.”
The platform allows users to filter incidents by type, such as traffic stops, and by time of day, helping parents and workers plan travel routes, especially during early-morning hours when enforcement actions are more common.
The website offers several tools beyond the map, including a digital “red card” with know-your-rights guidance, a chatbot trained on ACLU materials, and translation features for interacting with law enforcement.
It also provides county-level data on traffic-related arrests that have led to ICE detention. Siembra NC said risks are higher in Gaston, Union, and Montgomery counties, as well as in counties that recently signed 287(g) agreements, which allow local law enforcement to work more closely with immigration authorities.
The group cautioned that the map is not comprehensive and often shows only where federal agents were present, not whether arrests occurred.
Recent incidents cited by the organization include traffic stops in Sampson County, where Newton Grove police pulled over at least eight workers last week, and an October arrest in the Catawba County town of Brookford, where a man stopped for driving without a license was later handed over to ICE under a new local-federal agreement.
“Everyone deserves to get to work, school and back home safely,” Siembra NC co-director Nikki Marín Baena said in the release. She added that many immigrant workers are legally barred from obtaining driver’s licenses, calling arrests that lead to ICE detention “cruelty” that harms the state’s economy.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image-1-1024x863.jpeg,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture).The Missouri Department of Social Services announced Thursday that it will continue to issue partial payments of federal food benefits for November, while updating its systems to resume paying full amounts.
The announcement comes after President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed legislation funding the federal government through the end of January and ending the shutdown he cited as the cause of delayed payments from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“With federal funding back in place, our team is moving swiftly to issue full November benefits,” said Jess Bax, director of the department, in a press release.
Baylee Watts, the department’s media director, said in an email that the department is working with its electronic benefits vendor to distribute full November benefits.
“As soon as we have confirmed the timing and what that will look like for different participants, we’ll be able to share more,” Watts said.
States across the country scrambled to comply with rapid-fire changes to federal guidance on whether and how to issue SNAP payments while Congress remained gridlocked on expiring healthcare tax credits.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture threatened on Saturday to impose financial penalties on states that had paid out full monthly benefits in keeping with a judge’s order on Nov. 6 that USDA fund the program. USDA had already changed its instructions on the amount of benefits states could include in partial payments.
Missouri began distributing partial benefits on Tuesday, with enrollees in the program receiving up to 65% of their normal monthly funds.
The intricacies of USDA directives on partial payments forced state agencies to make complex calculations under pressure, said Christine Woody, food security policy coordinator at Empower Missouri, a nonprofit that advocates for low-income residents.
“The (state) department did not cause this,” Woody said, “and they were working with what they had.”
Recipients qualifying for the maximum allowed for their household, according to USDA instructions, received 65% of their regular benefits. Households eligible for less than the maximum saw their payments reduced by a further 30% of their income. Initial guidance told states to reduce maximum allotments by 50%.
USDA “strongly encouraged” states in a policy memo Thursday to “begin the process of upgrading systems and updating state procedures” to make partial payments more quickly in the future. The memo noted that, even after Wednesday’s appropriations bill, there aren’t enough contingency funds to make full SNAP payments in November 2026 “in the event of a lapse of appropriations next year.”
Woody said Empower Missouri will advocate for more federal support in case SNAP runs out of funding in a future shutdown.
“I believe that there are things that the federal government could do,” Woody said, “to ensure that there’s more money in those contingency funds.”

Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — A Sumter County man who killed three during a crime spree 21 years ago is set to die by firing squad at 6 p.m. Friday.
Barring a final, unlikely intervention, 44-year-old Stephen Bryant will become the fifth person executed in South Carolina this year and the seventh since the process resumed in September 2024. Bryant pleaded guilty in 2008 to fatally shooting three people during a string of burglaries.
Nationwide, 42 people have been executed this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

Bryant’s attorneys made a single final appeal to attempt to halt his execution, arguing lower courts never heard evidence that he suffered from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. The state Supreme Court rejected that argument, allowing his execution to go ahead.
As of Friday afternoon, Bryant’s attorneys had not appealed that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Gov. Henry McMaster could choose to commute Bryant’s sentence to life in prison, though the former prosecutor has not done so for any of the other six inmates put to death during his time in office.
Bryant opted to die by firing squad instead of lethal injection or electrocution, the other two methods allowed in state law. He will become the third person in the state to die using that method, putting South Carolina on par for the highest number of executions using firing squad. Utah is the only other state to have used the method since the death penalty resumed nationwide in 1976.
The state’s protocols for firing squad came under scrutiny after attorneys for the most recent inmate executed using the method, Mikal Mahdi, claimed the bullets mostly missed his heart. An autopsy of Mahdi showed two bullet holes instead of the expected three, leading lawyers to claim one of the marksmen missed.
Department of Corrections officials maintain nothing went wrong. Two bullets struck Mahdi in the exact same place, spokeswoman Chrysti Shain has said.
The crimes
Bryant was still on probation following three years in prison for attempted burglary when his deadly crime spree started Oct. 5, 2004, with a Sumter County home robbery. His plans, however, began before that, attorneys argued during his 2008 sentencing hearing.
For several days, Bryant drove his blue-and-white pickup truck around rural Sumter County, approaching isolated homes and spinning tales to anyone who answered the door when he knocked.
On Oct. 4, Bryant came to the home of Tom Dennis, which sat on several hundred acres of property far back from the road. Bryant told Dennis his brother stole his pickup truck and he needed help getting it out of a ditch, Dennis testified in court.
Dennis helped Bryant out and thought little of the interaction. The next day, Bryant returned to rob the house after Dennis left to attend Clemson’s homecoming football game. When Dennis went out to his office in an adjoining building the next morning, he discovered someone had stolen his laptop, briefcase and bag of money.
Bryant repeated his method three days later with James Ammons, another rural homeowner. That time, Bryant took only Ammons’ .40-caliber semiautomatic rifle and the shells Ammons kept on the nightstand.
Over the following days, Bryant used that gun to shoot four people, killing three.
The first came later that same day. Bryant went out to a popular fishing spot along the Wateree River. He walked up and down the Richland County side of the river, where Clinton Brown was fishing.
After a brief conversation, Bryant walked away. A few moments later, Brown felt a shot in his back, he testified in court. When he turned around, Bryant was already gone, he said.
Brown drove himself to the hospital, where he stayed for nine days but survived the gunshot wound. Brown died in 2017, at the age of 69.
The next day, Bryant went to his friend Cliff Gainey’s house to smoke marijuana and drink some beers, Bryant said in a later statement to police. When the beers ran out, Bryant drove the two of them to a nearby convenience store, where security video showed Gainey entering the store, then returning to Bryant’s truck parked outside, according to court records.
Bryant drove around for a while, until Gainey asked him to pull over so he could “take a leak,” Bryant told police. In separate statements, Bryant told police he thought Gainey was taking a knife out of his waistband, then that he thought Gainey was making sexual advances toward him.
Regardless of what happened, Bryant shot Gainey three times, he said.
“I don’t know exactly why I shot Cliff,” Bryant later said in a statement to police. “Only thing I can (think) is his actions brought back a bad memory and I felt scared.”
Bryant remembered “sitting on my knees crying for him because he was a friend,” police testified Bryant told them. When a passerby pulled up, Bryant got back in his truck and fled, he later told police.
Bryant went back to Gainey’s house and took all the electronics from the living room, along with a fish tank from his bedroom. At some point, Bryant started a fire, in what he claimed was an accident but prosecutors said was an act of arson.
Two days later, on Oct. 11, Bryant killed 62-year-old Willard Tietjen, who friends and family called TJ.
Bryant had come to Tietjen’s house several days earlier, claiming he needed to see Tietjen’s phone book to try and track down a friend’s phone number. Tietjen helped, and Bryant left without incident, Tietjen’s wife, Millard Tietjen, testified.
When he returned, Bryant said he told Tietjen his truck had overheated. Tietjen invited him in and began to talk about religion before becoming hostile, Bryant told police. Bryant shot him nine times, an autopsy showed.
Bryant stayed in Tietjen’s house long after killing him. He smoked Tietjen’s cigarettes and used his computer. He took Tietjen’s Masonic ring off his finger and cleaned off the blood in the sink. He rearranged the furniture and lit candles over Tietjen’s body, police testified.
“He was there for hours, enjoying his work, admiring what he had done,” solicitor Kelly Jackson told the judge during his trial.
When Tietjen’s wife and daughter called to check on him, Bryant answered his cellphone, calling himself “the prowler” and telling the women he killed Tietjen, the victim’s relatives testified in court.
Bryant also burned Tietjen’s eyes with a lit cigarette, set his goatee on fire and used Tietjen’s blood to write messages on the wall for police, according to court documents.
“Victim number four in two weeks, catch me if you can,” Bryant wrote on one wall, some of the letters in blood. On another was the word “catch,” also in blood, police testified.
Bryant’s note seemed to suggest he already planned to kill again, prosecutors argued. Two days later, around 4 a.m., he picked up Chris Burgess at a gas station, loaded his bicycle into the back of his pickup truck and drove off.
A hunter found Burgess’ body on the side of the road, shot three times, in a similar manner to Gaines, investigators testified.
“It was over for me,” Bryant told police he was thinking at the time.
Police arrested Bryant later that day. After initially trying to blame someone else, he confessed to the police, according to court testimony.
During his time in jail, Bryant racked up more charges for threatening a detention officer and severely beating another. Bryant pleaded guilty to all the charges he faced.
Prosecutors sought the death penalty for Tietjen’s killing because Bryant’s theft of jewelry and other items from the house qualified as an aggravating offense, according to court records. He received life sentences for the other slayings.
The victims
Most mornings, Bob Summers stopped by his friend Tietjen’s house for coffee, he testified during Bryant’s sentencing hearing. The morning of Tietjen’s death, Summers called to tell Tietjen a joke, as he often did.
Tietjen liked jokes, and he told good ones, Summers said. Summers liked to give him gag gifts, and he planned to give Tietjen a tie that looked like a bottle of Tabasco hot sauce before his death, he said.
Tietjen worked for the Air Force for 23 years, maintaining radar systems, his wife of 39 years testified. After retiring in 1985, he worked at hardware and electronics stores before eventually going into the insurance business, she said.
Tietjen was active in the local Masonic Lodge, and he was a Shriner, including driving a buggy he kept in the basement every time a parade happened in the area, she said.
When asked if she understood that Bryant could be put to death for killing her husband, Millard Tietjen told defense attorneys she was OK with that.
“I can’t say it would make it any better, but I feel he deserves a punishment because he made the choice to do what he did,” she said during the 2008 hearing.
Chris Gainey was 14 when Bryant shot his dad, Cliff Gainey, to death by the side of a road. During the sentencing hearing, he recalled fishing with his dad and watching movies, though he added he didn’t remember much else about their time together.
“The only thing I really remember, he used to always comment on me being — just always said I look just like him,” Chris Gainey testified. “My mama still says the same thing.”
Chris Burgess’ family missed him every day, his mother, Christine Burgess, wrote in a letter read out loud in court.
“We all loved him dearly,” the letter said. “The pain and suffering of this family will never go away.”
Stephen Bryant
In the months leading up to the killings, Bryant tried to get help for his deteriorating mental state, his aunt and grandmother told a judge.
That August, two months before his crime spree, Bryant sat down with his grandmother and aunt to ask for help. At his grandmother’s home, he clenched his hands on her glass-top coffee table, causing the whole table to shake, she recalled during his 2008 trial.
Bryant told the two about how his grandfather, his uncle and his older half-brother sexually and physically abused him throughout his childhood.
“He looked like he was being tortured,” his aunt, Terry Lee Bryant Caulder, testified during his trial. “It’s like his soul was just laid wide open. In his eyes, you could see he was hurting and suffering and he was living the abuse over again as it was coming out, what he was telling us.”
His grandmother, Shirley Freeman, suggested Bryant call a sexual abuse hotline, she said. Caulder found the number and handed the phone off to Bryant, who spoke to the person on the other end for a while, she testified.
The hotline seemed to offer no resources. His probation officer referred him to a nearby counseling center, but Bryant couldn’t afford to pay for the services, so he left without getting help.
He couldn’t sleep on the nights he picked up his victims at gas stations. He told police he remembered only bits and pieces of each incident, which experts testified could have been a symptom of his post-traumatic stress disorder, according to court records.
Bryant grew up in a troubled home, his attorneys have argued to multiple courts. His parents met and conceived him in a rehabilitation facility, though neither got sober. His mother drank during her pregnancy with him, she told attorneys during his appeals process.
Starting at the age of 17, he spent much of his life in and out of jail, always for non-violent offenses, defense attorneys said during his sentencing hearing.
The trauma of his early life, combined with the developmental effects of his mother’s drinking during her pregnancy, caused Bryant to snap and act outside his normal frame of mind, his attorneys argued during his appeals.
During his 17 years on death row, Bryant received two disciplinary sanctions, one for fighting without a weapon in 2009, and one for possessing a weapon in 2023, according to prison records.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado legislative leaders will soon vote on whether to extend or make permanent a system to livestream video of committee hearings at the Capitol.
The Executive Committee of the Legislative Council, made up of party leaders in both chambers, approved a pilot program earlier this year for video streaming in five committee rooms. Previously, only audio was livestreamed and archived for committee hearings, making Colorado an outlier among state legislatures.
Since then, people accessed committee video livestreams over 15,000 times during 35 meetings between July 30 and Nov. 5, according to a report from Legislative Council Staff. About 60% of those views were related to the planning, proceedings and aftermath of the special legislative session in August. The most-viewed meeting was an economic forecast to the Joint Budget Committee on Sept. 22.

“A major change during the process of the pilot project was that users can now see live slide presentations,” LCS Director Natalie Castle told lawmakers on Friday morning. “That was one of the things we heard from people that they were really happy to be able to see.”
The video stream shows the same view as a committee participant on Zoom, with a fixed wide shot on the committee room dais, remote participants and any materials being presented.
The pilot program has been extended until the end of the year.
“Video can make it easier for people to follow committee testimony as well as statements made by committee members, especially when speakers aren’t identified,” reads a letter of support from the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition and other organizations to Legislative Council. “Video provides context, allowing observers to see who is present and to gauge the emotions and reactions of lawmakers and others in the room. When people can watch the legislative process, they can better understand the legislative process, and that can foster more civic engagement.”
The Colorado General Assembly is currently the only state legislature in the country that does not provide video of committee hearings, according to a document shared earlier this year by the CFOIC.
The executive committee will vote on whether to make video streaming permanent at their next meeting. It would cost $20,000 to set up and then $50,000 per year, primarily for storage costs.
“I  want to voice my enthusiastic support of continuing and expanding what we have already done,” House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, said. “I have had conversations and really appreciate the overall perceived value that this has brought to our public.”

Josh Stein speaks to reporters in Raleigh on Oct. 20, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Governor Josh Stein is urging the public to not be provoked as U.S. Border Patrol agents arrive in Charlotte this weekend.
Stein said in a statement Friday that the agents arriving in Mecklenburg County should be focused on arresting violent criminals and drug traffickers.
“Unfortunately, that’s not always what we have seen with ICE and Border Patrol Agents in Chicago and elsewhere around the country,” said Stein. “The vast majority of people they have detained have no criminal convictions, and some are American citizens.”
Stein encouraged North Carolinians to remain peaceful and follow the law as they stand with their neighbors, and to document and report any problems with federal agents.
“When we see injustice, we bear witness. If you see any inappropriate behavior, use your phones to record and notify local law enforcement, who will continue to keep our communities safe long after these federal agents leave. That’s the North Carolina way.”
‘They need to stay home’
Congresswoman Alma Adams (NC-12) didn’t mince words Friday when asked about the Border Patrol arriving in her district in an ongoing aggressive immigration enforcement by the Trump administration.

“First of all, I think they need to stay home. We don’t need that kind of disruption,” said Adams. “We don’t need them coming in here antagonizing our citizens.”
The veteran Democratic congresswoman said she has heard from numerous constituents worried about how immigration enforcement will unfold in the Queen City.
“When I look at what has happened in other cities, how people have been treated, abused, even in physical ways, we don’t want that in Charlotte. We don’t need that in Charlotte,” Adams told reporters.
On Thursday, U.S. Rep. Tim Moore (NC-14), who also represents parts of Charlotte, said he supports bringing the Border Patrol into the city.
“I’m glad that they’re looking at doing that, and I’m glad at the way they’re approaching it,” said Moore in Raleigh.
U.S. Customs and Border Patrol does not comment on its plans, but Moore predicted the CBP would likely stay “for a while” and focus on organized crime.

Charlotte has been in the national spotlight since the killing of Ukrainian immigrant Iryna Zarutska on the city’s light rail system. The event prompted state lawmakers to pass an expansive crime bill this fall, which Gov. Stein signed.
Adams has said she prays for Zarutska’s family, but it is shameful for lawmakers to try to score cheap political points from the tragedy.
On Friday, Adams said the nation has watched immigration enforcement officials come into other cities only to have the situation quickly spiral out of control for the undocumented, the documented, and even local citizens.
“I just think that’s just unconscionable,” Adams lamented.
Like Stein, Adams is encouraging people who are planning to protest Border Patrol enforcement to do so peacefully.
“We certainly hope that these folks coming in here will just pass through and continue on their way,” said Adams.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3910-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Following a long and occasionally contentious Water Quality Control Commission meeting on Thursday, commissioners voted 7-4 to vacate a controversial vote from last summer that would have advanced a petition from an oil-and-gas industry-aligned group to expand the use of treated oil and gas wastewater, known as produced water.
Earlier this year, the WQCC adopted rules to allow for oil and gas wastewater pilot projects, but no discharges into surface or groundwater, a decision seen as a victory for environmental groups.
In June, a new petition by the industry-backed Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance requested the 12-member WQCC  rewrite its May rule, and allow 13 counties to use “treated produced water” for uses such as watering livestock, “non-food crops,” construction and releases into the environment.
The WQCC subsequently, at a July 8 meeting, set a hearing on the WATR Alliance petition and, in its August meeting, amid strong opposition, rejected motions to quash the petition.
Several environmental groups in response filed motions for the board to vacate the July vote allowing the petition to proceed, and to disqualify seven of the WQCC’s members, saying their “impartiality and fairness” were “compromised by interference” from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. 
The latter allegation came in response to Santa Fe New Mexican reporting on an emailed exchange in July between staff at the governor’s office and cabinet heads appointed to the WQCC that encouraged them to attend the August meeting in-person and get the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse (WATR) Alliances petition “over the finish line.” Those revelations also led to a protest outside the state environment department in September, with demonstrators calling for Environment Secretary James Kenney’s resignation.
Amid strong opposition, New Mexico water board lets plan for more oil and gas wastewater use proceed

The governor’s office has previously denied any wrongdoing. She has previously cited the state’s limited water supplies as a reason to explore expanded uses for oilfield wastewater. 
The governor’s Communications Director Michael Coleman, in response to Thursday’s vote, said, “while it’s disappointing that the WQCC vacated the hearing prior to considering extensive water reuse research conducted in recent years, the Lujan Grisham administration will continue to work with stakeholders to implement the 50-Year Water Action Plan. The governor is focused on adopting comprehensive, science-based water reuse rules that are legally required under the Produced Water Act and crucial to protecting and preserving our freshwater resources for generations.”
The WQCC decided the decision of disqualification became “moot” after it vacated its July 8 vote.
Representatives from numerous conservation groups praised Thursday’s vote, with New Energy Economy Executive Director Mariel Nanasi calling it in a statement, a “huge victory for the people” and the now-overturned vote “the product of bias, undue influence, and a predetermined outcome.”
Tannis Fox, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center, also said in a statement that the commission had “done the right thing…by wiping the state clean and avoiding any appearance of impropriety.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Zain-and-Vittoria-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma public schools won’t be able to adopt new social studies textbooks next year with academic standards for the subject still in flux. 
The State Textbook Committee voted Friday to suspend indefinitely the social studies textbook adoption cycle while the state Supreme Court and the Oklahoma State Department of Education consider what to do with the academic standards. 
A September Court order paused implementation of the new social studies standards, which became highly controversial for including Bible teachings and dubious claims about the 2020 presidential election and COVID-19. Public records show 12 textbook publishers chose not to return to Oklahoma after the new standards were approved.
Those 12 companies, including major publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, are currently on the state’s approved list but didn’t submit a bid this year for reapproval. Companies have withdrawn from Oklahoma before during a math adoption cycle in 2023.
Some of those companies informed the Education Department they had concerns about new content included in the social studies standards, said Sharon Morgan, program director for the agency’s Office of Standards and Learning.
“There were a few publishers that we’re familiar with that did reach out,” Morgan said. “They were concerned about a few of the objectives in the 2025 social studies standards, and they let us know that they would not be bidding.”

Morgan said she doesn’t recall which publishers this entailed. She said the companies didn’t specify what new content was the source of their concerns, only that “they did not feel they could bid.”
The state received 12 bidders this year, including four not currently on the approved list.
In a typical cycle, the State Textbook Committee would have voted in November on final textbook adoption after considering review committees’ evaluations of each publisher. That vote would establish an approved list that schools could choose from when spending their textbook funds.
That vote couldn’t happen Friday with the social studies standards on hold, said Morgan, who was recently appointed as the committee’s chairperson.
“We’re hoping this is resolved by February and we know what our standards are,” she told the committee during Friday’s meeting.
In the meantime, public schools will continue using social studies standards and textbooks adopted in 2019.
New state Superintendent Lindel Fields said his administration intends to reexamine the 2025 standards. He told news reporters last month he expects “there will be some changes to them,” which would need agreement from the Oklahoma State Board of Education and the state Legislature.
Fields replaced former state Superintendent Ryan Walters in October. Walters, who resigned Sept. 30, led the development of the 2025 social studies standards.
Publishers would have another opportunity to bid once the standards are finalized, Morgan said. Having a final version of the standards by February would give companies time to decide whether to submit an intent to bid by April.
Delays in the current adoption cycle could force the textbook committee and its review teams to consider both social studies and science materials in 2026, Morgan said. It also could push three other subjects on the 2026 schedule — health, physical education and vocational education — to later years, she said.

(Screen capture by Kansas Reflector from MPSC meeting)TOPEKA — Missouri utility regulators on Thursday approved a tariff to ensure large power users on its system are responsible for paying their fair share of the effect their usage has on the power grid and other customers. 
The Missouri Public Service Commission approved a large-load tariff submitted by Evergy, which operates in Kansas and Missouri, and that was supported by most parties in the case. 
Unlike in Kansas, where a large-user tariff was unanimously agreed to by all intervenors, including business, environmental groups and a data service coalition, two groups did not support the Missouri order.
Missouri Public Service Commission staff and the Missouri Office of Public Counsel, an organization that advocates for small business and residential customers, did not support the order. 
In fact, the staff and OPC submitted a separate proposal that commission chairwoman Kayla Hahn said was too confusing and could cause large users to avoid locating in Missouri.
“Staff’s proposal requires upwards of 25 different charges that a large user could be subject to paying,” she said. “The evidence showed us the vast amount of charges and uncertainty make it unclear if a large user would be paying too much, too little or more likely if a large user would forgo locating in Missouri altogether as even a sophisticated user would be unable to predict what its ultimate bill responsibility would be.”
The tariff reflects broad stakeholder consensus and “contains strong safeguards to ensure that large new loads pay their fair share while enabling growth that benefits Missouri,” the commissioners said in the order.
Large-load users were defined in the order as those requiring 75 megawatts per month at peak times, a parallel to the Kansas order approved Nov. 6 by the Kansas Corporation Commission.
“I’m satisfied that this will result in the large-load customers bearing the financial responsibility for the costs that are incurred for infrastructure improvement, be they transmission or generation,” said commissioner John Mitchell. “I’m also satisfied that the agreement does establish reasonable protections both for the existing customers and for the large-load customers, and ensure that the large-load customers will pay their fair share.”
Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said Missouri rates include similar protections to those put in place in Kansas for existing customers by ensuring that companies pay their fair share for access to the grid. The rate for these new large customers is higher than that paid by existing commercial and industrial customers. 
“This premium rate helps pay for modernization and maintenance of the power grid that is shared by all our customers,” she said. “In both Kansas and Missouri the commissions have recognized the value of attracting large energy users and the importance of making sure existing customers don’t foot the bill.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hahn-at-mpsc-1024x565.png,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

The Mississippi Board of Education voted to take over the school district during a special called meeting Friday. District officials had reached out to the state education agency on Oct. 30 because the school system couldn’t make its November payroll. 
“This was a difficult but necessary decision to protect the educational interests of students in Okolona,” State Superintendent Lance Evans said in a statement. “The financial challenges facing this district have reached a point where state intervention is required to ensure students continue to receive the education they deserve.”
Over the past two weeks, Mississippi Department of Education officials have been meeting with district leaders to determine the financial state of Okolona schools. The district sent the agency some paperwork that show a budget shortfall of more than $100,000, but other financial documents, such as payments to vendors, were incomplete, according to information state education officials presented.
Education department officials discovered that the district hasn’t had a financial audit since 2021, and has been outspending since fiscal year 2023-24. 
“That’s part of the work … for our staff to perform, really, a forensic account and review of their finances,” said Kymberly Wiggins, the agency’s chief operating officer.
The state board determined today that the district’s situation was critical enough to warrant a takeover, citing ongoing insolvency and a pattern of financial mismanagement and accreditation violations. Effective immediately, John Ferrell, the agency’s chief of school and district transformation, will become Okolona’s interim superintendent. The district will get financial relief through the state’s school district emergency assistance fund. 
Without intervention, Okolona schools would continue to have “an inadequate and unstable educational environment, thereby denying the students of the district the opportunity to learn to excel and to obtain a free and appropriate public education,” said Matt Miller, president of the state board of education.
The state took over the district in 2010 for similar financial issues and accreditation violations. Okolona was also academically failing then. The state returned the district to local control in 2012.
“This is a total shock to me,” said Okolona Mayor Sherman Carouthers, a lifelong resident of the area. “We’ve seen so much improvement. You’ve really caught me off guard. This is something I’m going to have to process.”
Since 2017, the district’s academic rating has improved from a D to a B. 
“The educator part of the district has done quite well,” state board member Mary Werner said during the meeting. “But the leadership has failed miserably.” 
Barbara Carouthers, the Okolona school board chaplain and a distant relative of the mayor, would not answer questions when reached by Mississippi Today.

Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray announced Friday afternoon that the Senate won’t take up the issue as was expected in an unusual December session.

Indiana lawmakers were scheduled to meet starting Dec. 1 to consider drawing more Republican-leaning U.S. House districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections — following a months-long pressure campaign by Trump’s administration and his supporters. That included two trips to Indianapolis by Vice President JD Vance.

Ten colleges from four nearby states have filed a brief in support of Middlebury College, arguing the case has broader implications on colleges' and nonprofits' obligations to donors who contribute gifts.

Former Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas has appealed his lawsuit against Middlebury College to the Vermont Supreme Court — the latest development in a years-long legal dispute over the naming of the college’s Middlebury Chapel.
Douglas’ lawsuit, first filed in 2023, sought to reverse a decision to remove former Gov. John A. Mead’s name from the college’s chapel. Mead’s descendents supported Douglas’ appointment as a special administrator of Mead’s estate before he filed suit.
Mead served as Vermont’s 53rd governor of Vermont from 1910 to 1912. Douglas, meanwhile, served as the state’s 80th governor from 2003 to 2011.

The building had for a century stood as the Mead Memorial Chapel, named after the former governor and longtime trustee of the college. But in 2021, the college, amid a statewide reckoning over Vermont’s history of eugenics, decided to rename the building, Middlebury Chapel.
Douglas argued this was a breach of contract and of good faith. Mead, who helped the college pay for the chapel’s construction, included in his offer that the chapel bear the Mead name in perpetuity, Douglas said in court documents.
Vermont Superior Court Robert Mello in April granted Middlebury College summary judgement, dismissing Douglas’ claims and resolving the case without a trial.
But Douglas, in his appeal to the Supreme Court, argues that the Superior Court erred when it concluded that there were no naming terms laid out in the contract between the college and Mead. The court, Douglas said in legal documents, instead “imposed its interpretation of a ‘reasonable time’ for the name to remain on the chapel — which it decreed was 100 years.”
The former governor is asking the court to remand the case back to Superior Court to consider whether there was a clear contract with an enforceable promise — that is, “whether the Mead name would remain on the chapel as a memorial, for as long as the building existed,” Douglas said in court filings.
“The structure that John Mead built was both a Memorial and a Chapel, and memorials have no end-date; they are always meant to be for as long as the memorial stands,” Douglas wrote in an email.
An attorney representing the college did not respond to a voicemail seeking comment, and a media relations employee with the college did not return a request for comment. The college previously argued in Superior Court that no clear request to keep the name in perpetuity can be found in available documents.
“John Abner Mead had the gratification of seeing his wishes for construction of a prominent chapel on Middlebury’s campus brought to fruition — and, indeed, that chapel bore his name in recognition of the gift for over a century thereafter,” the college wrote in a Superior Court filing. “But, as Mead did not expressly condition his gift on the use of his name, Middlebury was not legally bound to preserve the appellation ‘Mead Memorial Chapel’ name in perpetuity.”
The legal case serves as a reminder of Vermont’s history with eugenics in the early 20th century. In his appeal, Douglas makes the argument that Middlebury College itself was much more influential in that movement than Mead.
But the matter has also drawn the attention of other colleges and universities who argue the case has broader implications to consider regarding colleges’ and nonprofits’ obligations to donors who contribute gifts.
Ten colleges from four nearby states — including Tufts University, Amherst College and Wellesley College — have filed an amicus brief with the court in support of Middlebury College.
These types of institutions, lawyers wrote in legal documents, handle tens of thousands of donations, some made generations ago. The handling of these gifts are settled under common law, “which generally prohibit donor standing to pursue claims with respect to a completed gift,” they wrote.
A departure from that practice, the colleges argue, “would upend the current system,” they wrote in the brief. 
“It would result in significantly increased litigation for the courts as well as unnecessary administrative and legal costs for institutions like Middlebury and the colleges, requiring them to expend funds that would otherwise support their charitable purposes,” they wrote.
‘The altar of public relations’
The state Superior Court noted in its decision to dismiss the case that “no explicit reference to perpetuity” existed at the time. Douglas argues in his appeal that none was necessary.
“Why would anyone have foreseen the need to have a ‘perpetual clause’ dictating the behavior of a college whose leaders were his dear friends?” Douglas said in court documents. “Even the judge allowed for the fact that there could have been a contract — he just decided that if there was one, it had expired. We believe that a jury should make that determination.”
The Supreme Court has yet to schedule a hearing on the matter.
The college, in its removal of Mead’s name, pointed to a farewell speech that Mead made to Vermont’s General Assembly in 1912 where he espoused eugenicist ideas.
Mead told lawmakers in his speech that a “class of individuals in whose mental or nervous construction there is something lacking” were “increasing out of all proportion to the normal growth of the population.”
He continued that “most of the insane, the epileptics, the imbeciles, the idiots, the sexual perverts, together with many of the confirmed inebriates, prostitutes, tramps and criminals” in state’s jails, asylums and poor farms were “the results of these intermarriages or the natural offspring of defective parents.”
Mead encouraged lawmakers in Vermont to consider “how best to restrain this defective class and how best to restrict the propagation of defective children,” he said.
Douglas has said previously that Mead’s speech ultimately did not have a significant impact on Vermont’s eugenic sterilization policies, which were instituted after Mead’s death in 1920.
In his appeal, Douglas said that Mead, in his 1912 address, was “speaking as a physician,” that he “cautiously referenced vasectomy as a safer alternative to other sterilization practices,” and was “motivated by medical concern for women’s health rather than ideological adherence to eugenics.”
Douglas instead pointed to the college’s own history with eugenics, and wrote in his appeal that the college “sought to distance itself from Vermont’s eugenics history by scapegoating Mead while concealing its own extensive role.”
The college for more than 50 years, he said, “promoted eugenics through teaching, scholarship, and advocacy — even after the Holocaust revealed the catastrophic consequences of eugenic theory.”
Douglas in his appeal likened the college’s removal of the Mead name from the chapel to a “hypocritical public relations smear campaign to scapegoat” Mead.
The college “sacrificed Governor Mead on the altar of public relations,” Douglas wrote, and “used him as a subterfuge to conceal the fact that Middlebury College was literally, a Eugenicist Factory, for over 50 years.”
The college had courses in sociology, biology and zoology that emphasized race, heredity and biological problems, Douglas wrote, and the college was one of 44 institutions listed in the 1914 Journal Heredity as teaching eugenics.
In an email, Douglas said the institutions arguing in support of Middlebury College “want to maintain their aversion to allowing unpopular views on their campuses & to ensure the right to cancel their own generous alumni donors.”
“If I were to present a substantial gift to a college, I’d be concerned that, at some point in the future, its leaders would discover some obscure statement of mine that justifies the same shabby treatment that was visited on Gov. Mead,” he wrote.

Wintersteen spoke in front of the board about ISU’s accomplishments and efficiencies for the last time Thursday before her coming retirement in January. Members of the board, as well as University of Northern Iowa President Mark Nook and University of Iowa President Barbara Wilson, said Wintersteen will be missed.
“The Iowa Board of Regents expresses its deep gratitude to President Wintersteen for her expertise, dedication and extraordinary service to the board of regents, Iowa State University, its students and families and all Iowans,” Bates said.

The ISU president expressed her gratitude for the board as well, saying she sees “the countless hours, energy and effort that every regent provides for this voluntary service,” and every Iowan owes them a big thanks for their commitment.
While Wintersteen has been serving as ISU president — the first woman in the role, Bates said — for nine years, her tenure at the university spans nearly five decades. She was also one of the first women to work as an ISU Extension associate in integrated pest management, according to her online biography, and earned her doctorate in entomology before becoming a professor of the topic.
Wintersteen also held different administrative roles at ISU throughout her career, including dean of the college of agriculture and life sciences and director of the Iowa Agriculture and Home Economics Experiment Station, her biography stated. She officially became ISU’s president on Nov. 20, 2017.
“Under her leadership, Iowa State raised a record breaking $1.5242 billion for the Forever True for Iowa State campaign with $500 million dedicated for student support, including more than 50,000 donor funded scholarships,” Bates said.
The board selected North Dakota State University President David Cook to succeed Wintersteen as president, but with his contract beginning March 1 and Wintersteen’s ending at the beginning of January, an interim president was needed to fill the gap.
Bates announced at the board’s Thursday meeting that David Spalding, ISU vice president for economic development and industry relations, will serve as interim president starting Jan. 3. His annual salary was set at $600,000.
Spalding did not attend the board meeting announcing his selection, but Bates said “we’re certainly grateful that he accepted this interim position.”

Three county commissions in Southeastern New Mexico have met so far this month to select nominees to replace Nicholas Paul in the state Senate. 
Paul, a Republican in Alamogordo, announced his resignation in mid-October due to health reasons after less than a year in the seat. Because Senate District 33 covers parts of three counties, commissions in Otero, Chaves and Lincoln Counties met to nominate potential replacements.
All three selected different names, one of the nominees and officials from the counties told Source New Mexico this week. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham will choose from that list a senator to serve the rest of Paul’s term, which ends in 2028.
The three nominees are current state Rep. John Block (R-Carlsbad), along with Lincoln County Commission Chair Mark Fischer and Rex Wilson, who was the Southern region director of Presbyterian Medical Services until 2024.

The governor is expected to choose Paul’s replacement before the 30-day legislative session begins Jan. 20, according to Brandon Harris, a Senate GOP spokesperson. 
The county commissions considered eight potential replacements, according to commission meeting minutes. Other candidates included Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford, Otero County Attorney RB Nichols, former state Rep. Zachary Cook, business owner Benjamin Luna Jr., and Matthew Wade, a former 12th Judicial District deputy district attorney.
Otero County’s pick: Rep. John Block
In a cover letter, Block, who has represented House District 51 since 2023, said he should replace Paul in the Senate due to his record in the House, where he noted his “impeccable” attendance at interim legislative meetings and regular rankings as the most conservative state House member, where Republicans are in the minority.
Block wrote on Facebook on Nov. 8 that the County Commission selected him. Otero County officials did not respond to Source’s request for comment Friday. 
Former U.S. Rep. Yvette Herrell, a Republican, wrote a letter endorsing Block. So did Jerrett Perry, the executive director of the Alamogordo Chamber of Commerce, and Michelle Perry, a small business owner in the area who also runs a charter.

Lincoln County’s pick: Commission Chair Mark Fischer
Fischer touted his role leading the commission through recent wildfires and floods and advocating for the county’s interests at the Roundhouse. If chosen, he said he’d work to advance the county’s tourism and horse-racing industries while seeking to expand logging and agriculture. 
“Lincoln County as well as the whole state needs oil and gas, and I have always supported that,” he wrote.
Chaves County’s pick: Rex Wilson
Wilson, who also served two terms as a Lincoln County commissioner, wrote in a cover letter that his 18 years as a healthcare administrator and history as a multigenerational rancher in Lincoln County make him a good fit for the Senate seat. 
He also said he started Camp Sierra Blanca at Fort Stanton in Lincoln County, a “nationally recognized alternative education model” that gives troubled young people a “second chance through non-traditional pathways.”

(Photo by HUD Office of Public Affairs)New federal rules issued last week constitute the “most devastating housing cuts in modern U.S. history,” according to Minnesota organizations that provide housing to people exiting homelessness. 
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development pays for a large portion of supportive housing services across the country — developments that house people with disabilities who are transitioning out of homelessness for free or at a deep discount. Supportive housing developments typically also offer on-site services like case management, mental health treatment and job training. 
More than 3,600 Minnesotans live in supportive housing, and last year Minnesota organizations received around $48 million in federal funding from Continuum of Care grants, the HUD program funding homelessness solutions.
The new rules will cut federal spending on permanent supportive housing by more than half, forcing the organizations that provide housing to find new funding sources and cut spending — likely by reducing the number of buildings they operate and people they serve.
The rules would effectively double chronic homelessness, according to a press release from a coalition of 185 Minnesota organizations opposed to the cuts.
Existing supportive housing developments can typically count on retaining around 90% of their base federal funding year-over-year. But the new rules drop that number to 30%, meaning some developments could face sudden, steep budget cuts. 
The press release says “these shifts could reduce funding for permanent housing by more than 85% and strip away both the scale and flexibility of the nation’s primary homelessness response system.”
The Reformer reported in September that HUD canceled Continuum of Care grants that it had awarded to Beacon Interfaith Housing Collaborative for the construction of two new supportive housing developments. 
When HUD reopened the grant application, it contained the priorities of President Donald Trump. 
To receive grants under the rewritten program, projects must be in a city, county and state that prohibit public camping, drug use and squatting and enforce those prohibitions; cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and follow certain standards for involuntary commitment. 
It also bars applicants who “deny the sex binary in humans or promote the notion that sex is a chosen or mutable characteristic” and those who “knowingly distribute drug paraphernalia…under the pretext of ‘harm reduction.’”
Minnesota doesn’t qualify under several of the provisions. For instance, Minnesota is a trans refuge state and many local law enforcement jurisdictions do not enforce federal immigration law, which is considered a federal, not a state or local responsibility.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/51668526145_e737307647_o-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-11-14 14:57:51.767846

Screenshot. After nearly three hours of public comment, the Michigan State Board of Education voted along party lines Thursday, 6-2, to pass updated health education and sex ed guidelines that include recommendations to teach students about LGBTQ+ identities. 
“I am proud of what we just did,” said Dr. Pamela Pugh, the board’s president. “We made safer spaces for students, all students.”
The debate generally boiled down to those in support of the new guidelines advocating for the inclusion of LGBTQ+ students in public school curricula, while those opposed cited questions of parental rights and religious freedoms. 
The state’s guidelines had not been updated since 2007, and the newly voted-in standards include guidance on coverage of sexual orientation, gender identity, consent and safe sex practices, which previously had not been a part of the curriculum. 
“We are not pushing anything,” said board member Tiffany Tilley. “We are doing our jobs, though, which is making sure that some very old standards and guidelines are being updated today.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Multiple current and former Michigan public school students, many themselves part of the LGBTQ+ community, spoke about how they felt excluded from school curricula, especially sex ed lessons, when people who shared their identities were not discussed. 
Over 100 residents attended the meeting to give public comment, leading the board to shorten each comment from three minutes to one. 
The standards maintained, in accordance with state law, requirements for parental notification and options to opt-out of sex ed courses, which staff members present from the Department of Education repeatedly emphasized. 
“I argue today we have found that many people believe that parental rights should be taken away,” said Nikki Snyder, one of the Republican members of the board who voted against the changes. 
“A lot of people talk about all parents have rights. Their children have rights. Not just the people who opposed the proposal. I am a parent. I’ve got rights,” said board member Marshall Bullock. “Because parental rights come with a responsibility.”

Snyder repeatedly called presenters from the Michigan Department of Education liars — which led interim superintendent Sue Carnell to interrupt her and call for her to respect the staff, though Snyder repeatedly interjected into questions from other board members. 
“There is a Board of Education massive overstep that is happening,” she said. 
“It is a true grooming going on,” said the other Republican on the board, Tom McMillin, utilizing an oft-used trope to falsely assert that members of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies are sexual predators.
“You said that people at this table were groomers and intentional groomers,” Pugh responded. “You need to retract that. Those are dangerous words and you need to be careful what you say at this table.”
Presenters from the Department of Education also noted that public comment outside of meetings was largely split between those in favor and those opposed to the guidelines. 
Of 1,388 formal surveys received, 924 opposed the update while 250 supported it. Outside of the actual formal survey system, the Department of Education received over 2,000 emails on the issue during the 30-day public comment period — 896 opposed and over 1,100 in favor. 
“This is not fringe, this is the mainstream of Michigan education,” Taryn Gal, executive director of the Michigan Organization on Adolescent Sexual Health, said during the meeting. “The people responsible for educating your students support the standards because they are grounded in evidence, aligned with national best practices and designed to meet the real needs of students today.”
“What about when the science is corrupted, right?” countered pastor Danny Soria, one of the nearly 50 pastors that signed a letter to the board opposing the new standards. “We find ourselves in biblical times at critical crossroads. We bear the profound responsibility to make wise and morally sound decisions. Those choices must be guided, not by a distorted or perverse moral compass, but by a biblical and constitutional perspective, one that holds the rule of law.”
“The only thing that matters is the parents,” said John Grossenbacher, who submitted a petition signed by over 1,600 parents in opposition to the standards. “They are against this.”
Three parent organizations submitted formal letters of support to the Board — The Michigan Parent Teacher Association, Parent Action for Healthy Kids and Red Wine & Blue Michigan.

Becky Jo Hadlock requested a trial to contest a misdemeanor charge accusing her of defying a legislative subpoena. 
The post Weston County clerk pleads not guilty in subpoena case appeared first on WyoFile .","An eastern Wyoming clerk under fire for her actions during the November 2024 election pleaded not guilty Friday to failing to appear at a legislative hearing where she had been subpoenaed to testify.
Weston County Clerk Becky Jo Hadlock entered her plea during a brief appearance in Natrona County Circuit Court. Her attorney, Ryan Semerad, told the court his client wanted a trial.
Hadlock faces a single misdemeanor charge accusing her of defying a legislative subpoena that required her to testify before a panel investigating her office in connection with errors that occurred during the November 2024 election. She faces up to six months in jail and a $100 fine if convicted.
Circuit Judge Cynthia K. Sweet set a $500 personal recognizance bond for Hadlock, meaning the defendant won’t have to put up any money to remain free as long as she makes future court appearances.

Court records show a handful of lawmakers spoke with authorities during the criminal investigation surrounding Hadlock. But a reporter did not see any legislators in attendance at Friday’s hearing.
The criminal case comes amid growing scrutiny of Wyoming’s elections system. Republican lawmakers filed 45 election bills during the last legislative session — a striking number for one topic in a single year. Hadlock’s actions have fueled calls for additional legislation, including to move Wyoming to a hand-count voting system.
Election errors
State lawmakers and other officials began to scrutinize Hadlock’s actions soon after errors in the November 2024 election resulted in a dramatic undercount of votes for Rep. Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, in last year’s general election. Neiman was the majority floor leader at the time and is now the House speaker.
Hadlock, it was later learned, had printed out three versions of the ballot because of errors on the first two. That itself wasn’t a problem — clerks sometimes reprint ballots to correct misprints and other errors. But the clerk’s office gave some voters the incorrect first and second versions, which resulted in tabulators miscounting votes for Neiman, who was running unopposed for House District 1, and a county commission race.  
The result showed Neiman initially receiving only 166 votes, with another 1,289 voters leaving that race blank — what’s known as an undervote.
Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Wyoming’s top elections official, noticed the error and tried to contact Hadlock on election night. When she didn’t answer, he sent sheriff’s deputies to her home.

Multiple investigations ensued. After his inquiry, Gray recommended Hadlock’s removal from office. Gov. Mark Godon came to a different conclusion. He decided that Hadlock made serious mistakes, but those errors did not amount to misconduct and malfeasance — the level needed to seek her removal from office. Gordon also stressed the serious nature of recommending the removal of a lawfully elected county official, writing that “the decision of who should fill a county office is best made by the people of Weston County in the next election just a little over a year away.” 
The Wyoming Legislature also launched its own examination, forming a subcommittee to do that work. The Weston County Clerk 2024 General Election Subcommittee met Sept. 29 in Casper to continue its investigation.
Hadlock had been served with the subpoena on Sept. 23, according to a sworn statement by a Natrona County sheriff’s investigator. She emailed lawmakers two days later, informing them she would not attend due to a scheduling conflict.

The clerk later told the sheriff’s investigator that while she did receive a subpoena, she had personal business in Gillette on the day of the hearing. Specifically, she and her mother both had doctors appointments scheduled for that date.
That decision contributed to a new inquiry by the governor’s office into Hadlock’s actions. Last month, Gordon announced he’d received two additional complaints against the embattled clerk. One accused her of filing a false post-election audit following the 2024 general election. A second referenced her refusal to testify despite the subpoena.
After that investigation is complete, Gordon will decide whether to recommend that a court remove Hadlock from office. The governor cannot unilaterally remove her.

The agency had previously begun issuing partial Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits earlier this week.
Most recipients should soon have access to their full benefits, the agency said in a press release.
“We are grateful for this resolution and for the ability to move quickly to restore full benefits,” said Sondra Shelby, director of adult and family services. “Our teams have worked tirelessly to prepare systems so that Oklahomans receive the full support available to them without delay.”
Recipients do not need to take any action as benefits will be issued automatically.
More than 680,000 Oklahomans receive the benefits, commonly known as food stamps.
Last month, the Contingency Review Board met and approved the distribution of $1 million per week to food banks for up to seven weeks, contingent on a lack of federal funds. The funding was to come from the state emergency fund.
Carrie Snodgrass, a DHS spokesperson, said that $1.5 million had been distributed. The distributions are ending because the federal dollars were made available, she said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-14 19:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Can’t assume we can afford it’: Wingate stops water rate increase for now after city pushes back,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/14/wingate-pauses-water-rate-increase/,U.S. District Judge Henry Wigate halted for now a water rate increase for Jackson-area customers amid concerns over third-party manager's actions.,"A federal court Thursday halted, for now, a rate increase the manager of Jackson’s beleaguered water and sewer systems has for months said is necessary to keep the utility afloat. 
U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate said he needed more time to make a decision, adding he would have an update on the matter by the next hearing on Nov. 19. 
JXN Water also received news Wednesday that Congress approved to set aside $54 million for daily operations, Ted Henifin, the manager of the third-party utility, said. Lawmakers had already awarded the funds to the city, but initially did so only for capital projects. 
Since 2022, the utility has made relatively fast strides improving water pressure throughout Jackson as well as repairing burst sewer lines across the city. Moreover, for the first time in a decade, the water system is compliant with all federal drinking water regulations, Henifin said last week.

But without added revenue, JXN Water said it will continue to lose money and be unable to address sewer system repairs, including two major, ongoing overflows – one on Mill Street and another on I-55 near Home Depot.
Since the spring, Henifin has pleaded with the court for a rate increase after JXN Water ran out of its initial $150 million allocated for daily system upkeep. The hike would raise the average Jacksonian’s monthly bill – which includes costs for drinking water as well as garbage pickup and wastewater – by 12%, the utility says. 
City officials, including Mayor John Horhn as well as all of the Jackson City Council, have argued the utility shouldn’t be able to charge more until it collects payments from a broader swath of the city. 
Even if JXN Water had a 100% collections rate – it currently sits around 70%, far below the national average of over 90% – those bills wouldn’t yield enough revenue to keep the utility from losing money, Henifin has repeatedly told critics of his proposal. 
Jackson officials, attorneys for the ACLU, and Rep. Fabian Nelson, a Democrat whose district includes south Jackson, all spoke against the rate increase during a status conference in front of Wingate on Thursday. Wingate appointed Henifin to lead the city’s water recovery in 2022. 
Jackson City Attorney Drew Martin criticized JXN Water for not considering sooner its revenue needs. This increase would mark the second rate hike since Henifin took over. The manager previously has said it took a while to realize how much money the system needed to function. 
“What we hear from residents is ‘you can’t just spend money first and assume we can afford it,’” Martin said Thursday. 
In September, the utility ramped up its collection efforts, shutting off about 1,800 accounts. JXN Water has disconnected 4,403 total accounts since the start of 2025, adding it plans to continue disconnecting 500 to 1,000 accounts per week. It did not say how many accounts have since caught up or have been reconnected. The utility said it plans to have “worked” all accounts by mid-2026. 
In a court filing last week, Nelson submitted letters from constituents with thousands of dollars in water debt. After not receiving a bill for the first time in years, they couldn’t afford the down payment JXN Water requires to keep their taps on, the letters said. 
For others who wrote in, the utility told them they had high charges because of a leak at their home, although some claimed to have hired plumbers who told them the opposite. Some constituents complained of rude representatives from the JXN Water call center. 
Wingate himself said he called the center as an experiment and got conflicting answers from different operators. Henifin admitted Thursday the utility needs to better train its operators, which he said would begin around the new year.
A letter about billing issues a JXN Water customer sent to Rep. Fabian Nelson, a Democrat from Byram.
 “JXN Water has forgotten about the people and the citizens,” Nelson told the court while also praising the progress Henifin’s team has made so far.
The utility initially planned to send a notice of the rate increase to customers on Nov. 15 and for the change to take effect Dec. 15. In Wingate’s 2022 order that put Henifin in charge, the language doesn’t say the manager needs the court’s approval to implement a rate increase.
But at the eleventh hour of Thursday’s conference, Wingate enjoined, or stopped, Henifin from moving forward. JXN Water attorneys said they would need a decision by the end of November to enact the rate hike by the end of 2025, leading to the judge setting the next conference for Nov. 19. 
The two-day hearing, which began last week, looked in-depth at a number of issues, including both the city and JXN Water alleging the other owes it money.
A letter about billing issues a JXN Water customer sent to Rep. Fabian Nelson, a Democrat from Byram.
‘More than frustrating’
Henifin on Thursday discussed the city’s water debt, which as of October was $6.9 million. Most of that is from leaks at the Jackson Zoo, which should be fixed in the next two to three weeks, Jackson’s chief administrative officer Pieter Teeuwissen said.
But in the meantime, Henifin said, JXN Water has held “hostage” $6.3 million the utility owes the city in sanitation fees. Because residents pay for garbage pickup in the water bill, that money first goes to JXN Water. 
Wingate questioned the utility chief about withholding those funds. Henifin said JXN Water has spent the money to help keep its daily operations afloat. When the judge asked Henifin what authority allowed that power, he admitted he had “none.” The manager said the utility will pay back the city once Jackson pays its water debt. 
Teeuwissen and other city officials criticized JXN Water, saying not having sanitation revenue puts a strain on Jackson’s budget. Martin, the city attorney, said “it is more than frustrating” to hear Henifin withheld the funds without any authority.

JXN Water’s books and help from the Legislature
Horhn reaffirmed his stance Thursday against the proposed rate increase. The mayor is hopeful the state Legislature will work with him in the 2026 session to find other streams of revenue to invest into the water and sewer systems, and said it’s premature to raise rates before seeing what that may look like. 
Horhn offered several suggestions to lawmakers in October, such as raising the sales tax or diverting funds from the Capitol Complex Improvement District.
City officials also appealed to Wingate to allow access to JXN Water’s financial records, stating they couldn’t agree to a rate increase without having that information. 
While Henifin last week agreed to do so, he later asked to condition that access to prevent records from becoming public. Without context, he argued, it’d be easy for someone to misinterpret the numbers. The 2022 order gave Henifin the power to run the utility without being subject to public record laws. 
After initially pushing back on the conditions, the city said it would agree to a protection order preventing the records from becoming public without Henifin’s approval.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/06124621/Jackson-Water2-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-14 14:57:51.767846

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Following budget crises at several of its schools, the University of Louisiana System is studying how to restructure to minimize costs and maximize oversight. 
The system’s governing board voted Thursday to create a task force made up of university administrators, faculty, students and athletics officials from each of its nine universities. The group will look at ways to create shared services across the universities, implement a cross-system course numbering system and create long-term financial stability for college athletics. 
University of Louisiana System President Rick Gallot said he has been considering this plan since he took the job in 2023. 
The restructure is intended to give the system more power to deal with financial problems at its schools. In the past two years, the University of New Orleans and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette have had to dig themselves out of budget shortfalls, totalling $30 million and $25, respectively, that led to faculty and staff furloughs and layoffs. 
The University of Louisiana at Monroe has also had to deal with a $12 million budget shortfall but chose not to furlough any of its employees. 
Every university in the UL System is running a deficit in athletics, which are contributing significantly to the budget crunch at some schools. 
These fiscal problems largely snuck up on the system and its board members. 
“UNO was my alma mater, and I was on the board of supervisors, and somehow we didn’t know all that had gone wrong at UNO,” UL board member Julie Stokes said. 
In response to the budget crisis at UNO, the state legislature approved moving the school back to the LSU System, which it had been a part of until 2011. The switch is expected to take place in July. 
“I would say the same thing is true here, that the system by which we are managing these schools is not providing us adequate ability to supervise what’s happening at these schools,” Stokes said of ULL, which hosted Thursday’s meeting. 
Though it’s not yet known what actions the board will end up taking after receiving the task force report, if it decides to streamline services, such as human resources, accounting and IT, it is possible some people will lose their jobs. 
But Gallot encouraged those affected by any restructuring to participate in the study phase. The system will hold town halls about the process at each system university and put up a website to receive feedback, he said. 
The LSU System also announced its intent to restructure this month, although its process is very different. 
While the UL System will be going through a public process, LSU announced a rough outline of its new structure on Nov. 4, when it also hired a new president and chancellor, and said it would vote to finalize the plan within 30 days, without getting input from the public.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield agreed to pay New Jersey $100 million as part of a settlement to resolve claims that it made false statements to win a contract managing the state’s public worker health plans and then ignored a contractual provision so it could overcharge the public plans, prosecutors announced Friday. 
State officials say Horizon, which administers public plans that insure more than 750,000 state and local government workers and retirees, had ignored a provision in the 2020 contract that required it to charge the state the amount billed by a health care provider or an amount negotiated between the provider and Horizon, whichever is less.
But the insurer knew it could not comply with the provision before it bid into the contract and concealed that fact from state procurement officials, the Office of the Attorney General alleged. Then it ignored the provisions, submitting more than 1,000 false claims to the state alongside fraudulent records to support them, according to state prosecutors.
“At a time when everyone is rightly concerned about the cost of their health care, it is simply unacceptable that an insurance company would seek to defraud our State and overcharge us while driving up the costs of health care for hundreds of thousands of dedicated public servants,” Attorney General Matt Platkin said in a statement Friday.
The state said Friday the settlement is the largest non-Medicaid false claims settlement amount in state history. Horizon denies any wrongdoing, and the settlement does not include an admission of guilt.
The lesser-of provision was a new addition to the 2020 third-party administrator contract meant to reduce costs for the state’s public worker health plans, which are distressed following successive premium hikes and departures by local governments and schools.
The provision required Horizon to charge the state the amount billed by a provider or the amount negotiated between the provider and Horizon ahead of time, whichever was less. For example, if a doctor charged $300 for a visit but had negotiated a $600 cost with the insurer, the provision would bar Horizon from charging the state more than $300.
But the insurer ignored the requirement and even sent plan members documents that misstated the amount it charged the state for their health care, providing lower provider charges even when higher negotiated amounts were paid, prosecutors said in their lawsuit.
Horizon received nearly $500 million across nearly five years under that contract, state officials said. Along with Aetna, the insurer was chosen to act as a third-party administrator for the state plans in contracts awarded last year.
The firm has since begun complying with the lesser-of provision and ceased providing false documents to members, according to the settlement agreement.
A spokesperson for Horizon said Platkin mischaracterized the facts.
“This has never been anything more than a straightforward contract dispute, one that Horizon tried to resolve in good faith more than four years ago in the same way it has resolved similar disagreements over the course of our long and fruitful partnership with the State: through a negotiated reimbursement,” said Thomas Wilson, the spokesperson.
Horizon resolved the underlying issues in 2023, he said, and the payments in question accounted for just 0.07% of claims and less than 0.5% of the amounts paid to health care providers.
“While Horizon’s interpretation of one aspect of the contract differed from the State’s, the settlement makes clear Horizon never retained any portion of monies charged to the State for health care provider claims,” Wilson said. “Horizon paid claims we processed for the State according to the contracts in place with the doctors and hospitals filing those claims.”
In the settlement, Horizon denies overbilling or submitting false documents to the state, positions not shared by New Jersey or private individuals who initially lodged the suit.
The suit against the insurer was initially brought by a group of private individuals, called relators, who sued on behalf of the state under the New Jersey False Claims Act. That law imposes civil penalties on individuals or firms who knowingly make false claims for payments from the state.
The law allows private citizens to sue on the government’s behalf and keep a portion of the proceeds if the suit succeeds.
Five of the six relators who brought the suit will split $12 million from the settlement. They are former State Policemen’s Benevolent Association Executive Director Kevin Lyons, former state PBA President Pat Colligan, former PBA Executive Vice President Marc Kovar, and Mark and Vince Flores, co-founders of the health benefits consulting firm AVYM.
A sixth relator, former state assistant director of health benefits Christin Deacon, will not receive a share of the proceeds because she administered the 2020 contract and became aware of the insurer’s alleged conduct in the course of her work before leaving her position.
“The Division has been, and continues to be, laser-focused on enforcing its contracts and ensuring that our health benefits plans and our members are protected,” state Treasurer Liz Muoio said in a statement.
Of the remaining proceeds, $10 million will go to the state’s false claims prosecution fund — state law requires 10% of proceeds from false claims settlements to be deposited there — and the remaining $78 million will return to the state pension and benefits division.
As part of the settlement agreement, Horizon will submit to additional reporting of its claims data and finances, including daily access to its claims, quarterly reviews, and more fulsome monthly reporting.
The insurer is required to make the $100 million payment by Dec. 2. It must also pay $1.25 million in attorney fees to the relators and unspecified amounts to the state for the enforcement of the agreement.

(Illustration by Eric Thomas/Kansas Reflector)I root for the underdog.
Maybe you’re like me, urging a touchdown from a winless team or hoping for a goal from a cash-strapped squad. Sure, FanDuel says they will lose by six touchdowns — and that’s exactly why I’m cheering for them. I’m a sucker for it all: “Hoosiers” and Leicester City and the Miracle on Ice. 
To identify the underdogs, we create power rankings for baseball seasons that are months away, coaches’ polls in college football and even national rankings in high school soccer. On betting apps, we find underdogs through point spreads and win probabilities. 
All of that energy highlights the folly of prediction — attempting to compare teams that will never be in the same state, let alone the same tournament. “Who would win a lacrosse match between these two undefeated high school teams: one from Virginia and one from Texas?”
Nevertheless, see me there on the couch, fixated on the national rankings, pulling for the underdog and begging for a fourth quarter interception so that a team designated No. 19 will beat No. 18. What an inspiring story.
High school sports fuel my upset fever. I have been on the sidelines for countless games, camera in hand as a photojournalist, when plucky rural schools have spooked state-ranked all-star squads. It’s electric. 
In search of Cinderella in Kansas high school sports, I scoured this fall’s online playoff results for the Kansas State High School Activities Association. After charting more than 100 games and more than a dozen brackets, I’m still looking. 
This fall has been a blockbuster season for the favorites in Kansas high school sports, so far. In the three fall sports where KSHSAA provides seedings — girls tennis, boys soccer and football — the top-ranked teams are dominating in 2025. 
Let’s start with football, because … well, America demands it. 
For football, KSHSAA organizes the state brackets into east and west. There are 16 teams in each bracket for Class 1A through 6A. With two rounds complete, that means there have been 96 games in those classes so far. (I didn’t tabulate eight-player and six-player formats, since they use different seeding systems.)
In the first round, the top eight football seeds had 81 victories and 15 losses, winning almost 85 percent of games. More than half of the wins by lower-seeded teams were by No. 9 seeds beating No. 8 seeds — not the dramatic upset I wanted.
In the second round of the football playoffs, seeds No. 1 through 8 won 44 games. The bottom eight seeds? They won just four times. 
All 12 football No. 1 seeds from 1A to 6A have survived the first two rounds. For us underdog fans, we must search to find the scattered low seeds. 
If you think you’ve found an underdog in the 4A football bracket — the No. 13 seed — you will need to look closer. This low seed, Bishop Miege High School, is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. They have mauled their first two opponents, 57-7 in round one and 30-6 in round two. 
How did they earn such a low seed? A team’s winning percentage is the basis for KSHSAA football seedings. For Bishop Miege, that stat is misleading, the result of a challenging schedule filled with match-ups against larger schools, both from Kansas and Missouri. Sure, they lost often, but against 6A Blue Valley North and Rockhurst High School, the fifth best team in Kansas City. 
This is not a typical 3-5 football team. 
Miege often plays the postseason spoiler, frequently in the state basketball playoffs. The school draws a low seed after a handful of regular-season losses, and then they tear through playoff opponents with better seeds. It’s particularly cruel when Miege is underrated and they pick off a No. 1 seed in an early round, never to be challenged again on their run to a state championship.
If football can’t provide an underdog story, then what about Kansas high school soccer? 
Alas, the top eight seeds in KSHSAA soccer this year won even more often than the favorites in football, an almost 88% winning rate in the first two rounds. 
Only two teams seeded in the bottom eight escaped the second round. Both of them — No. 9 St. Thomas Aquinas and No. 11 Kansas City’s Piper — mimicked the resume of Bishop Miege in football. They hug the state line with Missouri and played punishing regular seasons in the metro area — a record that sunk their seedings. In the playoffs, they started strong. 
While not a low seed, No. 5 Shawnee Mission East made an even deeper run to the state final in Class 6A soccer with a similar formula. 
It’s stunning that KSHSAA’s seeding would be so reliable in predicting winners, particularly soccer. Scoring is lower in soccer, with far fewer goals in the sport than touchdowns in football or baskets in basketball. That leads to less-predictable outcomes in most soccer leagues. But in the Kansas high school soccer playoffs, the favorites kept winning. 
That leaves us with tennis, but I’m warning you. Shield your eyes, my fellow underdog softies. 
In four classifications this year, KSHSAA awarded both a singles championship and a doubles championship. That’s eight total champions. The No. 1 seed won seven of the eight brackets. 
The only “upset” was in 3A doubles, where the No. 2 seed Reygan Coonrod and Inarie Rippert of Ellsworth beat the No. 1 seed. 
Even the tennis semifinals were parades for the top seeds. The No. 1, 2 and 3 seeds in all eight tournaments advanced to the semis. In fact, the lowest seed to advance to the semis was No. 5 seed — hardly an underdog in a bracket that contained 24 competitors. 
This is a good time to admit this: When I started my KSHSAA research, I thought I would be writing about how inefficient the seeding systems were. How they fed all kinds of upsets because they relied strictly on winning percentage, as in football and soccer. I had my ire poised for the keyboard. 
Instead, it’s kudos to you, KSHSAA. With only a few Kansas schools providing upsets, your seeding was nearly undefeated.

November 2020 | Ken Coleman photoLet’s be blunt: Michigan Republicans, like their counterparts nationally, are no longer merely questioning elections. They are actively seeking to undermine them. 
Their latest maneuvers, calling for federal intervention by baselessly smearing Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s ability to fairly oversee elections to cheering President Donald Trump’s pardons of the state’s alleged false electors, reveal a party more invested in manufacturing distrust than in protecting democracy.
Put together, these moves are not isolated issues. They form a strategy: cast doubt, sow suspicion, and demand federal oversight, all the while shifting focus from governance to grievance.
The “conflict of interest” gambit
On Thursday, GOP leaders in the Michigan Legislature demanded that the U.S. Department of Justice step in and monitor the state’s 2026 elections because Benson might have a personal political stake — she’s running for governor — and therefore cannot be trusted to run elections impartially. 
But those who know how our elections work also know Michigan has a deeply decentralized system administered across 1,600+ local jurisdictions and that electoral oversight is routinely conducted with bipartisan monitors and observers. 
What’s happening here is not about transparency, it’s about casting suspicion.

Rather than offering credible evidence of wrongdoing, these Republicans are demanding a federal takeover of state elections under the guise of “protecting fairness.” 
That is opposite the principle of local control and further erodes public confidence. 
The optics of a state handing over election control to Washington, D.C., are antithetical to stated conservative principles valuing states’ rights over those not explicitly delineated to the federal government. 
The pardons of false electors
Furthering this attempt to undermine elections were the October pardons by Trump of 16 Michigan Republicans who allegedly signed on as a false slate of electors in 2020 in an effort to overturn the certified election results in the state. 
The pardons, which were wholly unnecessary after the charges were dismissed, undercuts faith in the very system Republicans insist they are defending.
It is breathtakingly hypocritical. 
Keep in mind that the Republicans charged in the false elector case were not exonerated. After having sat through hours of testimony in the case, it was clear to me that the evidence showed an attempt to try and overturn Joe Biden’s Electoral College win. 
But a poorly handled investigation and an overreaching prosecution ultimately left the judge little choice but to reject the charges.
When you pardon those who seemingly tried to subvert the system and were already cleared of any consequences, how do you then credibly say you’re working to protect the system?

Why this matters
The integrity of elections is built by process, by transparency, and by predictable rules. In that regard, Michigan is among the best, having been ranked second in the nation for election administration in 2024 by the Elections Performance Index. 
Released by the MIT Election Data and Science Lab, the report scored Michigan at 88% on the index, second only to New Mexico, which also scored 88%. The report noted Michigan had shorter wait times for voters, far fewer registration and absentee ballot issues than the national average and a much lower rate of unreturned mail ballots. Michigan was also higher than the national average in both voter turnout (59.3% compared to 47.5% nationally) and voter registration (91% compared to 84% nationally). 
Yet now, Republicans lawmakers seem fixated not on improving how we vote but on how they can discredit how we vote.
When political actors sow doubt in elections without credible evidence, they are not engaging in oversight — they are delegitimizing democracy. 
When they then demand federal intervention in a state process because they don’t like the referee, they are undermining the system of state-run elections that the U.S. Constitution guarantees.
State Republicans’ relentless refusal to accept the basic legitimacy of our voting system aren’t signs of vigilance; they’re warnings. 
If we continue down a path where power matters more than truth and sabotage masquerades as oversight, then the greatest threat to Michigan’s elections won’t come from foreign actors or technical glitches — it will come from those who claim to defend democracy while dismantling it from within.

Kyle Walker listens during a 2025 committee hearing. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Republican state Sen. Kyle Walker has announced his opposition to redrawing Indiana’s congressional maps despite his close ties with a leader of a pro-redistricting group.
Walker’s statement, which he first released Thursday, makes him the eighth Senate Republican to publicly come out against the push initiated by President Donald Trump for redistricting in Indiana and other GOP-led states.
“I’ve spent the past several months listening closely to my constituents on mid-decade redistricting,” Walker said. “With 93 percent opposed, and as their voice in the Indiana Senate, I’ll be voting no.”
Thirteen Republican senators have come out in support, but 19 of the 40-member caucus haven’t made their stances known publicly.


The following GOP senators have come out in support of redistricting:
Sen. Scott AlexanderSen. Ron AltingSen. Scott BaldwinSen. Liz BrownSen. Justin BuschSen. Gary ByrneSen. Chris GartenSen. Mike GaskillSen. Tyler JohnsonSen. Eric KochSen. Randy MaxwellSen. Daryl SchmittSen. Andy Zay

Walker is up for reelection next year in one of the state’s few politically close state Senate districts, covering the northeastern corner of Indianapolis and the Fishers area in Hamilton County. He won the 2022 election with 55% of the vote.
Walker’s opposition is notable because he is a member of the 24-person Indiana Republican Party State Committee as the party’s 7th Congressional District vice chair.
He is also executive vice president of MO Strategies, a political consulting firm that is led by Marty Obst.
Obst is the chair of Fair Maps Indiana, a nonprofit group that says it has launched a six-figure advertising effort targeting undecided Republican senators pushing for their support of redistricting. The campaign includes texts, digital, television and mail advertising.
Obst served in senior leadership roles in Trump’s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns and was a senior political adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence. 
Walker did not immediately reply Friday to a message from the Indiana Capital Chronicle seeking additional comment on his decision.
Indiana lawmakers are scheduled to meet starting Dec. 1 to consider drawing more Republican-leaning U.S. House districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections — following a months-long pressure campaign by Trump’s administration and his supporters.
Senate Republican leadership has said they do not yet have enough votes to pass a redistricting bill. Any new maps would need a majority of 26 senators or 25 with Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith breaking a tie in support.
Other Republican senators who’ve announced opposition to redistricting are: Eric Bassler, Vaneta Becker, Spencer Deery, Sue Glick, Jean Leising, Jim Tomes and Greg Walker. 
Enough House Republicans are believed to be supportive of a redistricting effort for it to win passage in that chamber.
Walker has, at times, broken with other Senate Republicans on prominent legislation.
For instance, he voted earlier this year against Senate Bill 289, which was signed into law prohibiting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in state government and public schools. He also voted against the 2022 bill that established the state’s near-total abortion ban.

You can read more about the section here.

When legislators talk about “school choice” and diverting public dollars to private schools, they often package it as empowering parents. But often overlooked in the conversation is that after years of underfunding and unfair criticism, Mississippi’s public education is seeing measurable success.
According to the latest Kids Count Data Book, Mississippi was ranked 16th in the nation for K-12 education. Our fourth graders have led the nation in reading and math gains on the National Assessment of Educational Progress rankings, and graduation rates have reached historic highs.
There are so many wonderful things happening in Mississippi public education. Now is not the time to pull away from a shared system that is working. Vouchers and unaccountable “choice” schemes threaten the progress of the many in favor of a few.

The adage “it takes a village to raise a child” has never been truer. Educators are not seeking to replace parents but to partner with them. Schools consistently plead for parents to be active participants in the educational process.
Public schools are our community’s schools, run by local boards, funded by taxpayers and accountable to the public. Suggesting that only private schools or home options are legitimate undermines our collective investment that ensures every child, regardless of income or zip code, has access to quality education.
Mississippi’s recent gains were not driven by privatization. The state directs a very small percentage of kindergarten–12 funding to private programs. Our progress stems from intentional public investments in early literacy, Pre-K expansion, teacher support, accountability and local district innovations.
Yet, Mississippi has chronically underfunded its schools. Since the Mississippi Adequate Education Program was created in 1997, legislators only fully funded it twice, leaving a cumulative shortfall exceeding $3.3 billion.
Even in 2023, despite revenue surpluses, education was shorted by $161 million. The newly created 2024 Mississippi Student Funding Formula provided roughly $50 million less than full MAEP funding would have delivered.
We cannot afford to carve public money away from schools already asked to do more with less. Each diverted dollar reduces resources for classrooms, support staff, fine arts programs, counselors, nurses and special education.
Who truly benefits — and who loses — when vouchers enter the system? These programs primarily serve affluent families already able to afford private school tuition. They cluster benefits in urban areas, where private schools are more abundant, leaving rural Mississippians with fewer options and underfunded local schools.
When voucher programs win, public-school students and their teachers lose — facing larger class sizes, fewer resources and diminished support in the classrooms where most Mississippi children learn.
Public schools are accountable through testing, audits and transparency. Voucher-funded schools, however, are rarely held to the same standards. Many select their students, exclude those with disabilities or cloak financials in privacy.
Public dollars deserve public oversight. If a school takes tax money, it should be held to the same accountability expectations as every Mississippi public classroom. 
Other states offer clear warnings. In Tennessee, voucher students underperformed compared to their public school peers. In Arkansas, costs ballooned and private schools hiked tuition, excluding low-income families. Louisiana’s choice expansion deepened budget gaps.
Mississippi should learn from these examples: When states funnel public money into private schooling, inequality grows while outcomes stagnate.
Rather than dividing limited resources, Mississippi should double down on what works.
We should:

Fully fund the Mississippi Student Funding Formula so districts can operate reliably.
Expand early literacy and math intervention programs.
Support teacher recruitment, retention and development, particularly in rural areas.
Strengthen support for special education, fine arts education, counseling and technology.
Encourage innovation through magnet programs, dual enrollments and career tech centers within public systems.

Proponents of vouchers call “choice” freedom, but real freedom is not abandoning public responsibility. It is building a society where every child, regardless of income or geography, can attend a great public school.
Mississippi’s progress proves what collective investment can achieve. We should not dismantle progress with policies that favor the few. Public dollars belong in public schools.
The real choice before us is simple: a future where all children succeed, or one where some succeed at the expense of others. That’s a choice we must not accept and must do our due diligence to fight against.

Brown/Florida Phoenix)A Florida Republican has re-filed a measure to penalize local governments attempting to remove or destroy Confederate monuments and other historic memorials.
HB 496 by Sen. Stan McClain, an Ocala Republican, demands the state protect “each historic Florida monument or memorial from removal, damage, or destruction.” It’s the fourth time this bill has been introduced in successive legislative sessions as part of a broader conservative response to the nationwide movement to down or rename Confederate statues.
“The Legislature finds that an accurate and factual history belongs to all Floridians and future generations and that the state has an obligation to protect and preserve such history,” the bill reads.
Sen. Stan McClain via Florida House
Local government officials who try to take down the monuments would be fined up to $1,000, and could open themselves to lawsuits by either the group that helped maintain or erect the memorial or any Floridian who regularly uses it for “remembrance purposes.” A court could award the suing party damages up to $100,000.
The push to remove Confederate images emerged in 2015, after white supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine Black people in the Mother Emanuel AME Church a in Charleston, South Carolina. Roof had posed multiple times with a Confederate battle flag leading up to the mass shooting. From 2015 to 2018, roughly 110 Confederate memorials were removed nationwide. In addition, the state stopped flying the Confederate flag over the State House.
Hillsborough County was one of the first local governments in Florida to act following that incident, with the county commission voting later that summer to remove a Confederate flag that had hung in its county center, the Phoenix previously reported.
The Florida Legislature voted in 2016 to remove a statue of Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith that represented Florida in the U.S. Capitol, and again in 2018 to replace it with a statue of Mary McLeod Bethune, known for starting a private college for African American students in Daytona Beach that would become Bethune-Cookman College.
The removal push was reinvigorated in 2020 after George Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white police officer; nationally, 168 monuments were nixed that year alone, which eventually sparked the counter-movement to keep the statues seen in Florida.
In 2023, Florida Republicans first attempted to pass the measure to ban historic monuments being removed, damaged, or destroyed. Similar measures were introduced in the 2024 and 2025 sessions, but each failed before reaching either the House or Senate floors. As of 2024, Florida still had 73 of these monuments existing statewide.
Sen. McClain’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The 2026 session begins on Jan. 13.

Preventing food waste by producing, buying and serving only what is needed is the best way, according to the study, to reduce food waste. 
Other methods it identified include donating or upcycling food before it goes bad, feeding it to animals and livestock, composting food scraps or putting them through an anaerobic digestion system and applying the product to the land. 
Some of these solutions, according to the report, can be implemented in the near future while others have a longer start-up time, or require changes in state and local policies.

The food waste problem 
DNR determined in a 2022 study of landfill materials that food waste, comprising unsold food from stores, table scraps, uneaten prepared food, kitchen trimmings and byproducts from food and beverage processing facilities, was the number one material in Iowa landfills. 
The same study found that 19% of landfill material in Iowa is loose or packaged food waste. Of the average 200 pounds of food per year per person that Iowans dispose of at home, 25% is still packaged. When including commercial food waste into the calculation, Iowans dispose of 300 pounds of food waste, per person, per year. 
The Iowa rate is lower than the average rate for the U.S., which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates is between 492 to 1,032 pounds per person per year. 
EPA also estimates the average family throws away about $3,000 worth of food, or 11% of household food expenditures, annually. 
Further, the study said food waste emits air pollutants as it sits in solid waste landfills. 
Suggested solutions
The best way to reduce food waste that ends up in landfills is to manage the amount of waste in homes and businesses. 
The study suggests that at home, residents: eat their leftovers, keep track of the items in their refrigerators and pantries, plan meals, be creative with meals to use what is about to spoil, store food properly and purchase in quantities that can be consumed before they spoil. 
Restaurants can audit their waste streams and adjust their menus, wholesale orders and portion sizes to reduce food waste.

The study points out that while households and commercial businesses throw out food, 1 in 8 Iowans face food insecurity. 
Food banks and food pantries often receive donations from grocery stores or wholesalers of food that is about to pass its expiration date, which can be one way of  reducing food waste. 
The study surveyed six food-rescue organizations in Iowa, including Food Bank of Iowa, which accepted more 26 million pounds of rescue food in 2023 to be distributed across its 55-county region. 
The surveyed organizations identified that the majority of this food is able to be used and given out at food pantries, though the process presents some barriers. It’s difficult to always provide culturally relevant foods and some stores are reluctant to donate their food for fear of being held liable for accidentally donating spoiled food. 
Based on the information gleaned from the study, DNR recommends the state improve education and training strategies around food donation, establish requirements for certain businesses to donate food and increase tax credits available for donating food.  
Composting is another strategy for reducing food waste.
The study found that in 2024, approximately 2,925 tons of food waste were managed with composting in Iowa. 
This means, per the study, that most facilities are operating “well below” permitted limits and that the state’s composting capacity is “not being fully utilized.” 
Surveyed facilities cited permitting, contamination due to the inclusion of non-compostable items like glass or plastic, and cost as the major limiting factors to increasing compost capacity.
Solutions presented by the study include: legislative requirements to compost food for certain businesses, partnerships to purchase or rent composting equipment, grants and incentives to pre-process food waste. 
Once food scraps are composted, the study found that waste facilities generally do not have a hard time selling the compost to homeowners, businesses and farmers that want to apply the nutrient-rich product to their fields and gardens. 
Similar to composting, anaerobic digestion also breaks down food scraps into a usable product: biogas. 
According to the study, some Water Resource Recovery Facilities in Iowa pull organic material from wastewater streams and process it via anaerobic digestion. Of the nine sites surveyed by the study, four use the produced biogas onsite for things like heating boilers and electricity generation, while others sold the biogas. 
The study suggests greater development, marketing and procurement of the practice at facilities in the state to help manage food waste. 
The study points out that composting facilities and wastewater facilities with anaerobic digestion are concentrated to areas of higher population in the state, which means some regions don’t have access to these processes. There are only five composting facilities in Iowa and three water resource recovery facilities that accept food waste.
DNR noted that residents and businesses can add smaller compost or anaerobic digestion infrastructure on site or in their backyards to help reduce food waste that ends up in a landfill.
Another solution the study suggested is the implementation of a “sharing table” at schools. This practice has been implemented in other states and allows students to put their un-opened packaged food on a table in the cafeteria to be donated, rather than tossing it in the garbage.
The study also called for greater education in schools around food waste, and incentives to businesses that implement food reduction efforts. 
DNR said it plans to continue to measure food waste in Iowa to “to assess effectiveness of the State’s efforts to reduce food waste.”
The study was funded through an EPA Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling grant.

Drinking rates in the U.S. in 2025 are at their lowest point since 1958, according to a Gallup poll.
The report says that from 1997 to 2023, at least 60% of Americans reported drinking alcohol at least occasionally. That number is now 54%.
Pollsters say it coincides with research highlighting health risks with any level of drinking, in contrast with earlier studies that found health benefits with moderate drinking.
Gallup has been tracking Americans’ drinking habits annually since 1939, and the drinking rate has only been under 60% eight times.
This shift in drinking habits is mainly being seen among younger generations. In 2001, 72% of young adults aged 18 to 34 reported drinking alcohol. That number is now at 50%.
Other demographics that have shown the highest decline include: Republicans, households making less than $40,000 or more than $100,000, white adults and women.

(Photo by Getty Images)A third lawsuit has been filed against Iowa’s insurance commissioner over the legality of a new state law regulating pharmacy benefit managers.
A group of insurance companies argue Senate File 383, signed into law earlier this year, “upends the prescription-drug coverage that Iowans receive and prevents health-benefit plans from communicating cost-saving information about one pharmacy over another.” The lawsuit claims federal law preempts that sort of “interference,” and the First Amendment prohibits the law’s restrictions on free speech.
The lawsuit was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa by OptumRx, a pharmacy benefit manager headquartered in Minnesota, and by several insurance providers or health plan administrators with which it contracts: United HealthCare Services, UMR Inc., UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company, UnitedHealthcare Plan of the River Valley, and Golden Rule Insurance Company.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Two previous lawsuits challenging the legality of Senate File 383 have already paused enforcement of parts of the law.
In July, Chief U.S. District Judge Stephanie Rose concluded that significant portions of the new law are most likely illegal and invalid and preliminarily enjoined the law’s enforcement against the plaintiffs in that particular case – the Iowa Association of Business and Industry.
In October, Rose blocked the law’s enforcement in a separate but similar case brought by Wellmark Blue Cross-Blue Shield, Iowa’s largest health insurer. In that case, Rose issued a temporary injunction pausing the imposition of a $10.68 dispensing fee for prescriptions filled at pharmacies in Iowa under Wellmark covered plans and policies.
The new law restricts PBMs’ ability to set certain cost-sharing rates and fees intended to incentivize a person to fill their prescription at a particular pharmacy. The law also requires independent pharmacies to be reimbursed at the average national acquisition cost of a drug plus a $10.68 dispensing fee.
The law is backed by the owners of many small and rural pharmacies, but is opposed by some business leaders and health insurance companies who argue that while it provides more money for small pharmacies it does so at the expense of Iowa consumers.

ABI has warned the measure could result in an additional $340 million in costs for private-sector health insurance plans, resulting in an increase of $169 for the average insured Iowans’ pharmaceutical costs each year.
Iowa’s insurance commissioner, Doug Ommen, has appealed the injunction issued in the ABI case to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and ABI has filed a cross-appeal. Both appeals are still pending.
New lawsuit cites decision in ABI case
In the newly filed lawsuit brought by OptumRx and its business partners, the plaintiffs allege Senate File 383 adds “far-reaching, draconian and expensive new measures” to Iowa law, and they are seeking an injunction halting enforcement of the new law. They also argue the new law is preempted by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Citing the district court’s reasoning in the ABI case, the plaintiffs in the new lawsuit argue that Ommen cannot legitimately enforce Senate File 383 against the many entities who aren’t parties to the ABI lawsuit.
They note that shortly after the injunction was issued in the ABI case, the commissioner opted to forgo enforcement of the new law against OptumRx, UHS, UMR, UHIC, UHC River Valley and Golden Rule. “But the situation has changed,” the lawsuit states, alleging that on Sept. 24, 2025, the commissioner issued a bulletin to all pharmacy benefit managers announcing his intent to enforce the law against all entities that were not part of ABI’s case, asserting he was “obligated” to do so.
“Senate File 383 financially harms not just the plaintiffs but also the Iowans that they serve,” the lawsuit claims. “Further, the commissioner’s enforcement of SF 383 wastes resources, carries potential monetary penalties, and risks plaintiffs’ licensure in the State of Iowa.”
The lawsuit seeks, “at a minimum,” the same injunctive relief already afforded to the parties in the ABI case.
The office of the insurance commissioner has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.

The board Thursday approved changes to requirements for directors in the Child Nutrition Program. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Board of Education Thursday approved changes to the requirements for hiring directors for the state’s Child Nutrition Program.
The changes would require candidates to have a high school diploma; three years of food service management experience, state approved training and a level four certificate from the School Nutrition Association.
Previously, a child nutrition program director had to have a bachelor’s degree in food and nutrition, food service management, or home economics; a minimum of 1,400 hours in compensated food management or an approved alternative, and 15 hours of professional development.
According to State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey, the previous requirements were set by the federal government. That led to criticisms from state school districts, especially rural ones.
“For many years, going back before I was in this role, in my last role, we had complaints about the rules being so strict that we in many of our school districts, especially rural counties, could not find people who met the qualifications,” Mackey said. “Qualifications were set by the US Department of Agriculture, so we couldn’t do anything about that. But in 2025 the agriculture department really relaxed their rules and gave states more flexibility, and our board immediately picked that up.”
Mackey said the changes would “allow more people to be able to join our child nutrition management team.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0243-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-14 12:57:07.875626

Credit: Related DigitalRyan Friedrichs, a vice president for the company pushing the controversial AI data center project in Saline Township, and the husband of Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, would recuse himself from any projects before the state if Benson is elected governor in 2026.
That said, the company stopped short of saying that Friedrichs would leave his post at the company, which is owned by one of Benson’s larger donors. Whether Friedrichs stepping down or stepping away from the company would resolve the conflict remains an open question for the state’s voters in the August 2026 primary, or the general election should Benson move on to the fall contest.
Questions about a potential conflict of interest between Friedrichs, Benson and Related Companies, the parent corporation of Related Digital, which is developing the data center, came to the fore after Michigan Advance and others reported that the secretary of state’s husband held a high-ranking position in the company and was involved in its past lobbying work.
Michigan’s Benson has familial, professional ties to company pushing data center project in Saline

Benson is one of the leading contenders in the gubernatorial race, and not just on the Democratic primary side. Friedrichs recently terminated his lobbying license as Benson geared up to run for governor.
Still, the connection raised concerns about whether Benson could be impartial and free from influence given that Related Digital has such a large business interest before the state. The matter not only concerned her husband, but also one of her billionaire donors and professional connections: Stephen Ross, the owner of Related Companies.
The Advance asked Related Companies on Wednesday whether Friedrichs would step down from his position in the company if Benson were to win the August 2026 primary, secure the Democratic Party nomination and eventually go on to win the general election in the fall.
A company spokesperson said that they would respond to the inquiry but did not do so on Wednesday evening.
Benson’s campaign indicated to the Advance on Thursday morning that Friedrichs would indeed step aside from any state business the company might have if the secretary of state ascended to the highest seat in Michigan government next year.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
On Thursday afternoon, Kathleen Anne Corless, vice president of Corporate Communications for Related Companies, confirmed that Friedrichs would do so if Benson was elected governor.
“This is the largest economic investment in Michigan’s history – Ryan has been a valued member of our team working on community and stakeholder engagement,” Corless said via email. “Our plan is to begin full construction at the end of this year, and regardless of who wins the governor’s race and is sworn in come January 2027, we are not aware of any aspects of the project that would then be before the new administration for consideration.”
Corless went on to say that Related Companies has “strict conflict of interest policies,” and “of course Ryan would then recuse himself from any projects before the state.”
The project is also prohibited from future expansion, making a conflict of interest less likely. But even with Friedrichs out of the picture, any future state business involving Ross’ Related Companies during a potential Benson governorship could still raise conflict of interest questions.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire Republicans are again trying to eliminate a series of programs across state government they consider to be part of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.
During the last legislative session, lawmakers debated eliminating the state’s Office of Health Equity and the Department of Environmental Services’ civil rights and environmental justice programs, as well as forbidding the governor from ever re-creating the now-disbanded Governor’s Advisory Council on Diversity and Inclusion. That bill failed, but as a compromise lawmakers renamed the Office of Health Equity to the Office of Health Access in the budget legislation. Additionally, lawmakers enacted a ban on state agencies engaging in diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.
2025’s bill was spearheaded by Republicans like Rep. Mike Belcher, who called diversity programs “evil” and said at the time they “ought to be considered unlawful and unconstitutional.” However, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, where the Office of Health Access (then the Office of Health Equity) is housed, said the offices are merely meant to allow people with disabilities, people learning to speak English, or others to access state services they’re legally entitled to. Many Republicans argued this isn’t actually DEI, while Democrats said the work was important regardless of whether it was DEI.
In addition to helping blind, deaf, or English language learners obtain state services, the Office of Health Access operates the federally funded refugee resettlement program — which helps new Americans find employment, health care, and social services — and community engagement efforts to understand what health barriers exist in the state. The Department of Environmental Services’ civil rights and environmental justice programs work to ensure the department is in compliance with federal laws like the 1965 Civil Rights Act and the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. The Governor’s Advisory Council on Diversity and Inclusion was disbanded during the transition from former Gov. Chris Sununu to current Gov. Kelly Ayotte after her November 2024 election victory. Ayotte told the Bulletin in February she had no plans to resurrect it.
Rep. Yury Polozov, a Hooksett Republican, introduced the same bill ahead of the 2026 session. Polozov said during Wednesday’s House Health and Human Services Committee meeting that the state’s ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs might make parts of the bill unnecessary, “but the underlying message and underlying intention of this bill is crucial for our state.” He said he believes there’s a group of legislators willing to work on floor amendments to adjust the bill.
Health and Human Services Associate Commissioner Ann Landry said if the bill went into effect as written, the department would simply move the functions of the eliminated offices to other offices because they’re required by federal law.
“All the functions have to remain for us to be successful at DHHS,” Landry said, “Either because we’re federally required or required by state law, or it’s a really important part of our engagement with the rural communities and actually all communities across the state.”
John Williams, director of legislative affairs for the department, told lawmakers that 2025’s bill was one in “a very small percent of bills” that the department “actually actively opposed.” He said it was similarly opposed to the bill passing in 2026.
Rep. Mark McLean, a Manchester Republican, called the bill “problematic” but said he was going to vote for it “out of respect” for Polozov. He said if it isn’t amended before a floor vote, he will vote against it there.
Rep. Lucy Weber, a Walpole Democrat, said, “It makes no sense to me to vote yes on a bill that we all agree is fundamentally flawed.”
“I would prefer an ITL (inexpedient to legislate) motion,” she said ahead of her no vote. “If somebody thinks they can fix the bill between now and the time we meet, the remedy would be to vote ITL on the bill as it stands, but bring an amendment that could be considered on the floor.”
The committee voted 9-8 to recommend the entire House pass the bill.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/healthaccess-1024x630.jpg,,,2025-11-14 11:58:51.002434

(Stock photo via Getty Images)In South Carolina, a nurse practitioner’s level of autonomy depends not on training or competence, but on where they work.
At the Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic where I practice, I can deliver autonomous care. Four years ago, when I worked in private practice, that same level of care required a written practice agreement with a collaborating physician.
The South Carolina Nurse Practice Act was amended in 2018 to replace the term “supervising” with “collaborating” physician, an important but limited step toward modernizing nurse practitioner regulation.
There were also changes to where nurse practitioners could practice in relation to the collaborating physicians and some changes in prescriptive authority. The state still requires formal practice agreements that restrict nurse practitioners from working to the full extent of their education and licensure.
In contrast, in 2016 the Veterans Health Administration granted full practice authority to nurse practitioners nationwide. This policy was designed to increase access to care, improve efficiency, and address provider shortages.
Within the Veterans Affairs system, I provide care independently while collaborating naturally with physicians, pharmacists, and mental health professionals as part of a multidisciplinary team.
Collaboration occurs because it benefits patients, not because it is required by regulation.
Nurse practitioners are not seeking to replace physicians but to complement them within the health care system. My own professional path included 16 years as a registered nurse before becoming a nurse practitioner.
While new graduates benefit from supervision and mentorship, long-term restrictions do not enhance safety. Instead, they create unnecessary administrative barriers and delay patient care.
According to the Commonwealth Fund’s 2023 State Health System Performance Scorecard, South Carolina ranked 37th nationally for overall health system performance, based on access, quality, and efficiency.
Research consistently shows that states granting full practice authority to nurse practitioners perform better on these same measures. Expanding practice authority allows for more efficient use of the health care workforce, particularly in rural and underserved communities.
Granting nurse practitioners full practice authority would not drastically change daily practice for most providers. It would simply streamline administrative requirements.
Removing the need for a collaborating physician’s name on nurse practitioner licenses and allowing independent prescribing of certain medications would save time for both nurse practitioners and physicians, allowing all providers to focus more on patient care.
South Carolina faces the same workforce and access challenges as many states, with growing health care demands and a shortage of primary care physicians.
Allowing nurse practitioners to practice to the full scope of their licensure is a proven strategy to expand access, maintain quality, and improve health outcomes.
Modernizing these regulations is not about changing who provides care, it’s about ensuring South Carolinians can receive the care they need, when and where they need it.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nurse-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-14 11:58:51.002434

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s second attempt to grow its offshore wind portfolio is dead in the water.
Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, confirmed in an email to Rhode Island Current Friday morning that the company ended its negotiations with SouthCoast Wind to purchase power from the project. 
The news comes more than a year after Rhode Island officials unveiled a tentative contract with SouthCoast Wind developers to buy 200 megawatts of electricity from the project planned south of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket. Negotiations finalizing the deal stalled multiple times due to a series of setbacks by the Trump administration, including revocation of a key federal permit for the project.
Dalo cited the federal uncertainty facing the offshore wind industry as reason for the cutoff of contract negotiations.
“After several [power purchase agreement] negotiation extensions and continued uncertainty in the offshore wind industry, we were unable to come to agreeable terms” Dalo said in his email. “We remain fully supportive of the offshore wind industry and look forward to future clean energy [sic] opportunities as the industry evolves.”
 He did not immediately respond to follow-up questions including when the deal was officially cast aside. The latest deadline, Nov. 1, came and went with no public acknowledgement from either party on the status of the talks.
SouthCoast Wind also did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Friday. 
The 149-turbine project, proposed 60 miles south of Rhode Island, was also under tentative contract with Massachusetts utility companies to buy the rest of the 1,200 megawatts of nameplate capacity. Massachusetts officials worked in concert with Rhode Island and Connecticut to leverage bulk buying power in a first-of-its-kind tri-state solicitation for projects — even scheduling their contract negotiations to coincide with Rhode Island’s timeline.
The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources did not immediately respond to questions on the status of its contract negotiations Friday.
The deal, if finalized, would have been the second offshore wind project providing power to Rhode Island, providing enough electricity to power 125,000 homes if operating at full capacity. It follows the state’s contract for 400 megawatts of electricity from the Revolution Wind project, now nearing the end of construction in Rhode Island Sound. Environmental advocates and state energy leaders have touted the benefits of wind-powered electricity to stabilize the regional electric grid while helping meet Rhode Island’s decarbonization mandates, including the Act on Climate Law of 2021.
Gov. Dan McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Friday.
But the nascent offshore wind industry has faced headwinds under the Trump administration, which halted federal reviews on offshore wind projects on Trump’s first day in office. Setbacks mounted as federal regulators then set their sights on projects already past the federal approval stage, including Revolution Wind, which faced a monthlong pause in August that was later overturned by a federal judge’s order. 
Meanwhile, federal regulators sought to revoke key permits for other projects, including the construction and operations plan for SouthCoast Wind granted in the waning days of the Biden administration.
On the same day a federal judge in D.C. granted the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s request to pull back the permit for SouthCoast, Rhode Island energy regulators authorized the project developer’s request for a license to run underwater transmission lines up the Sakonnet River and out Mount Hope Bay. However, the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board’s unanimous approval on Nov. 4 was conditioned upon the project receiving all federal and state approvals.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-14 16:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The ranks of unaffiliated CT voters are growing,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/14/ct-unaffiliated-voters/,The number of registered Democrats is dropping in Connecticut as more voters have chosen to register without a political party.,"The number of registered Democrats is dropping in Connecticut as more voters have chosen to register without a political party.
The Democratic share of Connecticut voters dropped almost 2 percentage points since 2020, the Republican portion increased 0.7 percentage points, and voters unaffiliated with any party increased by 1%. 
But Democratic candidates aren’t necessarily losing votes as the party loses registrants — made clear after Democrats flipped control of 28 towns and cities in the Nov. 4 election.
Across the nation, more voters are straying away from political parties. According to Gallup polls, a record 43% of people across the nation self-identified as independent in both 2023 and 2024. Since 2000, the number of self-identifying independents has only reached 43% one other time — in 2014.
But within the state, towns and cities are split on this change. Just under half of towns saw a decrease in the percentage of all voters who were unaffiliated, while a little more than half saw an increase.
For Republican and Democratic registration, though, this is not the case. Nearly every town in the state saw a decrease in registered Democrats 2024 to 2025, with many seeing percent changes of over 1% in just one year.
Republicans got a big bump in party registration — accounting for 0.8% more of all registered voters 2023 to 2025. More than 100 towns saw percent increases in registered Republicans 2024 to 2025, and cities like Hartford and New Haven saw the largest percent increases, following a larger state-wide trend.
More than 20 towns held municipal primaries in 2025, which can affect party registration trends.
Despite having closed primaries, Connecticut is one of ten states that has a higher percent of unaffiliated voters than Democrats or Republicans, as of August 2025 data from Ballotpedia.
While the Republican party is gaining registrants state-wide, only two towns have more registered Republicans than any other party. Most towns had a plurality of unaffiliated voters, but in many places, registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters are neck in neck.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/D4SC7-the-share-of-unaffiliated-ct-voters-has-been-growing--1024x672.png,,,2025-11-14 11:58:51.002434

(Photo courtesy of Northlands Rescue Mission)Most North Dakotans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could see their full November benefits restored as early as Monday, according to the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday it would release the funding for most SNAP recipients within 24 hours of the federal government reopening.
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services in a Thursday evening announcement said it was working to get benefits out to residents as soon as possible, but that system updates were pending and it did not have a firm timeline. 
Households that received partial SNAP benefits last week will get the remaining amount, while households that have yet to receive any funding this month will get full benefits, the department said.
“We’re grateful for the full SNAP benefits that support nearly 56,000 North Dakotans,” Pat Traynor, the agency’s interim commissioner, said in the announcement. “The pause revealed the strength of our communities — neighbors, businesses, and organizations stepped up with compassion and resilience.”
Air travel, SNAP benefits, back pay at issue as federal government slowly reopens

The program started the month without funding due to the federal government shutdown, which ended Wednesday night after 43 days.
Partial benefits became available in North Dakota last week after the federal government released 65% of the funding under the order of a federal judge.
While that judge ultimately ordered the executive branch to administer full benefits, President Donald Trump’s administration was appealing the ruling at the time the federal government reopened.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s office earlier this month granted $915,000 in state funds to the Great Plains Food Bank to address food insecurity during the shutdown while funding for SNAP remained uncertain.
Great Plains Food Bank spokesperson Darby Njos said the nonprofit expects to distribute 3.5 million pounds of food in November and December — about a 60% increase in the amount of food it usually distributes to food pantries around the state.
She said even though SNAP will soon be restored, the food bank expects to see high demand for food assistance to continue.
“We’re seeing consistently strong turnouts at our mobile food pantries, at our pop-up pantries, and our partner food pantries have been reporting heavy, consistent usage,” Njos said.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)More than a dozen people voiced their concerns over the latest proposed health insurance rate hikes for West Virginia state employees during a public hearing in Charleston, West Virginia, Thursday evening. 
Seventeen people spoke during a two-hour public hearing held by the Public Employees Insurance Agency finance board at the Culture Center.
Most called on state lawmakers to work with the PEIA board to find a solution for state employees’ rising health insurance costs. 
“I’m asking you: let’s have these conversations,” Joe White, executive director of the West Virginia School Service Personnel Association, told the PEIA finance board. “This can be fixed. That’s my ask. A simple ask. This is real numbers, this is real lives, this is real people.”
White read the PEIA finance board an example of a teacher taking home less pay than they did in previous years because of increases in health insurance costs and a lack of raises. 
“Our folks are working, some of them for free,” White said. “… I tried to Google today what job do you have where you make less money a year after 10 years. Google can’t even give me an answer. Folks are hurting.”
PEIA officials have proposed increasing premiums by 3% for state and non-state employees and employers, and for retirees during fiscal year 2027, which begins in July.
For state employees, a monthly spousal surcharge would increase by an average of $200 per month. The surcharge is for families that have a spouse who chose a PEIA plan despite having the option of a health insurance plan offered by their own employer. 
PEIA officials say they’re bound by the law to make the surcharge the actual cost of the plan. 
Non-state agencies would be required to have at least half of their employees enrolled in a PEIA health plan. 
The proposed rate hikes are not as steep as the increases that went into effect in July, when premiums went up by 14% for state employees, by 16% for local government workers and by 12% for retirees. Out-of-pocket and copay costs also went up. 
Jerry Throckmorton, a Kanawha County teacher for more than 30 years, called the PEIA rate hikes a crisis that could lead to people leaving the teaching profession. 
“If we don’t solve this problem with people retired making less money, people that see their paychecks and they’re making less than they did the year before, that’s going to cause a massive exodus of people,” he said. “We can barely find people to fill slots now.”
He said lawmakers, the governor and the PEIA board should work together to come up with solutions for the crisis. He worries that the younger generation of teachers will disappear.
“Those are the people that will provide the future of the state,” Throckmorton said. “And if we let those people move on to something else because of all these issues, then how will we make West Virginia better?” 
Kanawha County Commissioner Natalie Tennant said the majority of county workers are on a PEIA plan that would increase by 5% next year under the board’s proposal. She noted that according to the agency’s five-year plan, those workers will see a “worrisome” 14% increase in fiscal year 2028. 
Tennant said commissioners approved a 6% pay increase for county workers, the first in three years, that would be eaten if their PEIA rates increase by 5%. 
Increased health care costs affect employee household budgets and the county’s ability to recruit and retain employees, she said. 
“We all know how challenging it is to find and keep skilled public safety workers,” Tennant said. “When benefits become less affordable, good people leave, and when they leave, we just don’t lose employees. You know this — we lose experience. It takes six months to train somebody, right? So we’re behind in training and continuity of services that our citizens depend on.”
Chad Francis, a representative of the United Mine Workers of America, called the premium increases “punishments.”
“[They’re] penalties against the very people who keep West Virginia running: our teachers, our nurses, our highway workers, state troopers and every civil servant who shows up day after day to serve this state,” Francis said. “Let’s be clear about what’s being proposed, a 3% increase in premiums, on top of inflation, stagnant wages and the rising cost of living, a $200 hiking in the spousal penalty, because apparently, being married to someone with employer coverage is now a taxable offense.”
PEIA leaders have said that the rising cost of health care — particularly inflation on prescription GLP-1 drugs that treat obesity and diabetes — are a major driver of the rate increases.
Leaders have also pointed to a report from the firm BDO that indicated that the sharp rate increases that public workers have had in recent years had been caused in large part because between the years 2018-2022, rates had been frozen. Former Gov. Jim Justice had vowed not to increase the rates during his time as the state’s chief executive.
The series of public hearings will continue in Morgantown Monday and will conclude with a virtual public hearing via Google Meet at 6 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 20.
The PEIA finance board is expected to vote on the proposed increases at its next meeting, slated for Dec. 4.

If this Saturday’s Florida-Ole Miss football game were a bowl game, we all know what its name would be: The Lane Kiffin Bowl. That’s because the worst kept secret in college football is that Florida has zeroed in on Kiffin to be its next head coach.
And, in keeping with the corporate sponsorship of bowl games these days – as in the Allstate Sugar Bowl, Goodyear Cotton Bowl and the Rose Bowl presented by Prudential – I’ve got the perfect name for this one: The Lane Kiffin Bowl, presented by Jimmy Sexton.
Rick Cleveland
Sexton, of course, is Lane Kiffin’s agent. He also represents coaches named Nick Saban, Kirby Smart, Kalen DeBoer, Steve Sarkisian, Mike Norvell, James Franklin, Hugh Freeze and a host of others. He has negotiated hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts for both coaches and athletes so he could easily fund the bowl game sponsorship. He is the Babe Ruth of sports agents. And you know he is loving Saturday’s Lane Kiffin Bowl (6 p.m. kickoff, Vaught-Hemingway Stadium).
Sexton also loves the fact that coaching vacancies exist at LSU and Auburn. The more the merrier, you know. So get your calculators out, and let the bidding begin. You get college football blue bloods Florida and LSU involved in a bidding war and no telling how high the bids will go. 
The fact Ole Miss is a 16.5-point favorite over Florida on Saturday tells you all you need to know about why the demand for Kiffin’s services is so high. Florida has won three national championships and eight SEC Championships since 1990. Ole Miss hasn’t won so much as an SEC division championship in that same period.
Yet, in his six seasons at Ole Miss, the 50-year-old Kiffin has guided the Rebels to 53 victories against just 19 defeats. Perhaps more impressively, his Ole Miss teams are 13 games over .500 in the SEC. Compare that to Tommy Tuberville, who was 12 games below .500 in the SEC when he left Ole Miss in 1998 to take the Auburn job. (Sexton was Sen. Tuberville’s agent, too.)
Little wonder Florida wants Kiffin. Gator fans look at Kiffin and see Steve Spurrier 35 years ago. They see a brash, visor-wearing, offensive-minded coach whose wide receivers always seem to run wide open through opponents’ defenses. They see what Kiffin has done at Ole Miss and can only imagine what he might do at Florida.
Ole Miss enters Saturday’s game at 8-1 and No. 7 in the college football playoff rankings. This has the potential to be the greatest season in Rebel football history. But at a time when everyone who bleeds red and blue should be focused on beating Florida, many are instead worried sick about losing their coach. Keep in mind, they have been down this road before.
The Rebels were 8-1 and ranked No. 11 about this time in 2022. The Auburn job was open then and various news reports had Kiffin headed for the Plains. And you know what happened next. Ole Miss, a clearly distracted football team, lost four straight games.
Eventually, Kiffin stayed at Ole Miss. The Rebels have won 30 games in the nearly three seasons since. Ole Miss has given Kiffin everything he has asked for – beyond a salary of  about $9.5 million per year. Ole Miss supporters are bankrolling a football NIL budget of more than $20 million a year and an assistant coaches salary pool of more than $8 million a year.
We could debate forever which is the better job. Five years ago, I would have said Florida, hands down. But not now. The transfer portal and NIL have changed everything in college football. Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter, NIL guru Walker Jones and, yes, Kiffin have been on the cutting edge in all that. 
Florida, with a bigger stadium, is located in a much larger state amid much more football talent. But with all that comes higher expectations. Remember, Dan Mullen won 60% of his games in nine seasons at Mississippi State and then took the Florida job. He won nearly 70% of his games in four seasons with the Gators – and got his butt fired.
Kiffin could end all that speculation and avoid a repeat of 2022, Instead, in a press conference earlier this week he added fuel to the fire. “There are still advantages for the traditional ‘blue bloods,’” Kiffin said. “Kids still care about stadium size, history, Heismans, national championships, and location to talent…”
I have no clue what Kiffin will do. He may not either. I do know all this speculation has really increased interest in a game in which a 9-1 team is heavily favored over a team that has won only three games and already has fired its coach. The Lane Kiffin Bowl, it is.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/06141438/AP_22303188392546-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-14 10:57:30.270956

The New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions this week launched the Rural Education-Workforce Collaborative, an initiative connecting early education through 12th grade in rural school districts with career development opportunities in high-demand fields.
The $400,000 initiative is funded through the Community Benefit Fund, which falls under the Department of Workforce Solutions. The fund was created during the 2025 Legislative Session to support programs that reduce climate change impacts and create worker training programs for industries that address such programs.
“We created the Community Benefit Plan to spark exactly this type of creative partnership,” President Pro Tempore Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) said in a statement. “This investment will give young people real skills and paths to stay in the rural communities they love while building our state’s capacity to face the challenges of a changing climate and economy.”
According to the Department of Workforce Solutions, the new model is a collaboration between the department, rural PreK-12 school districts, institutions of higher education and Collegiate Edu-Nation, a nonprofit organization that consults with rural school districts across the country to end education and income inequality. The program will “expand access for rural students by integrating education and workforce resources such as dual credit programs, free college tuition and work-based learning opportunities.”
The goal is to prepare rural, low-income, first-generation students and those with disabilities or from tribal communities to meet the state’s growing workforce needs. The Collegiate Edu-Nation initiative started in Texas and now includes New Mexico public school districts such as Corona Public Schools, Mosquero Municipal Schools and Loving Municipal Schools. 
“This workforce-school partnership tackles several challenges at once by connecting education to real world opportunities from the earliest stage, creating opportunities for rural youth and building our workforce in climate-ready and infrastructure careers,” Department of Workforce Solutions Secretary Sarita Nair said in a statement. “The collaborative will demonstrate how much we can accomplish when we join forces with innovative rural school districts and the local workforce development board to give students true options for their futures and strengthen New Mexico’s economy.”
According to Lee White, superintendent of Loving Municipal Schools, it is difficult to connect students in rural communities to “real world opportunities that align with regional industry trends.”

Peter J. Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, will take over the case from embattled Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, Skandalakis announced Friday.
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee had tasked Skandalakis with finding a replacement for Willis by Friday or he would allow the case to be dismissed.
Skandalakis said he contacted “several” other prosecutors who declined to take up the case.
“The decision to assume responsibility for this matter was reached only after careful and deliberate consideration,” Skandalakis wrote. “While it would have been simple to allow Judge McAfee’s deadline to lapse or to inform the Court that no conflict prosecutor could be secured—thereby allowing the case to be dismissed for want of prosecution—I did not believe that to be the right course of action.”
Skandalakis said he recently received 101 banker boxes of documents related to the Trump investigation and an 8-terabyte hard drive containing the complete investigative file.
“Since receiving these materials, I have diligently worked to familiarize myself with the record and the status of the proceedings,” he said. “Additionally, I have attempted to review the evidence gathered and the hours of interviews and proffers of witnesses and former codefendants.  Unfortunately, I have not had sufficient time to complete my review. With Judge McAfee’s deadline now upon us and my review still ongoing, I have determined that the best course of action is to appoint myself to the case. This will allow me to complete a comprehensive review and make an informed decision regarding how best to proceed.”
A Fulton County grand jury  indicted Trump in 2023 when he was out of office along with 18 others who she alleged formed a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election, which Trump narrowly lost to President Joe Biden.
Following the loss, Trump had famously called Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and asked him to “find” the missing votes he would have needed to win. The alleged scheme also involved plans to submit a bogus slate of electors to falsely certify that Trump had won the election, a harassment campaign against Fulton County poll workers and a voting systems breach in Coffee County.
Four of the alleged co-conspirators pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against Trump and the other defendants, who maintained their innocence.
But the beginning of the case’s end came when an attorney for defendant Michael Roman, a former Trump campaign aide, introduced evidence that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had been involved in a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor she hired for the case with a lucrative contract, creating a potential conflict of interest.
After dramatic testimony including descriptions of vacations and cruises the two had taken together, a judge ordered that either Wade or Willis’ office needed to step aside from the case.
Wade resigned from the case, but Willis was ultimately disqualified from pursuing the charges against Trump by the Georgia Court of Appeals because of the “significant appearance of impropriety” stemming from their relationship. The Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear Willis’ appeal in September, leaving the case officially in need of a new prosecutor.
Georgia’s case is the last criminal case still pending against Trump.
Prosecution against Trump himself may stall while he is serving as president, but the cases against other alleged co-conspirators could move forward. That could represent a stumbling block for the president after other legal developments have gone his way.
U.S. Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith dropped a federal election interference case as well as a case alleging Trump mishandled classified documents after Trump’s 2024 election victory because it would be illegal to continue prosecuting him after taking office.
A New York state appeals court overturned a nearly $500 million civil penalty Trump was ordered to pay in a case involving fraudulent loan applications, though the judges left the fraud finding in place.
Trump is appealing a New York conviction involving hush money payments to adult film star Storsmy Daniels, which gave him the status of being the only felon elected president, and he’s seeking Supreme Court intervention in a civil case over a claim that he sexually abused and defamed writer E. Jean Carroll.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-14 14:27:08+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Suspension of maternity services at Mercy Medical Center sparks fears of permanent closure,Hallie Claflin,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/health-care/suspension-of-maternity-services-at-mercy-medical-center-sparks-fears-of-permanent-closure/,"Mercy Medical Center in Springfield announced last week that it plans to temporarily halt maternity and newborn services at its Family Life Center starting December 8, sparking fears the hospital will be next in a decade-long trend of statewide maternity unit closures in a region where labor and delivery options have already dwindled.","MERCY MEDICAL CENTER in Springfield announced last week that it plans to temporarily halt maternity and newborn services at its Family Life Center starting December 8, sparking fears the hospital will be next in a decade-long trend of statewide maternity unit closures in a region where labor and delivery options have already dwindled. 
The Catholic hospital owned by Trinity Health of New England cited persistent staffing constraints as the reason for the suspension. Providers will continue to offer prenatal and postnatal care at outpatient sites throughout Western Massachusetts, according to a press release, but babies will not be delivered at the hospital. The medical center reached an agreement with nearby Baystate Medical Center in Springfield to handle many of Mercy’s maternity patients. 
Mercy Medical Center spokesperson Mary Orr did not give an estimated timeline for how long delivery services may be suspended, but a statement from the hospital said it “will continue to pursue all options to resume continuous, safe, high-quality maternity care.”  
But Alan Sager, a Boston University School of Public Health professor, said there is reason to sound the alarm.  
“This is not pretty,” Sager said. “You lose the doctors who retire and relocate when the hospital closes or when the service shuts down, and then it’s very hard to attract doctors or nurses back into an underserved area.”  
Nearly 77 percent of Mercy’s patient revenue came from Medicaid and Medicare as of 2023, and “Medicaid is not a generous payer,” Sager noted.  
Since 2014, 11 hospitals in Massachusetts have closed or filed to close their maternity units, according to Health Policy Commission data. Holyoke Medical Center just north of Springfield permanently closed its maternity services unit in 2020 a few months after temporarily shuttering it, later citing the unit’s persistent annual financial losses as the reason for the closure. Many patients from Holyoke have since sought care at Mercy. 
“Given Mercy’s location in Springfield serving a fairly heavy mix of Latino patients … the closing of Mercy’s maternity care can dislocate patients who may find it hard to obtain care they’re equally comfortable with elsewhere,” Sager said. “Language-related differences matter to patients. They’re disadvantaged by the successive displacements of care.”  
The Massachusetts Nurses Association (MNA) has argued that the Department of Public Health should be acting more aggressively by treating the suspension like an essential service closure, which provides a mechanism for DPH to review a proposed closure or reduction in services. DPH did not respond to a request for comment.  
Jaime Hyatt, a registered nurse serving as co-chair of the MNA bargaining committee at Mercy where he has worked for nearly 25 years, says the staffing issues did not arise overnight.  
“Nurses have witnessed deliberate inaction on Trinity Health’s part to backfill vacant positions – especially on the provider side – as evidenced by job postings offering below-market wages,” Hyatt and bargaining co-chair Dee Doyle said in a statement. “This failure to adequately recruit and retain staff has led directly to the erosion of care we see today.”  
Mercy declined to answer questions about the maternity unit’s staffing levels and its efforts to recruit and retain employees.  
Just over 800 babies were delivered at Mercy in 2022, according to most recent DPH data. Cooley Dickinson Hospital in Northampton and Baystate in Springfield are the two nearest remaining options for patients from Holyoke, Springfield, Chicopee, Westfield, and other surrounding towns. Sager said hospitals are not “interchangeable parts,” and shuttering a service “rips apart the fabric of care” where patients once felt comfortable. 
“Springfield is the third largest city in the Commonwealth. How is it possible that there’s no choice of care?” Hyatt said. “It does not seem like the choice should be one hospital in Springfield.”  
The financial stability of Mercy Medical Center came into question this summer after reports surfaced that Baystate Health was in talks to acquire the hospital, which Hyatt and Doyle say left staff feeling “vulnerable and compelled to seek employment elsewhere.” In April, the Boston Globe reported on Mercy’s “exodus” of emergency room doctors and its hiring of a private, for-profit medical staffing agency that led to staff departures and pay cuts. In 2024, the hospital lost nearly $30 million and had the lowest profit margin among all independent health systems and hospitals in the state at –9.2 percent.  
Hyatt said he is worried the hospital will soon begin seeing births in its emergency department.   
“If they are far enough along, there’s not going to be time to send them down the street to Baystate,” he said. 
Pulling back services even temporarily in a region with already-limited options for maternal health care has nurses and providers like Hyatt concerned that Western Massachusetts could later become a maternity desert. 
“By letting this close, it shows that we are in contraction as opposed to expansion,” he said.",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hospital-1024x768.png,,,2025-11-14 10:00:17.957968

A week after Typhoon Halong passed through Japan in early October, its remnants crossed the Pacific and struck western Alaska. Nearly 50 Alaska Native communities across the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta near the Bering Sea were met with towering wind speeds, record storm surge, and widespread flooding. At least one person died, and 1,500 adults and children, who were mostly Yup’ik, were displaced from the villages. Initial estimates have reported that the storm decimated 90 percent of homes in the coastal village of Kipnuk and 35 percent in Kwigillingok, which has also experienced toxic chemicals spilling into its freshwater supply.
“It’s going to take years to recover from the disaster,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski at the Alaska Federation of Natives’ annual convention last month. “After the floodwaters recede, and after the damage to the homes and the fish camp is calculated, there’s so much work that remains and so much healing that is needed.”
State and federal resources are being mobilized to respond to the disaster. On October 22, alongside Governor Mike Dunleavy’s state emergency declaration and release of disaster relief funds, President Donald Trump authorized a federal emergency declaration and $25 million in funds for recovery and rebuilding efforts. State agencies such as the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management have also begun moving evacuees into long-term housing.
“This declaration is a critical step toward recovery, but it must be the beginning of a broader, sustained response,” said Vivian Korthius, who is Yup’ik and the CEO of the Association of Village Council Presidents, in a statement.
Kipnuk and the other villages hit by the storm have been on the front lines of climate change for more than a decade. Rising temperatures have caused permafrost to melt, causing land subsidence and flooding throughout the delta. According to the Alaska Climate Research Center, Typhoon Halong also exhibited characteristics consistent with the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures have changed the nature of tropical cyclones, leading to heavier rainfall, hurricane-like winds, and taller waves. The storm surge that struck Kipnuk, for instance, broke a 25-year-old record.
Many of the Alaska Native villages affected by Typhoon Halong were established in coastal areas as a result of the colonial policies imposed by the United States government. When the Russian Empire arrived in Alaska during the early 19th century, fur traders sought to benefit from the industry’s boom along the coastline. After Russia sold the land to the United States in 1867, the federal government aimed not only to seize and occupy lands but to encourage assimilation through boarding and day schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
The boarding school era played a crucial role in how villages were organized. Tribal communities sought to keep their children at home, given that boarding schools forced them to live away from their tribal cultures and were associated with abuse. As a result, Yu’pik communities chose to live near and send their children to village schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
“They were told, or at least it was implied, if not told, that you need to settle here to send your kids to school, or they may be sent away to boarding school,” said Sheryl Musgrove, the climate justice programs director at the Alaska Institute for Justice, who oversees climate adaptation, mitigation, and relocation with village partners in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.
The historic passage of the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, commonly known in the state as ANCSA, also reshaped where communities settled. The law abolished existing Native land claims in exchange for 44 million acres to be managed through private regional and village corporations. These for-profit entities, which operate in industries such as logging and oil, created jobs and encouraged settlement in centralized villages and regional hubs. As a result, settlements further solidified along the coast and near rivers.
Given that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted that Alaska’s summer waters will be ice-free in the next decade, communities have been trying to relocate with the assistance of tribal corporations. But relocating an entire village is a tall order. Costs are high, and selecting a site to relocate to with assistance from the regional corporation can be challenging. For instance, 300 people from Newtok, a village north of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, moved 9 miles away to a new village known as Metarvik late last year. But the infrastructure in Metarvik is already falling apart. Electricity is intermittent, running water is lacking, and residents have had to use 5-gallon buckets as toilets. The project, which was meant to serve as a model for other villages, received millions in federal grants but ultimately lacked federal guidance and fell short of meeting residents’ needs.
Despite a different legal terrain and colonial legacy, the federal government still has treaty responsibilities to uphold toward tribes in Alaska. In May, the Environmental Protection Agency canceled a $20 million flood protection grant awarded by the Biden administration last year. This landmark grant was expected to accelerate relocation for many villages. Rescinding funding was yet another example of the lack of federal investment, Musgrove said.
Due to the severity of the storm’s impact, Kwigillingok leaders have elected to proceed with relocation. It’s a decision that the Alaska Institute for Justice will assist with.
“No one knows what the future brings, and we need serious investments in these communities like Kwigillingok and Kipnuk to be able to rebuild or relocate — whichever they choose to,” said Musgrove. “So they can be safe from that next storm, whenever that next storm is in frame.”

People continue to die from drug overdoses in Los Angeles County jails — yet the county’s Department of Health Services has scaled back the accessibility of opioid addiction treatment for people behind bars, writes CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.
In a Sept. 16 memo obtained by CalMatters, Chief Medical Officer Sean Henderson said that Correctional Health Services will take “a pause on primary care in ordering buprenorphine,” a medication that curbs cravings and prevents overdoses. The new guidance also directs prioritizing people who first enter the jail system for treatment, and placing everyone else who wants medication on a waitlist. As of Oct. 31, over 800 people were on the waitlist.
Injectable buprenorphine costs about $1,600 per shot, with nearly 40,000 doses of buprenorphine administered in L.A. County jails since July 2022. The county sets aside about $25 million a year for the treatment program. Its Department of Health Services said the new rules — which restrict access to buprenorphine — were made “to help maximize the reach of (the) program.” The statement did not say how making it harder or having patients wait longer to access buprenorphine would positively affect the reach of the program. 
Critics argue the policy shift is dangerous, and that delaying treatment can lead to more fatal overdoses. 

A physician from the Correctional Health Services who spoke with CalMatters on the condition of anonymity: “Patients are begging me for help. I’m on edge, waiting to see if someone is going to die.”

The change comes as the state is suing L.A. County over the poor conditions of its jails and the high rate of in-custody deaths. Overdoses have made up 28% of jail deaths this year, compared to 9% in 2016, according to a September memo from the director of the county’s correctional health services.

More people want to investigate State Farm

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
As L.A.-area fire survivors complain about insurance-claim delays and denials, the county on Thursday launched an investigation into State Farm’s handling of its policyholders’ claims. It is the second government probe into the insurer this year in California.
The county told State Farm that if it is “engaging in any unlawful or unfair business practices,” it should stop, according to a letter from County Counsel Dawyn Harrison. The county also asked the insurer for detailed information, including about all claims filed related to the January fires, as well as its practices related to smoke damage and insurance adjusters.
State Farm said in a statement that this probe by the county “will be another distraction from our ongoing work in California to help our customers recover from this tragedy.” It said it has been cooperating with the earlier investigation launched by the state Insurance Department in June.
Fire survivors complain the state’s investigation is taking too long, and last week called on Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to resign.



Senate Pro Tem eyes congressional seat

California’s leading state senator, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, is making a bid for Congress following the end of his 12-year term limit next year, writes CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
The Santa Rosa Democrat seeks to represent California’s 1st District — one of the districts that has been drastically redrawn under Proposition 50 to favor Democrats. 
During his time in the Legislature, McGuire focused on wildfire prevention after wildfires in Sonoma and Napa counties destroyed thousands of homes and claimed dozens of lives in 2017. In one of the state’s budget bills this year, he also secured the most “pork-barrel” earmarks for local projects in his district.
The 1st District has been comfortably held by Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who has represented the northern part of the state in Congress since 2013. For his support of President Donald Trump’s recent budget bill, which guts Medicaid spending by more than $1.1 trillion over 10 years, constituents slammed LaMalfa in August over a move they said will harm rural hospitals and residents.
