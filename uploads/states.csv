Forests, national parks to stay open during government shutdown, but services may be limited 

Federal agencies and programs in most cases are not allowed to spend money without authorization from Congress. As the federal fiscal year expired at midnight Tuesday, the U.S. Senate Democrats and Republicans remained deadlocked on two dueling proposals that would have extended funding, the States Newsroom reported. 
As a result, many federal workers and programs will be suspended until a funding plan is approved, with exceptions for the military, the Department of Homeland Security, and Transportation Security Administration and air traffic controllers — although these employees will be working without pay. Mail services and Social Security checks will continue, because they do not require annual funding.
There are around 14,387 civilian federal workers in Idaho, with the highest number in the southwestern region of the state, according to the Idaho Department of Labor. Across the nation, the Congressional Budget Office estimated 750,000 federal workers will be furloughed without pay. President Donald Trump and a top official have signaled some of the furloughs may become permanent mass layoffs. 
 How will health care and other public assistance be affected? 

Medicaid and Medicare payments should continue, although a mass furlough of staff may cause delays, CBS news reported. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services officials wrote in its contingency plan it has sufficient funding to last until the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, which in total runs Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, 2026. 
More than 300,000 Idahoans are enrolled in Medicaid, according to Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s budget request form this year.

Food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,Infants and Children, known as WIC, are also expected to continue, at least in the short-term. There are more than 130,000 Idahoans using SNAP benefits. There were more than 30,000 Idaho women and children using WIC services as of information shared by the department in March 2024. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture runs both food benefit programs. The agency’s contingency plan said that SNAP has enough funds to run through October. The National WIC Association told NBC News that the program has enough funding to continue for another week, after which the program would likely be suspended without more funding from the agriculture department. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, which administers these programs to Idaho residents, could not immediately be reached for comment on how services would be impacted. 
 How will the Boise Airport operations be affected?

A spokesperson for Idaho’s largest airport, the Boise Airport, said the shutdown is not expected to have an immediate impact on its day-to-day operations. 
Federal airport personnel are considered essential and will be expected to continue working without pay. During the last government shutdown, which lasted more than a month from December 2018 to January 2019, TSA personnel called out of work at an increased rate, ABC news reported at the time.  
“We are working closely with our federal partners to maintain smooth operations and support the travel experience,” Boise Airport spokesperson Jennifer Kronberg said in an email. “The airport recommends arriving earlier than usual to give yourself enough time to go through the TSA security checkpoint in the event of staffing shortages.”

 Will Head Start early learning programs be affected? 

The federally funded Head Start school readiness program will still receive grants, and programs should continue, Idaho Head Start Association Executive Director Megan Woller told the Sun. 
The staff running Idaho’s programs are not federal employees, she noted. 
Head Start provides preschool services to children aged 3 to 5 and their families, and Early Head Start works with families with children from birth to 3 years old. 
“Assuming the shutdown doesn’t last too long, we are hopeful that programs themselves will not be too badly impacted if federal Office of Head Start employees are unavailable,” Woller said. “Fiscal Specialists and Grantee Specialists are federal employees assigned to the Head Start programs and at times, they assist the programs with very critical, time-sensitive business … If anything changes, families and staff will be made aware of their program.” 
 Idaho Republicans and Democrats blame the opposing party for shutdown 

As of Wednesday afternoon, Congress remained deadlocked among a deep partisan divide between stopgap funding proposals. Idaho’s Republican delegation largely blamed Democrats for the shutdown.

“Senate Democrats have rejected a clean Continuing Resolution to keep the government open to provide breathing room to make bipartisan progress on advancing regular appropriations bills,” Idaho U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo said in an emailed statement to the Idaho Capital Sun.  
“Instead, they are demanding an unserious proposal that would increase government spending by a staggering $1 trillion and wipe out a vast majority of the savings Republicans have worked diligently to pass since the start of the Congress.  The Senate will keep voting to try to keep the government open–Democrats have the choice either to support a CR (Continuing Resolution) as they did 13 times under the previous Administration and keep the federal government fully operational, or pursue unreasonable political objectives.” 
The U.S. Senate voted late Tuesday night and Wednesday morning on a House Republican-supported stopgap funding proposal that would have kept the government running for seven weeks. 
The House proposal advanced Sept. 19 in a 217-212 vote, nearly along party lines. The Senate, which needed at least 60 votes to pass, voted 55-45 late Tuesday on the House Republican funding proposal, also nearly along party lines, with three Democrats joining Republicans in support. 
Senators also voted 47-53 Tuesday on a Democratic proposal that would have extended funding for a month, renew health care premium subsidies, and restore Medicaid cuts approved in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Congressional democratic leaders have said they won’t support a plan that doesn’t extend the health care premium tax credit subsidies, which are set to expire and go toward lowering premiums on health insurance purchased through state marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act. 
The health policy organization KFF estimated Idaho has roughly 100,600 enrollees in the health care premium tax credits, receiving an average credit of $407.

Idaho U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson also placed blame on Senate Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Democrat Chuck Schumer. 
“Shutting down the government is bad politics and policy. Unfortunately, Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats are holding the funding hostage and pushed us into a government shutdown due to their far-left, unreasonable policy demands,” Simpson said in an emailed statement. 
“Idahoans, like the majority of Americans, do not support their tax dollars paying for free health care to illegal aliens, stripping rural hospital funding, or increasing spending by nearly $1.5 trillion. The impacts of government shutdowns are extremely harmful, which is why I supported the clean CR to keep our government open, but the Democrats’ counterdemands would be much more harmful to our nation.”
The law prohibits federal health care — through Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, called CHIP — from being provided to immigrants in the country illegally. The Democrats’ funding proposal wouldn’t have changed that law, but would have restored benefits to noncitizens who had legal permission to be in the U.S., such as refugees, those under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and asylum seekers going through the legal process.

Idaho U.S. Sen. Jim Risch said on the social media platform X, “My offices are open, staffed, and working for Idahoans during the shutdown. While Chuck Schumer placates the far left, my staff and I are staying on the clock to put Idaho first. If you are in need of assistance with a federal agency, contact my office: https://risch.senate.gov/public/” 
His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Sun, other than to highlight the X posts, which include posts that say the blame for the shutdown “is squarely in the hands of the Democrats.” 
Idaho Rep. Russ Fulcher’s office could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The Idaho Democratic Party said in an emailed statement that while Republicans control the House, Senate and White House, the blame lay with the GOP. 
“With all that power, they showed they can’t lead and don’t care to. Democrats fought to protect your health care, keep premiums from doubling for more than 100,000 Idahoans, and save our rural hospitals from devastating cuts,” Idaho Democratic Party Chair Lauren Necochea said in the statement. “Democrats fought to protect your health care, keep premiums from doubling for more than 100,000 Idahoans, and save our rural hospitals from devastating cuts. But Mike Simpson, Russ Fulcher, Jim Risch, and Mike Crapo stood with their party and turned their backs on Idaho families. Because of their choice, thousands of Idahoans will go without pay.”

Gretchen Whitmer advised Wednesday.
Whitmer’s call for schools to continue feeding kids was joined by State Superintendent of Public Instruction Michael Rice and came on the same day that the governor signed a continuation budget with just a fraction of the previous fiscal year’s spending to hold the state over while the Legislature finishes drafting a final budget bill for the 2025-26 fiscal year.
“Two summers ago, I was proud to deliver free school meals to all 1.4 million public-school students, saving parents around $1,000 a year per kid and time each morning,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Since then, we have consistently funded free school meals, saving Michigan families time, money, and worry. As we continue pushing the Michigan Legislature to finalize a balanced budget that feeds our kids, as they’ve said they would, I am calling on our school districts to do what it takes to feed every student today, tomorrow, and every single school day after that too.”
Legislators worked into early Wednesday morning to hash out a final deal after last week’s budget framework came to the fore, and then lapsed into a one-hour government shutdown before both chambers voted on a House plan to keep the government open for the next eight days. That should give legislative staff some cover to produce a final budget bill, which is expected to be approved Thursday and then signed swiftly by the governor.
Despite that work, schools are still without a state budget allocating money to K-12 instruction, leaving many districts in a tough spot as their funding status remains unclear.
Rice said students have been healthier as a result of the last two years of free school meals being a separate line item in the past two previous fiscal year budgets.
“The Michigan Department of Education is appreciative of the support of the state legislature and Governor Whitmer for the Michigan School Meals Program and of the opportunity to partner with local food service staff, directors, and educators to ensure that all children can eat free at school. Let’s keep feeding our kids,” Rice said in a statement.
Public school districts in Michigan receive their state funding in 11 monthly payments, with the last payment being made Sept. 20, which would cover expenses through Oct. 20.
However, K-12 Alliance of Michigan Executive Director Robert McCann released a statement late Wednesday afternoon, urging the administration to provide “actual guidance to help districts navigate this self-created budget crisis,” and calling on Whitmer to release details on the proposed budget and road funding plans that heretofore have been discussed only behind closed doors.
“Pressing schools to spend money when lawmakers have failed to deliver a budget for more than three months now continues to show a total lack of awareness about the chaos and uncertainty Lansing has created that has led to schools discontinuing services such as these. Until there is an actual budget signed into law that includes funding for school meals, which lawmakers have yet to produce, districts cannot simply trust that the funding will be there when the budget is now more than three months overdue,” McCann said.

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., speaks at a news conference with Senate Republicans on Wednesday morning, Oct. 1, 2025, regarding the ongoing government shutdown. (U.S. Senate GOP X screenshot)The federal government began a shutdown early Wednesday morning after the deadlocked U.S. Congress failed to approve a funding bill before the beginning of the new fiscal year to keep services running.
The shutdown comes as Republicans and Democrats stand at odds over federal funding priorities. Democrats want to see enhanced health care subsidies included in the spending bill. Republicans do not. Without the 60 votes needed in the U.S. Senate for any bill to advance, the body remained at a standstill Wednesday afternoon.
The enhanced subsidies — for plans purchased on the Health Insurance Marketplace — are set to expire at the end of the year. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the subsidies expiring is projected to cause 4.2 million Americans to lose their health insurance by 2034.
It’s unclear how long this shutdown will last; Thursday marks the Jewish holiday Yom Kipper, which the Senate will take off from work. Lawmakers will likely reconvene for further votes on the competing Republican and Democratic spending bills on Friday and Saturday.
Meanwhile, members of President Donald Trump’s administration have threatened that the shutdown will lead to permanent layoffs and firings for certain federal workers. On Wednesday, the federal Office of Management and Budget told some GOP lawmakers privately that firings could start in “one to two days.” 
Those firings were threatened last week before the shutdown occurred when OMB chief Russ Vought issued a memo telling agency heads to consider giving reduction in force (RIF) notices to employees in programs or working on projects where funding ended on Wednesday due to the shutdown. Those RIFs, per the memo, should occur in programs that are “not consistent with the President’s priorities” but few other details have been released regarding who exactly would be affected.
On Tuesday, unions representing federal employees filed a lawsuit against the threats from Vought and the Trump Administration. They called the threats an “unlawful abuse of power” in a news release that day and alleged it was a “misuse” of the shutdown process, which has occurred for decades when funding decisions could not be made.
“Announcing plans to fire potentially tens of thousands of federal employees simply because Congress and the administration are at odds on funding the government past the end of the fiscal year is not only illegal — it’s immoral and unconscionable,” said American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley in a news release. “Federal employees dedicate their careers to public service — more than a third are military veterans — and the contempt being shown to them by this administration is appalling.”
West Virginia leaders react, lob blame at Democrats
Reacting to the shutdown Wednesday, West Virginia Sens. Jim Justice and Shelley Moore Capito, both Republicans, pushed blame on Democrats, who they and their colleagues say are unwilling to compromise despite the potential ramifications for regular workers and people.
Justice, in an emailed news release, said that funding government services “shouldn’t be a food fight.” He said the “clean bill” put forward by Republicans is similar to that voted on by Democrats previously. He said that it was “time for Democrats to stop the games and work with [Republicans] to reopen the government.”
Capito, in a news conference hosted by the Senate GOP on Wednesday, reiterated comments by other Republican leaders in the Senate regarding how “nonpartisan” and “clean” their proposed spending bill is. Democrats, she said, are “hijacking” the process and holding American people “hostage” in the meantime.
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, she said the lack of passage on a spending bill is robbing Americans and West Virginians of vital representation from the people they elected to office. 
“[Democrats have] hijacked a process that we need to have in order to demonstrate to the American people what we promised them in this election and what President Trump promised them,” Capito said. “… We’re not going to ride on some continuing resolution that spends like President Biden wanted to spend. We’re going to put our own imprint on this for the American people. That’s what they wanted when they voted us in, and that’s what we want to give them.”
Thousands of West Virginians in particular will be impacted if the health care subsidies at the heart of this fight expire at the end of this year. About 67,000 West Virginians buy their health care on the marketplace. 
The West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy said that West Virginians who buy insurance through the marketplace will see their premiums increase by an average of 133% or $1,400 annually. About 15,000 West Virginians will lose health care altogether because they cannot afford it any more, according to the center. 
In a statement Wednesday, West Virginia Democratic Party Chairman Mike Pushkin said it’s clear — given the stakes for low- and middle-income people — that this shutdown is a “Trump shutdown” and largely the work of Republicans.
“While Republicans refuse to even show up to work, Democrats stand united: cancel the cuts, lower costs, and save health care for hard-working West Virginians,” Pushkin said. “Trump is playing politics with West Virginian’s livelihoods. Democrats won’t stop fighting to lower costs and save health care.”
An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll from Tuesday shows that more Americans are holding Republicans responsible than Democrats for the current shutdown.
How services will be affected in the Mountain State
The impacts of the shutdown are wide reaching, with thousands of federal employees in various agencies furloughed and others being forced to work without pay to keep vital services operational. In the past, unpaid workers have received backpay for their service once the government is operational again.
Though most day-to-day services are likely to continue, the consequences and impact on those services could grow the longer the shutdown goes on. In previous shutdowns, workers who were forced to go without pay stopped going to work at a certain point, leading to delays in travel, paperwork processing and more.
The overall impact — both economically and otherwise — of this shutdown will likely depend on how long it lasts. While services with already-appropriated funding will likely remain in operation until funds expire, others could be impacted more immediately. More information will become available on these effects in the coming days.
For now, here’s some information on how certain services could be affected in the Mountain State:
Safety net services
Funding for WIC — a food assistance program for women, infants and children — could run out of remaining funding relatively quickly, leaving thousands of West Virginians in need and out of services. The National WIC Association said Wednesday that while the program has enough on hand to run “temporarily,” Congress should act sooner rather than later to prevent a full shutdown of the vital program.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — which serves as a lifeline for thousands of struggling West Virginians — could also face challenges if the shutdown continued.
Those who rely on SNAP should receive their monthly October EBT payments without issue since those funds were already allocated. However, according to the Food Research and Action Center, if the shutdown continues later into the month, November payouts could be impacted depending on how much money the U.S. Department of Agriculture has in its contingency reserve funds to cover SNAP costs.
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid services will continue throughout the shutdown, but agencies and representatives for them may be difficult to reach or coordinate with due to staffing and other challenges.
Travel and National Parks
Workers for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) as well as air traffic controllers are deemed to be essential workers, meaning flights should be able to continue as scheduled as long as individuals continue to show up to work.
A spokesperson for Yeager International Airport, in Charleston, said Wednesday that the airport “expects regular operations to continue throughout the government shutdown.” 
“We remain in close coordination with our federal partners to ensure a safe, secure, and efficient travel experience for all passengers,” they said.
Amtrak trains are also expected to continue running. Per a statement from Amtrak, the railway company expects to “remain open for business.” However previously, when shutdowns have loomed, the Rail Passengers Association has warned that services could become strained the longer a shutdown goes on.
National parks, scenic areas, reserves and more will remain “as accessible as possible during the federal government shutdown,” according to the National Parks Service. The shutdown, however, will likely cost millions in tourism dollars lost nationwide as people question how open they are or opt not to visit. 
Trails and most open-air memorials will remain accessible, but as nearly half the national parks’ staff have been furloughed, not all services will be available. Park visitor centers and other facilities — including some bathrooms, indoor museums and exhibits and more — will likely not be open. Those that are open will not be subject to maintenance while employees are furloughed.
Courthouses and law enforcement
Most law enforcement activities are deemed to be critical services, meaning they will continue working though, in some regards, without pay.
In West Virginia, the federal court system has enough money to likely keep operations running seamlessly. 
The state’s federal penitentiaries — one of the largest federal employers in West Virginia — will continue operations, though again, likely some staff will be unpaid while the shutdown persists.
All essential military personnel deployed during the shutdown will continue working. Some administrative roles and other responsibilities may face furloughs.
Education
Any grant funds not already appropriated to extend past Oct. 1 will likely be put on hold until the government is fully functioning. Other programs that already have funding on hand will likely continue.
The Federal Department of Education will see more than 80% of its staff furloughed during the shutdown. Per The Associated Press, the largest activity that will be paused throughout this time is the investigation of civil rights violations.
Federal student loan programs will continue allocating money until funds are depleted. All loan and Pell Grant borrowers must continue making their payments throughout the shutdown. The department will continue to process the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.
Colleges themselves will likely not be immediately impacted, but research activities — which could affect students in certain study programs — could be put on hold. If the shutdown persists, colleges may see more impacts.

At Wednesday’s State Board of Education meeting, Dan Tetreault, assistant director of early learning at the state Department of Public Instruction, presented the annual Read to Achieve report, which will be submitted to the General Assembly.
The report shows that 70% of first-graders and 66% of second-graders reached grade-level reading benchmarks in 2024-25, compared with 39% and 43% just four years ago.
Third-grade scores saw a slight decline. Just 47% of students demonstrated proficiency on the state reading test this year, down from 49% last year.
The data also showed gaps among student groups. Only 21% of English learners scored proficient in third-grade reading, and just 17% of students with disabilities met that standard. By comparison, 59% of white students and 69% of Asian students did so.
Board members questioned Tetreault on why the early-grade gains don’t translate into higher third-grade scores. He explained that the gap stems from the different skills measured.
“For grades one and two, students are assessed with the DIBELS 8 assessment, which looks at foundational skills,” Tetreault said. “By third grade, they have to show proficiency on the end-of-grade reading test. What we see in the DIBELS data is strength in the acquisition of foundational skills, but we see opportunities for growth in areas of language comprehension.”
Several members echoed those concerns, saying the state may need to examine more closely what “proficient” means, with some noting that DIBELS 8 measures different skills than the end-of-grade exam and questioned whether the state is measuring what matters most for reading.
“We want to be sure we’re measuring the right things at the right time so families and communities get a clear picture of progress,” said board member Beckie Spears. 
State law requires students who don’t meet third-grade reading standards to attend summer reading camps or be retained, with some exceptions. About 9,300 third-graders attended reading camps this summer — roughly 35% of those eligible — and 23% of them became proficient afterward.
The report also shows thousands of students promoted through “good cause” exemptions, such as passing an alternative test or having documented disabilities. This year, about one-third of students who initially failed state exams advanced under those provisions.
The Read to Achieve program was launched in 2012 to improve early literacy and ensure students are reading on grade level by the end of third grade. Since then, lawmakers have revised the law several times, adding summer reading camps, reading portfolios and alternative assessments.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Childresn-reading-1.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)On the first day of the federal government shutdown, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and 20 other Democratic AGs are challenging new Trump administration rules that will restrict federal aid for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence if they are undocumented immigrants.
The 54-page complaint filed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island seeks to block the new “Legal Services Condition” by the U.S. Department of Justice for programs scheduled to take effect on Oct. 31 including the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) and Byrne Justice Assistance Grants (JAG).
States were notified of the rules on Aug. 18 via what the complaint called “surprise notices” informing them they could no longer provide legal services to undocumented immigrants with funding allotted to them through the VOCA, VAWA, and JAG grants.
That was the same day the same coalition of AGs filed a separate suit against the DOJ and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to stop the withholding of VOCA funds to states where officials refuse to comply with federal immigration enforcement. That case remains ongoing.
Democratic AGs sue DOJ to receive federal funding for victims of violent crimes

But even as the Democratic states challenged the administration, the DOJ continued to formalize “improperly ambiguous” rules with “no explanation,” the complaint argued.
“The condition is unclear as to what constitutes ‘legal services’ and which groups of victims and other individuals are to be excluded from those services, including how state agencies (and subgrantees) are to identify which victims and individuals to exclude,” the lawsuit alleges.
The suit argues that the new restrictions would strain victim services programs by forcing states to screen immigration status. The coalition also warned legal residents and U.S. citizens could also be denied help.
“When a victim of sexual assault or domestic violence seeks help, the first question we ask should not be about their immigration status,” Neronha said in a statement. “These restrictions are unreasonable, unlawful, and we will fight to make sure they are blocked.”
Attorneys general involved in the latest lawsuit are from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.
Neronha and the coalition argue that DOJ’s new restrictions violate the U.S. Constitution’s Spending Clause, along with the Administrative Procedure Act.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the DOJ, declined to comment citing the federal government shutdown which began midnight Wednesday after Congress failed to approve a funding bill before the beginning of the new fiscal year. 
“During the current lapse in appropriations, DOJ operations are directed toward national security, violations of federal law, and essential public safety functions,” she said in an emailed statement. “Inquiries outside of these functions will be considered when the lapse in appropriations ends.” 
But the shutdown will not have any effect on federal court operations in Rhode Island.
“All hearings and trials will proceed without interruption, and matters may continue to be scheduled with the Court in the ordinary course,” states a notice on the federal court’s website. “Public access to the court — both in person and through the court’s electronic filing system — will remain unaffected.”

Free.,Shutdown standoff in US Senate extends as thousands of federal workers are sent home,"Ashley Murray, Jennifer Shutt, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/shutdown-standoff-us-senate-extends-thousands-federal-workers-are-sent-home,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Democrats and Republicans remained at a stalemate Wednesday as government offices closed and hundreds of thousands of federal workers faced furloughs on the first day of a government shutdown that showed no sign of ending.Proposals from each side of the aisle to fund and reopen the government failed again during morning Senate votes, mirroring the same vote breakdowns as Tuesday evening, when lawmakers could not reach a deal hours before the government ran out of money.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected up to 750,000 federal workers could be furloughed, leading to a $400 million per day impact on the economy.Locked in their positions, Republicans failed to pick up enough Democrats to reach the 60 votes needed to advance their plan to fund the government until Nov. 21. Senators will break Thursday to observe Yom Kippur, but Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota told reporters on Capitol Hill he expects the chamber will work through the weekend if necessary.Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, along with independent Angus King of Maine, again joined Republicans in the 55-45 vote for the House-passed stopgap spending bill. GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted no.Democrats also failed to find support to move forward their bill to fund the government through Oct. 31, roll back GOP cuts on Medicaid and permanently extend subsidies that tie the cost of Affordable  Care Act health insurance premiums to an enrollee’s income level. The Democrats failed to advance their plan in a party-line 47-53 vote. King, who caucuses with Democrats, voted in favor.Shutdown tied to health care tax creditsSenate and House Democrats say they will not support a GOP path to reopen the government unless Republicans agree to negotiate on rising health care costs. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said at a press conference that Democrats are “ready to sit down with anyone at any time and at any place in order now to reopen the government, to enact a spending agreement that meets the needs of the American people and to address the devastating Republican health care crisis that has caused extraordinary harm on people all across the country.”The New York Democrat pointed to harms in “rural America, working class America, urban America, small-town America, the heartland of America and Black and brown communities throughout America.” Democratic leaders blitzed Capitol Hill with their message on health care, holding press conferences and attending an evening rally Tuesday on the lawn outside the U.S. House.

They pointed to new data published this week showing annual insurance premiums could double on average in 2026 if the subsidies expire at year’s end, according to an analysis from the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF. Open enrollment for next year’s ACA health insurance plans opens Nov. 1 in most states, and Oct. 15 in Idaho.Uptake of ACA health insurance plans has more than doubled to over 24 million, up from 11 million, since the introduction of the subsidies in 2021, according to KFF. During their own budget reconciliation deal in 2022, Democrats extended the insurance premium tax credits until the end of 2025. The majority of ACA enrollees currently rely on the credits.Democrats also want assurances that the White House and Senate Republicans will not cancel any more funds that have already been approved by Congress, as was the case this year when the administration and GOP lawmakers stripped funding for medical research, foreign aid and public broadcasting, among other areas.‘This can all end today’GOP leaders in the House and Senate continued to blame Senate Democrats for the government shutdown at the expense of furloughed federal workers and Americans who rely on their services. At a Wednesday morning press conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson said “troops and border patrol agents will have to go to work, but they'll be working without pay.”Johnson also claimed at the press conference that veterans benefits would stop. The claim is false, as Veterans Administration medical care will continue uninterrupted and vets will also continue to receive benefits, including compensation, pension, education and housing.

“As we speak here this morning, there are hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are getting their furlough notices. Nearly half of our civilian workforce is being sent home — these are hard-working Americans who work for our federal government,” the Louisiana Republican said, flanked by fellow GOP leaders on the Upper West Terrace of the U.S. Capitol overlooking the National Mall. Johnson decided in late September the House will be out until Oct. 6, canceling this week’s votes. The speaker said he will bring House members back next week, even if the government is still shut down.“They would be here this week, except that we did our work — we passed the bill almost two weeks ago out of the House, sent it to the Senate,” Johnson said. “The ball is literally in (Senate Minority Leader) Chuck Schumer’s court, so he determines that.” Thune said “this can all end today” and “needs to end today.”The South Dakota Republican said the funding lapse can cease when Senate Democrats vote for the GOP’s “clean” short-term funding bill. “We will continue to work together with our House counterparts, with the president of the United States, to get this government open again on behalf of the American people,” Thune said. Bipartisan deal and TrumpVirginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said later in the day that a bipartisan group huddled on the floor during votes to talk about a possible path forward on “health care fixes” and ensuring that if a bipartisan deal is brokered, the Trump administration will stick to it. Republican senators, he said, could give Democrats assurances they won’t vote for any more rescissions requests from the White House, which ask Congress to cancel already approved government spending. But other issues, like laying off federal workers by the hundreds or thousands, have to be a promise from the president. “If I find a deal, should Congress have to follow it? Yes. Should the president have to follow it? Yes. Well, what if the president won't follow it? Oh, yeah, you got a problem,” Kaine said. “So you know, rescission, impoundment, those are Senate words. But a deal is a deal — people get that.”Kaine also emphasized that it’s not a “clean” stopgap funding bill if the Trump administration unilaterally cancels some of the spending. “In the past, we voted for clean (continuing resolutions), but the president has shown that he'll take the money back,” Kaine said, referring to the technical name for a short-term funding bill. “I mean, just in Virginia, canceling $400 million to our public health, $40 million economic projects just pulled off the table, firing more Virginians than any president. “So we just want you to agree, if we do a deal, then you'll honor the deal,” Kaine said. “It's not that much to ask.”‘People are suffering’North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said he doesn’t expect the shutdown will have long-term ramifications for senators’ ability to negotiate bipartisan deals — a necessity in the upper chamber, which has a 60-vote threshold to advance legislation. “It's all transactional,” Tillis said. “I think there's going to be opportunities for some bipartisan work, but none of that happens, you can't even really consider it when you're in a shutdown posture.”Cortez Masto, who voted to advance Republicans’ seven-week stopgap bill, said the GOP “created this crisis” on health care and “need to address it.”“They have no moral standing — no moral standing —- to say that this is all on the Democrats. They are in control. They've created this crisis,” Cortez Masto said. “People are suffering and they need to come to the table.” Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who was sworn in for the first time during the last shutdown, said he worries about longer-term effects. ""My concern is it's going to poison the well on negotiations going forward on a lot of things,” Hawley said. “I can't speak for anybody but myself, but I would just say that these tactics are very destructive. And it's destructive, not just for relationships, but for real people.”Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)While Republicans in Washington, D.C. are opposed to extending the healthcare subsidies for the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, state insurance commissioners, including Montana Auditor James Brown, a Republican, sent a letter to Congressional leaders last month urging them to continue the enhanced tax credits that began during the pandemic.
“Without an extension of the enhanced credits in September, insurers and marketplaces will begin to notify over 20 million consumers in all 50 states of major premium increases in a matter of weeks,” states the letter submitted by The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents insurance regulators in all 50 states, D.C. and five territories.
The expiring subsidies have been a key issue in the halls of Congress this week that led to the federal government shutdown.
Although Brown was at odds with Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy of Montana on the issue as recently as Sept. 16, he declined Tuesday and Wednesday to comment to the Daily Montanan.
In the nation’s capital, the debate splits along party lines. In votes on Tuesday, Republicans opposed a Democratic stopgap proposal on Tuesday to fund the government for a month that included several health care provisions, while all but three Democrats opposed a Republican measure to fund the government for seven weeks. A continuing resolution to fund the government needs 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to pass.
The Affordable Care Act Marketplace allows individuals who do not receive health insurance from employers and do not qualify for Medicaid to shop for coverage from private insurance companies.
Open enrollment for people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace starts Nov. 1, and premiums could double in 2026 if enhanced tax credits in the ACA expire at the end of this year as scheduled, as States Newsroom’s D.C. Bureau reported, citing an analysis by health policy research organization KFF.
In Montana, more than 77,000 individuals selected insurance through the ACA Marketplace in 2025, according to KFF. That is up from 42,822 in 2020, before the expanded credits took effect.
All the growth in Marketplace enrollment in the last four years is among people receiving an advanced payment of the premium tax credit, according to a KFF report, nearly doubling from 2020.
In 2024, more than 58,000 Montanans received more than $63.5 million in expanded ACA subsidies from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which extended the subsidies through 2025.
In an interview with the Montana State News Bureau, Brown said he was trying to do the “job that has been tasked to me by the Legislature to protect the consumer and provide regulatory certainty to insurance companies that provide ACA plans in Montana.”
A KFF state-by-state analysis shows that Montanans’ with the tax credits pay an average monthly premium of $112, compared to $203 without the credit — an 81% difference.
In a statement issued in August, Brown warned Montanans about rate hikes from major insurance providers in the state, including Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana, PacificSource, Mountain Health Co-op, and UnitedHealthcare, which he attributed to several factors including drug and medical inflation, and the uncertainty over federal subsidies.
Heathcare.gov, the federal government’s website for the ACA marketplace, shows that PacificSource is requesting an 11% rate increase, while Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana is requesting a nearly 25% hike.
Brown has been vocal over the ACA’s flaws in interviews with other outlets.
“Until Congress repeals and replaces the failed law that has driven rates higher for years on the American people, we are calling on the federal government to restore the ACA subsidies that help keep insurance within reach for Montana families,” Brown said in a statement to the News Bureau.
Ten House Republicans earlier this year proposed legislation to extend the tax credits.
No members of Montana’s federal delegation, including Rep. Troy Downing, former state Auditor, responded to requests for comment on the debate over subsidies fueling the shutdown, or whether they would support standalone bills to extend the credits.
But speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican, said the enhanced premium tax credits were always intended as a temporary, COVID-era subsidy and would carry a $350 billion price tag over a decade.
“It is not a good idea to extend it. We don’t deny the fact there are increases coming in health care costs and insurance premiums, but it’s not because of the loss of this subsidy. That’s a very, very small percentage. The overall health care costs are going up because of inflation, because of some new expensive drugs that are being more utilized,” he said. “These subsidies are not a hill worth dying for the Democrats, and certainly we’re going to oppose it.”
“There’s no reason we should be in a shutdown. It costs taxpayers money. It disrupts government services. And at the end of the day, it doesn’t really deliver any political or policy objective. So, let’s end the shutdown and get both sides back to the negotiating table, get the appropriations through and move forward. That’s the right answer, it’s the best answer as well,” Daines added.
In press statements, Daines and Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy both blamed the “Schumer shutdown” on Democrats playing political games.
“Chuck Schumer and the Democrats put partisan games over the best interests of the American people and shut down the government. Democrats are holding critical resources for our military, veterans, and hardworking Montana families hostage to appease their radical, far-left base,” Sheehy said.
Rep. Ryan Zinke posted on social media that Democrats shut down the government because, “they want billions of dollars for illegal immigrants to receive taxpayer funded welfare benefits,” echoing a talking point put out by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. The New York Times dove into that claim, while Newsweek and CNN fact checked it as false.
Zinke’s office sent out a survey to Montanans on Wednesday asking whether they “support shutting down the federal government to provide illegal immigrants taxpayer-subsidized health care and eliminatev (sic) the $50 billion rural health fund?”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/capitolnight-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Immigrant advocates staged a small demonstration Wednesday morning at the New Mexico Roundhouse, criticizing legislative leaders and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham for not including in the special session legislation banning immigrant detention centers from operating in the state.
Amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push, three New Mexico detention centers are facing increasing scrutiny for contracting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold detainees. The number of detainees has steadily increased in the facilities in Torrance, Cibola and Otero counties since Trump’s second term began, according to the latest data. 
NM committee chair who once stymied ICE detention center ban says he’s reconsidering

A measure to prohibit ICE from holding detainees at New Mexico detention centers failed during the session early this year after passing the state House but not the Senate. Last month, Lujan Grisham excluded it from the agenda for the session beginning Wednesday, saying through a spokesperson that she left it out after Democratic leaders requested a “scaled-back session agenda that did not include the immigration detention center bill.”
That said, the governor’s Communications Director Michael Coleman said in prior statements the governor is “committed” to legislation banning  ICE detention centers in the state, and “hopes that lawmakers will pass the strongest bill possible.”
Fernanda Banda, one of more than a dozen advocates who gathered in front of the Roundhouse on Wednesday morning, told Source New Mexico that potentially waiting until January is “not good enough,” with people being detained in New Mexico and across the country “left and right. “
“If the governor doesn’t want to put us on the agenda, we’ll bring detention to her,” she said. 
The protest featured a handful of demonstrators sitting in a makeshift jail cell. They read statements they had collected from ICE detainees held in the Torrance County Detention Center, most of them during Trump’s second term, which described being separated from their families and held in poor conditions, including dealing with a sewage backup and water shortage earlier this year. 
Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) told Source New Mexico after a news conference Wednesday morning that he and other lawmakers have already committed to making ICE detention a piece of priority legislation that the Legislature takes up during the first half of the session. 
But he said he’s still not sure whether it will pass the Senate. “I don’t know yet,” he said. “That’s why we need the time to get it right.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Protest-over-Immigration-detention-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Bureau of Investigation director Tony Mattivi and Attorney General Kris Kobach announced a crackdown Wednesday on “brazen” sales of marijuana and THC products as law enforcement raided 10 shops in six cities across the state.
The two spoke to reporters at a news conference in Topeka while the raids were underway, and they said additional stores would be targeted later Wednesday and again on Thursday.
Mattivi said the KBI was targeting illegal retail drug sales because teenagers were suffering dire health consequences from consuming products with high concentrations of THC.
“I was at one of these locations earlier today,” Mattivi said. “The violations of the Kansas Controlled Substances Act are brazen. These places are selling pre-rolled marijuana cigarettes. They’re selling marijuana bud. They’re selling marijuana flower in canisters and cigarette by cigarette.
“The places that we’ve identified today are nothing but weed dealers in strip malls, and we cannot continue to not enforce our controlled substance laws when we have these substances causing bad effects on Kansas kids.”
Mattivi said a Kansas child would face less resistance buying marijuana than tobacco cigarettes.
“That has to come to an end, and that’s what we did today,” he said.
The KBI and local law enforcement spent weeks planning the raids in locations where local prosecutors had agreed to bring charges, Mattivi said. The initial wave of targets included smoke and vape shots in Concordia, McPherson, Pratt, Salina, Topeka and Wichita. The seized products would be sent to KBI or private labs for testing, Mattivi said.
While Kansas is surrounded by states that have legalized marijuana to some extent, the drug remains illegal here. Kansas lawmakers have considered bills in recent years that would legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes, and the House passed legislation in 2021, but Senate leadership has stonewalled various proposals. The issue is expected to resurface in the next year’s legislative session, ahead of election season.
For now, Kobach said, the laws have to be enforced. And, he said, there are many illegal products available at stores in Kansas, including THC vapes and THC teas.
“In recent years, enforcement of our laws against marijuana and THC in Kansas have been intermittently or, in some jurisdictions, not enforced at all,” Kobach said. “And so this is an announcement that that period of lax enforcement is ending, and the KBI has taken the lead in identifying places that have become particularly brazen in their selling of marijuana products.”
Kobach and Mattivi traced the rise in illegal sales to the 2018 Farm Bill passed by Congress that legalized some hemp products.
“Since the Farm Bill passed, there’s been a growing acceptance of some of these products, whether they’re CBD or or THC,” Mattivi said. “Over time, these shops, I think, have pushed the envelope and pushed the envelope and pushed the envelope.”
Some of the products, Mattivi said, contain 75-95% pure THC.
“Part of the problem that we’re dealing with when it comes to THC and marijuana is that there has been a continuous rise in the concentration, or the level of purity, the level of THC, that’s present in these products,” Mattivi said. “This isn’t the 6 or 7% THC ditch weed that a lot of people in this state are familiar with.”
The KBI said the following stores were raided midday Wednesday: Two EZ Smoke and Vape locations in Wichita, Whiskey River Trading in Pratt, Cigarette Outlet in Pratt, Pratt Tobacco and Vape in Pratt, Space Out Smoke Vapor & Tobacco in Salina, Vapor 100 in Salina, Mountain Gypsy Vape Shop in Concordia, The Hanging Leaf in McPherson, and Sacred Leaf in Topeka.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA010165-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

(Screenshot)Fred Clark, a former Democratic state legislator and executive director of Wisconsin Green Fire, announced Wednesday he’s running for Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District
The 7th District covers much of northern and central Wisconsin. It is currently held by Republican Rep. Tom Tiffany, who recently announced he is running for governor. Clark served in the Legislature from 2008 to 2015. After leaving the Legislature, he worked for Green Fire, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting Wisconsin’s environment. 
In a video announcing his run, Clark complained that Congress is allowing President Donald Trump to institute tariffs that are harming the northern Wisconsin economy while cutting federal benefits and failing to keep the government funded. 
“We’re all starting to pay more for the things we need because this Congress refused to stop an insane tariff war against our best trading partners,” Clark said.  “And unbelievably, they just voted for a massive handout to billionaires that will add $3.4 trillion to our national debt while taking health care away from 270,000 Wisconsinites who need it the most, leaving the rest of us to pay more for health care that’s just getting worse.” 
On his campaign website, Clark says his priorities are rebuilding rural economies, maintaining secure borders while providing a pathway for immigrants to live and work in the country, expanding health care coverage and responsibly managing the state’s farms and forests. 
Jessi Ebben, a Republican from Stanley had filed to run for the seat before Tiffany announced his gubernatorial campaign. Republican state lawmakers from the area, including Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) could also get in the race.

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)Fresh off a plane from Washington, D.C., U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree held a press conference Wednesday afternoon to address the government shutdown that leaves many employees at the Portland International Jetport and airports across the country working without pay.
“I’m so sorry that this is the first day of a government shutdown,” Pingree said at the start of the conference. With Republicans in control of the White House and both branches of Congress, she said, “this is their shutdown.”
Pingree — who was the only member of Maine’s delegation to reject the resolution that would have kept the government funded — said this is the most unusual shutdown she’s experienced in her time in Congress and highlighted its potential to affect health care for many Americans. The issue has been at the crux of Democratic resistance to Republicans’ short-term plan to fund the government while budget negotiations continue.
Federal government shutdown begins, with no easy exit in sight

Pingree said she’s heard from small business owners and self-employed Mainers who fear that the proposed changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act currently dividing Congress could increase their health care costs at a time when cost of living already feels burdensome.
As the chair of a U.S. House of Representatives appropriations subcommittee, Pingree said she has spent many hours trying to negotiate with her colleagues on both sides of the aisle. She said there are people across the political spectrum that don’t want to see health care costs go up for their constituents, calling it a “universal issue.” 
Rural hospitals in her Republican colleagues’ districts will be hurt just as much as those in Democratic districts, she added. 
Hours before, the U.S. Senate again rejected the House-passed Republican bill that would fund the government for seven weeks without any of the health care provisions requested by Democrats — with Maine independent Sen. Angus King again breaking with Democrats to back the GOP measure.
Hoping to eventually win more Democratic support, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he plans to keep the Senate in session over the weekend to vote again and again on the Republican funding bill.
There are roughly 12,000 federal workers who live in Maine and could either be furloughed or asked to work with deferred pay. Mainers will also be impacted in other ways, for example 179,000 households receive federal nutrition benefits each month, funding for which could run out if the shutdown is prolonged. Those receiving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will continue to receive payments, though call and wait times for those programs are likely to be impacted.
Acadia National Park will remain mostly accessible to visitors, Sen. Susan Collins’ office announced Wednesday, and essential visitor services will continue as the region prepares for the busy autumn tourist season.
More power to the president?
In a statement posted after the initial vote Tuesday evening, King said it was one of the most difficult decisions he’s faced during his time in the Senate but that he was motivated by limiting the power of the Trump administration.
Although many Democrats saw that vote as an opportunity to stand up to President Donald Trump, King said voting against it would have actually given more power to Trump and members of his administration, including Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, and Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget.
“The irony, the paradox is, by shutting the government we’re actually giving Donald Trump more power,” King said in a social media video Tuesday night. 
He went on to quote Trump, who said he could “do things during a shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them,” referring to Democrats. King said those actions would not be good for American people, so his decision was “a vote of conscience on behalf of the state of Maine and the people of the United States.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who was the only House Democrat to back the Republican spending bill, agreed with King’s reasoning. In a statement Wednesday, Golden said he opposed cuts to Medicaid and would like to see certain health care tax credits extended, but the shutdown hurts Americans, the economy and “the irony is it has only handed more power to the president.”
Golden argued there is time to negotiate, but “this government shutdown is the result of hardball politics driven by the demands far-left groups are making for Democratic Party leaders to put on a show of their opposition to President Trump.”
While Pingree agrees the shutdown will give Trump “too much power,” she said, “this president has taken that power for the last nine months.” She pointed to the Trump administration’s comments about potentially firing federal employees during the shutdown rather than the usual practice of furloughing them, adding that it has been firing federal employees since day one.
Pingree said she could see a viable path forward if Republicans are willing to negotiate and that House members could be back by the end of the week to start working on a deal. 
However, her work on appropriations has left her with little trust that the other side will budge. Pingree also said the continuing resolution presented by Republicans is atypical because it includes cuts and funding changes — that Pingree described as “illegal and unconstitutional” — precipitated by the executive branch, rather than continuing the existing baseline budget. 
Health care costs on the line
The main issue Democrats tried to leverage ahead of the shutdown was extending health insurance subsidies.
Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidies lower the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Of the 61,000 Maine people who enroll through CoverME.gov, the state’s online marketplace, 85% rely on premium tax credits to reduce their monthly costs.
Last week, Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, told Maine Morning Star that she supports extending the credit but believed it should be addressed outside a must-pass spending bill. The Republican noted that, unlike funding the government, the subsidies didn’t have a Sept. 30 deadline. They expire at the end of the calendar year, though open enrollment begins Nov. 1 and the Maine Bureau of Insurance already announced higher insurance rates.  
Groups pressure Collins to extend health care subsidies. Collins says not yet.

Pingree said Congress can’t wait seven weeks — the length of time funded by the Republican proposal — to sort out the tax credits because many Americans will be forced to make decisions about their health care before then.
In a statement on Wednesday, Gov. Janet Mills blasted Republicans’ refusal to negotiate with Democratic lawmakers over including health care provisions in the must-pass bill.
“It’s entirely irresponsible that the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have shut down the federal government simply because they don’t want people across Maine and America to have access to health care and are unwilling to prevent health care costs from skyrocketing further,” Mills said. “Now, in addition to denying people vital care, Republicans are pushing our economy closer to the brink, putting critical services at risk, and requiring TSA workers, prison guards and members of the military to work without pay.”
Last month, Mills sent a letter to Maine’s congressional delegation warning that thousands of Mainers could see their monthly health premiums increase by as much as 117% if the subsidies are not extended. 
Democrats had also been pushing for a continuing resolution that reversed the Medicaid cuts made in the GOP’s sweeping budget reconciliation bill signed in July. 
Democrats are also growing increasingly frustrated with the Trump administration’s unilateral actions on spending, arguing it has significantly eroded Congress’ constitutional power of the purse.
Since Trump resumed office, his administration has rescinded and withheld numerous congressionally appropriated funds. 
Ahead of the government shutdown on Tuesday, Collins said the Government Accountability Office should sue the Trump administration over its efforts to freeze or unilaterally cancel spending approved by Congress. The GAO has cited the Trump administration for illegally impounding funding for electric vehicle charging, museums and libraries, Head Start, energy efficiency upgrades in K-12 schools, funding for medical research at the National Institutes of Health and funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
On Wednesday, the top Democratic Senate Super PAC Majority Forward released ads in Maine blaming Collins for the government shutdown.

The federal government shut down Wednesday after Congress failed to pass a funding bill before the beginning of the new fiscal year, States Newsroom and the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Idaho is home to numerous national forests, national monuments and even a section of Yellowstone National Park. 
For now, national forests and national parks remain open to visitors, officials said Wednesday. 
“Currently, the National Forests and Grasslands will remain open to visitors and wildland firefighting and disaster response will continue,” a U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesperson who did not give their name said in a written message to the Idaho Capital Sun on Wednesday. 
“This may change due to length of the shutdown.”

Jessica Maddock, a public affairs officer for the Sawtooth National Forest in Idaho, referred all questions from the Idaho Capital Sun about how the shutdown would affect national forests in Idaho to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s press office. 
In addition to providing the statement saying forests and grasslands remain open, the U.S. Department of Agriculture also provided a written statement in support of U.S. President Donald Trump that blamed Democrats for the shutdown. 
“The Democrat shutdown will cause real harm to American farmers, ranchers, and rural communities,” the unidentified U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesperson wrote. “President Trump has made it clear through his support of H.R. 5371 that he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”
Republicans control majorities in both chambers of Congress, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives, and control the White House. 
Websites for several national forests were updated Wednesday with similar political messages in support of Trump.
For example, the Sawtooth National Forest’s alerts website now features a banner that states, “The Radical Left Democrats shutdown the government. This government website will be updated periodically during the funding lapse for mission critical functions. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”
Yellowstone National Park’s website was also updated Wednesday to indicate it will remain open but services will be limited. 
“National parks remain as accessible as possible during the federal government shutdown. However, some services may be limited or unavailable,” the statement read. 
 Shutdown will harm wildlife habitat, animal welfare advocacy group says

On Wednesday, an organization called Humane World for Animals, which was formerly known as the Humane Society of the United States, expressed concern about how the government shutdown would affect wildlife, research animals, farm animals and companion animals.
The organization noted that while national parks remain open, trash collection will stop, which harms animals and their habitats.
“The federal government plays a significant role in upholding animal welfare, so there can be wide impacts on animals during a shutdown,” Humane World for Animals President and CEO Kitty Block and Humane World Action Fund President Sara Amundson said in a written statement. “Any cuts in staffing can leave animals — wild, farmed and companion — more vulnerable to harm.”
Efforts to reach Yellowstone National Park officials to discuss specific effects of the shutdown were not immediately successful Wednesday.
Most of Yellowstone is located in Wyoming and Montana, but a small 50-square mile roadless section is located in Idaho. 
Although officials controlling the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s press office placed the blame for the shutdown on Democrats, Democrats in Idaho disagreed, saying Democrats were willing to negotiate.
“Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House,” Idaho Democratic Party Chairwoman Lauren Necochea said in a written statement. “With all that power, they showed they can’t lead and don’t care to. Democrats fought to protect your health care, keep premiums from doubling for more than 100,000 Idahoans, and save our rural hospitals from devastating cuts. But Mike Simpson, Russ Fulcher, Jim Risch, and Mike Crapo stood with their party and turned their backs on Idaho families. Because of their choice, thousands of Idahoans will go without pay. That includes Forest Service firefighters, Mountain Home Air Force Base personnel, and BLM staff who manage our public lands. Farmers are waiting on $29 million in payments they are owed. Veterans will face delays in care, small businesses will lose access to critical loans, and Women, Infants and Children benefits, including food and formula, will run out. Republicans in Congress believe they are above accountability, and they proved it by forcing this shutdown.”

(Photo by Tim Henderson/Stateline)Home sales closings dropped in August and remain well below pre-pandemic levels as high prices and interest rates weighed on the market, according to an analysis this week by the Calculated Risk blog.
Home sales are on track for the worst year in decades, matching the 4 million annual sales in 1995, according to a separate realtor.com report Sept. 25.
Homebuying options remain slim for middle-income earners

Closed sales were down 1.8% nationally compared with August 2024, with the largest decreases in Las Vegas (down 16%), San Diego, California (down 10%), Grand Rapids, Michigan (down 9.5%), and Jacksonville, Florida (down 9.4%). Nationally, closed sales are down 27% since 2019.
Nevada is seeing more unemployment claims by construction laborers, carpenters and electricians in the Las Vegas area as home sales drop.
Bucking the trend were cities including Houston (up 12%); Des Moines, Iowa (up 9%), and Phoenix (up 4%), as well as the states of Indiana (up 7%) and Louisiana (up 5%).
September sales should be up from 2024 because interest rates declined slightly, according to a statement from the Calculated Risk blog. August prices rose 2% compared with 2024. Home sales for September are scheduled for release Oct. 23 by the National Association of Realtors.

(Michael M.

Leonardo Garcia Venegas, a construction worker in Baldwin County, alleges in the lawsuit that he was detained twice by ICE officers in May and June because of his appearance.
“When he goes to work on private property, Leo expects the freedom, as an American, to work in peace,” the complaint reads. “Yet, twice, Leo got the opposite: Immigration officers, wielding an overly broad grant of authority but no warrant, raided the private construction sites where Leo was working and rounded up all the workers who looked Latino—even citizens, like Leo, who had done nothing wrong.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
 The lawsuit filed on Tuesday in the Alabama Southern District Court names as defendants the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS); the U.S. Department of Justice and multiple government officials including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem; White House Border Czar Tom Homan and U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi.
According to the lawsuit, Venegas is an American citizen who was born in Florida. He moved to Alabama at age 14 and has lived in the state since then. 
Venegas was detained once on May 21 and again on June 12 while working on private construction sites. The complaint said during the first arrest on May 21, Venegas was arrested while recording his brother who was also being detained by ICE.
“Leo continued walking, but Officer Doe 1 suddenly sped up and grabbed Leo by the arm, causing Leo to exclaim, ‘Don’t touch me! I’m a citizen,’” the complaint said. “Without asking any questions, Officer Doe 1 forced Leo’s arm behind his back and began to push him to the ground.”
After being pushed to the ground, the lawsuit alleges, ICE agents took Venegas’ STAR  ID, a form of identification requiring significant documentation to obtain. However, the complaint says that officers still arrested him and accused him of having a fake identification. He was released after officers verified his Social Security number.
Local law enforcement agencies in Alabama partner with ICE, sparking concerns

The lawsuit alleges that white and Black workers were also on the site that was raided on May 21, but only Latino workers were targeted by ICE.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a press release Wednesday that Venegas was detained because he was obstructing an arrest.
“He physically got in between agents and the subject [ICE] were attempting to arrest and refused to comply with numerous verbal commands. Anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including U.S. citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest,” the department said.
During the second raid on June 12, the lawsuit said, Venegas was alone on a construction site he was working on when ICE officers approached and instructed him to exit the building to have his immigration status checked.
When Venegas presented his STAR ID, he was told it could be fake and he was then walked to an unmarked vehicle where his immigration status was checked and he was released along with two other workers the lawsuit claims were also unlawfully detained.
Attorneys for Venegas allege that the raids that led to Venegas’ detainments violate the Fourth Amendment.
“Immigration officers need a warrant, consent, or an emergency to enter the non-public areas of private construction sites (e.g., areas posted with no trespassing signs, fenced in, or enclosed). And they must have an objective factual basis for suspecting that the particular workers on that site are violating immigration laws,” the complaint said.
Venegas’ attorneys also allege that unconstitutional policies of DHS have allowed ICE officers to unlawfully search workers at construction sites.
“Under the administration’s policy, immigration officers can raid construction sites without a warrant and without any reason to believe the employers or employees on a particular site are violating immigration laws. Once on the property, officers can arrest anyone they think fits the profile of an undocumented worker and detain them until the worker proves their legal status,” Institute for Justice, the non-profit organization representing Venegas said.
Venegas said he feels like he’s unsafe going to work.
“It feels like there is nothing I can do to stop immigration agents from arresting me whenever they want,” he said in a press release Wednesday. “I just want to work in peace. The Constitution protects my ability to do that.”
DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement in response to a New York Times article Wednesday that ICE “does not arrest or deport U.S. citizens” and that “Any U.S. citizens arrested are because of obstructing or assaulting law enforcement.”
Jarred McClain, the lead attorney for the lawsuit, said in a phone interview Wednesday this case was filed to protect constitutional rights. 
“Our case is fundamentally about the rule of law, however people feel about immigration or law enforcement or ICE’s policies, our structure of government can’t survive unless we stand up and protect the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution,” McClain said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

He said school choice has led to closures and consolidations of public schools. (Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia School Board President Paul Hardesty said Wednesday that lawmakers — not education officials — are responsible for addressing the school closures and consolidations that are increasing across the state. School choice, he said, has led to tens of thousands of students leaving public schools over the past decade. 
“Where does that relief need to and have to come from? Right across the way,” Hardesty said. “There’s 134 members of the Legislature. They have the oversight. They have the ability to change the school aid formula, to recognize these rurally challenged, geographically challenged areas that we speak of. They have that ability. I and this board and this department do not.”
Hardesty’s comments came during the regular board of education meeting Wednesday morning. 
School closures have become more common as the state’s population declines and more students leave public schools for private and home schools. 
According to the state Department of Education, 16 public schools closed in 2024, up from 9 in 2023 and five in 2022. The 2025 numbers have not been finalized, but five public schools have closed so far, said Christy Day, director of the West Virginia Department of Education Office of Communication
Hardesty said the public has a “severe” misconception about who sets the state’s laws and rules concerning the state’s education system. He said he decided to make the comments after reading an opinion column about a school closure in Randolph County. The board of education can offer limited relief when it comes to school closures and consolidation, he said. 
Hardesty said he’s seen a “fundamental change” in the legislative process over the past decade – all in the name of school choice. He attributed the change to the influence of the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, a nonprofit organization of conservative state legislators that have advocated for expanding school choice. 
“They are the ones that proposed the school choice model and playbook for West Virginia and other states throughout the land, and they make no bones about what they’re trying to accomplish,” Hardesty said. “…on public education, I think they played a little heavy handed, and they’ve got some unintended consequences from their actions.”
Hardesty said the public school system has lost more than 35,000 students over the past decade “in the name of school choice.” While the Legislature has changed school law to incorporate school choice, it’s made no changes to the funding model, he said.
“The financial instability of the system continues to grow and continues to grow and gets worse and worse,” Hardesty said. 
Under the current school funding formula, counties receive state funding based on the number of students.  
The state’s Hope Scholarship gives families around $5,200 per student to use for private school or  homeschooling.The state’s school voucher program will need around $245 million next year, an increase of $144 million from the current year’s funding, according to the West Virginia treasurer’s office. 
Del. Joe Ellington, R-Mercer, chairman of the House Education committee, said through a House spokeswoman Wednesday that “it’s too early to say” if lawmakers will address the school funding formula during the next legislative session.
“But we have spent a good deal of time looking at the formula, and it’s possible the Public Education Subcommittee may have some discussions about it before the regular legislative session,” Ellington said. 
Because private schools can’t often accommodate students with Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), Hardesty said the Hope Scholarship has taken the state’s “best and brightest” and left the public schools with the responsibility of educating children with social, developmental and economic challenges.
“It’s left us the toughest to try to educate,” Hardesty said. “And we’ll take that challenge head on, but it’s hard. It’s very expensive to provide the services for those children.”

(Photo via Google Earth)A Bremer County hospital is being sued by a fired surgeon who alleges the hospital has put patients at risk.
Dr. John Matthew Glascock, a bariatric surgeon, is suing the Waverly Health Center and its CEO, Jodi Geerts, in Bremer County District Court. Court records indicate Glascock was employed by the hospital from July 2018 to Dec. 22, 2024, when he was fired.
According to the lawsuit, Glascock specializes in advanced laparoscopic surgery and bariatric surgery.
Prior to joining Waverly Health Center, he worked at Waterloo’s Covenant Medical Center from October 2002 through June 2018. Covenant hired Glascock to establish a surgical weight loss program, which later became known as the Midwest Institute of Advanced Laparoscopic Surgery. The lawsuit claims the program “was very profitable and generated millions of dollars in revenue for Covenant.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In 2017, the lawsuit claims, the Waverly Health Center began recruiting Glascock and encouraging him to leave Covenant. In July 2018, Waverly Health Center hired Glascock to conduct advanced laparoscopic and bariatric surgery, to be marketed under the brand name “Healthy You.” The lawsuit alleges the program grew each year and represented “a new and profitable service line” for the Waverly hospital, with Glascock performing “about 1,000 surgical cases that generated millions of dollars in additional revenue” for the hospital.
In January 2023, Geerts was named CEO of the hospital. In August 2024, Glascock’s first assistant for his surgeries, Jason Jampoler, accepted a traveling-nurse position and gave the hospital two weeks’ notice of his departure.
The lawsuit alleges Glascock then met with Geerts to impress upon her the importance of retaining Jampoler. Geerts allegedly responded by indicating the hospital would not try to prevent Jampoler’s departure and Glascock would have to use whomever the hospital chose for him to assist with surgeries.
Surgery halted due to ‘patient safety’ concerns
According to the lawsuit, shortly after Jampoler left, Glascock attempted to perform a weight-loss operation known as a sleeve gastrectomy. The nurse selected to assist with the operation was, the lawsuit claims, unfamiliar with Glascock and had never participated in a bariatric surgical case.
“It was clear from the start of the procedure that the nurse WHC selected lacked the skill, ability, and experience to be Dr. Glascock’s first assistant,” the lawsuit claims, adding that Glascock soon stopped the surgery. “In Dr. Glascock’s medical judgment, continuing the surgery without a qualified and competent first assistant put the patient’s safety at risk,” the lawsuit alleges.
Glascock alleges he then met again with Geerts and “stressed that the lack of a competent first assistant to work with him was, first and foremost, a patient safety issue, and that the issue had to be resolved before he conducted, or attempted to conduct, another bariatric surgery.”
Geerts, the lawsuit claims, again told Glascock he “would work with whomever WHC assigned him.” Glascock allegedly told Geerts he intended to raise the issue with the hospital’s board of trustees at its upcoming Sept. 23, 2024, meeting, but a few hours before that meeting was to begin, Geerts handed him a “termination notice,” indicating he was being fired without cause and was relieved of his duties, effective immediately.
By firing him “for no reason, Geerts and the Board of Trustees jeopardized the health, safety, and well-being of WHC’s ‘Healthy You’ patients, a significant number of whom were scheduled for surgical procedures or were involved in complex post-operative management and care,” the lawsuit claims. “While his former colleagues watched in horror, Dr. Glascock cleaned out his office and left the building.”
The lawsuit claims Glascock’s firing was in violation of public policy and constitutes wrongful termination and breach of contract. The lawsuit also seeks damages due to Geerts’ alleged intentional interference with his contract.
Waverly Health Center has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the hospital declined to comment on the case.
Glascock’s previous employer alleged fraud
The lawsuit against Waverly Health Center isn’t the first time Glascock has sued a former employer.
Court records show Glascock’s employment agreement with Covenant had contained a noncompete clause that restricted him from engaging in a medical practice in his area of specialty for a period of 18 months. The agreement included a buyout provision that could have relieved Glascock of the noncompete restriction in exchange for one year’s compensation, according to court records.
When Glascock quit in 2018, he asked that Covenant release him from the noncompete clause, but was unwilling to pay the buyout fee. Covenant refused the request, and Glascock then went to work at Waverly, less than 25 miles from Covenant. Covenant eventually hired a bariatric surgeon to replace Glascock, but according to subsequent court rulings, that surgeon worked at Covenant for less than two months before being fired for misconduct.
Covenant’s bariatric surgery clinic closed and lost its accreditation about one year after Glascock left. Glascock filed two lawsuits against Covenant, one alleging he was not awarded agreed-upon incentive payments, and one which sought to have the noncompete clause declared unenforceable.
Covenant then filed a counterclaim for damages resulting from Glascock’s alleged violation of the terms of his contract. In 2021, a judge ruled in favor of Covenant in the amount of almost $1.2 million — $507,000 plus $660,517 in interest and attorney fees.
Glascock appealed, but the Iowa Court of Appeals upheld the judgment and also awarded Covenant $82,330 in additional attorney fees tied to the appeal.
Covenant then sued Glascock again, alleging that despite his “substantial income and significant assets,” Glascock had refused to pay the judgment against him, forcing Covenant to go after his assets, which reportedly included more than $1 million worth of California real estate and an assortment of vintage motorcycles.
Covenant alleged Glascock committed fraud by transferring ownership of the motorcycles and other assets to his mother, Dorothy K. Glascock, and by working with an “asset-hiding firm” that openly promoted its ability to help people hide their assets from creditors.
“Glascock is a wealthy doctor, with millions of dollars in mansions and real estate who won’t to pay his debts and enlists his family to help hide his assets to avoid collection,” attorneys for Covenant alleged in court filings.
The lawsuit was dismissed shortly after attorneys for Glascock and Covenant informed the court a settlement had been reached.
Malpractice claims filed by patients 
In 2020, Glascock and Waverly Health Center were sued by the family of the late Byron Hesse, who had died hours after bariatric surgery at the hospital. The lawsuit alleged that during the operation, Glascock nicked Hesse’s spleen, then attempted a repair. During an autopsy, 3,850 milliliters, or roughly 130 ounces, of “liquid and clotted blood” were allegedly found in Hesse’s abdominal cavity and Hesse’s death was allegedly attributed to a surgical complication of the surgery performed by Glascock.
Glascock and the hospital denied any wrongdoing and the case was later dismissed with no public disclosure of any settlement.
In 2023, Glascock and Wavery Health Center were sued by another patient, Erin Barker of Oelwein, who claimed her botched bariatric surgery and Glascock’s subsequent alleged negligence left her “starving” and close to death.
In her lawsuit, she claimed that after her vision began to fail and her body began to shut down in the wake of her surgery, she was taken to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics where she underwent immediate surgery. “The doctors at UIHC told Erin that her body, specifically her organs, were 24 hours away from completely failing and she could have died within 48 hours,” the lawsuit alleged.
Glascock and Waverly denied any wrongdoing. The lawsuit was dismissed after a judge ruled that the certificate of merit that must accompany such lawsuits had been filed improperly as it was not in the form of a sworn affidavit.

Ron DeSantis is threatening to put lawmakers on the spot about property taxes during the heat of their reelection campaigns.
The governor, during a news conference at Jacksonville International Airport Wednesday, reiterated that he believes voters should decide the fate of the property tax in the state come the November 2026 election.

Lawmakers could “potentially have a special session on property tax right in the middle of the Republican primary season in July or August,” DeSantis said, although “I’m not saying we’re going to wait that long.”
He continued: “I don’t think a lot of these guys would want to vote the wrong way then. It’s interesting, when they know the voters are watching, they tend to govern themselves accordingly.”
The 2026 primary elections are set for Aug. 18.
The governor’s office is researching how the tax can be eliminated, in what he says is possibly the only state in the nation that could eliminate such a tax. In August, he said the structure of the state’s economy, enhanced by tourism, gives Florida the edge most states don’t. 
“I want to see something big enacted, that’s the whole goal. So, we’re doing that, we’ve got numbers, we’ve got language, we’re doing that. So, that will happen, you guys will see that in due time,” DeSantis said. 
“Nobody that I’ve talked to is really complaining about taxes at the state level. They appreciate the tax relief, they appreciate no income tax. What they’re being squeezed by are taxes at the local level, with the property taxes,” DeSantis said. 
DeSantis appeared with Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia. The stage was positioned next to what Ingoglia calls a “Donna Deegan Hologram,” a video board at JAX that plays an image of the mayor welcoming travelers to the city. 
On social media, Ingoglia has taken a particular interest in the cost of the display to taxpayers, reportedly $75,000. During the news conference, Ingoglia called the presentation “a stark example of tone deafness.”
The Florida House last month convened its Select Committee on Property Taxes in advance of the 2026 legislative session. That committee is digging into the matter, while the Senate remains without any counterpart.
As part of the state’s so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” efforts and in a push to prod lawmakers into eliminating property taxes, DeSantis and Ingoglia have been touring around the state, criticizing some local governments for spending practices. They’ve alleged overspending in several jurisdictions but few specifics of what they consider wasteful spending.
DeSantis promised more findings, including for universities and state agencies. 
The governor said the state may highlight cities that are, in his eyes, doing “a good job.” 
“It could be a blue city,” DeSantis said. “We’ll give you credit. And I know that there are red areas that have spent way too much.”

Affordable Housing Conference in Raleigh.

Schuetz, vice president of infrastructure and housing at Houston-based Arnold Ventures, was the keynote speaker at the event, which was attended by more than 1,500 affordable housing advocates, developers, policymakers and others. She leads the organization’s efforts to find evidence-based solutions to address critical housing issues.
“We haven’t been building enough homes to keep up with demand created by population growth and job growth for more than 15 years now,” Schuetz said. “Going back to the great financial crisis, we just stopped building housing altogether for about four or five years. It took a long time for industry to start digging itself out of a hole.”
Arnold Ventures is a philanthropic organization that focuses on evidence-based solutions to problems in the criminal justice system, education, health and public finance. It was founded by billionaire John Arnold and his wife Laura.
Schuetz is author of Fixer Upper: How to Repair America’s Broken Housing System, which assess how local state and national housing policies affect people and communities.
The housing shortage, Schuetz said, is more acute in areas with the best job markets, productive companies and great public schools.
“The Research Triangle area has a lot really well-paid jobs and a lot of great opportunities for people,” Schuetz said. “Places like coastal California, D.C. [District of Columbia], where I live, New York, Boston — many or those areas haven’t been building enough homes for 30 or 40 years, so we’ve got a lot of building to do to dig ourselves out of a hole.”
The top states for the housing shortage are large one like California and Texas, but North Carolina and others also have not built enough housing to keep up with demand, Schuetz said.
A recent study commissioned by the NC Chamber Foundation in partnership with the North Carolina Home Builders Association and NC REALTORS® found that the state needs 760,000 new housing units over the next five years to meet demand across its 100 counties.
Schuetz believes fixing the nation’s housing crisis will require bold policy changes from local, state and federal governments. She said states and local governments have adopted “a whole lot of rules that may be coming from a good place” but make it tougher for developers to build housing.
Schuetz supports revisions to zoning laws to allow more diverse housing types such as accessory dwellings, townhouses, duplexes and apartments. The rezoning process for rental housing also needs to be shorter, simpler and more transparent to help low- to moderate-income households, she said.
It’s also much harder to build starter homes for first-time homeowners, she said. “Part of the problem we have now is that the people who would have been homeowners probably 20 years ago are still in the rental market.”
Schuetz would like to see zoning reforms to encourage the building of more row houses, popular in cities such as the District of Columbia, Baltimore and Philadelphia, rather than the single-family detached homes that tend to dominate zoning in many areas.
She noted that existing homeowners are a formidable force when they go before local governments to protest development proposals, often complaining that projects are too big, out of scale and will put enrollment pressures on school districts.
“This is worse actually in a lot of communities that think of themselves as progressive, care about diversity but they really don’t want diversity in their own neighborhood,” she said.
Schuetz said she gave a talk in Chapel Hill last year where she heard Habitat for Humanity fought residents who professed to care about affordable housing for 15 years to get a project approved to provide such housing.
She said there has been a shift over the last several years with many more people showing up at local government meetings to support affordable housing and apartment complexes.
Schuetz advised developers to avoid “grand general statements” when trying to win over existing homeowners anxious about new projects and policy reforms. She said the quickest way to shut down a conversation about policy reform is to walk into a room and declare an end to single-family homes.
“Stay away from scary terms,” Schuetz said. “We want to talk about things in a way that is positive so we can make it easier to build homes of all shapes and sizes.”
Nate Blanton, a former Democratic candidate for the NC House, organized a successful fight against a large housing project in Garner, contending such developments can diminish the quality of life for existing residents. Blanton did not win the House race.
Blanton said the development of 300 single-family homes, 500 multi-family residential units and commerce space was not right for the area. It was too big and would have a negative impact on traffic, he said.
“We got the outcome we desired and the development was stopped,” Blanton said. “That’s virtually unheard of in North Carolina.”
Blanton acknowledged that some neighbors opposed the development because the mostly white community of homeowners didn’t want to see renters move nearby.
“When you say affordable housing, I can tell you what pops up in a lot of people’s minds,” Blanton said, acknowledging a legacy of racism that fuels distrust among some whites.

Scott Farmer, executive director of the N.C. Housing Finance Agency, said state and federal funding is essential to increase the state’s housing supply. But removing barriers through regulatory reforms would also help developers to quickly add more homes, he said.
“A lot of that has to do with local governments and some of their staffing capacities as well, which we recognize, but the biggest hurdle is financing and regulatory reform to speed up the construction process,” Farmer said.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)A federal government shutdown has Minnesota’s 18,000 civilian federal workers facing furloughs, reassignments, work without pay and threats of being fired.
Republicans need a handful of Democratic votes in the GOP-controlled Senate to overcome a filibuster and pass a spending bill to keep the lights on. Democrats, spurred on by a restive grassroots base, want concessions on the massive health care cuts Republicans passed in July. Republicans have refused. 
For now, that means all but the most essential services — airport security, food inspection, weather alerts, law enforcement — have been shuttered. 
The shutdown comes after months of attacks on federal workers by President Donald Trump and allies including Elon Musk, who ordered the termination of thousands of government employees and offered buyouts to 2 million workers. (Litigation is ongoing over the legality of the firings; many workers have been hired back.)
The constant denigration of the federal workforce had already lowered morale; now, a shutdown is making things worse — and federal employees are afraid to speak out, said Ruark Hotopp, national vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees for the district including Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. 
Federal workers in Minnesota do everything from data collection and processing of funding applications to park maintenance and management of the electrical grid.
Don’t expect to hear too much from them, however: Directives from federal agency leaders say workers are subject to discipline for speaking with the press or posting about their jobs on personal social media accounts, Hotopp said. Even the union is having some difficulty understanding what’s happening at various agencies. 
“Getting accurate information out of agencies is really difficult at the moment, because they’ve put gag orders and they’ve terrified everybody — so it’s kind of a hostage situation,” Hotopp said.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order in March instructing agencies to terminate their union contracts. Unions immediately sued, and a district judge on Tuesday ruled the president overstepped his authority. While the lawsuit is underway, agencies have decided to unilaterally cancel collective bargaining agreements.
At the same time, agencies are icing out union representatives, Hotopp said, making gathering data on furloughs, reassignments and firings more difficult. 
Some agencies still have some leftover funding available from the last stopgap funding bill, so some federal workers are working with pay for the time being. 
Others, like the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, where Hotopp works, are reassigning workers from positions that are funded through congressional appropriations to jobs that are funded by uninterrupted sources of funding, like the fees people pay on citizenship and visa applications. In some cases, Hotopp said, that means placing people in jobs that they didn’t agree to, and aren’t trained for. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Education, Commerce, Labor and Housing and Urban Development have all furloughed more than 70% of their workers, according to a New York Times tracker.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/edemployee-1024x750.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

Maggie Goodlander speaks at an event at Waypoint in Manchester on July 8. The congresswoman said Republicans are to blame for the government shutdown that began Wednesday. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Amid finger-pointing over the government shutdown that began on Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander said she saw only one Republican in the Capitol and congressional offices the day before.
She slammed it as a “stunning dereliction of duty.”
“The idea that they’re not showing up at all and that they’re not working in good faith is the reason why we are in this predicament, why we are on the cusp of a completely senseless and utterly preventable shutdown,” Goodlander said in a phone interview with the Bulletin Tuesday. “That’s the most stunning part of all of it.”
On Tuesday, the Senate failed to come up with a plan that would’ve funded the government for the short term at the start of the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. Republicans proposed keeping the government open for the next seven weeks using mostly current levels of spending. Democrats called for roughly $1 trillion in additional funding to extend a series of Affordable Care Act tax credits set to expire in December and reverse health care cuts made in July through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Senate Republicans — who hold a 53-47 majority — rejected the Democrats’ proposal and refused to budge on the health care requests, so all but two Democrats (and one independent who caucuses with the Democrats) in the Senate rejected the GOP spending plan Tuesday, leading the government to shut down at midnight.
Both parties, including Democrats like Goodlander, have pinned the shutdown on the other side of the aisle.
“No one who’s coming at this in good faith wants to see the government shut down,” Goodlander said. “This is a crisis of the Republican Party’s creation, and I’m sorry to say, but that is the truth. We’ve got a Republican-controlled White House, a Republican-controlled Senate, and a Republican-controlled House of Representatives.”
Meanwhile, Republicans — including President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson — have argued that by voting down the proposal that mostly maintains current levels of spending, Democrats are responsible for the shutdown.
In a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday ahead of the shutdown, 33% of respondents said both parties are equally to blame while 26% blamed Republicans more and 19% blamed Democrats more.
Before arriving in the Senate, the Republican spending plan passed the House (where no filibuster rule exists and only a simple majority was necessary) with only one Democratic vote. Goodlander, who voted no, wouldn’t say what concessions Republicans would’ve needed to make in that spending plan or a future alternative plan for her to vote for it.
Still, she bashed Republicans for not extending the Enhanced Premium Tax Credits set to expire at the end of the year.
“We know that if these tax credits are not extended, it’s going to spark what one of my Republican colleagues called a death spiral,” Goodlander said. “It’s going to put us in a place where people will not be able to get the care that they need.”
Republicans have alleged Democrats are trying to extend free health care to immigrants who aren’t authorized to be in the country. Goodlander called this “a bald-faced lie” and “completely at odds with what our laws actually say.” Indeed, undocumented immigrants aren’t legally eligible for the programs Democrats are seeking funding for and their proposal doesn’t give them eligibility.
As the country braces for a lengthy shutdown, Goodlander emphasized her support for a series of bills that would’ve ensured military service members, civilian defense workers, military contractors, TSA agents, and air traffic controllers are paid during shutdowns as well as a bill to revoke the pay of Congress members during shutdowns. However, none of those have advanced out of committee, and they’re all far from becoming law. Essential government employees reporting to work Wednesday are doing so without pay. Goodlander also sent a letter to the House administrator requesting her House salary be withheld during the shutdown.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/goodlandershutdown-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)First, you tap into racism.
Several decades ago, Republican campaign consultant Lee Atwater described how, as The Nation put it, “Republicans can win the vote of racists without sounding racist themselves.” Atwater outlined the “Southern Strategy” in a 1981 interview, but its roots stretch out much deeper into America’s political past and wrap around its present.
If you care to listen, it’s not difficult to hear how state and federal Republican policies on immigration, crime, and diversity initiatives, among other areas, rely on the predictability of America’s entrenched racism. In New Hampshire, there are echoes of the strategy in the way House leaders antithetically defend their crusade against DEI as the restoration of the “principle of equal treatment under the law.” Too many Republicans, it seems, desire equity only insofar as the nation’s long practice of systemic discrimination is preserved, even as they deny that those discriminatory practices exist. 
New Hampshire’s push for a ban on the teaching of “divisive concepts” — essentially a statutorily mandated American history puff piece — was born of this preservation effort, too. As far as the anti-DEI gang is concerned, this country was progressing just fine before the pesky Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts came along and mucked up the works. 
The Southern Strategy also provides the foundation for the way state Republicans talk about immigration, particularly sanctuary cities and the concept of “illegal” human beings. They’ve banned those sanctuaries now, freeing the Granite State from an imagined scourge that would rank toward the very bottom of voter concerns had a cluster of ambitious Republicans not recognized it as a right-wing layup. And, if there was any doubt about just how blatant the national party has become in its approach, here are a couple of recent headlines: “US Supreme Court OKs racial profiling in Los Angeles immigration enforcement” and “Trump’s DC rhetoric echoes history of racist narratives about urban crime.”
The right can’t even talk about the cause of this week’s shutdown — ultimately a divide over whether the federal government should help poor people receive health care — without whipping up bigotry. The accusation that Democrats want to give free care to unauthorized immigrants is inaccurate, as the Trump administration and members of Congress no doubt know, but from the Republican perspective the facts don’t matter even a little bit. Their base hears “money for illegals” and that ensures that the truth of it, which is that Democrats are pushing for the extension of subsidies and the restoration of Medicaid funding so poor Americans don’t fall through the health care cracks, is washed away in a false fury.     
What we’re witnessing in New Hampshire and the nation right now is a lot of things, but progress is not one of them.
From there, you create moral panic.
One of the defining characteristics of this Republican moment is its inseparability from a strain of Christian nationalism that is much more interested in stonings than the benevolence it professes to embrace. While the true aims of the movement are clearly evident in the label, the policies are marketed as protections for the American family. Protect them from what? Anything and everything deemed by Christian nationalists to be unchristian, which tags an ever-expanding list of out-groups for persecution and eviction.  
To that end, New Hampshire lawmakers have pursued book bans and pro-discrimination bathroom bills, while hijacking reproductive health care decisions from women and their doctors, outlawing gender-affirming care, and adopting “parental rights” measures that create a framework in which adults can leverage their own moral panic to dictate school curriculum.
Taken together, the policies deliver a hard fact: There’s a selective and diminishing guest list for the great society as envisioned by American conservatives.
Finally, you keep corporations, the wealthy, and their media-savvy champions happy enough so they’ll accept all the crimes and immorality that in other eras would have ended a presidency and a movement.
The same week that The Wall Street Journal dropped that bombshell about President Donald Trump’s gross contribution to Jeffrey Epstein’s birthday book and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of racial profiling, The New York Times published a story that flew under the radar.
“The Trump administration is quietly dismantling efforts by the Internal Revenue Service to shut down a slew of aggressive tax shelters used by America’s biggest multinational companies and wealthiest people,” read the lead of that story from reporter Jesse Drucker.
Despite its small splash, what the story describes is part of the main event for the large swath of American conservatives who hate taxes even more than they love Christian nationalism or translating racism into policy. When considered along with the administration’s giant tax cut law and the ongoing gutting of the IRS — and the ever-expanding $1 trillion tax gap — it’s clear that Republicans don’t see economic inequality as the problem. In fact, they see it as the answer.
In New Hampshire, that means business tax cuts, tax repeals that largely benefit corporations and the wealthy, universal school vouchers — all while services for lower-income families are being cut or defunded. Amid all of this, overstressed homeowners and renters are running out of ways to make their household numbers work as the cost of everything from groceries to auto repairs to child care eliminates options and opportunities. 
Alleviating those burdens — and for as many people as humanly possible — should be job one for any politician, but that’s not how politics works.
The architects of this modern Republican tent have worked long and hard to achieve the level of power they now hold. And nothing is more frightening to the powerful than ceding even an ounce of it. So now they are prioritizing their continued majorities through gerrymandering, which disempowers individual voters and should be reprehensible to anyone who claims to be a public servant, whatever political party they call home. They are also, under the banner of “voting integrity,” making it so some of the people most likely to vote against them will never get the chance. 
But “voting integrity” is a lie born of an even bigger lie from Trump and the bulk of his party: that the 2020 election was stolen. Do you know how many cases of election fraud there were that year, collectively, in the six battleground states targeted by Trump’s wrath? Fewer than 475 — “a number that would have made no difference in the 2020 presidential election,” the Associated Press reported.
Of course, so loud and persistent are the echoes of Trump’s lie that the facts about “voting integrity” did nothing to stop New Hampshire (which has seen fewer than 20 convictions for voter fraud in total over the past decade) from enacting one of the most restrictive voter ID laws in the country last year.
That’s not integrity; it’s just disenfranchisement. As the Brennan Center for Justice reported in 2023, “There is a growing mountain of evidence that strict voter ID laws disproportionately impact voters of color.”
Even amid this swell of bigotry, hypocrisy, and orchestrated chaos, in many ways the America of 2025 resembles the America that I was born into more than a half-century ago. Trump is racing with the same baton that President Ronald Reagan once clutched.
But what does feel new is that the Republicans are succeeding at pulling off maybe their greatest con of all: convincing a not insignificant number of Americans that the primary instruments of general public well-being are actually the “enemy within.” Public education is the enemy. Affordable and accessible health care is the enemy. Scientific research is the enemy. Environmental protections are the enemy. Clean energy is the enemy. Voting rights are the enemy. Civil rights are the enemy. Progress, in all its forms, is the enemy.
America is actively choosing racism, Christian nationalism, and economic policies that favor the wealthy over systems designed, however imperfectly, to give more people a better chance at a good and decent life. That is what passes as Republican populism.  
I know that not every conservative can recognize themself in what I’ve just described, that there are many who envision more light than darkness at their desired end. But what they should know, too, is that they own the means all the same.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/statehousecloudydome-1024x652.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

The Women, Infants and Children program, or WIC, has about two weeks’ worth of funding to keep feeding low-income Washingtonians, according to the state Department of Health. But if participation rises beyond current levels, that could be more like one week. 
Nicole Flateboe, executive director of Nutrition First, the state’s WIC association, pegged the available contingency funding on Tuesday as lasting one week. 
She called money running out a “disaster.” 
“We will have babies being born to low-income women who will not have any breastfeeding support, and they will have no way to get infant formula if they’re not breastfeeding,” Flateboe said.
The program’s plight is one of the clearest examples of how a shutdown could affect everyday Washingtonians who aren’t federal employees at risk of furlough. Unlike entitlement programs like food stamps, WIC is subject to the annual federal appropriations in Congress, making it susceptible to a shutdown.
The White House has also signalled there would be no money to accept new WIC applicants starting immediately, meaning no new babies getting fed under the program.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported Tuesday that WIC would continue during the shutdown “subject to the availability of funding.”
The federal government shutdown began at midnight Tuesday, as Republicans and Democrats in Congress couldn’t find agreement on short-term funding to keep the government open. Most Democrats refuse to support a stopgap funding bill that doesn’t extend subsidies that help people afford health insurance, and Republicans haven’t budged on this issue.
This is the first federal government shutdown in almost seven years.
In Washington, over 200 clinics serve over 212,000 women and their children under 5 years old annually under the WIC program, according to the state. WIC helps nearly one-third of all newborn babies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture funds the program, while the state Department of Health administers it. 
Nationally, the program serves nearly 7 million Americans.
WIC helps mothers with access to healthy food, breastfeeding support, nutrition education and health screenings. Research has shown participation in the program helps limit low birth weights and reduce maternal mortality.
“The services that WIC provides reduce infant deaths, improve the growth of infants and children, increase immunization rates, increase access to community supports, and help ensure early prenatal care for pregnant participants,” Brittany Tybo, director of the Department of Health’s Office of Nutrition Services, said in a press release. “All of these benefits are at risk for WIC families, and the risk increases the longer the shutdown continues.”
The agency advises families on WIC to keep using their benefits as usual. 
A shutdown at the start of the federal fiscal year like this one is particularly challenging, as states have little funding left over and haven’t received funding for the new fiscal year. The week’s worth of contingency is made up of WIC money not yet used.
The state Department of Health said a shutdown would result in temporary layoffs or work hour reductions starting Oct. 6 for about 50 employees whose jobs are tied to federal dollars. Most are in the division that manages WIC.
Flateboe thinks this will result in confusion for enrollees, as they seek help from staff unfamiliar with the program. And the Trump administration’s staffing cuts in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service have already hampered its ability to help, she said.
“It’s a big mess,” Flateboe said. “We don’t have a lot of trust that the USDA is going to handle this real seamlessly.”
In Colorado, state lawmakers on Tuesday approved millions in funding to backfill WIC assistance due to the shutdown.

Every day seems like a new crisis: vaccines, Tylenol, turning off environmental monitoring, curtailing food stamps and then not reporting on hunger. All of this is shocking, but not unexpected. It’s the natural outcome of all of us retreating into our echo chambers and only listening to information from people we like and agree with. 
This is true on both the right and the left. Everyone everywhere feels the system is stacked against them; the government isn’t listening to them. We are in a place where information has overloaded our circuits, and we are just going with what is safe and comfortable.
Science is truth. And truth makes people uncomfortable. So instead of embracing the truth, we are figuratively and literally shooting the messengers. 
Yet, science makes America – and Georgia – great. 
Science and technology support over 60% of the jobs in Georgia. And over half of those jobs don’t require a college degree. These are the jobs that fuel Georgia’s economy and make us a great place to do business. Georgia has over 50 public universities and technical schools, an enviable start-up community, and a booming agricultural sector. 
Ironically, science is also the reason we can all use our phones to spread misinformation and convince people to shoot at federal workers. 
So how did we get here?
For too long, scientists have been hiding in their ivory towers, tossing truth bombs over the walls, and not bothering to explain themselves. They have been taking data and doing research but not ensuring the fruits of their labors benefit all. The academic system does not reward community interaction, and at times, it belittles it. 
And when people started questioning science results – scientists fought back with data! And pie charts! And the most obtuse language possible! Because, we naively believe the facts speak for themselves. 
So when people decided to look for someone to blame, there was a vacuum of information, and a lack of trust – and bam – here we are. On the precipice of our own Cultural Revolution – which by the way – China is just now recovering from 50 years later. 
Don’t take this as me placing all the blame on scientists – throughout history those speaking “for the people” attempt to silence those with inconvenient facts as “elitists.”
The bad news is that our amazing system has already been burned to the ground. How do we avoid sinking into 50 years of poverty, disease, and starvation? 
All of us must take a cue from those around us who are marching on the streets, who are giving aid to kids whose parents have been deported, who are cobbling together resilient communities. Those who, despite their fear, are standing up for what is right.
We speak up and proclaim: “We need science. We need scientists.”
The key to a vibrant democracy, and functioning scientific community, is meaningful, open, dialogue. It’s time for us – all of us – to put down our ire. Let’s get uncomfortable. Let’s talk to our neighbors. 
Scientists can do more to reward those who do community outreach and learn to communicate in a trustworthy way. 
Georgia policymakers could create a science and technology policy office to facilitate smooth integration of science and breakthroughs from universities to businesses, to public policy, to government offices, to the Georgians who need it. 
Businesses could program loudly and proudly how they need trained workers (who don’t have the measles) and a thriving science and technology ecosystem in order for Georgia to be open for business. 
Atlanta rose out of the ashes once before. And now we are the place to be in the Southeast. It’s time for all of Georgia to be the shining example of what the next-generation science and technology ecosystem can be. How things learned at the University of Georgia can help our farmers and our biotech companies. How a public health initiative from Georgia State University can increase the health of all Georgians (because, let’s face it, if people aren’t healthy, they can’t work, and if they can’t work, they cannot afford to get healthy).

The impasse currently centers on the U.S. Senate, where 60 votes are needed to advance the legislation. Washington’s two senators, both Democrats, voted against a Republican-backed seven-week funding patch that fell short Tuesday on a 55-45 vote. They supported a Democratic counterproposal that failed 47-53.
A major sticking point for Democrats is that they want to see the extension of expiring tax credits for people who purchase health insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Republicans want to negotiate on that issue separately.
Below is a roundup of statements that members of Washington’s congressional delegation have issued so far.
The Senators
Sen. Patty Murray
We have been calling for Republicans to work with us to keep the government funded, to address the health care crisis they created, and to stop people’s premiums from skyrocketing. Republicans haven’t just stuck their heads in the sand, they’ve outright refused to get serious about a solution.
Full remarks
Sen. Maria Cantwell
I heard Speaker Johnson on the television this morning saying that extending the ACA credits is a December issue. Well, it’s not really a December issue if people start in October and November making decisions and locking themselves into higher health insurance rates.
Floor remarks on Tuesday, via X
House Republicans
Rep. Dan Newhouse
The blame for the impending shutdown lies squarely on the shoulders of Senate Democrats. Their refusal to keep the government open will have devastating impacts on our farmers, veterans, and small business owners. Enough of the partisan games.
Statement via X, on Tuesday
Rep. Michael Baumgartner 
The Democrats should step back from their short-sighted plan to use a government shutdown to placate their base and attempt to expand Obamacare. It won’t work. Important Federal employees and tax-paying citizens will suffer as a result.
Statement via X, on Tuesday
House Democrats
Rep. Suzan DelBene 
Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House, and have led the country into a government shutdown. Families have been struggling to make ends meet as a direct result of Trump and Republican policies that have raised prices on everyday goods and slashed health care for millions. 
There is a clear path forward out of this crisis – stop the health care cuts and extend the Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies. 
Full statement
Rep. Pramila Jayapal
Democrats have been in Washington, D.C., ready to negotiate a bill that cancels the horrific Republican cuts, lowers costs, and saves health care. Meanwhile, Speaker Johnson sent his Members home to do fancy fundraisers with billionaires and refused to negotiate.
Once again, Republicans are choosing chaos over governing.
Full statement
Rep. Adam Smith
Instead of working across the aisle to keep the government open and protect the services Americans rely on, Donald Trump and House Republicans forced a reckless government shutdown.
My Democratic colleagues and I remain ready to work today to reopen the government with a bipartisan agreement that protects health care and delivers real solutions for the American people.
Full statement
Rep. Marilyn Strickland
Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. They fully own 100% of the shutdown.
Statement via X, on Wednesday
Rep. Kim Schrier
I know that a prolonged shutdown hurts all of us, especially working families, seniors, and our brave service members here in the Eighth District. I also cannot vote for a funding bill that is harmful to the people I represent.

Phil Murphy and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul with then-U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg at a Jan. 31, 2023, event in New York commemorating new funding for the Gateway rail project. The Trump administration this week ordered a delay to the tunnel plan, citing the federal government shutdown. (Edwin J. Torres/NJ Governor’s Office)The Trump administration froze billions in funding for New York infrastructure projects this week, including money paying for new trans-Hudson River tunnels carrying New Jersey’s rail traffic into New York City.
Russel Vought, director of the federal Office of Management and Budget, said on social media that the projects are being delayed “to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.”
The cuts would affect the $16 billion Hudson Tunnel project, known as Gateway, and New York City’s expansion of the 2nd Avenue subway, Vought said.
The tunnel project is critical to mass transit between New York and New Jersey. NJ Transit’s northeast corridor line — the busiest commuter rail line in the nation — runs through aging tunnels that the project would replace.
Those tunnels were severely damaged during Hurricane Sandy, and failures there could snarl commutes within a region that accounts for 10% of the nation’s economic output.
Here’s how our next governor says they’ll make NJ more affordable

The U.S. Department of Transportation in a statement said it had chosen to pause funding for the projects because of their size, calling them “arguably the largest infrastructure initiatives in the Western Hemisphere” but nodded to political motivations by attacking Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both New York Democrats.
“Thanks to the Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jefferies (sic) shutdown, however, USDOT’s review of New York’s unconstitutional practices will take more time. Without a budget, the Department has been forced to furlough the civil rights staff responsible for conducting this review,” the department said in an unattributed statement.
The attack is a reference to the ongoing federal government shutdown, which began Wednesday after Republicans who hold majorities in both chambers of Congress failed to reach an agreement with Democrats on government funding amid an impasse over Affordable Care Act subsidies that help low-income Americans pay for health insurance.
Those subsidies would expire at the start of 2026 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the GOP bill that extended tax cuts enacted in Trump’s first term.
The department said the shutdown would extend its review of the projects but did not provide a timeline, adding the funding was frozen under a yet-to-be-enacted rule that bars race and sex-based contracting requirements in federal grants.
The development led to some sniping in New Jersey’s governor’s race, with Democratic nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill criticizing Trump for “targeting New Jersey by gutting this funding” and claiming GOP opponent Jack Ciattarelli will not fight to make sure the tunnel project is completed. Ciattarelli campaign spokesman Eric Arpert said Sherrill “owns this shutdown and is responsible for any negative impacts on Gateway tunnel project and other NJ priorities.”
Thomas Prendergast, CEO of the Gateway Development Commission, a bistate body tasked with overseeing construction of the tunnels and other Gateway projects, in a statement said the commission “complies with all federal laws and regulations” and would continue to do so.
“We remain focused on keeping the project on scope, schedule, and budget,” Prendergast said.
Top officials at NJ Transit and the New Jersey Department of Transportation said they were not warned of the funding freeze ahead of time, but appeared unworried about its impact on the new trans-Hudson tunnels.
“As you know, the project is scheduled for completion in 2035. That’s a long time away, and this is a temporary issue. I’m sure it’ll work out,” said NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri, a former Gateway Commission CEO. “I think everybody on our side of the river wants to ensure there’s compliance, and I’m sure they will.”
New Jersey Transportation Commissioner Fran O’Connor noted the freeze did not impact other projects in Gateway’s portfolio, including the Portal North Bridge, which would replace a 115-year-old bridge that takes trains across the Hackensack River and risks snarling train traffic outside of New York City.
But he added it is unclear when federal funding for new tunnels crossing the Hudson River might resume.
“We’re going to have to wait and see,” O’Connor said following an unrelated event in Vineland. “I don’t have a crystal ball on that.”
The immediate impact of the freeze is unclear, though the U.S. Department of Transportation said it would block a pending $300 million reimbursement for the 2nd Avenue Subway.
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who said he was proud to work with Trump’s first administration on the Portal North Bridge, appeared hopeful the pause would be short-lived.
“With millions of commuters depending on the Hudson Tunnel Project and tens of thousands of jobs on the line, I’m confident that we’ll be able to work with the Trump Administration to keep Gateway moving forward,” Murphy said in a statement. “A project of this importance should be above politics.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)After Congress missed its deadline to fund the federal government by the start of October, local impacts on Michiganders are already starting to be felt, according to three University of Michigan faculty members. 
Many questions about those impacts, however, are hard to answer without knowing how long the shutdown will last — most shutdowns in the past have lasted less than a week. 
But as Stephanie Leiser, a lecturer at the Ford School of Public Policy, said, this shutdown may be different. 
“In these sorts of budget crises, it’s often historically been some sort of recession or major economic shock that’s precipitating the crisis,” she said. “But in this case, it’s really just politics. And so it’s who’s going to blink and who’s going to dig in.”
Some of the impacts of this shutdown will be felt in the immediate future — for average Michiganders, that might look like an inability to make an appointment with a government office or get help with services. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Dr. Christopher Friese, a professor in the School of Nursing, said that in Michigan, this would be one of the more notable impacts. “We’re one of the older states in the nation,” he said. “And Medicare beneficiaries won’t be able to get questions answered from Medicare.”
Friese added that in cases of food recalls — including a current recall of packaged meals tied to a listeria outbreak — support to county health authorities from the CDC would be impaired. 
Not all federal support will disappear right away. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, has already sent out its checks for October, meaning that those who rely on this assistance will have money through the month. But if the shutdown becomes lengthy, Dr. Jennifer Garner, a professor of nutritional sciences, said, “if those October pavements for November are delayed, then really the impacts on SNAP would be seen in November, and that’s where there would be a very large impact on the population of Michiganders who use that program.”
It is not just food assistance programs at risk with a shutdown, Garner warned, but food systems more broadly — including Michigan’s agricultural economy. Because the current federal farm bill is seven years old, farm bill-authorized programs and expenses are dependent on a federal budget. 
“Agricultural activities will feel the effects of the shutdown,” Garner added. 
And in many ways, Friese noted, the longer the shutdown, the more intense the effects will be. Grant approvals, for example, are largely halted during a government shutdown. 

“What we’ve experienced in the past in Michigan, when we’ve had shutdowns or we’ve had employees who can’t process grants before, is a huge backlog,” he said.
President Donald Trump has also said that he intends to permanently lay off federal government employees who are deemed non-essential under the shutdown, as opposed to temporary furloughs. 
Friese warned that this could exacerbate existing issues caused by federal workforce layoffs earlier this year — for example, he said, the National Cancer Institute had lost 10% of its staff prior to the shutdown, which had essentially stopped communications of messages about cancer prevention and cancer screening.
“If you were to shut down and the administration moves for more layoffs within HHS or other agencies, what you’ll see is just a continued erosion of public health work,” he added.
The federal government shutdown came as state legislators in Lansing were able to pass a continuation budget to fund the state for the next eight days — but if both the state and federal governments were to be shut down at the same time, Michigan would find itself in an unprecedented situation of how to fund essential services, Leiser said. 
“Does the state actually have cash reserves that it could survive on?” she said. “I think the money is there, but I don’t know if legally that scenario has ever really been played out.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/capitolnight-1-1024x769.jpeg,,,2025-10-01 15:57:52.669947

Test prep, mentorship opportunities and professional development will also be available.
As long as resident teachers commit to teaching in a “critical shortage area,” Elementary Education and Special Education students can also expect mentoring sessions, professional development opportunities and licensure testing support.
During the 2025 session the Legislature made $2,968,855 available to the Mississippi Department of Education to bolster its residency program. The Mississippi Teacher Residency, a program meant to help staff school districts struggling with teacher retention and recruitment, drew its initial funds in 2019 from the W. Kellogg Foundation and then also from American Rescue Plan Act dollars. 
Capacity for the program can now increase from serving 35 to 236 resident teachers each year.
Eligibility is now open to prospective teachers, teachers seeking additional endorsements or licensure help, and currently enrolled education students. The former version of the program only offered tuition waivers and stipends to bachelor’s degree holders looking to get a masters’ in education. Applicants also now apply through their universities as opposed to through MDE.
The Mississippi Delta region and southwest Mississippi have the most teacher vacancies, according to a survey conducted by the Mississippi Department of Education. On July 7, Clarksdale Municipal School District and Vicksburg-Warren School District posted the most full-time certified teaching vacancies to their sites with 40 and 59 jobs posted respectively.
A majority of Mississippi school districts are categorized as “critical shortage areas,” with 56% claiming the title. Nearly every school district in the Delta region is considered a ‘critical shortage area.’ These districts also received failing or near failing scores in the accountability ratings.
In a recent Mississippi Today story, Delta area teachers-in-training expressed frustration with the lack of preparation they received for licensure, particularly with the PRAXIS licensure exams.
“It left me feeling overwhelmed as I tried to catch up, and it significantly impacted my confidence, academic performance and health,” Timolin Howard told Mississippi Today.
The nine Mississippi universities and the breakdown of funds is as follows:

Delta State University – $280,000
Jackson State University – $272,417
Mississippi College – $119,684
Mississippi State University – $1,298,981
Mississippi University for Women – $140,000
Mississippi Valley State University – $279,000

Reena Szczepanski and Sen. Peter Wirth meet before the beginning of the Oct. 1, 2025 special session in the Roundhouse. In September, both members were targeted by bomb threats. Police later determined there were no explosives, but investigations are ongoing. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Republican and Democratic members in both chambers of New Mexico Legislature began the 2025 special legislative session Wednesday with bipartisan condemnation of political violence, which they described as a growing and worrying trend.
They had many recent examples to point to: the recent killing of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk in Utah; arson at the New Mexico Republican headquarters; the shooting death of a Minnesota House Leader, Democrat Melissa Hortman; bomb threats at the homes of Sen. Peter Wirth and Rep. Reena Szczepanski in Santa Fe; and the sentencing in August of Solomon Peña, convicted of orchestrating shootings at the homes of prominent elected Democrats. 
“Why would someone fire bullets at home to the members of this chamber? Why would someone fire bomb the Republican headquarters?” said Wirth, the Senate majority leader. “It just makes no sense.”
After Kirk’s killing, NM and Utah governors discuss disagreeing without violence

Sen. Bill Sharer (R-Farmington), the Senate minority leader, spoke after Wirth, saying political violence must cease “unequivocally, undeniably and immediately.”
“Disagreements are no longer just debates. They’ve become battlegrounds. When someone holds a different view, they aren’t just opposed, they’re vilified and dehumanized, or worse, silenced through fear or violence,” he said. “This is not who we are.”
In the House, Szczepanski, Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena) and Speaker Javier Martinez (D-Albuquerque) all took a few minutes to decry political violence. Martinez said he recently held his wife as she tearfully testified about the trauma she and her children still face from Peña shooting up their home. He was sentenced to 80 years in prison last month.
In the Senate, lawmakers bowed their heads for a moment of silence for Kirk and Melissa Hortman, the Minnesota Democrat killed along with her husband in July. 
The House held a similar moment of silence, where Martinez called on his peers to “show how a civil functional government can work, to deliver for its people.” 
Then he added:

Boone argued the school district, its superintendent and assistant superintendent, library media director and the principal and assistant principals of Lowell High School and Lowell Middle School had violated her civil rights by implementing policies to prevent her from contacting Lowell Area Schools staff, and from posting references to Lowell Area Schools employees on social media.
Boone is also embroiled in a separate civil suit filed by Lowell Area Schools Library Media Director Christine Beachler who argued Boone had waged a yearslong “smear campaign” against her, falsely accusing Beachler of providing pornography to children. 
Boone has countersued, accusing Beachler of defamation, arguing Beachler “used offensive and inappropriate language regarding Boone in her interviews, documentaries, and podcasts.”
Boone’s children attend Lowell area schools. She has opposed library books with LGBTQ+ themes and according to court documents, has criticized the school district arguing it is promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, social and emotional learning, “alternate sex and gender ideologies, and other liberal political ideology” making several posts to social media criticizing the district and specific officials and employees. 
After criticizing a Lowell High School teacher on social media, Boone was sent a letter from Principal Steve Gough requesting she “cease and desist from any reference to any Lowell Area Schools employee on social media and/or other public communication platforms,” and asking that she have no contact with staff without permission from the building principal or superintendent. 
Boone argued these policies violated her First Amendment right to free speech, and that the policies are unconstitutionally vague. 
However Judge Paul Maloney of the U.S. District Court Western District of Michigan Southern Division, granted the defense’s motion to dismiss Boone’s case, concluding that her complaint failed to state a claim for which relief can be provided.

“Boone fails to allege that the School violated her First Amendment rights by requiring her to contact a principal or superintendent before directly contacting School employees. Members of the public ‘have no constitutional right to force the government to listen to their views,” Maloney wrote in his opinion. “It follows, then, ‘that it is not a constitutional violation to require that parents, if they wish to be heard, communicate only with particular staff members or do so only at a specified time and place.’”
Boone case dismissed
These policies only regulate whom Boone can communicate with, not the content of her messages, Maloney wrote, emphasizing that Boone was not prohibited from communicating concerns about her children’s education or treatment. 
“Such a restriction is not a First Amendment violation and a far cry from a ‘ban’ or ‘restraint’ on her speech,” Maloney wrote, later noting that Boone also failed to show that she had been prevented from continuing to post on social media. 
Maloney also dismissed Boone’s claim of a Title IX violation for lack of standing and claims tied to state-law for a lack of jurisdiction.

(The URI Good 5 Cent Cigar File Photo)After a four-year review process, the University of Rhode Island’s (URI) 27-member police department is now accredited by the state’s premier law enforcement standards organization for the first time in its history, the university announced Tuesday.
Accreditation awarded Sept. 24 by the Rhode Island Police Accreditation Commission (RIPAC) allows URI to join 45 other law enforcement organizations across the state that have met such standards — including Rhode Island’s other public colleges.
The Community College of Rhode Island and Rhode Island College were both accredited by RIPAC in 2021. That same year, URI started its road to accreditation after Michael Jagoda, the university’s assistant vice president of public safety, became the department’s chief of police.
“Accreditation is the gold standard for making sure we’re providing superior services to our community,” Jagoda said in a statement. “We’re making sure our policies and procedures are constitutional, they’re fair and nondiscriminatory, that our training is superior, that our officers are confident in their skillset and they’re going out there in partnership with the community.”
URI needed to meet over 200 standards including training, relationships with other agencies, community relations, and internal oversight, Deputy Police Chief Paul Ricci, the department’s accreditation manager, said in an emailed statement to Rhode Island Current.
Part of the procedure required all university officers to wear body cameras, which URI Police purchased in 2022 with a five-year, $288,750 U.S. Department of Justice grant. The funding came through a $16.1 million statewide program to equip Rhode Island law enforcement with body-worn cameras.
Ricci said that by gaining official accreditation, it shows that URI’s police department is “committed to maintaining the highest standards of professional law enforcement.”
URI also intends to seek accreditation through the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies and the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators.
Ricci said all URI police officers already meet the Rhode Island Police Officers Commission on Standards and Training’s rules and  regulations. Officers attend the Rhode Island Municipal Police Training Academy and, as fully sworn law enforcement, have the same powers and authority as municipal police statewide
URI’s accreditation from RIPCA is valid through September 2028.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-01 18:51:18+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT will keep programs hurt by federal shutdown afloat, for now",Keith M. Phaneuf and Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/01/ct-federal-shutdown-programs-afloat/,Gov. Ned Lamont said it’s premature to commit any of last year’s $2.5 billion surplus to plug holes in federal funding over the long term.,"Connecticut will continue nutrition, winter heating relief, Medicaid and other community assistance programs over the next month or longer, despite Wednesday’s federal government shutdown that interrupts funds for these programs, Gov. Ned Lamont announced.
But the Democratic governor said it’s still premature to commit any of last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion surplus to plug holes in federal funding over the long term.
“A lot of families out there are probably pretty worried about their health care and whether they’d be able to take care of their kid if there was a real emergency, worried about food and how they’re going to put a meal on the table,” Lamont said during a late-morning press conference Wednesday in his Capitol office.
“These guys in Washington [have] got to get their act together,” he added.
The White House announced a partial shutdown just after midnight Wednesday as Congress remained gridlocked over a new federal budget.
That translates into immediate challenges for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children — commonly known as WIC — and a clock ticking down to more complications for several other federal assistance programs, Lamont said.
But WIC, which serves 52,000 infants, older children and women here, will immediately need an infusion of state cash to keep operating, about $6 million per month, Lamont said, adding that Connecticut will plug the gap for now.
“I want those young families, those moms, to know that your WIC card will continue to be good, you know, for the foreseeable future,” the governor said. “We’re making sure that the [federal] government does not take that away from you.”
But Connecticut will not tap the $2.5 billion from last fiscal year, which closed June 30, to deal with that problem. Instead, it will support WIC from the current $27.2 billion state budget, which is running more than $300 million in the black. Administration officials said Connecticut would seek federal reimbursement after the shutdown for all state funds added to the WIC program.
Clock is ticking on SNAP and winter heating assistance
The shutdown, if it persists, also would create problems for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP, and on the winter heating assistance program that Connecticut runs chiefly through federal Low Income Household Energy Assistance grants.
SNAP provides about $72 million in nutrition assistance to more than 391,000 Connecticut residents monthly. But despite the shutdown closing off any new federal funding temporarily, the program has enough reserves to continue operating through October, said Lamont’s budget director, Jeffrey Beckham.
Similarly, the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program has more than $7 million in heating assistance funds left unspent from last winter. That’s enough to keep that program afloat as well until November, Beckham said.
The Lamont administration projects more than 100,375 households will need heating assistance this winter, up more than 12% from one year ago. The program serves households earning 60% or less of the statewide median income, which is $91,854 for a family of four.
Lamont’s social services commissioner, Andrea Barton Reeves, said a shutdown also will stall funds tied to Medicaid, a massive program that pumped almost $7 billion in federal funding last year into nursing homes, at-home care services, hospitals, federally qualified health clinics and health insurance for low-income households in Connecticut.
But reserves within the Connecticut’s Medicaid program should keep it functioning well into February or March of 2026, Reeves estimated. She added that federal block grants that Connecticut uses to support community action agencies — regional nonprofits that link vulnerable households with housing, energy, employment, child care and other human services — also face a funding crunch in early 2026.
Lamont: It’s too early to crack open CT’s piggy bank
The General Assembly last spring anticipated federal fiscal chaos when the GOP-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump collaborated on a massive array of cutbacks in federal assistance to states to help finance the extension of major federal tax cuts.
One of those cutbacks, involving subsidies to low-income households that buy health insurance on state exchanges — like Access Health CT here — has sparked outrage from congressional Democrats and has been one of the driving factors leading to the current budget gridlock and federal government shutdown.
The General Assembly created a special account to receive a portion of last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion surplus — the second-largest in state history — that could be used to supplant vanishing federal funds and blunt some of the pain of program cutbacks.
State legislative leaders have said they would like to see about $500 million of that surplus used for that purpose. Another $300 million would support a new program to expand affordable child care in Connecticut. And the remaining $1.7 billion would bolster the state’s rainy day fund and reduce pension debt.
But state Treasurer Erick Russell needs to inform pension analysts, who must perform periodic valuations of the program, by early November how much surplus will be deposited into retirement benefit programs.
And once surplus dollars go into Connecticut’s pension funds for state workers and municipal teachers, they cannot easily be withdrawn for other purposes.
Lamont, a fiscal moderate, has been reluctant to commit those funds to any response to federal cutbacks, preferring as much as possible to reduce the state’s considerable pension debt, which exceeded $35 billion last fiscal year.
And the governor, who will meet Friday with Democratic state legislative leaders, said it’s still too early to commit tapping last year’s huge surplus, though he didn’t rule it out.
“We’re going to know so much more in the next couple of weeks,” he said.
But labor leaders, faith groups and some of Lamont’s fellow Democrats in the General Assembly said Wednesday that it’s time for Connecticut to tap its piggy bank to help those left behind by Washington.
Leslie Blatteau, president of the New Haven Federation of Teachers and steering committee chair of CT for All, said during a late morning press conference in the Legislative Office Building that state revenue programs have surged dramatically just since last June.
“We all know that those funds that have been found belong to the working people of this state, and there is no question from anybody here today what Gov. Lamont and our legislators should do with those funds,” she said.
Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, chair of the General Assembly’s Human Services Committee, said that the changes to health insurance approved by the federal government would mean that a family of four with an annual income of $128,000 could see their monthly premiums increase from $925 a month to over $4,000 a month.
“Almost 60% of your income would be going for health insurance, and there is not one family in the state that can afford that,” said Lesser.
Lesser noted that the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a budget reconciliation bill signed on July 4, would reduce Connecticut’s Medicaid funding by $13 billion over the next 10 years. He said the change would disproportionately affect low-income people and people in nursing homes. In Connecticut, 1 in 3 children are on HUSKY, the state’s Medicaid program.
Lesser also said changes to the SNAP program will make about 42,000 Connecticut residents ineligible for the program — 39,000 are citizens or permanent residents and 3,000 are legal immigrants.
“It is particularly concerning for low-income communities around the state because, when you lose SNAP benefits in your neighborhood, the people who are losing out aren’t just the recipients themselves and their family,” Lesser added. “It’s also every neighborhood grocery store, and we already have food deserts in the state, in communities across the state, and we’re going to see a lot more hunger.”
But minority Republicans in the General Assembly have opposed any effort to slow Connecticut’s efforts to shrink pension debt.
And House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, urged Lamont Wednesday to keep Connecticut’s focus on curbing debt that otherwise will burden future generations of taxpayers.
“The question is whether the governor will stand up to his own party and prevent this raid on funds that symbolize fiscal responsibility,” Candelora said. “Democrats claim this money belongs to the people, yet they want to funnel it into growing government instead of returning it to taxpayers.”
State House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, who will meet Friday with Lamont and Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, to discuss response efforts, said Democrats still want to put more than $1 billion from last year’s surplus into the pension funds.
But “it’s irresponsible for state government to not be prepared [when] the drastic and unnecessary federal cuts come to fruition,” Ritter added.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1001_SR_LamontGovShutdown_124-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 14:58:50.639040

Mike Braun talks at an Indiana State Police outpost in Indianapolis on Oct. 1, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Hours after Congress failed to advance a stopgap measure to prevent a government shutdown, Gov. Mike Braun minimized the potential impact on Hoosiers, saying Indiana “isn’t as dependent on federal government largess.”
“We will get through it,” said Braun at a public safety event Wednesday. “If Indiana does lose some benefits in the short run, if it’s essential, we would look at maybe doing something to keep (them) in place.”
Indiana is the third-most reliant state when it comes to federal dollars. 
The former, one-term U.S. senator harped on congressional budgeting — specifically, the nation’s level of debt.
“We’re spending 30% more than we’re taking in at the federal level,” said Braun, noting that the nation’s interest payments exceed annual spending on Medicare or defense. “… that explodes geometrically each year going forward. So they are going to have to figure out how they’re going to start living within their means so that we’re not putting that burden on future generations.” 
Budget panel approves $15.79M for immigration detention upgrades at Miami Correctional Facility

A short-lived shutdown will likely have a minimal impact on the day-to-day lives of Hoosiers, with the exception of Indiana’s 24,000 federal employees. Some of those will stop being paid or could even be laid off following threats from President Donald Trump. The last partial government shutdown in 2018 lasted 35 days.
However, as detailed by the IndyStar, lengthy shutdowns can hurt Hoosiers accessing government services, including food benefits, national parks or passport applications.
On Wednesday afternoon, White House officials indicated a nutrition program for women, infants and children could “lapse.”
Indiana Congressman Jefferson Shreve, R-6th, said he will donate the equivalent of his shutdown pay to the Johnson County Boys and Girls Club.
“Hoosiers deserve a government that works for them — not political games,” he said.
One federal agency that won’t be impacted is Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. That includes the millions slated to come to Indiana following a recent agreement to use empty prison bed space to house federal immigrant detainees at a profit.
“From the beginning, I said Indiana is going to be a state that’s going to cooperate with ICE. We’re not going to be a sanctuary state; we don’t have sanctuary cities,” said Braun. “We still, though, suffer from the consequences of four years of open borders.” 
He again emphasized his personal policy of “worst first,” meaning that immigration officials should prioritize removing criminal offenders. Early figures indicate that many of those arrested by ICE have no criminal background. 
WTHR reported that the Miami Correctional Facility is set to start receiving detainees, with less than 100 scheduled to arrive this week as clergy continue to protest. The state agreed to appropriate nearly $16 million for facility upgrades last month.
 Other news

Though Republicans are still drumming up support for mid-decade redistricting in a special session, Braun said that such a session wouldn’t include a legislative follow-up to Senate Enrolled Act 1. The priority bill limited how much local government units could collect in property taxes, shifting some of the taxing burden to local income taxes.
But those local income taxes need to be approved annually, threatening the credit ratings of some municipalities. Braun said he didn’t think it would be dealt with because “generally, taxpayers are happy with the results of it.”
In contrast, legislative leaders said last month that changes to the law would be a top priority, such as delaying certain deadlines to better assess the bill’s impact. Many governments, public schools and libraries have cut services in response to the funding cuts. 
Despite nearly two months of constant pressure from the White House, including private meetings with Vice President JD Vance and Trump himself, no special session on redistricting has been scheduled. Previously, Braun floated the possibility of an early November special session.
When asked, Braun said redistricting was a daily topic among lawmakers and “evolving.” 
“We’ve got time, and if we get there to where they want to do it, we’ll probably have a special session,” he said. “At this stage they’re still moving, I think, in that direction.”
The filing deadline to run for Congress in Indiana opens Jan. 7.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-01 18:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Bridgeport farmers markets: How to save, where they’re located",Reginald David,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/01/bridgeport-farmers-markets/,"The Bridgeport Farmers Market Collaborative offers ways for residents to save money at the markets, including programs like SNAP matching.","For many Bridgeport residents, accessing fresh, locally grown produce is not always simple. Neighborhoods across the city face nutrition insecurity, limited access to grocery stores and rising food costs. The Bridgeport Farmers Market Collaborative was formed in 2014 to address these challenges, and over the past decade, it has grown into more than just a place to shop for fruits and vegetables. It has become a hub where residents can save money, learn how to cook with fresh ingredients and connect with neighbors.
The collaborative began with a simple mission: to make Connecticut-grown produce accessible and affordable while supporting local farmers and strengthening community ties. Today, it operates multiple farmers markets across Bridgeport, offering three primary programs that help residents stretch their grocery budgets. These programs are: Bridgeport Bucks, SNAP matching and the Farmers Market Nutrition Program. They work in tandem to ensure that families of all income levels can access healthy food.
Here’s more information on the markets and the programs the collaborative offers.
Bridgeport Bucks
Bridgeport Bucks is the flagship program of the collaborative. The initiative provides $5 vouchers that any shopper can use to purchase farm-produced items such as fresh produce, honey and jams. Unlike many assistance programs, Bridgeport Bucks are available to anyone, including people who do not qualify for SNAP benefits.
“People are like, ‘For real? You don’t need anything else?'” said Takina Pollock Shafer, director of the Bridgeport Farmers Market Collaborative.
The vouchers are so popular that they often run out within 15 to 20 minutes of a market opening. The program is made possible through sponsorships from local businesses, organizations and individuals who want to help lower the cost of fresh food in the community. By providing immediate financial relief, Bridgeport Bucks allow families to buy more fruits and vegetables than they might otherwise afford, helping residents make healthier choices while supporting local farmers.

Doubling SNAP Benefits
For families who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the collaborative offers a dollar-for-dollar matching program through a partnership with End Hunger CT. The program, known as CT Fresh Match, allows SNAP customers to double the value of their benefits when shopping at any participating farmers market in the network. For example, a $10 SNAP purchase earns $10 in matching tokens that can be spent on additional farm-produced items.
“We want to give people a dignified experience. You don’t want to make it feel like something complicated,” Shafer said.
The SNAP matching program not only increases purchasing power for families but also encourages people to try new fruits and vegetables. Customers can use their tokens across multiple markets in the network, providing flexibility and choice. This system allows shoppers to access produce at different market locations and times, accommodating work schedules and transportation limitations.
Farmers Market Nutrition Program
The collaborative also participates in the Farmers Market Nutrition Program, which provides additional support for seniors and WIC recipients. Seniors are eligible to receive $40 vouchers, while WIC participants receive varying amounts depending on household size and eligibility. To extend support further, bonus vouchers are also available, allowing recipients to stretch their benefits even further.
Shafer said the program has a noticeable impact on seniors. “The seniors, they don’t mess around. They’re spending those bucks because we get everything back,” she said. 
Cooking Demonstrations
Beyond financial assistance, the collaborative emphasizes education and engagement through cooking demonstrations led by Chef Raquel Rivera of A Pinch of Salt. In these demonstrations, residents are taught how to prepare seasonal produce in simple and approachable ways. Participants can taste the finished dishes, take home recipes and even earn Bridgeport Bucks for attending.
“It teaches people what to do with produce, and that it doesn’t have to be complicated,” Shafer said. Cooking demonstrations encourage residents to try new ingredients and recipes, build confidence in the kitchen and develop healthy eating habits.

Impact and funding
The collaborative operates markets across nearly every Bridgeport neighborhood. Multiple markets run on different days to prevent competition while maximizing accessibility for residents. 
Consistency is a key element in building trust, Shafer said. Residents know when and where markets will take place, and regular attendance creates a sense of community among shoppers and vendors alike. “Repetition is what builds community for people. There are just places where people know they can go and get what they need,” Shafer said.
The programs offered through the collaborative also have a measurable impact. Last year, the organization distributed approximately $80,000 in benefits, an increase from $50,000 the previous year. 
The collaborative’s programs are supported by a variety of local sponsors, including M&T Bank, Hartford HealthCare, St. Vincent’s Hospital, and Yale New Haven Health. The collaborative also works with other organizations to extend its reach. Partnerships with groups such as the Green Village Initiative are being explored, with the goal of creating a regional food hub that could provide a consistent, accessible market space and long-term sustainability for the programs.
Despite the successes, the collaborative faces challenges. Funding can be inconsistent, and SNAP matching funds are potentially at risk for 2026. The organization remains fiscally sponsored rather than operating as a fully independent nonprofit, which can limit long-term planning.
“Our SNAP matching funds are in jeopardy for 2026. We’ve been doing great and responding to the need that just seems to be growing year after year. So I’m hoping the money grows in the same direction,” Shafer said.

India supplies nearly half of all generic prescription drugs used in the United States, making it the largest single source. 
In 2022, Indian pharmaceutical companies provided 47% of generic prescriptions filled in U.S. pharmacies, far more than domestic producers or suppliers from Europe and the Middle East. These medicines addressed common needs like those related to mental health, high blood pressure, cholesterol and nervous system disorders. Because of India’s exports, Americans saved an estimated $219 billion on prescriptions in 2022, and $1.3 trillion over the past decade. 
India produces about 35% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, for generics in the entire world. Despite this, most Indian drugmakers rely on China for about 70% of the raw ingredients needed to manufacture these medicines. That dependency leaves the U.S. vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, a vulnerability highlighted by ongoing cancer treatment shortages.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico legislative Democrats on Wednesday opened a special legislative session by making their case for why they need to meet now, when the state has not yet felt the full brunt of federal cuts enacted in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
At a news conference with leaders from the New Mexico House and Senate, Democrats said the special session is expected to last two days and will be targeted on what they identified as the most pressing needs.
“There is nothing on this special session agenda that is not urgent,” House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) said at a news conference at the Roundhouse Wednesday. “I agree with my Republican colleagues: There’s a lot more nasty stuff coming from the federal government that doesn’t take place for another year or two, and we’ll have to deal with that in the 30-day and in the next legislative session.”
Martínez was referencing criticism from Republicans, who have a minority in both chambers, that the session is wrongly focused on faraway federal cuts when other issues like crime, child welfare or medical malpractice are more pressing. 
The Democrats provided more details about how bills they’ve drafted will address imminent threats the cuts pose. Specifically, they said they’ll direct millions of dollars toward the Health Care Authority to shore up cuts to food stamps and Medicaid; provide emergency funding to rural hospitals; and ensure New Mexicans who get their healthcare from the state’s exchange won’t face huge premium increases due to expiring tax credits. 
So far, five bills have been drafted. They address vaccine access, criminal competency, enhanced premium tax credits and rural hospitals. A fifth makes an appropriation to pay for those changes. 
Martínez said the Democrats have reached consensus on each. Republicans intend to introduce their own legislation this session, Democratic leaders said, but whether they’re heard and considered depends on whether they are deemed “germane,” or in-line with the topic areas Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham laid out in her proclamation yesterday. 
NM Gov: ‘This special session is about protecting the people who need help most’

Acknowledging that they cannot fully address or “backfill” all the looming federal cuts over the day or two, Democratic leaders described the session beginning Wednesday as “step one” in counteracting federal cuts, an effort they said would likely take several years and multiple legislative sessions. 
“What’s coming at the state of New Mexico is frightening,” said Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe), describing the full brunt of the federal cuts.
The session begins on the same day a federal shutdown begins in earnest. Martínez pointed to the shutdown to contrast gridlock in Washington with the work Democrats in the majority expect to do during the special session. 
“While dysfunction in Washington DC drives the federal government to a complete halt, we are here today to step up for our friends and our neighbors all across the state,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Martinez-2-1-1024x721.jpg,,,2025-10-01 14:58:50.639040

Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission, said the launch of Guardian 2.0 will take place “very soon” and an official date for the site to go live will be confirmed in the “near future.” 
The system, which provides public access to candidate expenditures and contributors, was set to be offline beginning Sept. 19 and launch by Wednesday, but more time was needed for “final adjustments” and to ensure data was accurately converted between the old and new software systems. 
Bruce Boone said fewer than 25 people have filings due in mid-October, and her agency will work with each of them to make certain they’re able to file on time. The site also provides information about which candidates have filed ethics paperwork to run for public office and political action committees that have formed.
“As with any new system, we expect there may be minor issues at first, but our team is fully prepared to respond quickly and provide direct support,” she said.
Guardian 2.0 will make filing and public access to campaign finance information “easier, faster and more transparent,” she said. 
The new system will have a new login, “modernized” visuals and a more intuitive filing experience, according to the Ethics Commission’s website. 
The change in the software system is a result of the current vendor no longer supporting the old system. Guardian 2.0 will be owned by the Ethics Commission and they will no longer be “dependent” on a single vendor, Bruce Boone said. 
While there may be temporary technical issues at launch, Bruce Boone said a support team will be available to assist the public and candidates filing paperwork.

(U.S. Defense Department)TOPEKA — Fort Riley announced Wednesday that many civilian employees are furloughed as a result of the federal government shutdown that went into effect at midnight Tuesday.
In a social media post, Fort Riley said email messages and phone calls to affected civilian staff will not be answered and many social media channeled will not be monitored.
More than 15 departments were closed, according to the post, including Public Affairs, Soldier and Family Assistance Center, some child care services, the Recycling Center and the Military Personnel Division administration.
Other departments are scheduling work by appointment only.

“Those who still report to work are classified as exempt and are generally in the life/health/safety fields,” Fort Riley’s social media posted in response to a question about who is affected. “Those who are not exempt do not report to work until funding is restored.”
A separate social media post referred people to the U.S. Defense Department’s website, which reads: “Military personnel will continue in a normal duty status, without pay, until such time as a continuing resolution or appropriations are passed by Congress and signed into law. Civilian personnel not engaged in excepted activities will be placed in a non-work, non-pay status.”

Fort Riley also postponed its Retiree Appreciation Day scheduled for Saturday.

The Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence, a nonprofit that runs two domestic violence shelters and provides a range of services, began this month offering no-cost medical examinations and forensic evidence collection at its new Waypoint Forensic Clinic. 
“Waypoint represents guidance, safety, and hope,” Lillian Lizana, director of the center’s forensic program, said in a statement. “Our goal is to provide compassionate, trauma-informed care that supports survivors and strengthens pathways to justice.”
The clinic is the first in the state to have a CortexFlo camera system, whose enhanced imaging can help see evidence of bruising and other injuries that may not be visible to the eye or by a basic camera, said Rene’ Davis, the center’s communications director. 
She said the technology can help provide evidence that can be used in prosecution of sexual assault and strangulation cases. 
Waypoint will also contract with certified Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners, who collect evidence in kits that can be used in court. The nurses, who are trained to provide trauma-informed care, are able to see survivors at the clinic or an area hospital. 
Davis said the clinic is an integral part of the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence’s 
Family Justice Center, which brings together under one roof help for survivors through counseling, legal aid, law enforcement, prosecutors and other services. Stakeholders from across Harrison County have been working together for several years to establish the center, she said. 
This is the first family justice center in Mississippi, and Davis said the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence is hopeful it will be replicated across the state. 
The family justice center, located in Gulfport at 47 Maples Drive, offers services that include the Northcutt Legal Clinic, which provides free legal services such as filing for domestic abuse protection orders, divorce and child custody, and a domestic violence intervention program geared to abusers that teaches accountability and respect. 
Renderings for the family justice center project imagine spaces for community services such as childcare and pre-school, offices for other departments and agencies and administrative space. 
Nearly 20 years ago, the first family justice center opened in San Diego, California, and now there are more than 300 centers around the country,  according to the Alliance for Hope International. 
A report by the alliance has found that family justice centers help survivors feel safe and empowered and it cites research documenting how they reduce domestic violence homicides.

Some residents walked around the room asking for signatures opposing the development. And, while North Salt Lake Mayor Brian Horrocks asked attendees to refrain from yelling or clapping during the meeting, few complied.
“They don’t care about us,” a resident yelled while Niederhauser answered a public safety question. “Put it in your backyard,” others shouted at different points of the meeting. 
Utah officials unveil site for 1,300-bed homeless campus after long, secretive search

The state entered a contract to purchase a Salt Lake City parcel to build the 15.85-acre campus at a site in the Northpointe neighborhood, roughly a mile from North Salt Lake’s boundaries, raising many eyebrows from residents in the surrounding communities. The purchase closing date will be sometime after the legislative session, Niederhauser said.
“The legislature will need to weigh in on some things before we move ahead with any construction or proceed with any development of that property, we want to engage the public,” he added.
Niederhauser spoke about the need for such a campus in the state, where homelessness increased 18% last year — Utahns experiencing homelessness are in need of resources and mental health and addiction support, and a centralized campus would offer an all-day, all-year operation for those needs, he said. 
The state has proposed a $4 million budget for public safety around the campus, conducted a wetland study of the property and is contemplating how to best work to mitigate the notorious mosquito issue in the area, and how to best transport people in and out of the campus that is far from any public transit.  
But, neighbors remained skeptical and deeply frustrated with the plans.

Neighbors ask for another site 
Brittney Souther, who lives near the proposed site, said she worries about North Salt Lake’s Foxboro neighborhood. 
“The nearest grocery store, the nearest bus stop, are not in Salt Lake City. They’re here in Foxboro,” Souther said. “Without reliable public transportation to take people back into the city, they will absolutely end up walking this way into our neighborhoods, towards our businesses and our schools.”
In her view, the campus should not move forward without strong safeguards for the surrounding community and without independent oversight to ensure the area’s safety. 
“You mentioned putting aside $4 million towards security, but you don’t even have enough money to build what you want, much less run it. Where will you even get the funds for that?” she asked Niederhauser.

But mostly, she wanted to know why a site west of the Salt Lake City airport was not under consideration for the project instead. 
“We looked at property there, similar to this property,” Niederhauser said. “This is the one that works for us.”
Shane Moser, a fire captain with the Salt Lake City Fire Department, speaking as a resident, also worried about public safety. His team, he said, responds to two or three calls a day at the Gail Miller Resource Center, a homeless shelter in Salt Lake City with a 200-bed capacity. Given the new campus’ 1,300-bed capacity, he expects the site to have an impact on the South Davis Metro Fire Department as well as the North Salt Lake Police Department, he said.



Let us know what you think...


 


But, Moser said, some solutions could decrease those concerns. 
“I would recommend that you guys look at a gate in, gate out, controlled access,” Moser said. “At the other resource centers, that is not the case. They’re allowed to freely roam the neighborhoods, and that has a significant drain on resources, as well as impacts crime levels.”
An emotional response
Mayor Horrocks said he wasn’t surprised by the highly emotional response of the community. 
For those who live on Salt Lake City’s west side, the project “is a disaster,” he said. But, in North Salt Lake, there may be ways to protect the city by controlling its access through the bridge over the Jordan River. 
“Obviously just to take the bridge out would be perfect,” Horrocks said. “If that’s not an option, then we maybe make it a toll bridge, and nobody comes or goes without someone checking in with someone.”
While he supports helping people who are going through rough patches to get back on their feet, he said it gets harder when those dealing with addictions don’t want to receive help. So, he’s unsure on how the campus will succeed. But, for now, he’s focusing on what can be done to protect his city.
“I think the decision’s been made. And when people say, ‘well, I’ll call my legislator,’ the legislature was the one that told Wayne to go make a recommendation, and he’s done that,” Horrocks. “So unless something changes dramatically, which I don’t see, I’m back to ‘OK, that thing’s coming. What can I do as mayor of North Salt Lake?’”

Gabriella Juarez, an LSU student affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, a progressive organization, was removed from the room by LSU Police after she continued speaking after her time had expired. The committee allows each commenter three minutes for remarks. 
Juarez and six other students criticized the committee, which they characterized as illegitimate. The students alleged the members’ motivations were to appease Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. Some of their remarks were profane, though most of the students did not curse during their remarks.
Juarez’s removal sparked outrage from around 15 other students in the organization who immediately stood and began shouting at the police, following them outside the LSU Foundation building. 
After Juarez’s arrest, several students blocked the police car from driving off with her. Six other students were arrested for obstructing a roadway, according to Z Martin, a Students for a Democratic Society member. 
Juarez was arrested for disturbing the peace, Martin said. 
The meeting continued after Juarez’s removal. The Illuminator is seeking comments from LSU officials taking part in the meeting.

Corteva will split into two publicly traded companies with the spin-off scheduled to be complete in the second half of 2026.  The individual companies will focus on crop protection solutions (New Corteva) and the seed business (New business entity generically termed “SpinCo”).
Per slides released to the investor community, this will result in companies with estimated 2025 annual revenues of $7.8 billion (New Corteva) and $9.9 billion (SpinCo).
Future Handling of “Legacy” DuPont Pensions is Included in the Plan
Understanding the Impact of the DuPont Legacy on Future Business Strategies
An important aspect of this transaction for many retirees of the legacy DuPont Company is the handling of the pension responsibilities.  During the previous company spin-offs and splits the legacy pensions were transferred to Corteva.  There has been considerable concern and speculation about the future handling of those pensions, as rumors of this further split emerged.  Per the public announcement, “legacy liabilities, including historical DuPont pension plan and PFAS obligations, will be retained by New Corteva.”
Full leadership rosters are yet to be announced, but Greg Page, current Chairman of Corteva, will remain in the role of Chairman for the New Corteva.  Chuck Magro, current Corteva CEO, will become the CEO of the “SpinCo” entity.
While mergers typically realize benefits in the form of “synergies” and reduced cost of operation, a split has the potential to increase costs as duplicate functions need to be established for the second, newly created entity.  In this case, the leadership evaluates those added costs to be minor and estimates them at $80-100 million annually.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OIP.webp,,,2025-10-01 13:58:43.810237

(Photo from Rhode Island Collection, Providence Public Library)The toxic remnants of an out-of-use Providence swing bridge are finally coming down with the help of a $2.34 million federal grant, announced by Rhode Island’s congressional delegation Tuesday.
The Point Street Bridge funding, awarded through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Marine Debris program, will cover the cost for the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC), along with The Nature Conservancy, to remove 250 tons of toxic and hazardous wooden timbers, pilings and sub-surface debris from the 1927 bridge.
The 527-foot swing structure, the third iteration of the bridge on the same site, was built to serve dual purposes, connecting motorists across the Providence River while also lifting to make way for a thriving water-borne shipping industry during the first half of the 20th century, according to a 1990 report by the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. Construction of the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier, completed in 1966, blocked large vessel traffic, rendering the movable feature of the highway unnecessary.
It remains passable by motorists, but has not swung open since 1959. However, the creosote wooden timber system used to lift the bridge was never removed. Its deterioration has caused pollution of the Providence River.
“Old pilings in the Providence River are more than an eyesore — they create pollution and impede navigation,” U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement.
The funding for marine debris cleanup projects nationwide was carved out in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Other programs and grants included in the Biden-era spending package have been pulled back, or paused, since the Trump administration took office.
Laura Dwyer, a spokesperson for the CRMC, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Wednesday. The project is expected to begin this month, with a September 2027 completion, according to NOAA’s website. 
“Removing hazardous debris from the Providence River is good for the environment, the local economy, and Rhode Islanders’ quality of life,” U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner, a member of the House Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement. “This new federal funding will make the river safer for boaters and strengthen Providence’s waterfront for residents and visitors alike.”
Rhode Island’s project was one of 13 nationwide awarded a combined $26.4 million through NOAA’s Marine Debris program, which also helps to remove derelict vessels and abandoned fishing gear.

(USDA Photo by Lance Cheung)Nearly half of U.S. Department of Agriculture employees will be furloughed during the federal government shutdown, though key programs that support nutrition, forest preservation and wildfire prevention, the most pressing plant and animal diseases and agricultural commodity assessments will continue.
Many offices, including county USDA service centers, will be closed or operating with minimal staff until Congress agrees on a temporary spending package. Support, payment processing and other functions of these offices are also suspended during the shutdown.
Congress failed to pass a stopgap spending bill Tuesday which resulted in the start of a government shutdown at midnight and federal agencies had to implement the contingency plans required by the Office of Management and Budget.
According to the contingency plan filed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, only a handful of agency operations will continue during the shutdown. The primary objective is that agencies cannot incur financial obligations if the funding source has lapsed and any planned or in-the-works activities that would incur new obligations, must cease. 
Activities that may continue during the shutdown include those that are financed by something other than current year appropriations, expressly authorized to continue, either by law or by necessary implication, necessary to the presidential duties and powers or related to emergencies that endanger human life or the protection of property.
According to the plan, more than 42,000 USDA employees are expected to be furloughed during the shutdown. That’s about half of the more than 85,000 employees the agency said would be “on board” prior to the shutdown. 
USDA programs that will continue despite the shutdown: 

Farm loan processing.
Certain natural resources and conservation programs that are mandatory under the farm bill or to protect human life and private property, like the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, dam safety and rehab work, the National Water and Climate Center which tracks flooding and weather risks and the National Soil Survey Center. 
“Core” nutrition safety net programs. This includes SNAP and child nutrition programs which have funding appropriations through October. The Women Infants and Children, or WIC, program is set to continue through the shutdown “subject to the availability of funding.” According to the plan, WIC can “recover and reallocate” unused grant funding from previous years to cover gap in coverage. 
Food safety operations, like inspections and laboratory testing.
Wildfire preparation and response. 
Activities like grading, assessment, inspection, import and export for farm commodities. These activities are supported by user fees and therefore not impacted by the shutdown.
Emergency programs under USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that address new world screwworm, highly pathogenic avian influenza, African swine fever, rabies and exotic fruit flies. Surveying for other plant and livestock diseases will cease during the shutdown. 
Prior obligations in the Section 521 rental housing agreement program. This is the program element of USDA Rural Development offices that will persist.
Operational requirements like human resource policies, cybersecurity and critical IT infrastructure. 

Under the contingency plan, USDA functions like ongoing research, reports, outreach and technical assistance are suspended. The agency will also stop processing payments and disaster assistance. 
Trade negotiations, hazardous fuel treatments, special use permits, regulatory work, training and travel by USDA employees and agencies are also suspended. 
According to the contingency plan, most functions are suspended for the Risk Management Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Foreign Agricultural Service, Food and Nutrition Service, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Economic Research Service, National Agricultural Statistical Service, Rural Development, and staff offices.
Website updates are also suspended under the shutdown. A banner atop the USDA website informs visitors that the website will not be updated “due to the Radical Left Democrat shutdown.” 
“President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people,” the banner reads. 
According to the plan, “all activities will cease” for the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and her office during the shutdown. 
Approximately 67% of Farm Service Agency, or FSA, employees will be furloughed. According to the plan, selected leadership at headquarters and USDA offices will stay on during the shut down. This means county service centers, and the majority of the services they offer, will not be available during the shutdown. 
Nearly all, 1135 out of 1237 employees, at the Food and Nutrition Service offices were projected to be furloughed during the shutdown, though according to the plan, enough employees remain to facilitate SNAP, child nutrition programs and WIC. WIC must make unspent funds from past years available in order to continue operations through October.
Close to 20,000 of the 32,390 Forest Service employees will continue to work on certain approved areas of agency work, like wildfire prevention, protection of federal land and federal directives to expand timber production. Public access to recreation sites managed by the department will be reduced, according to the plan. 
A significant portion of Agricultural Marketing Service operations are funded by previous farm bill appropriations or by user fees, so services like the Federal Grain Inspection Service and dairy grading will continue, as will market news information.
Operations like country of origin labeling, the packers and stockyards program, the national organic program, shell egg surveillance and the pesticide data program will be suspended. 
The plan calls for a number of reconsiderations in the event the shutdown persists longer than 5 days. This could include, for example a farm loan employee or other staff member on call at USDA service centers, or the reinstatement of some furloughed employees to deal with wildfire management. 
Glenn “GT” Thompson, chair of the House Committee on Agriculture, blamed Democrats, who demanded extentions to the Affordable Care Act be added to the stopgap spending bill, for shutting down the government and putting “critical USDA services in jeopardy.”
“These political games harm rural America through disruptions to farm payments, disaster relief, food assistance, and other critical services,” the Republican from Pennsylvania said in a statement. “Performative photo ops at state fairs and lip service to the producers who feed, fuel, and clothe our country won’t hide the truth—Democrats forcing a government shutdown only inflicts more pain on our agricultural economy.”

“When the government shuts down, Montana suffers,” said Vicky Byrd, CEO of the Montana Nurses Association, in a statement. “Our nurses and healthcare providers are already stretched thin.
“This shutdown will make it harder to deliver care, to access care, to keep rural hospitals and clinics open, and to ensure patients get the treatment they deserve and need.”
Early Wednesday, the federal government started shutting down after the U.S. Senate failed to advance short-term funding measures before midnight. An estimated 750,000 federal workers could be furloughed at an impact of $400 million a day, according to States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C., Bureau.
Open enrollment for people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace starts Nov. 1, and premiums could double in 2026 if enhanced tax credits in the ACA expire at the end of this year as scheduled, the D.C. Bureau reported, citing an analysis by health policy research organization KFF.
In a news release, the Montana Nurses Association said 47,000 Montanans rely on ACA coverage, they are facing an average premium increase of $5,900 a year, and older adults in rural areas will experience an even more severe impact.
The total premium in Montana was not immediately available Wednesday morning, but a national KFF analysis found premiums were expected to more than double on average, from $888 this year to $1,904 in 2026, according to States Newsroom’s D.C. Bureau.
A married couple in Helena could see premiums rise by nearly $19,764 annually, the Montana Nurses Association said.
In a phone call with the Daily Montanan, Montana Nurses Association Vicky Byrd said repealing ACA subsidies and gutting Medicaid puts rural hospitals and clinics in vulnerable financial positions.
Without continued Medicaid support, hospitals could lose up to 50% of their uncompensated care funding, forcing them to cut services or close, the Montana Nurses Association said.
“You don’t know how long it’s going to take, but once these rural hospitals and clinics go bankrupt, there’s no bringing them back,” Bird said. “There goes jobs. There goes my nurses’ jobs. There goes our providers for these rural communities. Now, (patients) are going to have to drive miles and miles.”
She said some people won’t seek care at all, and they’ll end up even more sick and land in the emergency room as a result, where medical costs will be even steeper.
In the news release, the Montana Nurses Association urged the state’s Congressional delegation to “stand up for Montana values and protect healthcare, restore funding, and reopen the government.
“We call on President (Donald) Trump and Congressional Republicans to work with Democrats to find a solution that puts people over politics,” the association said.
The political standoff had Democrats blocking a temporary government funding bill by Republicans, arguing a solution needs to include an extension of tax credits in the Affordable Care Act. But Democrats didn’t have support to pass a bill of their own.
Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy of Montana supported a GOP measure to fund the government for seven weeks, but they opposed the Democratic bid to continue funding for a month with extensions for health care provisions, States Newsroom’s D.C. Bureau reported.
Neither the Republican bill nor Democratic proposal to avert the shutdown received the needed 60 votes to pass, the D.C. Bureau reported.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nurse-hallway-hospital-getty-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-10-01 13:58:43.810237

“Each day the government remains closed, I will be donating my salary to the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay which provides help to vulnerable populations who may be impacted by this reckless choice,” U.S. Sen. Ashley Moody said in a written statement.
The center provides social services for sexual assault survivors, veterans, and first responders struggling with PTSD and other mental-health challenges.
U.S. Reps. Kat Cammack from Gainesville and Gus Bilirakis from Pasco County said that they have formally requested that the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer withhold their congressional pay for the duration of the shutdown.

“If the military is not getting paid, members of Congress should not be getting paid,” Cammack said Tuesday night in a video posted to her X account. “It is the very least that members of Congress can do when other people, especially when our military and our Border Patrol, the Democrats want to withhold their pay, well, they need to do the same then.”
“Government shutdowns are costly, disruptive, and ultimately unproductive,” Bilirakis said in a written statement. “It is unacceptable for Members of Congress to receive a paycheck while dedicated federal workers — including members of our Armed Services — go without.”
Members of Congress get paid $174,000, a rate that hasn’t changed since 2009. They continue to receive funding during a shutdown per the U.S. Constitution. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution says: “The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.”
Florida’s other U.S. Sen., Rick Scott, sponsored legislation in 2019 — his first year in the Senate — to prevent Congress from getting paid during government shutdowns. He doubled down on that proposal during an appearance on “Fox and Friends” on Wednesday morning.
“If you didn’t do your job in business, you didn’t get paid,” he said. “If you don’t show up in your job, you don’t get paid. Why are we getting paid? We shouldn’t get paid if we don’t do our job.”
Multiple news sources have listed Scott as the richest member of Congress worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Meanwhile, some federal lawmakers say they can’t afford to have their paycheck withheld.
“I’m not wealthy, and I have three kids. I would basically be missing, you know, mortgage payments, rent payments, child support,” Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., told NBC News. “So it’s not feasible, not gonna happen.”
About 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed during a government shutdown, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

A panel of federal judges heard arguments Tuesday in the ongoing court cases of two international students who were detained in Vermont earlier this year as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activism.
Mohsen Mahdawi, who is Palestinian, and Rümeysa Öztürk, who is Turkish, have been free from custody for months after judges in the U.S. District Court for Vermont ordered their release. Mahdawi was arrested by federal agents in Colchester in April and was held in federal custody in a state prison. Öztürk was held overnight in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in St. Albans after agents arrested her in Massachusetts. ICE then took her from Vermont to a detention center in Louisiana. 
Now, the Trump administration is in the process of appealing aspects of the Vermont District Court’s rulings. The challenges were heard one after the other Tuesday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, which is located in New York City. 
In both cases, the three-judge panel is considering questions with potentially national implications about the balance between the government’s power to enforce immigration laws and the protections of individual rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.
The appeals panel did not issue a decision Tuesday. Attorneys for Mahdawi and Öztürk said after the hearing that while they did not know when that ruling would come, it could be relatively soon because the judges were operating on an “expedited” timeline.
In both cases, the government is arguing that federal immigration law prevents district courts, such as the one in Vermont, from taking up certain cases in which those bringing a suit are challenging their detention by federal immigration authorities. 
In Mahdawi’s case, specifically, the government is appealing Vermont Judge Geoffrey Crawford’s decision to release the Columbia University student on bail while courts consider his challenge to his arrest. In Öztürk’s case, the government is appealing Judge William Sessions’ order that would have transferred the Tufts University student back to Vermont from an ICE detention center in Louisiana. But that order was essentially superseded by Sessions’ decision to then order her release on bail. 
In addition to the proceedings this week, both students are also challenging the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to deport them in proceedings in the federal immigration court system. That court system is part of the U.S. Department of Justice and separate from federal district courts, like Vermont’s. The students’ immigration challenges are both being heard in Massachusetts, their attorneys said. 
In court Tuesday, Tyler Becker, an attorney in Trump’s Justice Department, said the students should have been required to exhaust their options within the immigration system before seeking relief from the U.S. District Court judges in Vermont. 
Becker argued that even if the students lose their immigration court challenges, meaning they would be facing deportation, that system allows opportunities for appeals, including to the same level of court — the federal appeals circuit — as Tuesday’s hearing. He said the Vermont judges were wrong to take up the two cases. 
But attorneys for the students contended that those immigration proceedings could take months or even years. It’s unlikely the students’ immigration cases would get the same expedited treatment as their cases in Vermont’s district court, they said, because the students are no longer behind bars. That potentially long timeframe, the students’ attorneys said, would not give the students the immediate relief they needed to cure what the attorneys say were clear violations of their rights to free speech.
Both students appear to have been targeted for speaking out about Israel’s war in Gaza. Mahdawi was a prominent leader of pro-Palestinian campus protests at Columbia, while Öztürk wrote an op-ed criticizing Tufts’ response to the war. 
Moreover, the attorneys said, stripping the students of the ability to challenge their detention in the place where they were being held, at least for a time — Vermont — would violate the clause of the Constitution meant to guarantee individuals’ protection from unlawful government detention, known as the writ of habeas corpus.
Potential conflict between the immigration system and other courts, which the Trump administration is raising as a key concern in the students’ cases, is “just the price of our constitutional design,” said Michael Tan, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union representing Mahdawi, during Tuesday’s arguments. 
In Mahdawi’s case, Becker also argued Tuesday that a roughly decade-old Windsor Police Department report describing statements Mahdawi allegedly made to an Upper Valley gun store owner was not properly considered in the Vermont judge’s ruling. 
The report led an FBI agent to speak to Mahdawi, and the case was soon ended, lawyers for both parties have said. Crawford, the judge, said earlier this year he believed that the “shocking” allegations in the filings were “in large part fabricated.”
One of the judges on Tuesday’s panel, William Nardini — who is one of two Trump appointees hearing the students’ cases — was sharply critical of Crawford’s assessment of the fact the FBI did not pursue charges in the case, saying Crawford made “dramatically flawed” inferences about Mahdawi’s character based on that fact.
Tuesday’s hearing came on the same day, meanwhile, that a federal judge in Boston ruled in a separate case that the Trump administration has violated the Constitution in targeting non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. The ruling said Trump and his policies threatened free speech. 
Attorneys for Mahdawi and Öztürk said Tuesday they weren’t immediately sure how that case could impact the students’ proceedings. But in comments to reporters, Mahdawi himself quoted the Boston judge’s ruling and urged people to consider its words.
“He says: ‘Alone, I have nothing but my sense of duty. Together, we the people of the United States — you and me — have our magnificent Constitution,’” Mahdawi said.

Child care advocates rallied in Raleigh last summer in support of calls for better funding. (Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline) As a child care provider, I witness firsthand the struggles families face and the power of community in addressing those struggles. Recently, a teacher in one of my programs notified me of a child who repeatedly removed her shoes in class. We discovered it was because the shoes were too small and hurt her feet, and her mother couldn’t afford to buy new ones. When I told neighbors about it, they bought the child not just new shoes, but socks and other clothing, too. To me, their actions exemplify real care: understanding a need and offering tangible help in the way that actually reaches people.
Despite recent stories to the contrary, Republican’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) isn’t about helping families, and it certainly won’t help those who need it most. Ultimately, the law’s significant cuts to health care and food assistance will harm the early childhood field I work in and love.
While the OBBBA technically increased the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to allow families to claim up to $3,000, it remains non-refundable, meaning most low-income families cannot fully use it. Over 70% of the expanded benefit is projected to go to households earning over $100,000 annually. This excludes the vulnerable families I work with, who face housing instability, financial hardship, and sometimes can’t even afford basic necessities like shoes for their children.
While tax credits aren’t inherently bad, this bill’s provisions primarily benefit wealthy families, leaving the rest of us behind. Lawmakers shouldn’t be touting these credits as a child care win, because it isn’t.
Lowering costs for families is crucial, but laser-focusing on affordability without fixing the child care sector’s underlying problems is shortsighted – it’s like lowering gas prices when the roads desperately need paving. Even with employer tax credits, this approach won’t solve the child care crisis, as increasingly limited supply issues will further reduce families’ options.
Some parts of the new law also aim to expand access to employer-provided care, but this option isn’t widely used, and it places child care in the same bucket as employer-provided health insurance coverage—a benefit you lose if you lose your job. For a parent who’s just lost their job, losing access to child care makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to find work again. Child care is also outside most employers’ core business, allowing them to easily discontinue the benefit and leave working families optionless.
The OBBBA also expanded “Dependent Care Assistance Programs,” designed to allow working parents to set aside a portion of their pre-tax income in a savings account for child care. But low-income families working paycheck-to-paycheck, like many in my program, have no wiggle room to set anything aside—and parents using the flexible spending account can’t use the tax credit for the same costs. Also, having more money in the short term, even for higher earners, doesn’t mean much if you can’t find or access care—which is the bigger problem for the more than half of Americans who live in child care deserts.
Nearly half of early educators rely on public assistance like Medicaid. About 80% of the teachers in my program need it, because I can’t cover their health insurance. Without basic needs programs, more educators will leave the field for better-paying jobs with benefits, worsening the turnover and retention crisis. This only grows waitlists and reduces access to care for parents. Fewer educators also means more of a burden on providers like me—I’m seeing more burnout and feeling it myself, and it’ll only get worse as educators struggle to cover basic needs like health care and food.
If we really want to fix the child care crisis, tax credits won’t cut it. We need a three-pronged approach: educating families on the importance of early years and offering whole-family counseling; investing in early educators through professional development, health care, and higher wages; and expanding services for children, including special education and supportive early care. Direct funding for child care programs could achieve these goals.
Children are our future. We must provide them with the best possible start in life, including family mental health support, accessible and affordable early education, and basic necessities—like shoes that fit.

(headshot courtesy of Wisconsin Court System)Appeals Court Judge Maria Lazar announced she’s running for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court Wednesday morning.
Since her election to the District II Court of Appeals in 2022, Lazar has been a reliable vote for right-wing causes on the panel — which is controlled by a 3-1 conservative majority. 
Lazar joins fellow appellate Judge Chris Taylor in the race for an open seat on the Court, which is being vacated by Justice Rebecca Bradley. Bradley has been one of the Court’s most right-wing members and announced earlier this year she would not run for re-election. 
In a video posted to X, Lazar said she was running for the seat to reduce the “politicization” of the Court. 
“We need to draw a line in the sand and stop the destruction of our courts, especially our state Supreme Court,” Lazar said. “I am an independent, impartial judge who strives to follow the law and Constitution in every decision I make from the bench. It is time to restore that level of judicial dedication to the Court.”
Lazar, a former Waukesha County judge and assistant district attorney, also noted that she’s been elected to her seats on the circuit and appeals courts while Taylor, a former Democratic state lawmaker, was first appointed to a seat on the Dane County Circuit Court by Gov. Tony Evers. 
While her campaign announcement sought to establish her nonpartisan bonafides, Lazar has a history of fighting for Republican causes. In her last campaign for her seat on the court of appeals, Lazar touted endorsements from prominent election deniers. 
Those endorsements included former Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who recently agreed to have his law license suspended for three years over his widely derided review of the 2020 presidential election, Jim Troupis, who is facing criminal charges for his role in the plot to cast false Electoral College votes on behalf of President Donald Trump, and Bob Spindell, a Republican member of the Wisconsin Elections Commission who cast one of those fraudulent ballots and has regularly used his position to spread conspiracy theories about election administration. 
Lazar was also endorsed in that race by Pro-Life Wisconsin, an organization dedicated to banning all abortions in the state. That endorsement is a stark contrast with Taylor, who previously worked as policy director for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin. 
“Just like Rebecca Bradley, Maria Lazar has spent her career rolling back people’s rights, attacking reproductive health care and voting rights, and doing the bidding of powerful special interests and her billionaire friends,” Ashley Franz, Taylor’s campaign manager, said in a statement. “If elected, Maria Lazar would be the most extreme member of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. It’s no surprise that she’s backed by the same right-wing billionaires who tried unsuccessfully to buy a seat on our supreme court this last April, which Wisconsinites overwhelmingly rejected.”

The large majority of the 51,600 people enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans in the state are served by two insurers, UnitedHealth and Vermont Blue Advantage. Both are leaving the market for individual purchasers next year.

Nearly all Vermonters on Medicare Advantage individual plans are expected to lose their current health insurance for 2026. New data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reveal all but one provider in the state will discontinue coverage for 2026.
Neither UnitedHealth nor Vermont Blue Advantage has renewed its individual Medicare Advantage plans for the 2026 year, CMS data show. These plans cover the large majority of the more than 51,600 people insured by Medicare Advantage plans in Vermont. Vermont Blue Advantage alone currently serves 26,000 people in the state.
Humana will continue to offer its Medicare Advantage plans in Bennington, Caledonia, Essex, Orange, Windham and Windsor counties. CMS’s data for the coming year did not show any 2026 Medicare Advantage plans available for individuals living in the state’s other counties to enroll in.
“Without a doubt, it’s very disruptive for seniors to have limited options to these plans,” said Kaj Samsom, the commissioner of the Department of Financial Regulation. 
These changes impact only the individual Medicare Advantage plans. Large employers may offer their retirees continued coverage with Medicare Advantage plans provided by the employer. In September, the State Treasurer’s Office announced that the health insurance plans it manages for retired teachers will transition from Vermont Blue Advantage to HealthSpring. Vermont Blue Advantage is run by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont in conjunction with its counterpart and parent company in Michigan.
Medicare Advantage plans are an option for people eligible for Medicare, a federal health insurance program for those 65 years and older and those with certain disabilities. The plans, sometimes called Part C plans, are operated by a private company but paid for by the federal government. They often include broader coverage, including prescription coverage, than standard Medicare, and they have a cap on annual out-of-pocket expenses. Generally, standard Medicare covers 80% of health expenses.
Last year two Medicare Advantage plans pulled out of Vermont, leaving only the Humana, Blue Advantage and UnitedHealth plans for individuals to choose from.  At the time, only 50 people were enrolled in Humana plans.
This week UnitedHealth, which is the nation’s largest provider of MA plans, announced an end to its MA coverage for 600,000 patients across the country in 2026. 
All across the country Medicare Advantage providers have been scaling back their coverage, as the plans become less profitable for the companies that run them. Many cite a decrease in the amount of money the private insurers receive from the federal government, higher numbers of patients seeking and paying for care, and a shift in federal rules outlining how much insurers can pre-pay providers for care. 
Current plans will remain in effect through the end of the year. Medicare’s annual open enrollment period, for patients to choose plans for the coming year, runs Oct. 15 through Dec. 7. 
Individuals who lose their MA coverage are guaranteed eligibility to enroll in any plan in the Vermont Medicare Supplement market up to 63 days after the MA coverage ends — for those whose coverage runs through the end of this year, that leaves until March 4, 2026, a press release from the Department of Financial Regulation explains. 
The department advises people to hold on to the notice they receive from their insurer announcing the end of coverage, as proof to secure guaranteed access to the supplemental plans. 
“This is disruptive, yes, but don’t panic. You have time, you have options. There are resources available to help guide you through it,” Samsom said.
He pointed people toward Vermont’s State Health Insurance Program (SHIP), which provides assistance to Medicare beneficiaries in Vermont, and the Medicare handbook for navigating coverage.
Without access to the Medicare Advantage  plans, individuals have the option to opt into standard Medicare for coverage. Those in traditional Medicare plans often need to buy a Medicare Supplement plan, or Medigap plan for short — which offers coverage for the remaining expenses that traditional Medicare does not cover. Many people on traditional Medicare also need to buy prescription drug plans, often referred to as Part D plans.
Vermont’s Medigap plans are expensive: “There’s a real risk of this change driving more people to be in Medicare with no secondary coverage,” said Mike Fisher, the state’s health care advocate. 
Yet Medicare Advantage plans have also received serious criticisms. 
“We regularly hear from people who feel like they have been sold something that doesn’t meet their needs,” Fisher said. “And we regularly hear from providers across the whole system of care who are really frustrated with underpayment.”
“There is a lot of frustration about them, so I think that there will be some people who will see this as a good thing,” he added. “But we also know that there’s a lot of Vermonters who have been quite satisfied and well served [by the Medicare Advantage plans].”

A federal district judge sided with Cook in early September after she challenged the president in court.  A three-judge panel then split 2-1 in rejecting Trump’s appeal to overturn the lower court decision and affirmed on Sept. 16 that Cook could keep her position as the case plays out. Trump asked the Supreme Court to intervene, adding to his series of petitions to the justices since his second term began.

A bill (HB 73) that would establish a centralized database to track the voting-rights status of individuals with felony convictions has once again been filed in the Florida House of Representatives.
Rep. Felicia Robinson, D-Miami Gardens, has sponsored similar legislation over the past several sessions. None have received a committee hearing (Broward County Democrat Tina Polsky has filed similar legislation in the Senate in previous years).
The origin of the legislation date to what happened after Floridians passed Amendment 4 in 2018. That measure was designed to restore the voting rights of Floridians who had served their criminal sentences (except for those found guilty of murder or sexual offenses).
The pool of potential eligible voters was reduced substantially, however, after the Legislature in 2019 required people with felony convictions to have to pay any “legal financial obligations” — fines, fees, and restitution — before regaining their right to vote.
That has led to uncertainty among individuals who have received confusing or contradictory information from the state since then about whether they are eligible to vote. Most notably, that resulted in the arrests of 20 individuals right before the 2022 primary election. Those arrests took place after state lawmakers approved the Office of Election Crimes and Security at the urging of Gov. Ron DeSantis during the legislative session earlier that year.
That lack of a centralized voter database led the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, the leading advocate for the passage of Amendment 4 in 2018, to file a lawsuit in 2023 against DeSantis and election officials, alleging they had created a “bureaucratic morass that prevents people with felony convictions from voting, or even determining whether they’re eligible to vote.” (The group dropped the lawsuit in 2024 as they agreed to enter into mediation with the Florida Department of State, according to the News Service of Florida).
What would happen
Robinson’s legislation calls for the Florida Commission on Offender Review to develop and maintain a database of information for those with felony convictions including:

The remaining length of any term of supervision.
The remaining amount of any restitution owed to a victim as ordered by a court as part of his or her sentence.
The remaining amount due of any fines and fees initially ordered by a court as part of his or her sentence or as a condition of any form of supervision.

If the measure were to become law, the Department of State, the Department of Corrections, the clerks of the circuit courts, the county comptrollers, and the Board of Executive Clemency would provide the information listed above to commission.
That body would be required to provide the governor, president of the Senate, and speaker of the House a comprehensive plan by July 1, 2027, that would:

List government entities and methods by which the commission would collect, centralize, analyze, and secure the information required to be included in the database.
Describe any infrastructure and services, including but not limited to, software, hardware, and information technology services, that may be necessary to create and maintain the database.
List the anticipated number of additional employees to develop and maintain the database.
Estimate the cost of the database.
Cite any legal authority necessary for the commission to develop and maintain the database.

Six months after a deadline for filing claims, a judge will allow a new petitioner — and potentially others — to seek compensation from the state’s largest religious denomination.

Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDigger
BURLINGTON — A year after filing for bankruptcy under the weight of 31 unresolved clergy misconduct lawsuits, the Vermont Roman Catholic Diocese is seeing its number of accusers rise nearly fourfold.
The state’s largest religious denomination had thought the pool of current abuse claimants had plateaued at 118 upon an April deadline for people to seek compensation. But at a hearing Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Heather Cooper endorsed a request by a new petitioner identified only as “John Doe” to add his name — a move that multiple lawyers involved said could potentially open the door for others.
After the diocese asked to reorganize its depleting finances on Sept. 30, 2024, the court said any claimants wanting to join the Chapter 11 case had to do so by April 4 — a date advertised in select national and state newspapers and local church bulletins.
But Doe, a former Vermonter now living in Florida, didn’t see the notice, he said in newly submitted court papers. 
Doe was placed within weeks of his 1947 birth at the diocese’s former St. Joseph’s Orphanage in Burlington, where he “suffered from repeated instances of abuse” during his decade there, his statement said.
Moving south in 1995, Doe didn’t know about the church’s bankruptcy case until a recent visit to Chittenden County this summer, when he learned of the filing as well as a new Burlington “memorial healing space” for the more than 13,000 children who lived at the orphanage from its opening in 1854 to its closing in 1974.
“For the first time in his life, Doe decided to acknowledge his history at the orphanage,” his lawyer, Celeste Laramie of the Burlington firm Gravel & Shea, wrote in court papers.
According to federal law, a bankruptcy court can decide whether to extend the filing deadline in such circumstances. But before the judge could rule on Doe’s request, attorneys for both the church and claimants agreed to add him to their current mediation topics — a move the judge endorsed on Tuesday without elaborating.
The updated total of 119 current claimants includes the initial 31 whose unresolved lawsuits spurred the bankruptcy filing. The new figure is almost double that of an earlier 67 accusers who settled abuse cases before the diocese sought Chapter 11 protection.
A year ago, the church said its assets had been reduced by half, to about $35 million. Since then, it has spent about $1.5 million — almost 5% of its remaining money — on legal bills, court records show.
Although the bankruptcy court has no authority to rule on any of the abuse allegations, which date as far back as 1950, it has allowed claimants to offer non-evidentiary “survivor statements.” On Tuesday, seven speakers told the judge of suffering depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, disassociation and problems with intimacy, sleeping and alcohol and drug use.
“Up to a year ago, I had planned to take my shame and humiliation to the grave,” said a Montpelier man identified as “speaker 4.”
Then he and others came forward upon the church’s bankruptcy filing.
“If the priests had been held accountable,” another speaker said, “we could have avoided all the pain.”

Harris said some of Prairie Public’s programs and services could be reduced or eliminated in coming months as the public broadcaster redistributes responsibilities among the remaining staff.
“Amid the hardship, we remain committed to serving our communities as best as we can,” Harris said. He added continued support from their viewers and listeners will be critical to the organization moving forward.
During debate on the funding pull back, Republicans criticized Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio as having bias toward liberal points of view.
U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., said during a virtual forum Monday she considers herself a lifelong public radio listener, but she supported the budget cuts to NPR and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting because she thinks they can be sustained by their supporters. 
There is more media competition than ever before in the marketplace and the government should not be “investing” in any specific media entity, she said.
“I thought it was an appropriate time to start pushing away from that and allowing public radio and television to stand on their own two feet,” Fedorchak said. “I’ve heard the fundraising calls that they are making and I’m pretty optimistic that they are going to have their supporters step up and help them fill those gaps that the federal government is leaving behind.”
In addition to federal cuts, Prairie Public saw a reduction in funding this year from the North Dakota Legislature.
During the 2025 legislative session, Gov. Kelly Armstrong proposed $2.9 million for Prairie Public for the 2025-27 budget cycle, including $1.7 million in one-time funding for transmitter replacement and maintenance. Lawmakers reduced the overall state funding to $400,000, providing money for tower improvements. Some lawmakers had advocated for cutting off funding to Prairie Public completely.
Prairie Public plans to continue providing educational programming, national content from PBS and NPR and maintain its transmitters in North Dakota, Minnesota, Canada and eastern Montana, according to the statement.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-01 16:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Is it time to let the Connecticut Sun set?,Jim Bellano,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/01/is-it-time-to-let-the-connecticut-sun-set/,"As much as it pains me to say it, it may be time for the State of Connecticut to confront reality and move on from the WNBA’s Sun.","As much as it pains me to say it, it may be time for the State of Connecticut to confront reality and move on from the WNBA’s Sun. 
As someone that has worked with eastern Connecticut municipalities, specifically in the tourism sector, I know what the presence of a professional sports franchise means for businesses and visitor traffic in the region.
Of course, the state will not move on– at least not without a fight. For obvious reasons, government officials will pursue, at least rhetorically, all avenues to keep the franchise in Connecticut. As we know, historically, the Nutmeg State is particularly sensitive to this issue.
For many, the sting from losing the Hartford Whalers to North Carolina after the 1996-97 season still endures. This is evidenced by the lingering presence of Whaler’s caps, T-shirts, and jerseys still worn by the team’s faithful.
And then there was the romancing of Hartford by the New England Patriots, only to have the city left at the altar after being used as leverage for a new stadium in Foxboro. Actually, it was less of a romance and more of a one-night stand, with Pat’s owner Robert Kraft leaving in the morning and telling then-Gov. John Rowland, “I’ll call you.”
First, Sun ownership has done all that it can to prepare the team for a move. Purchased in 2003 for $10 million, the most recent analysis by the website Sportico has the Sun valued at $180 million– 12th out of the WNBA’s 13 teams. However, the current bidding war has a Boston investment group battling a proposed Connecticut public-private partnership and dangling the number $325 million. Can the Mohegans resist such a return on investment?
Also, after reaching the semifinals in 2024, Sun ownership conducted a fire sale and gutted the franchise to the bone. This included the departures of the head coach, Stephanie White, WNBA legends Alyssa Thomas and Dewanna Bonner, and 2024’s Most Improved Player, DiJonai Carrington. Only two players from last year’s roster were around to take the court in 2025.
Second, a pivotal question is whether, like the Whalers, a professional franchise can flourish in Connecticut sitting halfway between Boston and New York. While league attendance has exploded over the past two years, according to accrossthetimeline.com, in 2025, the Sun drew an average of 8,635 fans per game in an arena that has a capacity of 9,323 seats for basketball. As with all WNBA franchises, this is significantly higher than what the team drew in the year 2023 BCC (before Caitlin Clark). But the Sun were still the fourth lowest in attendance this year, only surpassing teams that play at much smaller venues. Also, these attendance numbers were buttressed by a single game against the Indiana Fever held at TD Bank arena in Boston that drew over 19,000 fans- two and one quarter times higher than the usual crowd.
UConn’s Athletics website states that Peoples Bank Arena accommodates 16,294 seats for basketball. Therefore, an ancillary question is, would a Sun franchise in Hartford draw double the current fan base given that proximity between New York and Boston?
Finally, while well-intentioned, something just doesn’t sit right about a state government taking an ownership interest in a professional sports franchise, albeit a minority stake. As we see, the use of state pension funds for the deal does not have universal support. It is said that politics makes strange bedfellows. Here, both Republicans and the largest state employee’s union (AFSCME) have gone on the record opposing the proposed investment.
And let’s face it, the typical state official– elected or appointed, including those in the General Assembly– do not evoke a picture of a “silent partner.” You can almost see the following proposed bill in an upcoming session: “HB 2055, An Act requiring the Connecticut Sun to change from Man-to-Man to Zone defense.”
In the end, Connecticut’s efforts may buy a few years for the Sun to remain in state. In the end, however, such efforts are likely to go for naught. Antitrust and contractual interference accusations aside, professional sports leagues have significant control over the sale and location of their franchises. For reference, see Art Modell’s Cleveland Browns, Robert Irsay’s Baltimore Colts, and Donald Sterling’s Los Angeles Clippers- none of which exist anymore due to actions strongly supported by their respective leagues. Like Connecticut today, the Cleveland and Baltimore situations involved significant, but futile, state, and municipal opposition.
Make no mistake about it, Boston is too big a market not to have a franchise. The city is slated for one of the future rounds of expansion after 2030. With the explosion of revenue and team values it looks doubtful that both Boston and the WNBA will wait around six or seven years to cash in on what the Boston market has to offer.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Legislature video)TOPEKA — Complying with a federal policy designed to avoid conflicts of interest could cause “massive system disruption” for Kansans who have intellectual and developmental disabilities, an advocate told legislators last week.
Multiple people testified Sept. 25 before the Special Committee on Health and Social Services, to raise concerns about proposed changes because of a rule from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Kansas is out of compliance with the rule and stands to lose $350 to $400 million in federal funding if changes aren’t made, said committee chairman Rep. Will Carpenter, R-El Dorado.
The Kansas Department for Aging and Disabilities Services is addressing the issue as part of an overall strategy to modernize its home and community-based support waiver program.
To avoid conflict of interest, individuals with IDD who are on Medicaid cannot receive services from the same organization that provides their case management, said Jeanine Zlockie, National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services.
A case manager who has a financial relationship with the service provider could, for instance, feel pressured to steer a client to their company’s services, rather than objectively determining best services, she said.
CMS rules allow for workarounds in certain situations, such as in rural areas where there are limited providers, Zlockie said.
“The direction we’ve set based on these consensus recommendations is that there will be no dual service provision under a conflict-free system in Kansas,” said Seth Kilber, a KDADS assistant commissioner. “It’s going to require us to map the current state and the future state, defining those swim lanes for what each entity is able to actually do and perform.”
Paul Coffell, targeted case management supervisor for Starkey Inc. in Wichita, said the Kansas system already has conflict of interest practices in place and that he believes the system is strong and works well. He expressed concerns that separating organizations that provide services from organizations that provide case management would create an “invisible” waiting list as people wait for case managers.
“I would ask that everyone involved would remain open to persevering with what has been positive and successful for our TCM program instead of assuming that massive system disruption is unavoidable,” Coffell said.
Jeff Whittier, director of support services for Cottonwood Inc. in Lawrence, said the consensus reached among those working with KDADS to modernize the waiver was based on options presented to them. He called the agreement Kilber referred to as “the least damaging.”
In the Cottonwood community developmental disability organization area, Whittier said, there are 14 targeted case management providers, four of which are conflicted agencies.
“The remaining 10 are quote-unquote independent,” he said. “That sounds great on paper, since only 29% of the TCM providers in our area are conflicted.”
“In reality,” he added, “the four conflicted providers provide (targeted case management) services for approximately 66% of individuals in our catchment area.”
If the current plans addressing conflict of interest were implemented today, Whittier said, most providers, including Cottonwood, would likely divest themselves of targeted case management services.
Whittier said Cottonwood loses money providing targeted case management services, which is why most companies would choose to divest themselves of that portion of their work. He told the committee changes could be made systemwide to make the case management more sustainable, such as updating billing practices and costs.
“We really don’t have a choice in this matter, and I’m hoping that you will collaborate and be part of the solution, and everybody in this audience needs to be part of this solution,” Carpenter told Whittier. “The federal government has told us where we’re going to go with this, and I hope everyone understands that. They’ve been pretty lenient so far, but they’ve made it pretty clear we need to get our act together.”
Loved ones of people being served through the IDD program told the committee that changing case managers would negatively affect their family members.
Julie DeMarco gave examples about how the case manager who supports her 53-year-old brother, who has autism and is nearly nonverbal, has supported him because she knows him so well.
“A TCM who is not embedded, I fear, would not have that first-hand knowledge of him,” she said. “I believe the proposals break the essential links. I’m aware of the conflict of interest concerns, but I’d like to provide informed consent to keep my TCM embedded at the service provider. It should be our choice.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Julie-DeMarco-IDD-1024x583.jpg,,,2025-10-01 11:59:07.028943

(Josh Merchant/The Beacon)A large majority of Jackson County voters have cast ballots to recall County Executive Frank White Jr. Preliminary results from Sept. 30 reveal 85% of voters supported the recall.
The open question is whether those results will stand up against ongoing legal challenges.
As soon as the vote is certified, White’s position will be considered immediately vacant and the campaign for the next county executive — which has been quietly happening behind the scenes for weeks — will kick into high gear.
But it’s possible that the election result may not be certified soon.
You may have noticed that this year’s recall election was scheduled for an unusual September election date — instead of the normal schedule in early April, June, August or November. (Special bond elections sometimes happen in February, as well.)
Elections are almost always on those regularly scheduled election days.
That could explain why voter turnout was relatively low. White was voted out of office yesterday by just 16% of Jackson County voters — compared to the 48% that turned out in the 2022 general election where White won reelection. In Kansas City specifically, turnout for the Frank White recall was even lower at 11%.
White and the Kansas City and Jackson County election boards argue that a Sept. 30 election is not just unusual, but illegal. And that could spell doom for the recall vote if a judge agrees with them.
A judge initially set the Sept. 30 date as a compromise with the recall campaign, which initially wanted to set the date for Aug. 26. The election boards argued in court that scheduling an August election on such short notice would disenfranchise military and overseas voters, who would not have received their ballots in time.
Now, White’s lawyer is asking the Missouri Supreme Court directly to stop the election boards from certifying the vote until they hear the case.
Here’s how that could affect Tuesday’s vote.
 Why did the election boards sue to reschedule the election?

The Jackson County Legislature initially ordered the election to be held on Aug. 26 after approving the ballot language in early July.
That’s based on a requirement set by an ordinance in 2023 that a special recall election be held within 60 days after signatures are filed.
But both the Kansas City Election Board and the Jackson County Election Board objected.
Those offices, which operate independently from White and the rest of county government, said that wasn’t enough time to prepare an election.
Military ballots would have needed to be mailed out just days later, and the boards would have had only about a week to prepare for absentee voting to begin.
DaRon McGee, chair of the county Legislature, was not sympathetic. McGee is one of the candidates vying to replace White now that he has been recalled.
“I am deeply concerned by reports that this election may not move forward on the timeline the law requires,” he told KCUR in a statement at the time. “The Legislature has done its part. We now look to the executive branch and the election board(s) to fulfill their roles.”
So the election boards sued.
They argued that Missouri law only allows counties to schedule elections on regular election days — in February, April, August or November, unless otherwise specified in a city or county charter. The Aug. 5 election was already underway, so they asked a judge to reschedule the election for Nov. 4.
Notably, every countywide Jackson County election for the past 27 years has occurred the Tuesday after the first Monday of February, April, August or November.
The same generally goes for elections in Kansas City, which also schedules City Council elections in April and June under the city’s charter. The only recent exceptions were elections related to the streetcar in October 2017, December 2012 and on a Friday in August 2008.
The Jackson County circuit judge, Marty W. Seaton, ultimately disagreed with the election boards.
He said that Missouri statute carves out an exception for elections that are authorized by a county’s charter. He argued that meant the 2023 Jackson County ordinance allowed a recall to happen outside of those dates in order to meet the 60-day requirement.
But he said an Aug. 26 election would still be too soon because military and overseas voters wouldn’t get their ballots in time, which would be unconstitutional. So he set a compromise date of Sept. 30.
 The legal battle continues

The election boards wanted to appeal, but a procedural move made that impossible.
Weeks earlier, while the case was playing out, White joined the lawsuit, arguing that the recall petition signatures themselves were illegal because some of the signature gatherers were not Missouri residents.
The judge heard arguments on the election date, but he set aside the issue of the out-of-state signature gatherers.
And because that issue remains unresolved, Seaton has not certified his ruling yet. That locked the election boards out of immediately appealing to a higher court.
So on Sept. 26, White’s lawyers tried a different maneuver.
They filed a lawsuit directly with the Western District Court of Appeals asking it to postpone the election until November because the election boards have not been able to appeal the circuit judge’s interpretation of the law.
“The election is imminent, and the trial court refused to certify its ruling for appeal,” White’s lawyers wrote. “Unless this Court intervenes, an unlawful election will proceed, wasting taxpayer resources, confusing voters, and undermining public confidence in Missouri elections.”
If this legal precedent stands, they argued, it would waste taxpayer dollars and confuse voters. If Jackson County can set an election for any day of the year, voters who are less tuned in to county politics may not even know that they’re missing an election.
The judge at the Western District Court of Appeals declined to take up the case. So now they’re taking it to the Missouri Supreme Court.
White’s lawyers filed a lawsuit against Seaton, the Jackson County circuit judge, just hours before the polls closed on Sept. 30, arguing that the election was illegally scheduled. They argued that proceeding with the election before the legal challenges are resolved would create chaos and distrust.
“Once results are released, the damage to public confidence cannot be undone,” the lawyers argued in their lawsuit filed with the Missouri Supreme Court. “Securing ballots until this Court resolves the legal issues preserves the integrity of both the vote and the judicial process.”
Phil LeVota, an attorney representing the recall effort in court who is also a candidate to become county executive if White is recalled, believes that Seaton’s ruling is strong enough to hold up in an appeal.
“He made a pretty good order where he really cited a lot of case law,” he said. “The charter says 60 days, and I’m going to err on the side of getting it in front of people sooner than later. And there’s no downside to having (the election) on Sept. 30.”
But White’s lawyers point to a 2002 precedent when a court ruled that a “floating timeframe” (like the 60-day requirement set by the 2023 ordinance) does not qualify as a specific election date authorized by law.
 Election outcome could be reversed

The Jackson County Circuit Court judge believes that the Sept. 30 election date was legal. But no other judges have given a legal opinion to back it up.
There are still a couple of legal avenues for White and the election boards to challenge the results.
The first option is the most recent Missouri Supreme Court case. White asked the judge to prevent the election boards from certifying the election results until the legal questions are resolved. That would keep White in office as county executive until the judges decide whether the election was legal.
The second option is that the election boards appeal the case once the circuit judge certifies his ruling. At that point, the Western District Court of Appeals — and potentially the Missouri Supreme Court — would hear the case and decide whether Seaton was correct in setting the election for Sept. 30.
The third option is for White to challenge the election results by suing the election boards. He could argue that there is reason to believe the election was unlawfully administered, and he could cite the election boards’ own argument in court earlier this year that Sept. 30 was not a legal date for an election.
If any of those judges decides that Sept. 30 was an illegal date to hold an election, the court could order another election for a redo. At this point, that likely would not happen until April 2026.
This wouldn’t be the first time that a ballot question had to go to voters for a redo.
In November 2022, Missouri voters voted on a constitutional amendment to force Kansas City to increase its level of police funding from 20% of its budget to 25%.
That constitutional amendment, put on the ballot by the Missouri General Assembly, passed by a wide margin — nearly two-thirds of Missourians voted “yes.”
But then the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that the ballot language was misleading. So a judge struck down the measure and ordered a new election with updated ballot language.
It still passed, but by a much smaller margin — by about 24,000 votes, or 2.2%.
With these legal questions looming, a messy scenario rests on the horizon.
Imagine that the election boards certify the vote later this week or next week. The county executive position is vacated, and the county Legislature appoints a replacement.
Meanwhile, the appeals court or the Missouri Supreme Court takes up White’s case about whether Sept. 30 was a legal date to hold an election.
And suppose they rule in White’s favor — that elections must be scheduled only on days that are specifically outlined by Missouri statute or the county charter.
That would mean that legally, White never should have been removed from office. And Jackson County would then have two county executives.
LeVota believes the circuit judge’s ruling is compelling enough that an appeals court or the state Supreme Court would back it up. But he acknowledged the possibility of a political crisis as a result of the ongoing litigation around the recall.
“The appeals court could come back,” LeVota said, “and say, ‘You know what, we don’t think the trial judge was right. We think it should have been a November election. We’re throwing that entire election out, and we’ll have to do a new one.’ That could definitely, definitely happen.”

In a joint press conference held Wednesday morning, hours after Congress missed the deadline to pass a federal budget, all six of the state’s Democratic representatives expressed concerns about rising health care costs, specifically the exclusion of an extension to the Affordable Care Act tax credits in Republican budget proposals. 
“We hear Republicans over and over all saying that they want to restore the ACA [Affordable Care Act] tax credits,” said U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City). “Put it on the floor, and we can end this tomorrow.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We are here because at some point you’ve got to fight for your constituents,” said U.S. Rep Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor). “Our colleagues appear that they’d rather shut down the government than make health care more affordable and address the affordability crisis we’re all hearing about every day.”
Each representative on the call described the rapidly rising health care premiums for their constituents. Those costs have become a defining issue for Democrats from across the country as federal funds expire. 
“This is a spinning out of control reality for our state, and it’s not acceptable,” said U.S. Rep Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham). “Michigan families expect us to do our jobs, and that means passing a responsible budget. That means holding the line on rising health care costs.”
They also pushed back against claims by GOP leadership, including President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, that health care benefits were going to benefit illegal immigrants.
“Instead of sitting down and talking about the issues, they’re distracting with this lie,” said U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids).
Members of Congress on the call were also critical of their Republican colleagues for what they called a lack of effort to negotiate or work towards a responsible budget. 
“My colleagues not showing up yesterday, standing on the House floor was very shocking to me as they motioned to just adjourn,” U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) said. 
U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly), who voted against a continuing resolution put forward by Republicans, shared similar concerns to her House colleagues in a press release, writing, “Since July, I have been very clear: any conversation about my vote needs to start with health care. President Trump’s ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ will result in every single Michigander either losing their health care or paying more than they already have.”

Trump has said that instead of temporary furloughs of non-essential federal workers during the government shutdown, his administration will pursue permanent layoffs of these government employees. The actual ramifications of this have yet to become clear, but the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office predicted that around 750,000 government workers will be furloughed due to the shutdown. 
Dingell addressed the impacts of the shutdown on federal workers, saying, “None of us makes this decision lightly, but in the end, we’re gonna protect the people that we represent.”
U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) added, “We cannot blink, we cannot compromise on providing health care to the people that need this care, life saving treatments, life saving medications.”
Michigan’s U.S. House Republicans have placed the blame for the shutdown squarely on the shoulders of Democrats in social media posts, but Democrats in their press conference called it a “Republican shutdown,” noting that the GOP currently controls the White House and both houses of Congress.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uscapitolstop2025-1024x722.jpg,,,2025-10-01 11:59:07.028943

“We have people who live in Zionsville, but they have a Brownsburg, Lebanon or Whitestown ZIP code, so this bill will help foster community by reflecting our true boundaries,” said Zionsville Mayor John Stehr. “It will also simplify services and make emergency response more efficient by eliminating confusion over who has jurisdiction for a particular location.” 
Lawrence Mayor Deb Whitfield said “having our own ZIP code is more than just a number on mail. It’s about identity, efficiency, and opportunity. It gives our city the recognition it deserves, improves services for residents and businesses, and strengthens the sense of community we all share. Thus, this step ensures that the people of Lawrence, that I serve are better connected, better represented, and better supported.”

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana domestic violence shelters doubled the number of beds available for emergency housing in recent years with millions in state funding.
The shelters went from offering 335 beds statewide in 2021 to 663 beds in 2025. Louisiana governors and legislators gave an additional $7 million per year, starting July 1, 2023, and continuing through June 30, 2026, which allowed for the expansion, said Mariah Stidham Wineski, executive director for the Louisiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence. 
Louisiana shelters typically turn down approximately 2,500 requests for emergency housing annually. But over the past 12 months, they have been able to meet more of the demand, only turning down 1,300 requests. 
“That investment did completely change the landscape of these services,” Wineski said at a Louisiana Senate Select Committee on Women and Children meeting Monday. 
With the new state funding, advocates opened five shelters and 11 outreach offices for day services in rural parishes. They also expanded seven existing shelters, six child advocacy centers and six legal advocacy offices for victims. Counseling and domestic violence prevention programs were also added with the money, Wineski said. 
In total, the state now has 21 domestic violence shelters run by 16 organizations. 
Before 2023, approximately 90% of the funding for domestic violence survivor services came from the federal government and totaled $7 million annually. Another 10% came from state marriage license fees and a grant from Louisiana’s criminal justice reinvestment fund. The shelters also do private fundraising.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

Domestic violence is more destructive in Louisiana than in almost any other state. Louisiana has ranked in the top five states for homicides between intimate partners since 1997, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.

One out of 100 Louisiana residents – approximately 45,000 people – had a spouse or dating partner threaten them with a firearm in the past year, Wineski said. 
There were 181 deaths in Louisiana that were the result of intimate partner violence between 2020 and 2022, according to a state health department report. More than 65% of the victims were women, and three-quarters of the deaths were caused by a firearm. 

The health department started monitoring domestic violence deaths three years ago through a new state domestic violence fatality review panel, which studies specific cases of domestic violence homicides. Based on its investigations, the panel makes recommendations on how to prevent domestic violence deaths. 
While the new state funding is appreciated, Wineski said some of it has had to backfill federal funding that has been cut. Over the past five years, Louisiana domestic violence shelters have lost $4 million in federal money. 
Access to affordable, interim housing continues to be a barrier to victims leaving their abusive partners. Emergency shelters take approximately 45 days to house survivors, and many people need another temporary place to stay before they fully independent, Wineski said. 

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development provides money for one to two years of rental assistance for domestic violence survivors. Wineski’s organization also uses an $800,000 annual grant it receives from the state to provide housing assistance on a short-term basis for people leaving shelters. 
But the $800,000 is at risk of going away, Wineski said. The money comes from Louisiana’s criminal justice reinvestment fund, which was tied to savings achieved through drops in the state prison population that occurred when Gov. John Bel Edwards was in office. 
Gov. Jeff Landry has sought to undo many of the criminal sentencing changes Edwards made, which could reverse the prison population drops. With Landry’s support, lawmakers have enacted longer prison sentences that could dramatically increase the number of state prisoners. 

Wineski said she hopes legislators will find another source for the money.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PXL_20240223_230001247-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-01 11:59:07.028943

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)A proposed ballot measure to allow voters to decide whether Nevada should have an independent redistricting commission will be withdrawn, say organizers, following a court challenge by lawyers aligned with the Democratic Party.
Marc Elias, the nation’s most prominent Democratic election lawyer, on Monday announced his firm, Elias Law Group, along with Bravo Schrager, a Nevada firm also aligned with Democrats, are representing a Nevada voter named Juan Medina and challenging an independent redistricting commission ballot question proposed by Vote Nevada PAC.
In response, the political action committee plans to withdraw its proposal, citing an inability to fund a legal defense.
Independent redistricting commission, nonpartisan voting ballot measures proposed in Nevada

“The sponsors of the independent redistricting commission ballot question are disappointed that Nevada’s Democratic Party has once again silenced Nevadans by blocking our right to discuss redistricting reform as a community,” said Vote Nevada PAC Executive Director Sandra Cosgrove in a statement to the Nevada Current. “Feeling entitled to draw our district maps does not give the Democratic Party the right to gerrymander our voices into silence.”
In 2024, a similar ballot measure to form an independent redistricting commission was deemed “legally deficient” by the Nevada Supreme Court because it did not establish a revenue source to pay for the new public body. Cosgrove was a part of that effort, which was filed by Fair Maps Nevada PAC. The legal challenge against Fair Maps was also filed by Elias Law Group and Bravo Schrager.
The complaint filed against this year’s proposal argues that the “operative text” of the ballot measure is identical to the one two years ago, and therefore still violates the state constitution’s prohibition on unfunded mandates. Attorneys also argue that, because the organizers of the new measure were involved in the nearly identical measure that was thrown out, they cannot resubmit the measure under a new PAC.
Bravo Schrager declined to comment Tuesday. Elias Law Group did not respond to a request for comment.
Cosgrove has previously said she disagrees with the Nevada Supreme Court ruling regarding the unfunded mandate, saying it is applied selectively.
In her statement Tuesday, she said the Vote Nevada organizers plan to submit a new petition “that directly addresses this misinterpretation of our Constitution.”
Vote Nevada last month filed a second proposed ballot measure to amend the state’s Voter Bill of Rights to include a provision that could force the two major political parties to open their primaries. That proposal was not challenged in court, and the PAC plans to move forward with it, according to Cosgrove.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PXL_20211115_204204863-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-10-01 11:59:07.028943

The organization was already absent in Wyoming, North Dakota and Mississippi.","BATON ROUGE, La. — Planned Parenthood on Tuesday shut down its two clinics in Louisiana over what the organization said were mounting financial and political challenges that made operating in the state no longer possible after more than 40 years.
The closures make Louisiana the most populous of just four states with no Planned Parenthood locations. Louisiana joins Wyoming, North Dakota and Mississippi as states where the organization is absent.
The exit underlines the pressures on Planned Parenthood as it warns of wider closures nationwide in the face of Medicaid funding cuts in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill. The organization is also halting advocacy work in Louisiana, where the state’s Republican leaders have cheered on the closures.
The closures were “not the result of a lack of need” but rather the outcome of “relentless political assaults that have made it impossible for us to continue operating sustainably in Louisiana,” said Melaney Linton, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast.
Supporters have said the closures will have a detrimental impact on Louisiana, where Planned Parenthood has never been licensed to perform abortions in the state but did provide other medical care services to nearly 11,000 patients last year at its Baton Rouge and New Orleans clinics. 
Advocates and medical professionals fear that the organization’s departure will further exacerbate reproductive health care in a state that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows already has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country. In addition, a March report by the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s office noted the state’s significant OB-GYN shortage and health care deserts.
Trump’s spending and tax plan instructs the federal government to end Medicaid payments for one year to certain abortion providers. While the organization is seeking to have its funding restored through the courts, Planned Parenthood officials have warned that around one-third of roughly 600 clinics could be forced to close.

Earlier this year, five clinics in California and eight in Iowa and Minnesota shut their doors. In the past week, the Wisconsin affiliate announced that it would stop providing abortion and the Arizona affiliate said it would halt Medicaid-funded services.
“This is a win for babies, a win for mothers, and a win for LIFE!” Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry posted on social media Tuesday.
Planned Parenthood provides a wide range of services, including cancer screenings and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment. Federal Medicaid money was already not paying for abortion, but affiliates relied on Medicaid to stay afloat.
In Louisiana, a state with one of the nation’s highest poverty rates, 60% of patients at Planned Parenthood clinics used Medicaid. Last year, the clinics in Louisiana provided nearly 30,000 tests for sexually transmitted infections, 14,400 visits for birth control, 1,800 cancer screenings and 655 ultrasounds.
Nearly a decade ago, Jordyn Martin said she turned to Planned Parenthood when she couldn’t afford medical services anywhere else. While at the clinic, a doctor offered Martin a free HIV test. A week later, she was diagnosed with the virus.
“Planned Parenthood saved my life,” said Martin, who went on to volunteer for the organization.
Outside of the New Orleans Planned Parenthood clinic Tuesday, several people gathered and brought thank-you notes to the organization that has spent four decades in Louisiana. Inside the building, up until close, staff worked to connect patients with alternative health care providers.
Starting Wednesday, calls to Planned Parenthood numbers in Louisiana were being transferred to the nearest location in Texas or Arkansas.
Michelle Erenberg, head of a New Orleans-based abortion rights group named LIFT, said people have been contacting her for help to find new clinics. She said it was important to connect people with providers but worries about the strain it will put on clinics that are already short-staffed.
“Whether patients are going to be able to get appointments quickly, or access all of the services that Planned Parenthood provided, is unknown at this point,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01095411/AP25273767476432.jpg,,,2025-10-01 11:59:07.028943

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The national museum and memorial commemorating the Oklahoma City bombing will remain open despite the federal government’s partial shutdown.
Though it is affiliated with the National Park Service, the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum’s operating hours won’t be affected because it does not receive annual appropriations from state, federal or local governments, officials said.
However, National Park Service rangers will not be on site during the shutdown, which began Wednesday after Congress was unable to reach a stopgap funding agreement ahead of the new federal fiscal year. 
The memorial, which is located at the site of the 1995 bombing, commemorates the country’s worst act of domestic terrorism that killed 168 people, including 19 children, and injured about 850.
In April 1995, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb was detonated outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested and convicted for their roles in the attack. McVeigh was later executed.Nichols is serving life in prison. A third man, Michael Fortier, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for not reporting knowledge of the plot.
During the duration of the government shutdown, the Memorial and Museum plans to provide federal employees free admission to the museum if they present a valid federal identification.
The Museum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday and from noon to 5 p.m. on Sunday.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Farmers Union)LINCOLN — After having the biggest gross domestic product loss among states at the start of this year, Nebraska tied for the sixth-highest GDP gains during the second quarter. 
The latest report from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis shared that Nebraska’s GDP rose roughly 5.2% in April, May and June. The real GDP nationally rose 3.8%, following slower growth of 0.5% in the first quarter. GDP represents the total market value of goods and services produced during a specific time period.

“This report points to the underlying strength of Nebraska’s economy — one driven by agriculture, value-added processes, biofuels, manufacturing, financial services, healthcare and other key components,” Gov. Jim Pillen said in a statement. 
Nebraska’s GDP fell 6.1% in the first quarter of 2025, a previous bureau report shared, joining Iowa in posting the biggest declines during that period. Falling row-crop prices were a big contributor, as products like wheat, corn and soybeans make up a large portion of Nebraska’s agricultural output.
Row-crop prices are still hurting, according to Ernie Goss, a regional economist and professor at Creighton University. But prices on other agricultural products — namely livestock — have continued to strengthen. 
With Nebraska being a largely “ag independent” state, Goss said shifts in the agricultural industry can have a larger impact on the state’s economy compared to others. 
“You live with the volatility, and you die with the volatility,” Goss said.

Goss pointed to several other factors that contributed to Nebraska’s GDP growth. He said construction and health care spending was up during the second quarter. He noted high-tourism events like the College World Series also likely played a role. 
Pillen said the federal report confirms that Nebraska’s economy is stable and argued lawmakers should use that advantage to improve the state’s tax system. State Sen. Brad von Gillern of Elkhorn, chair of the Nebraska Legislature’s Revenue Committee, said in the governor’s press release that he believes the state’s recent income tax reductions and property tax relief contributed to the growth. 
State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte said, “The latest GDP growth for Nebraska is further evidence that the Nebraska way of lowering taxes and growing our traditional values is working.” 
However, Goss said Nebraska’s second quarter growth may have been an “anomaly.” He said it’s common for states seeing a period of economic slowdown to bounce back in the next quarter, but he said there are signs the third quarter might not be so positive. 
A Creighton economics report released Wednesday indicated that Nebraska’s business conditions fell this fall and found that the overall value of the state’s exported goods in 2025 is not as high as it was at this point in 2024.
Goss said China, which was once a big buyer of Nebraska pork and soybeans, has not made a purchase since May. He speculated that this may be in retaliation for the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. 
While Goss said Nebraska’s GDP may not fall into the negative percentages next quarter, he doesn’t expect the growth to be as significant as 5.2%.
“It won’t be negative, but it won’t be the strongest,” Goss said.

WILMINGTON – Breast Cancer Awareness Month is underway, and the Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition (DBCC) is putting the spotlight on the lifesaving power of self-awareness and advocacy. Breast cancer remains a pressing concern in Delaware. In 2025, an estimated 1,210 new cases will be diagnosed among Delaware residents. The state’s rates are higher than the national average, especially among underserved populations.
The Unexpected Connection
At DBCC, the mission has always been about reaching individuals with education, screenings, and support. But sometimes, chance encounters carry the biggest impact.
That was the case for Lissette Rivera, DBCC’s Women’s Health Screening Manager, during a visit to an imaging center earlier this year. Rivera was there to assist a scheduled patient who required interpretation services. Unable to spot her patient in the waiting room, Rivera sent a quick text: “Where are you?”
Looking around, she noticed a young Latina woman standing alone, clearly anxiously awaiting her appointment. Rivera approached, assuming she was the patient. She wasn’t—but she was also in desperate need of interpretation services for her own upcoming appointment.  The young woman’s self-breast exam led to the discovery of a lump forcing her to bravely advocate for herself to get breast cancer screening before the age of 40. Without hesitation, after learning more about her story and reason for screening Rivera offered to stay and assist this woman as well.
Two Appointments, Two Outcomes
Rivera’s decision led to two very different outcomes that day.

The scheduled patient, the reason for Rivera’s visit, received wonderful news: a clear screening.
The 34-year-old woman she met by chance, received devastating news: a breast cancer diagnosis.

That diagnosis came the very week the woman was preparing to celebrate her 35th birthday in early September.
What could have been a lonely, frightening experience became a moment of compassion. DBCC, through Rivera, was there immediately to offer support and begin guiding the young woman through the next steps of treatment and survivorship care.
The Power of a Chance Encounter
Since that day, DBCC has continued to walk alongside the newly diagnosed patient, helping her navigate the complexities of surgery, treatment, and the emotional toll of cancer.
“This story is a powerful reminder,” says Lissette Rivera, “that advocating for yourself—even when it feels uncomfortable—can save lives. And when someone is willing to step in and connect you with the right resources, that support can make all the difference.”
The coalition encourages Delawareans to prioritize screenings and self-advocacy, and reminds the community that DBCC patient navigators are available in English, Spanish, and Haitian-Creole. To schedule a mammogram or seek support, call (302) 672-6435.
“Get screened for breast cancer,” Rivera urges. “Early detection saves lives—one of them could be yours, or someone you love.”
DBCC’s Statewide Role
With headquarters in Wilmington and offices in Kent and Sussex Counties, DBCC is the only organization providing comprehensive breast cancer support services across Delaware. Its work includes:

Screening & Education: Free or reduced-cost mammograms, outreach programs, and community health fairs.
Survivorship & Support: Peer Mentor Program linking newly diagnosed patients with survivors, plus bilingual and culturally tailored outreach.
Advocacy & Empowerment: Partnerships with the National Breast Cancer Coalition to push for research and an eventual end to breast cancer.

“Our vision is to create a community where every person diagnosed with breast cancer is a survivor, and fear and doubt are replaced with knowledge and hope,” said Francesca Vogel, DBCC CEO
Community Spotlight: Dewey Goes Pink
The state’s largest awareness event, Dewey Goes Pink, returns Saturday, October 4, drawing more than 5,000 participants to the beach for a 5K walk/run, music, and a post-race feast. Last year, the event raised $365,000, bringing its 13-year total to nearly $2 million for DBCC programs.
Other events throughout the month include walks, golf outings, art exhibits, film screenings, and wellness gatherings—all fueling education, screenings, and survivor services year-round.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Fifteen years after a 1,600-bed private prison in west central Minnesota shuttered, the Trump administration is considering reopening the facility as an immigrant detention center. 
Internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement records obtained by the Washington Post in August named the vacant Prairie Correctional Facility in Appleton as a piece of the plan to expand immigrant detention capacity to more than 100,000 beds by the end of the year — about a 66% increase from April. 
Faith leaders from across the state joined Appleton residents in a prayer vigil in protest of the prison’s potential reopening Tuesday. One resident, with supporters in tow, delivered a letter to local leaders, signed by a number of faith leaders and immigrant rights organizations, opposing the detention center plans and requesting transparency. 
“Appleton, frankly, is going to be a real hotbed of resistance,” said Rev. Daniel Romero of Disciples Public Presence, a social justice advocacy arm of the Disciples of Christ church.

The documents obtained by the Post were preliminary plans and were still in flux at the time of reporting, but the prison’s owners, CoreCivic, and ICE have not denied the reports. 
Appleton City Administrator John Olinger told MPR News in August that CoreCivic was “aggressively pursuing” a contract with ICE.
ICE and its enforcement and detention tactics have become a flashpoint as the Trump administration attempts a mass deportation campaign, while human rights activists and civil libertarians demand more scrutiny and accountability. 
On Tuesday, for instance, U.S. District Court Judge William Young, a Reagan-appointee, slammed the Trump administration for using deportations as a way to stamp out the free speech rights of immigrant pro-Palestinian demonstrators. He called the conduct of the administration unconstitutional and “a thing virtually unknown to our constitutional tradition.” 
In a statement to the Reformer, an ICE spokesperson said the agency “is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity.” The Republican megalaw passed in July boosted funding for immigrant detention and deportation by $176 billion, with $45 billion set aside for expanding detention capacity. 
CoreCivic spokesman Brian Todd said the company “continue(s) to explore opportunities with our government partners for which our Prairie Correctional Facility could be a viable solution.”

Prairie Correctional Facility was Minnesota’s only private prison until it shut down in 2010. A state law passed by the DFL-Legislature in 2023 bans private prison contracts at the state level — but won’t impact the federal government’s efforts to establish a private detention facility in Minnesota. 
The resistance is certainly present — if not widespread — in Appleton, which Trump won in 2024 by 27 points. As dozens of people gathered to sing and pray together in the green space next to Appleton City Hall, a truck circled the block with an American flag flying and a “WELCOME ICE” sign. 
One woman stopped by to heckle the group.

The cost of a single subway, bus or paratransit ride will hit $3 for the first time come January, after the MTA board on Tuesday approved the latest in a series of every-other-year increases.
The MTA had avoided hitting the 3-buck milestone in recent years, despite previous proposals to reach the mark that stretched back nearly a decade. 
MTA Chairperson and Chief Executive Janno Lieber acknowledged that any bump in fares is “always painful,” while contrasting what amounts to a 2% annual increase with double-digit fare hikes elsewhere in the country. 
“As we always say, transit is one of the things that makes NY affordable,” Lieber said. “Let’s start talking about housing and childcare and the other things that are clearly the center of that affordability crisis.”
Lieber pointed to a double-digit fare increase last year at New Jersey Transit and at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, where a 21.5% fare hike kicked in Sept. 14.
Officials also noted how transportation costs are lower in New York City than in almost all major U.S. cities — and flagged how the fare increase could have sent the cost of a single ride surging to $3.14.
“If we had actually followed the rate of inflation over the last two years, we would be asking you for a 24-cent increase to the base fare today,” Jessie Lazaruz, the agency’s deputy chief for commercial ventures, told the board prior to the 11-0 approval, with two members abstaining.
Instead, the MTA stuck to a pattern of what agency officials call “small and predictable” fare increases every other year.
Accompanying bumps will come for reduced-fare bus, subway and Access-A-Ride service, with the cost per ride going up 5 cents to $1.50 and the cost of express bus service that links the boroughs with Manhattan going from $7 to $7.25. The last fare increase came in 2023, when it went from $2.75 to the current $2.90 mark.
The vote also locked in a fare cap under the tap-and-go OMNY fare-payment system, ensuring that riders will pay no more than $35 for rides within a seven-day period, while reduced-fare riders will be capped at $17.50. That will permanently replace the unlimited-ride options available under the 7-Day and 30-Day MetroCard, as well unlimited passes for express buses.
The MTA earlier this week dropped the seven-day fare cap a buck from an earlier proposal of $36, citing the response of riders during the six-week public comment period that followed the July unveiling of the fare proposal.
“That feedback has helped us modify our proposals,” Lazarus said.
Transit officials said the increases — which will also kick in on Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road — are essential for the agency’s bottom line, with two-thirds of the agency’s operating expenses going to labor costs associated with its 70,000 employees. 
“It’s real simple, 70% of the MTA’s operating budget goes to pay their workers their medical coverage, their benefits and their pensions,” Lieber said. “Their wages increase, on average, between 3% and 4% a year, it varies a little bit — we now have a 2% per year fare increase.”
The Citizens Budget Commission noted that labor also has a part to play in the MTA’s financial well-being.
Adam Schmidt, a senior research associate with the non-partisan think tank, cited ongoing labor talks with Long Island Rail Road workers and a looming labor showdown next spring with the Transport Workers Union. 
“Both sides should pursue work role changes that increase productivity and operational flexibility so the MTA can continue to provide reliable service and fair wage increases,” he said.
Lieber also acknowledged that the ‘pizza principle’ — a theory that the cost of a subway ride and the slice of pizza should be about the same — no longer holds.
“I don’t know what the pizza principle would dictate at this point because folks have told me that we’re less than a slice in many cases,” he said. “Certainly at Totonno’s or some of the other great Brooklyn pizzerias that I favor, the slice has gone north of $3.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/042025_omny-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 10:57:16.497556

“As part of our ongoing restructuring, we have adjusted our upcoming schedule to focus on our strongest markets,” the airline said in a statement. “This includes the difficult decision to discontinue service at Hartford (BDL), effective Oct. 31, 2025, and Minneapolis (MSP), effective Dec. 1, 2025.”
The airline said it would reach out to affected passengers to provide refunds.
“We thank our airport, business and community partners in Connecticut and Minnesota for their support over the years,” the airline said.
The Connecticut Airport Authority, which operates Bradley International Airport, released a statement.
“Spirit Airlines has been an integral part of Bradley International Airport’s airline network over the last eight years,” it reads. “We thank Spirit Airlines for their investment in the Hartford market and will be ready to welcome them back when their current circumstances change.”
Connecticut Airport Authority Public Information Officer Brian Spyros said passengers will still have other options.
“It’s also important to note that Spirit has been offering year-round or seasonal service to Fort Lauderdale, Myrtle Beach, Detroit, Nashville and Orlando,” Spyros said. “Other airlines here at the airport already fly to those same destinations — so there will be no loss of nonstop routes for passengers from BDL in the wake of Spirit’s departure.”
The budget airline filed for its second bankruptcy in August, saying it was determined to keep flying. Last week, Spirit announced its plans to furlough nearly 2,000 flight attendants.

(Photo courtesy of Maine Family Planning)Maine Family Planning will shutter its primary care practice by the end of the month after being blocked from accepting Medicaid funds.
The state’s largest reproductive health care provider was one of two Maine organizations that can no longer claim Medicaid reimbursements due to a provision in the budget reconciliation bill that targeted certain providers that offered abortions (although the federal funds cannot and were never used to fund abortion services).
That meant a loss of $2 million in annual revenue for Maine Family Planning, which operates health care centers in 18 locations across the state. Primary care services were available in three of those locations. 
Maine Family Planning filed a lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction to block the law from applying to the organization, but Judge Lance Walker — who was appointed by President Donald Trump in his first term — denied that request. Maine Family Planning appealed to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston requesting a response by September 30.
“We have been very clear with the courts that without intervention and without the ability to bill Medicaid, we will have to end our primary care practices in Ellsworth, Presque Isle and Houlton by October 31,” said Olivia Pennington, the group’s director of advocacy and community engagement. 
“Those are all federally designated medically underserved areas. So we know already that folks have difficulty accessing health care, especially primary care, in those areas.”
Federal judge OKs Medicaid defunding of Maine’s largest reproductive health care provider

Walker wrote in his late August decision that the health care provider failed to demonstrate the irreparable harm it claimed to face, despite attorneys for Maine Family Planning warning about the impending shuttering of primary care and having to lay off providers in rural areas where health care is already scarce.
Maine Family Planning’s primary care practice was modeled to serve patients on MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, so without those federal funds, it is no longer sustainable, the organization said in a statement. Over the next 30 days, it will notify patients that they are being discharged and will work with them to help identify other primary care providers in the region that are accepting new patients. 
 “The cruel and dangerous law has put us in an impossible situation,” said George Hill, president and CEO of Maine Family Planning. “Discharging and turning away vulnerable patients strikes at the very heart of MFP’s reputation as a trusted community provider that has been able to serve patients of any means for more than 50 years.”
The provider is still seeing patients who need family planning care, regardless of insurance status, for as long as that is possible. 
Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, the other Maine provider blocked from accepting Medicaid funds, is still continuing to see patients in four health care centers across the state, regardless of their insurance or ability to pay. The organization recently started canvassing communities in southern Maine to let residents know about the broad health services they offer.

Alaskans have occasionally participated in the parade in New York City, which is celebrating its 99th anniversary this year, but the company believes this will be the first time that the state will be represented by a float in the event.
The announcement came on one of the last days of Holland America’s summer cruise ship operations in Alaska’s capital city. Juneau will continue receiving occasional large cruise ships through October.
“The float will be named simply ‘The Land of Glaciers, Wildlife and Wonder,’” said Leanne Jones with Holland America official during a ceremony announcing the float and a $5,000 donation to Trail Mix, a local trail-building nonprofit in Juneau.
“This marks the first time Alaska will be featured in the iconic holiday event, and the first time Holland America Line has ever participated in this parade,” Jones said. The parade is scheduled to start at 4:30 a.m. Alaska time on Thursday, Nov. 27.
A rendering displayed Monday shows a howling wolf, black bear and a moose at the back of the float. The main platform is a glacier and river with leaping salmon. 
“Well, that’s a pretty exciting announcement,” said Juneau Mayor Beth Weldon. “And you know, after Macy’s parade, we do have a Fourth of July parade in Juneau.”

Kaela Berg, DFL-Burnsville, listened to testimony on a mental health education bill in 2024. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota Rep. Kaela Berg, DFL-Burnsville, announced Wednesday that she’s running to replace U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, who is running for the U.S. Senate.
Berg is a single mom, flight attendant and union activist.
“I have had to fight to be in every room that I have been in,” Berg said in a Reformer interview.
She was first elected to the Minnesota House in 2020 after winning a south metro swing district race.
The south metro 2nd Congressional District is Minnesota’s most competitive. In 2024, over $13.3 million was spent on the race, most of which supported Craig’s campaign, down from over $31 million in 2022, according to campaign spending tracker OpenSecrets. Craig turned the district blue in 2018 and has won close races ever since, widening her victory in 2024 despite the Republicans’ victory nationwide.
Minnesota Sen. Matt Klein, DFL-Mendota Heights, and former DFL Sen. Matt Little are also running for the seat, as are Republicans Sen. Eric Pratt, R-Prior Lake, and Tyler Kistner, the 2020 and 2022 GOP nominee who lost to Craig twice.
Berg is part of a small group of working class state legislators — a 2024 study from Duke and Loyola Chicago found that less than 2% of state lawmakers nationwide come from working class jobs, dwarfed by the 50% of the labor force in working class jobs. Berg, whose parents are retired college professors, does not have a college degree.
She’s been a flight attendant for 22 years and is a lifelong Minnesotan, according to a campaign press release. She currently works for Endeavor Air, a subsidiary of Delta, and has held various leadership positions in her local union, including union steward and vice president.
Berg has pushed legislation to expand funding for school mental health personnel, and another bill to increase the criminal penalties for so-called straw purchases of firearms, which is when someone buys a gun for someone else who isn’t legally allowed to own one. Her district endured the shooting and killing of two Burnsville police officers and a paramedic last year by someone who was heavily armed via straw purchases.
Berg said that her policy focus in Washington would be on lowering living costs, strengthening public schools and stopping “attacks on health care” from the Republicans’ “egregious agenda.”
Lowering the cost of essentials is “easier than most people think,” Berg said: tackle “unfair tariffs”; make sure the wealthiest 1% and corporations pay their fair share in taxes; and invest in health care, housing and utilities.
“There are too many hardworking families in this district who feel like they’re falling further behind while Washington politicians look out for the wealthy and well-connected,” said Berg in the release announcing her campaign.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/working-class.jpeg,,,2025-10-01 09:57:58.795050

Visitors can use hotels, roads, lookouts, trails, open-air memorials and other sites but there won’t be visitor services, plan states.
The post Yellowstone, Grand Teton ordered to remain partly open as government shutdown begins appeared first on WyoFile .","The Department of Interior on Tuesday ordered Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks to remain partly open as the federal government shut down at midnight over a budget impasse in Congress.
“Park roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors,” according to the “lapse plan.” But visitor centers and other facilities that are usually locked after business hours will be closed, according to the agency’s September 2025 contingency plan posted Tuesday evening.
Staffing will be reduced “based on the assumption that the NPS is conducting no park operations and providing no visitor services,” the plan states.
Parks will begin notifying the public today regarding operations, services and which facilities are open or closed. Those notifications could clarify some elements of the plan that may appear confusing, including what visitor services will or will not be provided.
Whether “accessible areas” will have basic services appears to depend on whether fees are collected there.
“Past shutdowns in which gates remained open with limited staff have hurt our parks.” The Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks
“Basic visitor services” to maintain restrooms, sanitation, trash collection, road maintenance, campgrounds, law enforcement, emergency personnel and access through entrance gates will be provided at sites that collect fees under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, the plan states.
At Yellowstone, campgrounds will be open, WyoFile has learned. Emergency services parkwide, however, will be limited.
Hotels operated by concessionaires can remain open with the blessing of a park’s superintendent and approval by the Interior Department’s assistant secretary for fish, wildlife and parks.
The Park Service will not provide road or trail conditions and will not maintain websites or social media except for emergencies, the plan states. The Park Service will not open parks that don’t have “accessible areas,” according to the plan.
Former supervisors protest
The plan was put in place over the objections of 42 former park superintendents, including former Yellowstone Superintendent Mike Finley. They wrote Interior Secretary Doug Burgum on Thursday under The Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks’ letterhead.
“[W]e write to you with an urgent appeal to protect our parks and public lands by closing them if a government shutdown occurs,” the letter reads. “Past shutdowns in which gates remained open with limited staff have hurt our parks: Iconic symbols cut down and vandalized, trash piled up, habitats destroyed, and visitor safety jeopardized.”

The Park Service plan allows closure of areas with sensitive natural, cultural, historic or archaeological resources that can’t be protected — if the closure is approved by the assistant secretary.
The plan expects 9,296 of 14,500 employees to be furloughed,leaving 5,204 workers — about 36% — to run the parks.
In addition to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, the agency operates Devil’s Tower National Monument, Fossil Butte National Monument, the Fort Laramie National Historic Site, the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway and Bighorn Canyon National Recreational Area in Wyoming.
One wildlife tour operator on Thursday shared a letter to Wyoming’s congressional delegation saying uncertainty over a shutdown was plaguing his business.
“Our work, and the experience we provide to travelers from all over the world, relies deeply on the operation, maintenance, and stewardship of our public lands and the National Park Service,” wrote Taylor Phillips, owner of Jackson Hole EcoTour Adventures. “We have already seen the impacts of workforce cuts,” he wrote, worrying about “further reductions that would only weaken the guest experience.
“And when that experience suffers, visitors go elsewhere.”
In 2024, national park sites in Wyoming drew 8.1 million visitors, who spent $1.2 billion in the state, the agency reported Monday. That included $710 million in visitor spending for Yellowstone, $808 million for Grand Teton, $41.7 million for Devils Tower, $1.3 million for Fossil Butte and $1.4 million for Fort Laramie.
A glorious time
Some Yellowstone facilities were scheduled to remain open through Oct. 31, although many shut down for the season before that date due to weather. Whether that schedule changes with limited operations under the shutdown plan remains uncertain.
Plowing roads, for example, will not generally be allowed, according to the plan. Meantime, Yellowstone remains a magical place in the fall, a seasonal ranger said.
Bugling elk and fall colors draw crowds to Grand Teton and Yellowstone this time of year. 
“It’s just a glorious time to be here,” said John Kerr, who works in the summer in Lamar Valley. Now off duty, Kerr spoke for himself and not in any official capacity. “This is a time when bears are in hyperphagia — they are eating as much as possible to prepare themselves for a winter of hibernation. They are more visible.”

The Florida Department of Education reported that 444 titles were removed in some capacity across 16 counties in the state during the 2024-25 school year, down from 732 titles removed the school year before. In 2022-23, the state reported 386 removed titles.
In this, PEN’s fourth year of reporting, Florida ranked highest in the nation with 2,304 bans statewide of the 6,870 reported nationwide. Florida was responsible for 4,500 of the more than 10,000 books PEN reported the previous school year. 
The state reports books as removed when material has been discontinued in response to a parent or resident of the county and the data are reported by school districts.
PEN America’s dataset comprises school book bans reported to the organization and those covered in news media. The organizations cautions that its dataset is not comprehensive —  “there are likely additional school book bans that have not been reported.” It’s sum includes books that have been shelved pending review and those removed in response to direct or threatened action by government officials.
“Over the past four years, a misleading campaign to ‘protect children’ alongside advocacy for ‘parental rights’ has been weaponized to diminish students’ First Amendment rights in schools, sow distrust in librarians and educators, and diminish the ability of authors and illustrators to connect with their intended audiences,” PEN wrote in a news release.
The PEN database includes about 600 titles in Hillsborough County that are “banned pending investigation.”
The DOE list does not disclose any titles in Hillsborough County, for example, that have been removed.
The PEN list includes 500 materials in Union County “banned” in June 2025, although the DOE list does not include any titles removed in that county during the previous school year. 
Volusia County, in the PEN report, saw about 180 titles “banned pending investigation” and, per the DOE methodology, one title was removed during the previous school year, “The Kite Runner.”
The bulk of the state’s reported removals were in Clay County. PEN puts about 400 titles in jeopardy there, while the state lists about 280 removed titles in Clay County.

In August, PEN America celebrated a recent lawsuit by book authors and publishers challenging the state’s law removing books from classrooms and libraries. A federal trial judge ruled that the state’s law banning books deemed “pornographic” from school libraries is, in part, “overbroad and unconstitutional.”
Law banning school library books ruled ‘overbroad and unconstitutional’

“It is important to recognize that books available in schools, whether in a school or classroom library or as part of a curriculum, were selected by librarians and educators as part of the educational offerings to students,” PEN America wrote. “Book bans occur when those choices are overridden by school boards, administrators, teachers, or even politicians on the basis of a particular book’s content.”
PEN America credits Florida’s rate of removals to “the passage of multiple vague laws, direct pressure from local groups and elected officials, and threats to educators’ professional licenses if they fail to comply.”
Florida Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas, for example, has taken to social media to threaten Hillsborough County Superintendent Van Ayres over books available in that county’s catalog.
According to PEN, the most frequently banned book nationwide is “A Clockwork Orange” by Anthony Burgess with 23 instances. The next-most banned book is “Sold” by Patricia McCormick with 20. 
Nationwide, Stephen King is the most-banned author, followed by Ellen Hopkins, Stah J. Maas, Jodi Picoult, and Yusei Matsui. 
Lawmakers in 2024 acknowledged book challenges may’ve been out of control, calling abundant challenges by a small number of objectors “frivolous” when they passed a law limiting objections from non-parents to one per month. This school year was the first year that law was in effect.

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)Nothing reminds you of the constantly-changing needs of humanity quite like a tornado ripping through your community. 
When the May 16 storm hit St. Louis, it devastated neighborhoods and left a lasting impact on hundreds of residents who were already at higher risk of food insecurity. Combine that with upcoming changes to SNAP benefits and grocery prices that are nearly 30% higher than five years ago, and it is irrefutable that the food security landscape in our region is shifting.
We see these shifts firsthand at Operation Food Search, where demand for hunger relief services has more than doubled in certain areas. 
Our job, as an organization, is to respond to these changing needs. But adaptation requires accurate information. Without reliable data, we cannot adapt our programs in ways that are precise and impactful. 
That is why the USDA’s decision to cancel its 2025 Household Food Security Report is so troubling.
What is happening in our region is a microcosm of a reality that plays out across the nation every day. Needs shift, and the organizations that serve them must adapt. 
For 30 years, the data collected in the Household Food Security Report has guided governments and nonprofits on how to do so. At Operation Food Search, for example, it provides the level of detail required to make decisions about where to expand school-based weekend meal programs and how to prioritize routes of our mobile farmers’ market. These are programs on which the most vulnerable populations (including children, veterans, and disabled and elderly people) depend. Without consistent data, organizations like ours will be less able to direct resources in a way that maximizes impact.
The USDA’s statement that “trends in the prevalence of food insecurity have remained virtually unchanged” glosses over statistically significant shifts. 
In a nation of more than 340 million people, even an incremental percentage signifies thousands of real humans. The Household Food Security Report remains the only source that has tracked three decades of national and state-level hunger with consistent, comparable data. Its breadth and continuity—breaking down results by age, race, ethnicity, geography, and severity—are what allow policymakers and nonprofits to understand what’s working, what’s not, and how to evolve as needs do. 
On a national scale, the loss of this data comes at a particularly dangerous moment. In the 12 months ending in August, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.9%, with core inflation up 3.1% as tariffs and a tight labor market pushed prices higher. 
The food price index rose 3.2% in the same period, and as food costs climb, so does the risk of food insecurity. At the same time, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that 150,000 Missourians and 472,000 Illinoisans will lose some or all of their SNAP benefits under new requirements. 
To be clear, without the USDA’s annual survey we will not know how many Americans have enough to eat. Hunger is not static. It evolves with every storm and every policy change.
Cancelling this research does not cancel hunger; it simply makes it harder for us all to clearly see challenges and address them.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/produce-usda-image-1024x678-1.jpg,,,2025-10-01 08:57:05.904740

The word “accountability’’ continues to be thrown in every direction when it comes to solving homelessness. 
A bill on the governor’s desk, Senate Bill 634 from state Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez, would be a step forward in holding local jurisdictions accountable for addressing homelessness by stopping cities from chasing away critical, supportive services — along with the people who take on the tough task of helping unhoused people.
In his efforts to hold cities accountable, Gov. Gavin Newsom has rightly castigated some of the worst actors at the local level — from the city of Turlock, which refused to commit $1 in local funding to unlock major state funding to keep an existing shelter open, to the city of Norwalk, which sought to ban supportive housing and shelters in violation of state and federal law. Thankfully, a state lawsuit forced officials there to back down.
I have seen the entire spectrum of local efforts on homelessness — positive and negative —  in my role as a city councilmember in Claremont, chairperson of the San Gabriel Valley Regional Housing Trust and board member of the LA County Affordable Housing Solutions Agency.
Some localities are good actors, trying to solve the problem but lacking the tools and partnerships required to be effective. Some are bad actors, turning homelessness policy into an indictment of the people who cannot afford housing — suggesting the problem is that they are visible, not that they are unhoused. 
Accountability from state leaders means continuing to provide desperately needed funding for housing and supportive services, to help get our homeless neighbors back into housing. Accountability from cities means, at the most basic level, allowing those lifesaving, supportive services to reach the people experiencing homelessness on our streets. 
Despite reams of evidence that criminalizing homelessness not only fails to solve the issue but actually prolongs homelessness and makes it worse, some cities even tried criminalizing basic supportive services that help people survive the streets and get them back into housing.
In February, Fremont proposed criminalizing people who ‘’aid and abet’’ homeless encampments, as though social workers and good Samaritans handing out sandwiches were driving the getaway car in a bank robbery.  El Cajon, Santa Ana and other cities have tried it, too. 
That makes SB 634 even more critical. As the Trump administration pushes cities to take more draconian tactics, the bill would draw a line, so cities cannot prohibit the delivery of basic outreach and supportive services to people experiencing homelessness.
These services — coupled with access to housing that’s affordable — are ultimately the only long-term solution to homelessness. Everything else is just a shell game. 
Cities can and should do more. They should enact zoning that makes it easier to build affordable housing and shelters. They should partner with counties to make sure behavioral health services are available for people seeking them. The list of best practices goes on. 
At the very least, they should not bar the services needed to address homelessness for which Newsom has consistently provided funding. The governor should take these recalcitrant cities to task and sign SB 634.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/04023-Bakersfield-PROJECT-LV_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-01 08:57:05.904740

(Photo by baona/Getty stock photo)On Oct. 6, the Maryland Supreme Court will hear consolidated appeals in climate lawsuits filed by Baltimore, Annapolis and Anne Arundel County against numerous American energy companies. At stake is whether Maryland law can be stretched to hold American energy producers liable for the global effects of climate change.
State court judges in Baltimore and Annapolis already dismissed these cases as preempted by federal law. The question now is whether Maryland’s highest court will affirm that ruling or allow identical litigation that has failed in Maryland and across the country to continue.
Since 2017, close to three dozen states, counties and municipalities have tried to use state consumer or nuisance laws to pin the costs of climate change on energy producers. Most have lost. Courts in New Jersey, South Carolina, Maryland and Pennsylvania have already dismissed such claims, finding them far beyond the scope of state laws.
Climate change is a global challenge. Emissions come from billions of decisions made over more than a century, across every state and country. Courts have consistently recognized that no single jurisdiction can regulate global emissions through local tort law. As one South Carolina judge warned, these suits risk creating a “chaotic web of conflicting legal obligations.” That is why the U.S. Supreme Court in American Electric Power v. Connecticut – in a decision handed down by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg – unanimously held that federal law governs these claims, and why Maryland judges have already dismissed them.

Even the Biden-Harris administration acknowledged that these cases face constitutional hurdles. In the former solicitor general’s brief, the Justice Department admitted that climate lawsuits may falter when they attempt to penalize companies for out-of-state or international conduct. The brief noted defendants “may ultimately prevail on their contention that respondents’ claims are barred by the Constitution … to the extent the claims rely on conduct occurring outside” state borders. That rationale led a Delaware state court to narrow that state’s lawsuit to in-state emissions and a Baltimore court to dismiss its case outright last year. The legal foundation for climate litigation is shaky at best.
National security leaders have also urged caution. Retired Air Force Gen. Richard Myers and retired Navy Adm. Michael Mullen warned that undermining petroleum production through litigation could harm America’s fuel security and military readiness.
None of this is to say that climate change is not a real and urgent problem. Marylanders know firsthand the risks of rising seas, stronger storms and hotter summers. But the state’s path forward lies in practical solutions, not courtroom battles with little chance of success.
Maryland has already invested in resilience projects, renewable energy and emissions-reduction initiatives that make a measurable difference. Expanding those efforts, through innovation, infrastructure and collaboration will do far more for local communities than years of costly litigation likely to end in dismissal.
It is also worth noting that the Baltimore, Annapolis and Anne Arundel County cases have been brought by San Francisco-based trial lawyers. Their interests do not align with Maryland’s. For them, the lawsuits are part of a broader campaign, regardless of whether they succeed. For Maryland, however, the risk is wasted time, taxpayer dollars and missed opportunities to implement real solutions.
Climate change is a challenge of governance and policy, not ambulance-chasing tort law. Disputes of such interstate and international nature belong with Congress and federal agencies, not local courts. Allowing state-level claims to proceed risks turning judges into policymakers, imposing regulations through litigation rather than democratic debate.
Maryland’s own circuit judges recognized this, finding that the Constitution’s federal structure does not allow state law to be applied to claims tied to global emissions. Upholding those rulings would not be a denial of climate action. It would be an affirmation that the courts must respect their proper role.
If Maryland truly wants to lead on climate solutions, it should build on the work already underway: Investing in coastal resilience, supporting technological innovation and fostering partnerships with federal agencies and the private sector. These initiatives can deliver real benefits for Maryland families, workers and communities. By contrast, pursuing lawsuits that have already failed in New York, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina — and Maryland — itself is a distraction. It will not bring the progress Marylanders need.
The Maryland Supreme Court has an opportunity to bring clarity and finality. By affirming the dismissals, it can ensure that the state’s energy and resources are directed toward viable solutions, not prolonged legal battles. Doing what’s best for Maryland means moving beyond litigation and focusing on policies that actually work.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1182600677-1024x718.jpg,,,2025-10-01 08:57:05.904740

Burlington, Vermont
Died Sept. 15, 2025
Essex, New York


Stephen Goddard “Steve” Phillips, 82, of Elm Street, Essex, NY, died unexpectedly Monday, September 15, 2025, at his home, with his loving wife by his side.
He was born in Burlington, Vermont, September 12, 1943, the son of Edward Steward and Madelon Frances (Glaser) Phillips.
Steve graduated from Burlington High School, Class of 1961. He went on to pursue a degree in engineering from UVM, but mid-way through his junior year his ambition to build became uncontainable and he left college to begin forming the foundations of his company, S.G. Phillips, Co. What began as “grunt” work, clearing and grubbing for the Vermont Interstate System and working in sewer lines, quickly grew into being named a Top 100 Contractor in the U.S. From Maine to Florida, his company built municipal wastewater facilities, buildings for IBM and Hannaford, ski resorts in Sugarbush and Ascutney, and transformed Church Street in Burlington in the ‘80s, laying every brick you walk on today. His company was only successful by the hard work and determination of his employees, all 700+ at its peak. Steve had a rare skill of surrounding himself with smarter people whose appetite for construction was equal to his. He had profound love and respect for his construction family.
Steve had another family he was building concurrently. He and his first wife, Pamela (Gerhard), bought and began fixing up an old farmhouse in Waitsfield, VT that welcomed his first two sons. Shortly after their marriage ended he met and married his second wife, Judith (Osler) and welcomed two more sons. Their home became quite literally the command center, complete with a landing strip, where his children were raised with an abundance of love, excitement and opportunity.
After a complicated back surgery in the ‘90s, Steve’s life shifted direction and he left “The Valley”, closed up his company and headed to the shores of Lake Champlain.
In 2002, providence came in the form of a question, would you like to go for a boat ride?, Steve asked Emily, unaware at the time that she would go on to become his wife, caregiver and most importantly his soulmate. They married in June of 2006 and built a loving life together with their dogs and cats in Essex, NY.
Steve was a husband, a father, a Flippy, an uncle and a dear friend to many. He lived an incredibly full and captivating life, leaving nothing on the table. He had a deep passion and desire to push the limits which he did through skiing, hunting, racing cars and on the waters of Lake Champlain. He found his peace and love on his Diamond Island.
Stephen is survived by his wife, Emily (Gardner) Phillips, his sons, Briggs Phillips and his wife Amanda of Charlotte, VT, Harper Phillips of Stowe, VT, Christopher (Botsy) Phillips and his wife Olivia of Boulder, CO, Whitney Phillips and his wife Jesse of Warren, VT, and his daughter Dawn Tebbetts of New Haven, CT and by his grandchildren Crawford, Questwell, Cowen, Waverly and Walker Phillips. He also leaves behind his cousin Candy Davidson, his in-laws, Alan Gardner and his wife Tina and Nancy Belzile and his very special dog Sibley Diamond.
He was predeceased by his parents and brothers Thomas and Richard Phillips.
A funeral service was held at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church in Essex, NY on Friday September 26 at 11:00 am.
In lieu of flowers the family would appreciate donations be made in Steve’s memory to support students attending CV-TEC, particularly in the Construction Trades to Champlain Valley Educational Foundation PO Box 4 Westport, NY 12993.
Steve loved small, generous acts- consider taking in a stray cat, helping a stranger and most importantly, tell the person you love the most everyday just how much you love them. Everyday is a gift.
Arrangements are in the care of the Hamilton Funeral Home, 294 Mannix Road, Peru, 518-643-9055.

Research by the commission found court costs in the state vary depending on the county because of local laws passed by Legislature. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Local laws have created significant disparities in court costs and access to court services in different counties in Alabama, according to findings presented by the Joint Interim Commission on Court Costs on Tuesday.
“There are a lot of local court costs,” said Nathan Hudson, administrator for the Administrative Office of the Courts for Alabama. “There is a good bit of disparity. There are various things that we fund with court costs.”
The findings came after weeks of review  of regulations. Alabama Chief Justice Sarah Stewart, who leads the commission, directed commission members in June to compile a list of fees and fines that are charged by counties. That information would then form the foundation for the analysis to gauge the current state of court costs in Alabama.

The commission first met several months by way of a resolution approved by the Alabama Legislature during the 2025 session. The Joint Interim Commission on Court Costs is tasked with providing a report to lawmakers after they evaluate the current situation to possibly move toward a more uniform system.
Hudson displayed a spreadsheet that laid bare the fees that Autauga County charges to residents to file documents with the court to obtain legal services as an example. For example, Autauga County charges $244 to file for divorce but Madison County charges $324 for the same service, according to their respective websites.
The fees, as well as fines, are allocated to several funding sources. Some pay for court operations. Others are allocated to the state, including the General Fund budget.
A state regulation is meant to reduce the disparity in fees. But lawmakers often bypass that rule by enacting local legislation that allows municipalities within their respective districts to charge court costs for specific items and designate the funding for specific sources.
“This is probably something that has been going on for the last 50 years,” said Stephen Wallace, circuit court judge for the 10th Judicial Circuit, a member of the commission who attempted to identify patterns in the history of local laws affecting court fees.
According to his findings, counties imposed court fees to pay for the construction of jails within their jurisdictions, oftentimes tied to debt service. From there, local laws were passed to fund law libraries in the mid-1980s to 1990s.
Other laws were enacted to provide services for youth and juveniles, then used to fund sheriffs’ departments; diversion programs and domestic violence programs. Since 2010, court costs have been  earmarked for specialized programs, such as mental health courts for example.
“Overall, it is a patchwork system,” Wallace said. “The defining feature is that there is no defining feature. It was built over 50 years, and it has taken a long time to get to that point.”
Members also found similar themes for civil fees, such as filing for a divorce.
“The general takeaway is that the base fee was in the middle, even a little bit on the low side,” said Steven L. Nicholas, an attorney based in Mobile, regarding civil filing fees in Alabama. “The counties or circuits that don’t have big fees are still in the middle. It is the outliers that are starting to press up against the high side.
The commission will consolidate the findings and prepare a report for the Legislature to review by the time the 2026 legislative session begins.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250624_110807-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-01 08:57:05.904740

Spencer Cox speaks during a Turning Point USA event at Utah State University in Logan on Tuesday, Sept. 30, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Back in Utah for the first time since conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was killed three weeks ago, the company he co-founded, Turning Point USA, continued its “American Comeback Tour” at Utah State University on Tuesday. 
Turning Point staff estimated 6,500 people — mostly college-aged, but some older and younger  — came to the event in Logan, about 120 miles north of Utah Valley University where Kirk was shot and killed Sept. 10. 
The aftermath of Kirk’s death was apparent, with tightened security and a heavy police presence across campus as thousands of people filed into the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum arena. While attendees lined up outside, armed police officers could be seen patrolling the area, positioned at various entry points across campus. Bag-sniffing dogs walked up and down lines as students waited to enter. 
Students cheered, repeatedly chanted “USA” and “Charlie,” and danced to hype music while waiting for the event to start. Along with President Donald Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” red caps, many wore white shirts with the word “freedom” across their chests, matching the shirt Kirk wore when he was killed.

Kirk’s memory was center stage throughout the event — meant to honor him, but also keep his conservative activism alive. Repeatedly, speakers called Kirk a “martyr” while calling what happened to him “evil” and urging his supporters to continue to fight for conservative beliefs.  
“I’m not here to eulogize Charlie Kirk. I am here to pass the torch on to every single one of you,” said Alex Clark, the host of a conservative health and wellness podcast associated with Turning Point USA. “Tonight, each of us certainly feels the weight of this loss. But what we don’t do, what we refuse to do, is bow to despair.” 
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox booed, but also applauded 
In Kirk’s absence, Turning Point hosted a panel of Republican politicians including Gov. Spencer Cox, former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz who is now a Fox News commentator, and Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, who plans to run for Arizona governor in 2026. 
Tyler Bowyer, chief operating officer of Turning Point Action, moderated the panel, which he pointed out featured speakers who are all also members of Utah’s dominant faith, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
When Cox was introduced, loud boos boomed through the arena. 
Cox, in the wake of Kirk’s killing, has drawn national attention as he has condemned Kirk’s killing — calling it a “political assassination” while denouncing political violence. He urged Americans to “stop hating” each other, spend less time on social media, and more time connecting with their family and neighbors. 
‘Our nation is broken,’ Utah Gov. Cox says of Charlie Kirk assassination

But divides within the Republican Party — including Kirk and his supporters — concerning Cox date back years. In 2022, Kirk said in a post on X that Cox “should be expelled from the Republican party” after the governor vetoed a bill banning transgender girls from school sports. 
When Cox first began to speak, recalling when he first learned about Kirk’s killing, he was immediately drowned out by boos. Bowyer urged the crowd to help “facilitate a conversation.” When he was able to speak uninterrupted, Cox recounted speaking to Trump after the shooting and pledged to hold Kirk’s shooter accountable, calling his killing “treasonous.” 
“This was more than an attack on Charlie Kirk. This was an attack on free speech. It was an attack on America. It was an attack on American ideals. It was treasonous,” Cox said, adding that the nation has not seen “that kind of political assassination in my lifetime.” 
The crowd, though they at times also applauded Cox, gave a warmer reception to Biggs and Chaffetz, who both repeatedly praised Kirk and Trump.

Utah’s ‘soft’ politics?
During the panel discussion, Bowyer posed a question that seemed to challenge Utah’s tempered style of politics, asking whether the “soft Utah approach” has “enabled people who are mentally ill.” He also pointed to Cox’s “Disagree Better” campaign that has sought to discourage political tribalism, hate and polarization and asked “is that really a both sides issue?”
Cox said “this isn’t just about left or right, it’s about good and evil.” He condemned labeling people “fascists and Nazis,” while also saying “the idea that speech is violence” is “so dangerous” because it can be used to justify actual violence. 
Cox also said “there are violent people on the far right. It happens. And to say that that’s not true would be a lie.” 
On Bowyer’s question about Utah’s “soft approach,” Cox, who is a Latter-day Saint, pointed to the death this week of President Russell M. Nelson, the faith’s leader, saying, “he very passionately believed that anger never persuades.” 
Cox got loud applause for that. 
“That is not ‘soft,’” he continued. “Peacemaking is not soft. It’s the hardest thing you can do.” 
Cox then said that’s what Kirk did. While he debated people who disagreed with him, he also “treated them with respect,” he said. He also acknowledged “there is a rift” within the Republican party.

“There are people in our party who don’t want to do what Charlie (did),” Cox said. “They just want to call each other names and we can’t fall prey to that.” 
Bowyer also asked a pointed question about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, questioning whether it should “take mental illness a little more seriously” and take a stronger stance against “inclusion politics.”
Cox said his faith teaches him “we all have agency, and everybody’s responsible for their own decisions.” He said Kirk’s shooter is responsible, “not the church, not Utah, not someone else. That person is responsible.” He also agreed the entire country needs to take “mental illness more seriously.” 
“Charlie had the answer to that,” he said. “Get off your couch. Get off social media. Get married. Have kids. Do something with your life.” 
Biggs, in his answer to Bowyer’s question, said, “You have to be honest, and you call balls and strikes the way they are. … If you don’t call balls and strikes, if you aren’t honest, if you aren’t speaking with clarity, purpose and principle, you are deceiving you, yourself (and) the person you’re having a conversation with.”

When Bowyer asked whether “inclusionary politics has gone too far,” and has led some to give up on their “moral compass,” Chaffetz said from his experience “those that preach the most tolerance are the least tolerant among us.” He also added that he worries about “too much tolerance” and there needs to be a “balance.”
Chaffetz then got what was one of the loudest moments of applause when he said: “You do not need a man with junk in a woman’s bathroom.” 
Toward the end of the event, dozens of students lined up to ask questions. One questioned Cox about the veto of the bill banning transgender girls from school sports. Cox explained that he worried the ban would only get overturned in the courts, so after he vetoed it he and the Legislature “worked together” to put in place a commission to decide transgender athlete eligibility rather than an all-out ban. 
“I think Charlie and I would agree on 99% of things,” Cox said, adding that he wished there would have been an opportunity for him and Kirk to have “had that debate together.” Even though Cox said he thinks Kirk would have still disagreed with him, “what matters” is continuing to talk to people you may disagree with. 
“We’ve got to make space for that,” Cox said. “And we’re doing that tonight.”

This week Toni Atkins, former president pro tem of the state Senate, joined those who've ended their campaigns.","Over the last half-century or so, California has had six elections for governor when the office was being vacated.
Understandably, such incumbent-free elections to run the nation’s most populous and economically powerful state have drawn serious candidates, mostly holders of other high-profile offices who declared themselves as soon as decorum would allow.
When, for example, Republican Ronald Reagan’s two terms as governor were ending in 1974, the Democratic secretary of state, Jerry Brown, narrowly defeated the Republican state controller, Houston Flournoy.
This bit of political history is offered because the end of Gavin Newsom’s governorship is approaching rapidly. In scarcely a year, California voters will choose a new governor. The June 2  primary, which will determine the two finalists, is just eight months away. 
Yet the field of would-be governors remains very unsettled.
For months voters, political media and potential campaign financiers waited for former Vice President Kamala Harris to decide whether, after losing the presidency to Donald Trump, she would seek the governorship.
Harris finally said no, with a rather odd remark: “I don’t want to go back in the system. I think it’s broken.” She may have been referring to national politics, but since the issue was California’s governorship, she could also have been implying the state was broken after many years of dominance by her Democratic Party.
Harris’ decision, whatever her motives, did not settle the question about who will be running for governor next year. There are declared candidates, of course, but none scores very high in preliminary polling.
Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis had been one of the first to declare her candidacy but shortly after Harris announced her decision, Kounalakis dropped out, opting instead to run for state treasurer.
With those two out of the picture, former Congresswoman Katie Porter became the frontrunner, more or less by default, but with underwhelming support — 17% in a poll by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies, released in late August. Her standing may have reflected nothing more than name recognition from her losing campaign for U.S. senator last year.
This week Toni Atkins, former president pro tem of the state Senate, also ended her campaign, saying she could see no pathway to victory. A few other Democrats remain, most notably former Biden administration official and state Attorney General Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.
Mostly, however, we are seeing just preliminary skirmishing among those still in the race, because we’re still waiting to see who else might run.
After the departure of Harris and Kounalakis, another name popped up in media speculation:  U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla.
It’s difficult to understand why Padilla, who holds one of the nation’s most coveted political offices and could remain in the Senate for the rest of his life, would want to seek no more than eight years as governor.
Does he really want to deal with California’s plethora of infinitely difficult, unresolved issues, such as homelessness, housing shortages, water supply uncertainty, economic stagnation and, perhaps trickiest of all, a chronic multibillion-dollar budget deficit?
Were Padilla to give up his Senate seat for the governorship, as Republican Pete Wilson did in 1990, the only logical motive would be civic duty — he thinks California needs him to weather its crises.
Meanwhile, we’re waiting for another potential candidate, Rick Caruso, to also declare intentions. The very wealthy Los Angeles businessman ran a credible but unsuccessful race for mayor of his city after switching his party identification from Republican to Democrat and could draw support from moderate voters and interest groups of both parties. He says he’s weighing a race.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/011923-Toni-Atkins-Governor-Campaign-CM-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-01 08:57:05.904740

(Photo courtesy of Lizzy Tomber).David Tomber-Young, 9, of St. Louis, has always been musical and expressive. 
According to his mom, Lizzy Tomber, he can sing the theme song to his current favorite movie, “K-Pop Demon Hunters,” from memory, including the parts in Korean. And when he watches movies, he has a knack for imitating the actors’ facial expressions.
But David, who along with his three younger brothers has been diagnosed with autism, struggles with some aspects of verbal communication, like answering open-ended questions and talking about the past.
Tomber said David has had “really huge progress” since he began taking a medication prescribed by his doctor in May: leucovorin.
“Before, you would really have to be like, number one or number two, and kind of give him a couple of choices,” Tomber said. “Right now, he’s talking more at school and, I think, talking about what he did last weekend or what he wants to do tomorrow.”
Leucovorin was at the center of statements by President Donald Trump and top federal health officials on Sept. 22 about the causes and treatment of autism spectrum disorder. Officials endorsed the use of leucovorin, which is used to treat side effects of chemotherapy, as an autism therapy. They also asserted a link between autism and pregnant mothers’ use of acetaminophen – the active ingredient in the pain and fever reducer Tylenol.
Specialists across Missouri urged caution around the claims from the White House last week, advising parents to consult their doctors and underlining the complexity of factors that influence autism.
Doctors said that scientific research on Tylenol and autism is inconclusive, while noting the importance of treating maternal fevers and pain.
“Your specific healthcare needs are best addressed with your physician,” said Dr. Benjamin Black, medical director at the Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment at the University of Missouri. “You want to appropriately treat illnesses and fevers during pregnancy, and whatever that needs to look like in your pregnancy is a discussion to have with your care provider.”
Leucovorin is a form of vitamin B9 that limited studies have suggested can boost verbal communication in individuals with autism. The “hypothesis,” said Dr. Gregory Cejas, co-director of the Washington University Autism Clinical Center, is that some people with autism have an autoimmune reaction that prevents the uptake of folate in the brain – and that leucovorin can help.
“I think what we don’t know,” Cejas said, “is that a true hypothesis? So we have to test that more. We have to, I think, do bigger studies on those things.”
Tomber said that while she thinks leucovorin, along with speech therapy and his teachers’ support, has helped David, it isn’t a “miracle drug.” Two of Tomber’s younger sons, who are mostly nonverbal, tried leucovorin and stopped due to possible side effects.
“They’re obviously frustrated that they can’t communicate, that they can’t get their point across,” Tomber said. “If I can give them a tool to do that better, of course I’m going to do it.”
 ‘We don’t want to put blame on our families’

Jenny Shank, of St. Louis, said Trump’s assertions pulled her back to her self-doubt in the early days of her now 17-year-old daughter’s diagnosis with autism.
Trump urged pregnant women to endure pain and “fight like hell not to take” Tylenol, except in cases of high fever.
“As a woman, I think you go back so many times,” Shank said. “Even though you’re so grateful for your child and you wouldn’t change them, you still go back and you think, ‘Was it this? Was it that?’”
Cejas said that as researchers work to learn more about autism, it’s important not to “put blame on our families.”
“I think a lot of parents ask me, ‘Is it something that I did?’” Cejas said. “And my usual answer is no, there’s nothing that you did specifically. There is no way to predict anything that you did in your pregnancy or otherwise that led to this point.”
Michelle Trupiano, executive director of Beacon Reproductive Health Network, formerly the Missouri Family Health Council, said misinformation, including around Tylenol, sows uncertainty and distrust.
“It just causes confusion for folks that is going to trickle down into continued confusion for patients over who they can trust, who they can go to for accurate information,” Trupiano said.”
Zachary Moser, administrator at the Dent County Health Center in rural southwest Missouri, said his office doesn’t plan to make any changes following the president’s remarks on Tylenol.
Moser, who is also a pharmacist, said a letter published Monday by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs offered a “reasonable” and “substantially different” message from Trump.
“It just uses the common sense principles that we use in medicine all the time,” Moser said. “Use the lowest dose for the shortest amount of time as possible. That applies to everything we do.”
The letter ended by describing acetaminophen as “the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy” to aspirin or ibuprofen, which “have well-documented adverse impacts on the fetus.”
As of Friday, Moser saw some chatter about Tylenol online but had not yet been approached by many in his community for guidance on taking the medication. 
 ‘No single medical treatment’

Black, the medical director from the Thompson Center, said that because autism can’t be traced to any single cause or pathway in the brain, “no single medical treatment will be the answer for all patients and families.”
Though leucovorin appears to present minimal risk, Black said, there are no safety studies specific to patients with autism, and tests for the type of folate deficiency the drug may treat can be expensive or rely on scant data.
For now, Black said he is taking “a relatively cautious approach” to leucovorin.
Shank said that she will likely ask her daughter’s doctor about leucovorin. She wishes she could take away some of her daughter’s struggles, but she isn’t looking for a cure. 
“I don’t think that autism is something that needs to be cured,” she said.
Looking back on her family’s journey, Shank said she wants parents of children with autism to feel empowered to reach out to other families, because “most other families, they get it, they understand.”
“Go out of your comfort zone to fight for your child and advocate for them and create opportunities for them,” Shank said, “and give them the tools they need to succeed.”

“That means there were like [16] kids graduating high school,” DYS Schools Superintendent Tracy Smitherman said Friday. “So we’re just bouncing off of the rooftops down there, around here, about what all our kids are doing.”
In addition to students getting more high school diplomas, Smitherman also reported that 57 students enrolled in the Training and Advancement Center passed all three parts of the General Educational Development (GED), bringing the DYS passing rate to 65%.
“These students are diligently working toward their GEDs, post-secondary courses, and acquiring career readiness skills in over 20 areas, including [National Center for Construction Education and Research] and Microsoft certifications,” Smitherman said in a statement on Aug. 6.
In a phone interview on Tuesday, Smitherman said the increase in graduates is due to DYS School System guidance counselors checking transcripts for students.
“Our counselors are almost like private investigators trying to piece [student records] together so that the children don’t take the same class multiple times and make sure that they’re actually taking the classes that they need to take with us instead of something that they don’t need,” she said. “We have really put a lot of effort and a lot of meetings in with counties and with the specialized treatment centers and with the State Department of [Education] trying to get every one of the players to utilize the PowerSchool [software] as it’s set up to be used so that we can actually look at a child holistically and piece all the pieces together and make sure he meets the standards for graduation.”
PowerSchool is a software used by school systems to track grades, attendance and other data.

That’s more than $80 billion in assets managed by volunteer boards guided by professional managers and lawyers — usually with little outside oversight. My own HOA has over 8,000 units — a small city by Nevada standards. If you think your HOA is just a harmless neighborhood committee, my story should make you think again.
I’ve spent over half a million dollars in legal fees, plus untold insurance defense costs, defending rights most of us assume are guaranteed: to speak, to run for a board seat, and to hold an HOA to the law. I’m not wealthy and many would call this foolish. 
This is not just my story, or only about HOAs. The misuse of attorney-fee provisions as weapons reaches across our civil justice system, where those with deep pockets can intimidate, silence, or bankrupt opponents simply by driving up costs. HOAs are just one arena.  Unless this abuse is reined in, no one is safe.
When speaking out gets you sued
As a retired Air Force officer and healthcare executive, I never expected to be sued by my own HOA — twice — simply for running for its board.
The first time, the developer still in control of my community filed a defamation lawsuit. My offense? Questioning his decades-long grip on power. I fought back and won. In doing so, I set a precedent: the Nevada Supreme Court confirmed that HOA governance is a matter of public concern and that owners are entitled to anti-SLAPP protections.
The court fined the developer $10,000, pocket change to him. For me, “victory” cost hundreds of thousands in legal fees and left a target on my back.
On my second run, homeowners elected me. But eighteen months later, developer-appointed directors ousted me — no recall, no due process — with the association’s lawyer’s blessing. The state regulator, the Nevada Real Estate Division (NRED), knew and did nothing. I challenged the removal; years later, the case still drags on.
A system built to intimidate
The tools used against me are available against any homeowner. It’s like getting a speeding ticket from the police — then being sued by a random driver as if they were your prosecutor. No one imagines civic life works this way — except in HOAs, where private lawsuits and “prevailing party” attorney-fee clauses turn disputes into financial weapons.
A second ruling by the Nevada Supreme Court in my case weakened protections further. Today, it’s even easier for developers, boards, and their attorneys to silence dissent and bankrupt opposition.
NRED has the authority to enforce the law, but avoids tough calls, ignores complaints, operates in secrecy, and refuses to bring issues before its oversight body, the Governor-appointed Commission for Common-Interest Communities. The Commission sees the problem and does nothing.
One example says it all. My association and its developer demanded $120,000 in attorney fees for a single appellate answer. That’s more than twice the median annual salary of a Nevada worker.
My own attorney cost about $40,000 — expensive, yes, but what choice did I have? He handled both my appeal and the association’s counter-arguments. These fee claims aren’t about fairness; they’re designed to intimidate and deter. And it works.
More than one battle
My legal fight has spawned multiple cases, all tied to one unresolved question: after 25 years, should this community be run by its owners or by the developer?
Opposing counsel insists defending developer control is the same as defending the HOA itself. That’s wrong. Developers and homeowners do not share the same interests, and boards stacked with appointees almost always protect the former.
And even in fully owner-controlled HOAs, the risk remains. A determined board with aggressive lawyers can isolate and crush dissenters using the same tactics. Nevada’s HOA laws — weak enforcement, lack of transparency, punitive fee provisions — make abuse possible anywhere.
Many homeowners keep their heads down. I once saw that as apathy. Now I see it as survival.
I love my community. I love Las Vegas. I love Nevada. But outside of HOAs, there are few housing choices and lawmakers know it. The real question is whether we accept this as the price of living here, or whether we demand better.

(Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images)More than three decades ago, water managers in Southern Nevada launched a plan to pipe groundwater from hundreds of miles away to augment Lake Mead’s water supply. The plan fell through and the region moved on, implementing major water conservation efforts instead.
A coalition of conservation groups say Nevada’s history can offer hope as water managers across western states negotiate new rules for sharing the Colorado River’s dwindling water supply.
The Great Basin Water Network, Living Rivers-Colorado Riverkeeper, Utah Rivers Council, and the Glen Canyon Institute released a report Wednesday with several recommendations they say would prevent the continued over-consumption of the river’s water.
States reliant on the river are approaching a 2026 deadline to reach a consensus on how to manage the river, and they have until mid-November to reach a preliminary agreement or risk federal intervention.
With only weeks until the earlier deadline, Colorado River basin states remain at odds over how to manage the river that serves 40 million people across the West. Those disagreements largely center on which half of the basin should decrease its water use, and by how much.
States are split into two camps, the Upper Basin – Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico – and the Lower Basin – California, Arizona and Nevada.
But states, experts and policymakers do agree on one thing: the river is overallocated. 
Chronic overuse, drought and rising temperatures linked to climate change have shrunk water flows. The river has lost nearly 20% of its natural flows in the past quarter century. Hydrologists say it could lose another 20% in the coming decades.
The report by the coalition of conservation groups highlights nine recommendations on how to permanently reduce water use on the Colorado River as supplies shrink. 
Those recommendations include preventing new dams and diversions, sharing water cuts among states, improving hydrology data, increasing water recycling, stabilizing groundwater decline, preserving endangered species, and improving agricultural irrigation. 
Kyle Roerink, the executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, said the recommendations are meant to confront difficult “hydrologic realities and the legal realities” as Colorado River negotiations stall and federal deadlines near.
“Things are so tense right now, nobody wants to upset the other side. They are divided. So nobody wants to say anything meaningful in public,” Roerink said. 
“Here we are really getting down to the wire,” he continued. 
Tense negotiations have also created a lack of public transparency as states develop the new management guidelines, said Roerink. When the current Colorado River guidelines were developed in 2007, public participation was significantly more robust, said Roerink.
“Now we’re just getting nothing,” he added. 
A major factor that needs to be considered during negotiations is the planned development of new dams and diversions that could lead to future legal conflicts, says the report. The Great Basin Water Network tallied more than 30 project proposals in the Upper Basin that could pull more than a million acre feet from the Colorado River if constructed. 
Rather than developing infrastructure to pull more water from the river, the report recommends Upper Basin states create water curtailment plans to establish a “clear-cut understanding of what entities have to cut during a shortage.” Lower Basin states are already subject to curtailments under the current operation guidelines. 
Some existing dams, like Glen Canyon Dam, will need to be modified to adapt to lower stream flows, says the report. 
Water in Lake Powell needs to pass through Glen Canyon Dam to reach Lower Basin states, but when the lake dips below a certain elevation significantly less water can pass downstream due to the dam’s engineering. In 2023, water levels in the lake came within 30 feet of that benchmark elevation.
The coalition asks the Bureau of Reclamation to include modifications to Glen Canyon Dam as part of the ongoing negotiations.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2223867672-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 07:57:34.193530

McDonald,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/10/01/as-lieutenant-governor-hopefuls-debate-nj-republicans-say-trumps-future-is-at-stake/,Republicans gathered at a Nutley VFW Hall on Tuesday to watch our lieutenant governor candidates debate for the first and only time.,"Lieutenant governor candidates Dale Caldwell, left, and Jim Gannon meet on the debate state on Sept. 30, 2025. (Photo courtesy of PIX 11)NUTLEY — Where else to watch the one-and-only debate between our leading lieutenant governor candidates than in one of New Jersey’s swingiest towns?
Nutley voters backed Republican Gov. Chris Christie’s reelection bid in 2013, then flipped to Democrat Phil Murphy four years later, then switched to Republican Jack Ciattarelli in 2021. Their presidential choices are equally swingy: Barack Obama in 2012, then Donald Trump four years later, Joe Biden in 2020, and Trump again last year.
This is a town that cannot make up its mind. Not that I thought I was going to run into many fence sitters at Tuesday’s debate watch party hosted by American First Republicans at VFW Post 493. This was such a pro-Trump crowd, one woman wore a t-shirt that read “even my dogs love Trump.”
And while we were all there ostensibly to watch Democrat Dale Caldwell and Republican Jim Gannon — running mates of gubernatorial hopefuls Mikie Sherrill (D) and Ciattarelli — debate issues like property taxes, transit, and immigration, the stakes of November’s gubernatorial race are so high for some of those at the Nutley VFW that no less than Trump’s political future is on the line if Democrats win New Jersey’s governorship in November.

“Donald Trump is on the ballot this year,” said Michael Byrne, the Montclair GOP chair. “If they win this race, they’ll go into the midterms with momentum and they’ll impeach him for a third time. We can’t have that. This election is about Trump as much as it’s about Jack and the future of our state.”
Trump was a major theme in Tuesday’s debate, too, at least for most of the time Caldwell spoke. Caldwell, like running mate Sherrill, name-drops the current occupant of the White House like Trump is his actual opponent. Whether the question was about lowering property taxes or discouraging political violence or continuing the Anchor tax rebate program, Caldwell’s responses were more about Trump than his and Sherrill’s plans to govern.
Even when asked about whether he would support continuing NJ Transit’s plan for annual fare hikes, Caldwell said, “We have to look at them, see where the money’s coming from, with the assault from the Trump administration.”
It didn’t get much better when Caldwell avoided Trump, like when he was asked about state school policy on transgender students. The Murphy administration has been sharply criticized by Republicans for a policy that requires school officials to accept a child’s asserted gender identity even absent parental consent. Ciattarelli has vowed to reverse that policy.
Democrats, especially in the wake of embarrassing national losses in 2024 that came after aggressive Republican campaign ads targeting transgender people, have struggled to communicate on this issue. Caldwell’s rambling answer to this yes or no question veered from saying his dad was supportive of the LGBT community to calling the relationship between parents and their children sacrosanct to saying not every school district is the same.
“We need to begin to look at the unique needs and the unique safety issues around every child. Mikie has said, and I have said, that safety is No. 1. We will do whatever it takes to make sure that the safety of the children in the school district, the safety of the children in the community, is our priority,” he said.
Yeesh. Moderator Dan Mannarino pressed him, “So you would keep the guidance?”
“We would, we would review the guidance, but, uh, you know, at this stage it makes some sense,” said Caldwell, a pastor and president of Centenary University in Hackettstown.
Here’s how our next governor says they’ll make NJ more affordable

Then there was the GOP side of the debate stage. Gannon, the Morris County sheriff, stepped in it big time when asked if a millionaire’s tax would be on the table for the Ciattarelli administration to fund services like food stamps that are facing cuts on the federal level.
“Taxes are on the table, but I’d be careful of millionaire’s taxes. They’re employing us,” Gannon said.
“So new taxes are on the table in New Jersey in your administration?” moderator Henry Rosoff asked with what I detected was a hint of incredulity.
“Well, you have to look at it. You have to look at the whole thing, but what I’m saying is, millionaires, we can’t just beat up the millionaires. The millionaires many times are employers. They’re employing us,” Gannon said.
Talk about a gift for the Sherrill campaign, which has argued repeatedly that Ciattarelli would raise taxes if elected governor (he says he would not). Within moments, a clip of Gannon saying taxes are on the table if he becomes lieutenant governor was widely shared by Sherrill’s campaign and her allies.
I heard no response among the crowd at the Nutley VFW when Gannon said this. There was a much larger audible reaction to Caldwell using his closing statement to praise Republican radio talk show host Bill Spadea, a Ciattarelli foe, with one woman saying, “That was a slimy move.” Afterward, the event’s organizers said they saw nothing in the debate that dampened their enthusiasm.
“Jack is more popular than he ever has been, with President Trump,” GOP operative Mike Crispi told me. “Mikie Sherrill, when she harps on these national issues in a race that I think is very localized, because it’s an off-year election, where the focus is Garden State issues, people roll their eyes.”
We’ll see if he’s right very soon. Election Day is in 34 days.

We have to work harder than ever to identify and implement common sense reforms that make it faster and more cost-effective to build renewables here in Vermont and across New England.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jonathan Dowds: Northeast states must resist President Donald Trump’s expensive swerve back to fossil fuels.","This commentary is by Jonathan Dowds, of Burlington. Dowds is the deputy director at Renewable Energy Vermont, the trade association representing Vermont’s renewable sector.
The Trump administration is forcing Americans to increase our dependence on the fossil fuel industry at the direct expense of our economy and our environment. 
President Donald Trump and the Republican majority in Congress have done everything in their power to kneecap the deployment of wind and solar, even though renewables are our country’s cleanest and cheapest sources of power and are the ones that we can build most quickly to meet rising electricity demand. 
Fortunately, the Trump agenda is not the last word. When he pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Accords during his first term, the Vermont Legislature voted to enact these important greenhouse gas reduction goals. Once again, Vermont and our New England neighbors need to craft our own response to resist Trump’s efforts to tie us ever more tightly to dirty and expensive fossil fuels.
The evidence that Trump’s energy policies amount to economic malpractice purely to benefit the fossil fuel industry is widespread. The U.S. Department of Energy has unilaterally mandated that a coal power plant in Michigan and an oil plant in Pennsylvania remain in operation beyond their planned retirements, despite the determination by state regulators, electric utilities and regional grid operators that closing the plants would not increase the risk of power shortages. 
Forcing these plants to remain operational has already cost tens of millions of dollars. Analysts at the company Grid Strategies estimate that expanding this practice to other uneconomical plants on the cusp of retirement could cost ratepayers between $3 and $6 billion per year. 
These poorly justified interventions in the normal operation of our grid amount to a forced subsidy for an industry that no longer makes economic sense. 
In New England, state governments and environmentalists agree that offshore wind is a foundation of our clean energy future. The Trump administration recently forced one project that was nearly completed, Revolution Wind, to stop work with minimal justification. ISO New England, the entity that runs our grid, declared unpredictable and unjustified stop-work orders for fully permitted projects, like Revolution Wind, would increase costs for consumers and threaten the reliability of the grid. 
Of course, bad news for wind is good news for fossil fuels, as halting Revolution Wind will lead directly to heavier utilization of existing oil and gas plants. New England ratepayers will pay a monetary cost for this, and the people who live near New England’s fossil fuel plants — disproportionately minority and low-income households — will suffer the risks of increased exposure to harmful pollutants. Slowing down offshore wind to increase gas generation is not a trade that is in our best interests.
Trump’s recently passed budget bill is loaded with more of the same handouts to the fossil fuel industry. 
It reduced the royalty rates paid on oil and gas leases, increased the tax credit for carbon sequestration for “enhanced oil recovery,” and created a new tax credit for metallurgical coal, all while abruptly gutting tax credits for the development and manufacturing of wind, solar, batteries and electric vehicles. 
The nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation has estimated that the Trump budget bill’s attacks on renewables will lead to a 9% to 18% jump in electricity rates by 2035. These are not policies designed to alleviate an energy shortfall. They are policies that ensure our continued reliance on fossil fuels. 
By eliminating the Solar for All program and tax credits for home solar, the budget bill also represents a major step back for Vermonters looking to control their energy bills. Solar for All had committed to deliver more than $60 million in federal grants to Vermont, designated to help low-income families and the affordable housing community access the benefits of solar. 
The tax credit for home solar, which had been scheduled to run into the 2030s, has helped thousands of Vermont families go solar. Its loss will be a blow, and the state will need to act to ensure that building rooftop solar remains a viable option for Vermonters.  
For all of the damage that Trump’s opposition to affordable renewable energy is doing, there is a path forward. Vermont took one of the most important steps last year, when the state updated its Renewable Energy Standard to mandate that all Vermont utilities get to 100% renewable power by 2035. 
These state standards act as a backstop against Trump’s interference, ensuring that our power comes increasingly from renewables rather than more natural gas plants, regardless of what is happening at the federal level. Simultaneously, we have to work harder than ever to identify and implement common sense reforms that make it faster and more cost-effective to build renewables here in Vermont and across New England. 
Trump is working to drag the country back into the past. Together, we can push for a renewable future.

Each bag is intended to last up to 125 uses. (Photo by Emily Fitzgerald/Washington State Standard.) Washington shoppers will pay 4 cents more per plastic grocery bag starting in January. But the bags themselves won’t get any thicker for at least another two years as lawmakers fine-tune the state’s single-use plastic bag restrictions. 
The price increase is a part of a law passed in 2020 banning some thinner, single-use plastic bags statewide and creating regulations for retailers offering carryout bags to customers. 
Approximately 80,000 Washington businesses are affected by the law, according to the state Department of Commerce. 
Under the law, paper and plastic bags have to be made with 40% recycled content, and plastic bags must be 2.25 millimeters thick and marked as “reusable.” The standard thickness for plastic grocery bags was previously 0.5 millimeters. 
Customers are required, under the law, to pay a fee for a paper or plastic bag. The revenue from bag fees stays with the retailer to help cover the costs of meeting the state requirements. The law also allows for single-use compostable bags, which don’t have a per-bag fee. 
The law set the initial fee for both paper and plastic at 8 cents per bag, but pre-scheduled a price increase for plastic bags to go into effect Jan. 1, 2026. Once in effect, plastic bags will cost 12 cents per bag, while the fee for paper bags will stay at 8 cents. 
The 2020 law also scheduled an increase in the required bag thickness, from 2.5 millimeters to 4 millimeters, to take effect in January 2026. But legislation passed this year delayed that increase for two years. 
The delay gives the Legislature time to revisit the state’s reusable bag policies and make further adjustments, lawmakers said. 
To deter retailers from making the switch to thicker bags early, retailers who sell bags thicker than 2.5 millimeters between 2026 and 2028 will be penalized 4 cents a bag on top of the standard 12-cent fee beginning in January. 
The penalty was part of the amendment to the bag law that lawmakers passed this year. 
Under the law, the penalty will be passed to the customer, increasing the total per-bag price to 16 cents. Revenue from the penalty will be deposited into the state’s waste reduction, recycling and litter control account. 
The 4 millimeter-thick bags are not widely used and retailers will “do everything they can” to avoid the penalty, Brandon Houskeeper of the Northwest Grocery Retail Association said during a House Environment and Energy Committee work session on Monday. 
Houskeeper and Department of Ecology Solid Waste Program Manager Peter Lyon each confirmed Monday that, while Ecology has received over 800 complaints of bag ban violations since the law went into effect in 2022, no businesses have been fined for non-compliance. 
Ecology staff and retailers have been successfully working together to address violations as they occur, Houskeeper and Lyon said. 
Even though the bag fees have helped offset some of the costs, businesses are paying substantially more for the bags than they make back from the fees. 
Depending on the manufacturer, plastic bags cost between 10 and 39 cents per bag to make and paper grocery bags can cost between 15 and 30 cents per bag. 
The bag fees also don’t account for bags given to customers on food assistance programs who, under the law, are exempt from paying the bag fees, or bags that are stolen from self-checkouts. 
A Washington State University study released this week found that, since the 2020 law went into effect, Washington saw a 50% decrease in the amount of plastic bags distributed, but a 17% increase in the total amount of plastic used.  
In other words, shoppers were using fewer bags with the fee in effect, but the requirement for thicker bags was requiring more material, the study said.
Paper bags saw a 22% decrease, the researchers found. 
The study also said that customers were not reusing plastic grocery bags enough to compensate for the higher plastic volume and the higher cost of producing them. 
“The fact of the matter is, individuals aren’t reusing them seven to 12 times,” Department of Commerce representative Kirk Esmond said during Monday’s work session.
The study authors acknowledged that they struggled to obtain comprehensive data due to the pandemic and a lack of cooperation from some distributors. 
However, they recommended that the Legislature remove the 4 millimeter bag thickness requirement entirely, and consider lifting the single-use plastic bag ban and allow retailers to again offer 0.5 millimeter-thick single-use plastic bags. 
Commerce and Ecology representatives agreed with the recommendation on the 4 millimeter-thick bags, but disputed the proposal to lift the single-use bag ban. 
“It certainly contradicts the law’s goal and the environmental factors that are associated with that,” Esmond said, calling the issue “very complex.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_9697_720.jpg,,,2025-10-01 07:57:34.193530

(Getty Images)Google recently pulled out of its proposed Indiana data center, which was to be built in Franklin Township. Proponents and opponents of the project disagreed, among other things, about just how many jobs the new center might offer.
While we argue over just how many careers may be ultimately available for a single site, we are missing a key challenge of the existence of such centers to begin with: while creating some jobs, the ability for machines to conduct complex skills like analyzing big data threatens to take away even more occupations. As professors, the lack of broader conversation among politicians, educators, and technologists concern us. In a world where artificial intelligence threatens to take away many of the professions we are training students to enter, what is college for?
In a future world where the paid work of the knowledge economy may become scarce, will a college education still function to build critical thinking skills, professionalize, and equip students with a set of skills to begin their careers? Or, could college be so much more for people — perhaps a place that is for learning how to live, not just how to become a driver of the economy?
Generative AI has changed many things in our society. AI is able to combine multiple sources of information together to do tasks far beyond just a search. At the moment, AI is dependent on available internet information (or misinformation) but the capabilities will only increase from here. It is prudent to plan for a disrupted working world.
As faculty members who are two of the Co-Directors of our University’s Teaching and Learning Center and who love to teach courses in Religion and Sociology, we are used to students not understanding why they find themselves in our classrooms—and who might not fully understand why for another 10 or 20 years. After all, our domains don’t necessarily translate into easily commodifiable skills or knowledge. But, later in life when people reflect on the deeper questions about meaning and the purposes of life, or how society is constructed around general assumptions about how people work and live together, or draw upon a particular skill set that they have not dusted off for some time, our domains are a powerful toolbox for asking deeper questions.
Trump’s AI Action Plan removes ‘red tape’ for AI developers and data centers, punishes states that act alone

A future world, a one that is not too far away where work is limited or fully automated, could be a dystopian nightmare or a utopian dream. In a nearly workless world, what shall we do with our time? Will our daily lives be spent working on our individual passions, or will society become unglued because we now have more time than we know what to do with? That is the choice that stands before us currently and which offers opportunities for enormous, productive, and hopefully positive change.
A college education would have to shift away from the current reductionist view of skills and monetary benefit to a model where human freedom is taught as a thing of radical responsibility: to create one’s own projects of meaning and value within a complex matrix of others doing exactly the same thing. Such projects may include things like we have now with production, but what we’re suggesting is that these are done for their own ends, not simply financial gain. Humans with this much freedom over their own time would have to learn what they value – and why – which is precisely what a college education should be doing anyway.
The college education of the future could then invent all sorts of new pathways to cultivating a life away from a world of work. We could study sociology and religion because they express human values. People could study biology because it expresses the enormous beauty of life on this planet. People could study business because it provides a rich tapestry of value propositions and calculations. Most importantly, people could study anything they want simply because they’re interested, not because they’re fearful of being able to make a living in a highly competitive, ever shifting, consumerist economy.
There will certainly be those who are stuck in the old model of education. In the current economy, college graduates make more money over a lifetime. College graduates earn about $40,000 more per year than someone with a high school diploma. While that is, of course, something to be celebrated, it is not the only benefit of matriculation. College graduates also remain married longer than those without a college degree, are far less likely to get dementia later in life, are more engaged in civic issues and service, are more likely to participate in religious services, and a myriad of other benefits. However, this is in the current economy, not the one on the immediate horizon, one in which such statistics may simply fall apart. The growth of AI to automate traditionally white collar tasks, and soon the blue collar tasks, will likely seriously disrupt employment trends.
The time to rethink the purpose of a college education is right now. In a world where work is deprioritized, what would be the point of the economic incentives of a college education? Disentangling income from education can provide the next great catalyst for higher education and for society. While it is important for faculty to prepare students for their future careers, in a world where we cannot even guess what those will be, we also must learn to help them think critically, with a mind to global awareness and cultural humility.
If we do so, we will know we’re not just preparing them for jobs, but for vocations, especially in an unknown economy where data centers power artificial employees. After all, the college students of today who build skills and maintain intellectual flexibility will soon become the generation that shapes the future for all of us.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Flying with the Indiana State Police isn’t as simple as being a trooper and having a pilot’s license. Sgt. David Ploog came out of the academy with five years of flying experience under his belt with the U.S. Army, but still worked on the ground for roughly a decade. When a former ISP pilot left to join the National Guard full time, Ploog — who still flies with the Army and has been with the Indiana National Guard for 24 years — was tapped to join.
“I always knew I would fly for the department, just didn’t know I’d be doing it this soon,” Ploog told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. He’s now been flying with ISP for roughly three years.

Staffing has ebbed and flowed over the decades. At one point, the aviation wing had a dozen aircraft, with mechanics and over 20 pilots spread out across the state. Today, all five of the state’s aircraft are located within a state trooper outpost in Greenwood.
The central location, nestled by a field of corn right off the interstate, means that most ISP aircraft can reach every part of the state within an hour. 
Today, there are six full-time pilots — most of whom are troopers with the exception of one retired trooper who now flies as a civilian — alongside a handful of Tactical Flight Officers, or TFOs. Of the latter, just one is full time while the others are part time, shifting from other trooper duties as needed. 
One trooper and one TFO are always on call, though not every flight requires a TFO. 
Ploog said that TFOs are necessary when operating the aircraft’s specialized camera systems, including the so-called Churchill navigation system that can pinpoint an address and keep a camera locked onto that location regardless of movement.
“They’re responsible for that camera system, radio communications with the ground and just performing general police duties,” said Ploog. “That way the pilot can focus on flying, obstacle avoidance and safe aircraft operation.” 
With fewer and fewer law enforcement agencies retaining their aircraft, ISP pitches itself as a free resource available to local departments. Just one other county — northern Indiana’s Lake County — has aircraft.
“Other than that, it falls on us. It’s our responsibility to support 91 other counties,” Ploog said. “The county units, the city units, the town units — if they need aircraft, they come to us.”
 Flying missions

In a presentation geared toward sharing the aviation unit’s resources with other law enforcement agencies, Ploog spoke about the department’s overall mission to support units on the ground — no matter their law enforcement agency. 
Specific missions fall into general categories, including: 

Search and rescue
Law enforcement patrol/support
Surveillance/situational awareness
Pre-raid surveillance for warrants
Aerial photography/videography
Casualty evacuation 
Marijuana eradication
General transportation
Disaster assessment 

“Bottom line: we support units on the ground,” said Ploog. “We don’t have our own … flying club where our goal is to get 100 hours this month.”
From the air, aviators can tell on-the-ground officers about details invisible from their perspective  — whether it’s a leaking tank after a semi accident or a suspect reaching into their pocket during a tense standoff. At large events like the Indiana State Fair or the Indy 500, a bird’s eye view can spot potential dangers to the public and monitor without interference.
The presence of ISP helicopters, in particular, have gained a reputation in Indianapolis’ street racing community, Ploog said. Aircraft now have to keep their distance until ground units are in place.

“As soon as they know a helicopter’s in the area, they disperse and they take off. It’s a show stopper,” Ploog said.
Some aircraft even operate lasers to guide officers with night vision goggles to specific locations. And though the cameras can capture eerily good details — Ploog said heat sensors can sometimes pick up expressions, since lips are typically cooler than other parts of the face — there are still limitations.
Hot weather disrupts heat sensors, which can be used to track fleeing suspects across miles or identify lost persons, while buildings and thick foliage can obscure camera angles. Humans still make mistakes, sometimes identifying a sleeping coyote as a potential body.
Ploog estimated that roughly 80% of the aviation wing’s time is devoted to crime fighting, while the remaining 20% is spent on finding someone who is lost — whether it’s a hiker, an elderly person with dementia or a child far from home.
Aircraft software can even hone in on specific locations sent from trackers like Project Lifesaver, which was recently used to identify a lost child with autism. The heat sensors can find a man with dementia who laid between rows of corn just a few rows deep — far enough that it could have taken hours to find him without the technology.
Some states even cross-train their aviators to be paramedics, beefing up emergency responses in rural areas — though that’s not yet the case in Indiana, such efforts could be explored in the future.
 Less common missions

Different aircraft serve different purposes. Of the unit’s five aircraft, two are fixed-wing planes — capable of holding just one to two passengers in addition to the pilot. These planes can be used to target marijuana growing operations or traffic enforcement. 
Early, black-and-white photos of the ISP’s aviation wing show these pilots often traveling solo with a shackled prisoner, transporting detainees quickly from location to location.
Now, such transport is generally reserved for other purposes. 
Ploog estimated that he’d done two transports so far this year, so rarely that “I almost forget that those even pop up.” 
“We try to facilitate the need as best we can,” Ploog continued.

Sometimes such requests can come when troopers are already dispatched to various parts of the state, and just need to adjust time frames. But Ploog said such transports have also been abandoned in favor of higher priority missions like missing persons or criminal activity. 
Once, Ploog said the unit was tasked with transporting a special prosecutor who had cases back-to-back and wouldn’t meet the commitments otherwise. Another example includes a bird flu researcher from Purdue University. 
More recently, Gov. Mike Braun has made headlines for using ISP’s helicopters to go from the Governor’s Residence in Indianapolis to his private home in Jasper.
The governor’s office said ISP “expects” pilots to fly regularly, and the state said flight hours were necessary for other reasons. 
Ploog said that while helicopters were flown daily, weather permitting, there weren’t any set hours. Rather, regular flights were necessary to maintain the aircraft and keep aviators sharp.
ISP’s aviation wing has three helicopters that hold between two to four passengers. The oldest dates back to 1983 and has nearly 10,000 hours of flight time while another is unadorned and used more for general transportation purposes. 
Depending on the conditions and models, aircraft can usually fly for a few hours until they need to refuel. These are additional considerations for aviators like Ploog, who need to plan out those sorts of trips in advance.
“It’s a privilege to be here,” Ploog concluded. “Where else can I get paid to operate million-dollar aircrafts for — and really, I don’t want to sound cliche — but to help the public. It’s what I signed up for and to put it all together, it’s amazing.”

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)As governor, Tim Walz has passed a range of progressive policies to benefit the people of Minnesota. He signed the state’s landmark law requiring carbon-free power by 2040, a measure meant to put Minnesotans first in the clean energy transition. 
But if the governor’s own Public Utilities Commission signs off on Wall Street giant BlackRock’s attempted takeover of Allete and Minnesota Power, the decision could undercut his legacy, his promises, and the very communities he represents.
All five PUC commissioners are Walz appointees. A Department of Commerce representative, part of his administration, has seemingly been shown — through records obtained by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project — to be communicating with a handful of “clean energy” groups that filed last-minute comments in support of the deal. 
At the most recent PUC hearing, Commissioner Audrey Partridge — a Walz appointee and former employee of one of those groups — gave them a platform to speak in support of BlackRock’s proposed deal, while requests from ordinary Minnesotans were ignored. This is after an independent investigation found that one of these very “clean energy” groups now backing the BlackRock takeover have accepted industry-linked funding — including money raised at a fundraiser supported by Allete itself and counsel for the private equity firm buyer. According to CURE MN, members of the public had submitted requests to testify at this same hearing but were denied. 
Given these actions, are Walz’s appointees tilting the process toward BlackRock instead of the public they are supposed to serve?
The facts on the record are damning. In her report, Administrative Law Judge Megan McKenzie recommended denial of the BlackRock deal, finding it not in the public interest and likely to result in rate increases to MN Power customers. Approving it could mean higher electric bills, less transparency, and a less stable grid. 
For Indigenous communities, accusations of BlackRock’s record on Indigenous issues offers a troubling preview of what’s to come in Minnesota. In South Texas, for example, BlackRock and its subsidiary GIP are backing the Rio Grande LNG terminal, which members of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe say will be built on their ancestral land.
This BlackRock deal could hinder Minnesota’s 2040 carbon-free mandate, since there’s no requirement that BlackRock advance this clean energy vision. As the administrative law judge concluded, the petitioners have not shown the acquisition is necessary to meet the state’s clean energy goals.
BlackRock’s hand-picked spokesperson at the September PUC hearing, Jonathan Bram, claimed he would be “personally devastated” if Minnesota Power failed under his watch. 
Yet during his time as a board member, SunPower collapsed into bankruptcy in August 2024, citing erroneous financials that rendered the company unable to secure financing. 
PESP documented Bram’s oversight failures in expert testimony and follow-up research. That is the track record Walz’s PUC is being asked to believe in. Commissioner Joe Sullivan literally characterized it as a leap of faith in the hearing.
This is Walz’s decision. If the PUC approves BlackRock’s takeover, it will be his commissioners who rubber-stamped it. It will be his Department of Commerce that greased the skids. And it will be his constituents who pay the price — in higher bills, diminished accountability, and a utility no longer owned by the people it serves. 
The PUC commissioners are supposed to protect the Minnesota public. The public, numerous experts, and the state administrative law judge are telling them this deal is bad for Minnesota.
Minnesotans should ask: Will Walz stand with you? Or with BlackRock?
With the final PUC hearing and decision scheduled for October 3, that deadline now belongs to the governor.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2165923397.jpg,,,2025-10-01 09:57:58.795050

(Photos by Dana DiFilippo, Hal Brown, and Amanda Brown)The two front-runners in this year’s gubernatorial race don’t have many overlapping proposals, but their main pledge is the same: to make New Jersey, a state with some of the highest taxes in the country, more affordable.
Republican Jack Ciattarelli’s plans range from revamping how state aid is distributed to schools to promising to veto pet projects in the state budget if he’s elected governor in November. Ciattarelli on the campaign trail has reminisced about days when he said more people would come to New Jersey to start a family, open a business, and retire here.
“Those are the things that people feel terribly insecure, if not fearful of, today, and I refuse to be the governor of a state in which people live with insecurity and fear,” he said at a recent campaign stop in Elizabeth.
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat hoping to keep the governorship in her party’s hands for the third term in a row, has also made lowering costs a chief plank of her campaign for the state’s top job.
“I’m going to be fiscally responsible with your money, I’m going to drive down your costs at every level, and I’m going to make sure your kids have great opportunities here in the state of New Jersey,” she said earlier this month when the two candidates met for their first debate at Rider University in Lawrenceville.
The two are vying to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a term-limited Democrat. Here are five ways Ciattarelli and Sherrill say they would reduce costs if elected on Nov. 4.

Property taxes
Ciattarelli wants to cap property taxes by linking them to a percentage of a home’s assessed value, a move he said would help make home ownership a reality for more young people. 
“We want people to own a home again. In this country, you build equity with home ownership,” he said. 
Utilities
Ratepayers in New Jersey were socked with 20% increases starting in June (rates are expected to rise again next year after a price-setting auction held in July).
Ciattarelli blames Murphy and Trenton Democrats for the increase, citing the Murphy administration’s push for offshore wind farms that failed to become a reality and its reliance on out-of-state power generation.
“As governor, I’ll ban offshore wind and diversify our energy sources in New Jersey to once again include natural gas and nuclear,” he says in a campaign ad.
Small business
Ciattarelli has called for the first $100,000 of income for small businesses to be tax-free and for the first $100,000 of their payroll to be exempt from employer payroll taxes.
“Watch entrepreneurship take off in New Jersey,” Ciattarelli told reporters after the Rider debate.
Corporate business tax
Ciattarelli has vowed to slash the state’s corporate business tax over six years. Currently, businesses are taxed between 6.5% and 9%, and businesses with a taxable income greater than $10 million face an additional, non-marginal 2.5% surcharge. He has proposed reducing the top tax rate by 1% annually for six years.
Income taxes
New Jersey’s income tax is paid under a series of marginal rates that increase along with the filer’s income, starting at 1.4% and topping out at 10.75% for income that exceeds $1 million. There are five tax brackets in between.
Ciattarelli has called for three tax brackets that top out at 5%.
“We’re going to restructure and simplify our income tax rates. Pennsylvania has a 3% flat tax for everybody … We’re going to simplify it. I’m in favor, at the very least, of three brackets. 3%, 4%, 5%.”
Sherrill supporter Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth) echoed her campaign-trail threat that Ciattarelli will raise taxes if elected, noting that Ciattarelli voted to raise taxes when he held local elected positions. Sherrill, Gopal said, is focused on lowering property taxes, increasing shared services, and addressing skyrocketing utility costs.
“You look at Jack’s six years in the Assembly with Chris Christie, they raised taxes those years. So I’m not sure there’s anything to say that any voters I’ve talked to have any confidence Jack is going to make things more affordable,” he said.

Property taxes
Sherrill has said shared municipal and school services could drive down property taxes, and supports mandatory consolidation of certain school districts.
“We have some school districts who have the whole administrative cost, all of the buildings, and yet they’re not even running a K-12 school system, so we do need to merge some of these school districts,” she said at the Rider debate.
Utilities
Sherrill’s response to rising electricity prices is to propose a state of emergency on her first day as governor, one she claims will allow her to freeze utility rates.
“When I take office, the average New Jersey family won’t see an increase in utility rates for an entire year,” she said at an event in August. 
Health care
Sherrill’s health care plan includes driving down prescription drug costs by requiring pharmacy benefit managers — middlemen who negotiate drug prices with manufacturers on behalf of insurers —  to pass discounts directly to patients. She said she’d also remove incentives that allow them to pick expensive drugs for coverage.
“I’ll hold PBMs accountable for achieving cost savings for consumers, not lining their own pockets, making sure they’re not directing consumers towards those more expensive drugs that are driving up their costs,” she said in a May campaign video. 
Small business
Sherrill has proposed removing “red tape” for small businesses and making the permit-approval process more transparent so residents aren’t wasting time and money on redundant forms. She said it’s too hard for new business owners to obtain permits, and they often find themselves lost in paperwork. 
“But a lot of this is going to be a culture change in Trenton, as we have a ‘get to yes’ culture, instead of a ‘gotcha’ culture,” she said.
Food
Sherrill wants to lower the rising cost of groceries by offering incentives to local grocers to open more stores, which she said will create more competition, lower prices, and address food deserts. 
“My affordability agenda is about making New Jersey work for the working people,” she said.
Jeanette Hoffman, a Republican strategist, praised Ciattarelli’s tax reduction plans and called it “a big red flag” that Sherrill, at the Rider debate, declined to commit to not raising the state’s 6.65% sales tax.
“Jack has a place to address every single problem, they’re very specific, and he can talk about them in detail and in a reasonable way. He has a better command of the issues,” she said.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Initial fall 2025 enrollment numbers reported by Indiana’s public colleges and universities show growth in first-year students at several campuses, even as the state continues to grapple with a consistently low college-going rate.
The announcements come on the heels of new state data showing that just 51.7% of Indiana high school graduates in 2023 went directly to college, continuing a years-long dip in enrollment among Hoosier students. 
State leaders have emphasized that the trend highlights a need for more aggressive recruitment, degree program realignment and increased affordability measures as Indiana reshapes its higher education landscape.
The Indiana Commission for Higher Education released data that show overall enrollment at statewide public institutions increased for the fourth consecutive year, growing by over 4,200 students, or approximately 2%, from fall 2024.
“Indiana’s higher education institutions continue to move the needle on increasing enrollment, particularly with resident students,” said Indiana Commissioner for Higher Education Chris Lowery. “Through intentional, strategic initiatives geared toward helping our fellow Hoosiers, such as Indiana Pre-Admissions, more Hoosier students and families are being informed of, and choosing to attend, the colleges and universities right here in Indiana.”
Gains reported across public colleges, universities
At Indiana University, overall enrollment climbed to 89,247 students, including 25,308 new undergraduate and graduate students, according to a Sept. 8 news release.
The university welcomed a record 16,636 beginners, a 6.7% increase over last year. IU Bloomington set a new high with 48,626 students, while IU’s online programming topped 10,000 students for the first time.
Indiana’s college-going rate drops again, dipping to 51.7%

President Pamela Whitten said in a statement that fall enrollment “affirms that the word is out about the exceptional quality of an IU education.”
Purdue University again broke application records, receiving 86,953 applications for its incoming undergraduate class. Officials called it the most selective class in university history, while also touting Purdue’s highest graduation rate to date. 
As of Sept. 16, university officials said 8,914 new undergraduate and 3,189 new graduate students are beginning their first semester at the flagship campus in West Lafayette, along with 666 new undergraduates and 30 new graduate students in Indianapolis.
Still, the Journal and Courier reported that both out-of-state and international enrollments declined year-over-year. The rate of admission for out-of-state undergraduates dropped to 39%, down from 45% the prior year — a shift Purdue officials attributed in part to pressures on housing and infrastructure after last year’s unexpected enrollment surge.
Meanwhile, international student enrollment across Purdue’s campuses fell nearly 15% year-over-year. A similar drop in international student enrollment was recorded at Indiana University.
Trevor Peters, a university spokesperson, said that some of the decline reflects a “slightly smaller class” the university opted to admit this cycle, partly in response to the “surprising jump” in enrolled students in recent years, Axios reported.
Visa delays and tightened immigration policies — affecting international enrollments nationally — are also a likely factor.
Indiana State University, meanwhile, reported its largest freshman class in five years, enrolling 1,602 first-time, full-time students — a 13% increase from 2024. Nearly half are first-generation students and more than half are eligible for Pell Grants. Total undergraduate enrollment rose 2% to 6,352. ISU also set a record with 415 students entering its Honors College.

At the University of Southern Indiana, this fall marked the third consecutive year of freshman enrollment growth. USI welcomed 1,367 first-time freshmen, up 3.5% from last year. 
University officials said that overall headcount dipped slightly due to small declines in graduate and dual-credit students, but the school highlighted gains in retention and credit hours. 
President Steven J. Bridges said “these achievements demonstrate that USI is not only attracting more students but supporting them as they thrive.”
Vincennes University additionally reported “positive enrollment growth.” Headcount at its main campus rose 5% to 2,481 students, the highest since 2023. Enrollment at the Aviation Technology Center in Indianapolis surged 39%, while the Jasper campus saw a 23% jump in new full-time students.
Ivy Tech Community College, the state’s largest postsecondary system, has not yet provided statewide fall 2025 numbers, but some of the community college’s campuses have already reported local gains.
Paula Luff, Ball State University’s vice president for enrollment planning and management, reported that Ball State welcomed 3,733 new freshmen this fall. This is the third consecutive year in which the university has enrolled a freshman class larger than its pre-pandemic average.
More work ahead
The enrollment announcements come amid sweeping changes across Indiana’s higher education system. 
Earlier this year, CHE updated its degree review process and schools have already cut or merged hundreds of programs across public campuses. Leaders said the move is meant to ensure “relevance and performance” in degree offerings.
State commissioners have also warned that institutions will need to adapt to shifting student demographics, declining numbers of high school graduates and changes to workforce demands. 
Members of the CHE board emphasized earlier this year that Indiana’s higher education landscape will especially require new strategies to attract and retain students.
As part of that effort, Indiana has rolled out a suite of programs.
A major lever is the 21st Century Scholars program, which saw its enrollment more than double after a 2023 law allowed all income-eligible students to be automatically enrolled.
Story continues below.
5-Preadmissions
 
There are already 48,000 ninth-graders in the 2029 cohort, according to the latest CHE data — although students must still activate their accounts, meet GPA and diploma requirements, and file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. 
Lawmakers also made FAFSA completion mandatory. About 55% of the Class of 2025 had completed the FAFSA by April 15. But among 21st Century Scholars, the completion rate was closer to 66%, according to CHE. By June 30, those rates rose to 60% and 72%, respectively.
To lift those rates even more, CHE staff said they’re running a statewide FAFSA campaign with in-school “filing days,” mailings, media outreach and social media infographics.
CHE now sends “pre-admissions” letters to eligible high school seniors, too, letting them know they qualify for admission at up to three Indiana colleges. This fall, commission staff expect to send more than 74,000 letters to students at 456 Indiana high schools. Forty-one campuses — 18 public and 22 private — are extending pre-admission offers to eligible students this school year.
Separately, CHE is sending thousands of “Enrollment Ready” letters to the state’s 9th, 10th, and 11th graders to encourage and prepare students to enroll in college after graduation.
Additionally, included in the state’s high school diploma redesign is a new “seal” that officials said should help streamline more college-bound students to Hoosier institutions. 
Under a law passed this year, students who graduate with the new diploma and earn an “Enrollment Honors Plus Seal” are automatically admitted to all public colleges. At least 300 Hoosier students in the 2026 cohort are on the path to obtaining that seal as of Sept. 12, according to CHE.
The agency is further pushing earlier outreach through its “Enrollment Ready” initiative and encouraging high schools to offer the 30-credit Indiana College Core, which transfers across campuses and boosts the odds of college enrollment.
CHE officials emphasized that in 2023, 2,625 students earned the College Core — an increase from prior years — and 91% of them enrolled in college.

His wife’s full-time job with benefits provides the family with health insurance, but for Raboin, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has made an important difference for some of his employees.


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


“We don’t offer insurance ourselves,” Raboin said during a recent round table discussion set up by Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin). “A lot of small businesses in small towns aren’t in a financial place to do that.”
Like Raboin, some of his employees get their coverage through a spouse or because they also work another full-time job that provides benefits. But over the years, the ACA and the HealthCare.gov marketplace created under the law have been a critical source of health coverage for many of his employees, Raboin said.
Recently he polled a number of them. One memorable response came from a part-time employee who also has a part-time job with a local church. She buys her health insurance on HealthCare.gov. Thanks to an increase enacted in 2021 in tax credit subsidies, she’s been able to afford the premiums, Raboin said she told him.
“So without it, she’s like, ‘I can’t keep working for you. And I don’t think I keep working for my church. I think I have to find a different job,’” Raboin recalled.
The ACA and HealthCare.gov have made it possible for millions more Americans and thousands more Wisconsin residents to obtain health insurance.
But less visibly, the health care marketplace that the ACA created has also helped support many small businesses. If the enhanced tax credit subsidies that lowered the cost of health insurance for millions over the last three years aren’t renewed, small business owners and employees say they could be especially hard hit.
Nearly half of people who get their health insurance through the HealthCare.gov marketplace are self-employed or small business owners, or else work for small businesses, according to KFF, an independent nonprofit that researches and reports on health policy.
To expand access to health care, the ACA created the HealthCare.gov marketplace to make buying health insurance easier for people whose jobs don’t provide coverage and who don’t qualify for government programs such as Medicaid.
To make coverage more affordable, the law provides tax credit subsidies for people with incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty guideline. Those subsidies were increased in 2021 and expanded to people with higher incomes.
The enhanced subsidies will expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress extends them — driving up the cost of health insurance for millions.
The enhanced subsidy “saves more than 230,000 Wisconsinites an average of $500 every single month,” Baldwin said during a Zoom press conference Tuesday.
For Chrysa Ostenso and her late husband, the enhanced subsidies lowered their premiums from nearly $2,000 a month to about $300 a month, Ostenso said.
Ostenso lives in Ladysmith, Wisconsin, where she and her husband operated an optometry clinic for more than three decades, raising four children along the way.
“We always struggled to afford health insurance but of course we had to buy it,” Ostenso said in an interview. “As a family of four kids with a small business, you can’t go without health insurance.”
The family’s high deductible plans required them to pay $6,000 a year out of pocket before insurance would cover their health care. By 2020, when the children were grown and the health plan just covered Ostenso and her husband, they were paying $1,979 a month, she said.
They hadn’t qualified for the original ACA subsidies. When the enhanced subsidies were enacted in 2021, however, Ostenso said their premiums went down to $300 a month, increasing to $500 a month in subsequent years.
“It actually meant freedom to go to the doctor, because we were spending so much money on our premiums [previously] that we actually couldn’t afford to go to the doctor,” she said.
Standoff over extending subsidies
In the weeks leading up to Tuesday night’s federal shutdown, Democrats in Congress demanded that Republicans rescind sweeping changes to Medicaid that were part of the major tax- and spending-cuts megabill that President Donald Trump signed July 4.
They also demanded an extension of the enhanced ACA subsidies.
Baldwin has coauthored legislation that would make the enhanced subsidies permanent. She spent part of the just-concluded congressional recess traveling Wisconsin and meeting with people who expect to see their health costs go up sharply if the increased subsidies end.
During Tuesday’s press conference, Baldwin related a conversation with a  bakery owner who worried about how she and her family will afford health insurance, “but also that increased costs on the [HealthCare.gov] exchange will mean that her employees at her bakery may have to quit to work for big companies that offer insurance.”
During Baldwin’s press conference, Gigi Gastevich, an artist who owns a retail space in Stoughton, said the ACA and the enhanced subsidies had made it possible for her to launch and grow her business.
Gastevich is a 15-year cancer survivor. When starting her business, she qualified for BadgerCare — Wisconsin’s main Medicaid program — which covered the ongoing medical monitoring she requires as a cancer survivor.
In 2025, with her income above the limit for BadgerCare, she found an insurance plan on HealthCare.gov that included her existing health care professionals in its network and had an affordable deductible.
The plan’s premium was $481 a month, Gastevich said, but the enhanced subsidy  brought it down to about $100 a month.
Without the subsidy, she said, she will have to switch plans — possibly losing her long-standing group of providers if they aren’t in the network. She said her choices include taking a high-deductible plan that would put some of the regular care she’s been recommended as a cancer survivor out of reach financially; or closing down her business. 
“[That] would mean not only abandoning my dream of entrepreneurship and being a self-employed artist, but taking away an income source for the dozens of artists and artisans whose American-made work I sell here,” Gastevich said.
It would also forestall her plans to scale up her business to sell her own line of textiles and employ others. “I won’t be able to do that if my health and well-being is tied to being on an employer-based health care plan,” she added.
Uncertain future
During her tour of the state, Baldwin stopped in Mount Horeb on Thursday, Sept. 25, where she spoke with Brix owner Matt Raboin and four other business owners as well as local health care providers.
The round table took place at the Upland Hills Health Mount Horeb clinic. The urgent care clinic is part of a broader system that includes a hospital in Dodgeville and clinics in surrounding communities.
Dr. Mark Thompson, Upland Hills CEO, said system executives expect to see about $400,000 a year in additional uncompensated care based on projections of people leaving the insurance rolls because they don’t think they can afford the new ACA premiums.
Jay Goninen sat in as a board member of the Upland Hills system, but he’s also an employer for whom the ACA has made it possible to provide health benefits.
Goninen owns a business that helps connect the auto repair industry with high schools and technical schools. For the last few years, he’s opted to have employees of the firm purchase health insurance on the ACA.
The company pays a portion of the cost. Goninen likens the arrangement to a common practice of employers who offer a group health plan and split the cost with their employees.
“I do really worry about just the individual person and their ability to afford to live right now, in general,” he told Baldwin. “It is tough.”
In addition to worrying about what will happen to employees who bought coverage at HealthCare.gov if they lose their subsidies, Raboin said he’s also concerned about the broader ripple effect in the community.
“Our clients aren’t rich,” Raboin said. “Not everybody can go out to eat all the time, and if you start taking away that expendable income, that’s less people coming out to eat. So I think it would depress the whole economy.”
Rachel LaCasse-Ford owns a campground with her husband and also heads the Mount Horeb Chamber of Commerce.
“I’ve never really had a job that offers health care,” LaCasse-Ford told Baldwin. “I’ve always worked in small business, so we have always used health care from the ACA.”
The enhanced tax credits “definitely benefited” the couple, she said. “And if those go away, that will make our budgets tighter, and it will make things more challenging for us.”
With every new job, LaCasse-Ford said, she considers its impact on their health coverage and whether she can stay with a nonprofit employer such as the chamber, work for a small business, “or if I need to look for a larger employer that offers benefits.”

More than a year after shedding jobs and closing campuses, the outdoor leadership and wilderness medicine school shared new economic impact data at 60th anniversary event.
The post Lander-based NOLS brings $19M benefit to Wyoming, but is still in financial hole appeared first on WyoFile .","As the Lander-based National Outdoor Leadership School celebrated its 60th anniversary with a cluster of high-profile events last week, President Sandy Calhoun delivered mixed news regarding the state of the organization.
The good: NOLS, which is among Fremont County’s top employers, contributed $18.7 million to the state’s economy in 2024. 
The bad: More than a year after shedding dozens of jobs and closing some campuses, the nonprofit school has yet to right its financial ship.
“We have extraordinary momentum at this moment,” Calhoun told a large crowd of NOLS instructors, alumni and friends during a public speech Friday in Lander, before tempering his message. “We’re doing great, but we’re not out of the woods yet.”
Calhoun’s presentation offered insight into the evolution and challenges involved in running what has grown into a multifaceted, $40 million global organization.

With multiple campuses, hundreds of employees and thousands of alumni, NOLS offers expeditions in locales ranging from Alaska to India and Kenya. The school is also a leading provider of wilderness medical training. It offers customized education courses, semesters in the field and instructor certification.  
It’s got a lot going on, in other words. 
In March 2024, the school restructured, citing an operational shortfall caused by declining student field days and other factors. NOLS eliminated 60 positions and suspended three campuses.
Those changes put the school on a trajectory out of deficit, Calhoun said, but “we’re not there yet.” NOLS experienced a $3.6 million operating loss in 2025, he said. 
“So what’s our playbook for the future?” he asked. “We have to focus on financial rigor. We have to continue to reduce costs, year over year.”
Brighter news  
One of the more positive moments came when Calhoun unveiled the highlights of an economic impact study conducted by University of Wyoming researchers. 
The study found that in fiscal year 2024, NOLS supported 142 jobs and generated $16 million in economic output in Fremont County, where it’s among the top 8% of employers. 
“Due to its significant presence, NOLS has a substantial impact on the economy of Wyoming and Fremont County in particular,” the study states, adding that the school also makes meaningful non-economic contributions to the state.

“For example, NOLS Wilderness Medicine provides emergency medicine training to the University of Wyoming Medical school first-year class, the Fremont County Search and Rescue team, Shoshone National Forest rangers, and over 450 EMTs annually qualified to work in the State of Wyoming,” it reads. “Additionally, NOLS contributes to Wyoming’s culture of outdoor recreation, leadership, and stewardship through the courses and experiences it provides to students.”
When you extrapolate that data over decades, Calhoun said, “NOLS has been such a huge contributor to the state of Wyoming, and we’re proud of it, and it’s a story we haven’t told.”
NOLS has certainly helped shape Lander’s culture and economy — attracting many who end up putting down roots in the remote mountain town. But there is also occasional friction between long-time locals and the school, which mainly enrolls out-of-towners for wilderness courses.
In late 2024, Lander’s city council gave NOLS an economic development LIFT Grant of $45,000 for its 60th anniversary festivities. Many residents censured the move as a wasteful use of taxpayer dollars that could be better put toward things like infrastructure needs. 
NOLS Board Chair John Babcock, who introduced Calhoun on Friday, addressed the grant controversy. 
“We brought hundreds of people to town” for the anniversary events, Babcock said, and “100% of [the grant] investment went directly back into this community … and so it’s been a great reinvestment in Lander.”
Kids these days 
Accomplished mountaineer Paul Petzoldt started NOLS out of a cabin in Sinks Canyon near Lander in 1965. The founder had a vision of teaching leadership and outdoor skills on wilderness expeditions. 
Six decades later, what began as a humble operation has grown into a seasoned heavyweight in the world of outdoor education. NOLS itself isn’t the only thing that’s different.
“Over the last 60 years, our mission and our values have held steady, but the world around us has changed,” Babcock said. Some of the most drastic differences are in students, he noted. Young people are increasingly brought up to avoid risk. They’re also logging more time online.

When the organization began, he said, “most students arrived at NOLS with experience just exploring their own neighborhoods unsupervised, and today, many students arrive with far less of that. Today, for many of our students, a NOLS course is the first time offline in their life.”
There are also encouraging trends among young people, Calhoun said. 
“There’s all this good news that points to the idea that we should have a line out the door,” he said. Nearly 70% of young folks see themselves as outdoorsy, and 80% of Gen Z and millennials want to spend more time outside, according to industry research, he said. 
While that creates more demand, companies with outdoor offerings have also proliferated. “The reality, and this is a huge reality for NOLS, is that we are in such a competitive place.” 
NOLS’ student satisfaction is consistently high, he added, which reflects very positively on the organization. But the school needs to return key metrics like student time on field courses to growth patterns and find ways to operate in the black. 
“We’re not necessarily where we want to be,” Calhoun said. “And there’s work to do.”

Wyoming has never been free from outside money, but that amounting to political influence is not a foregone conclusion, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post Outside money inside The Big Empty appeared first on WyoFile .","I recently participated in a panel discussion in Lander focusing on problems we face in Wyoming and how to address them. There were 150 or so attendees from Lander and the surrounding environs in the audience, all well-behaved, engaged and curious. Pretty much anywhere you go in the Cowboy State to discuss the current political atmosphere these days, you can draw a standing-room-only crowd.

Opinion

One of the questions asked of the panel was, and I’ll paraphrase, “How do we fight the influence of all the outside money pouring into Wyoming, trying to change the state we love?” That is certainly a valid question, and heads nodded throughout the audience when it was asked. Nobody wants to see outsiders shoving their weight around in the Big Empty just because they have wads of cash in their out-of-state bank accounts.
I think I shocked the crowd when it came my turn to answer, and I said, “Wyoming has NEVER been free from the influence of outside money.”
If you don’t believe that statement, go to your bookshelf, and pull down that dusty old copy of T.A. Larson’s “History of Wyoming” (and we’ll all tip our Stetsons when Larson’s name is mentioned) and re-read his definitive work. You’ll see for yourself that Wyoming has never been immune from the effects of outside money. Never!
Furthermore, why would we want to look down our sunburned noses at outside money? It is precisely what made our state what it is today.
If anyone had reason to look askance at the influence of outside money, it was the Native American tribes who watched pale-faced mountain men traipsing up and down frigid mountain streams in search of beaver pelts. The fur industry was Wyoming’s first lucrative commercial enterprise, and it was funded by outside corporate interests — the American Fur Company, the Rocky Mountain Fur Company and the Hudson’s Bay Company.
The next splash of outside money capitalized Wyoming’s hardrock mining industry, first in the South Pass gold fields, and later the copper bonanza in the Sierra Madre. Enough of the profits stayed in Wyoming to create local wealth, but most of it was deposited in the financial institutions of the Great Elsewhere.
Outside money from Texas and Great Britain created the range livestock industry, and gave our state its namesake cowboy. The cattle industry is still the most culturally significant part of Wyoming’s past, but it was never homegrown. It came about due to the influence of outside money.
The same offshore capital built the Union Pacific Railroad through our southern counties. That benchmark project was light-years beyond the means of local Wyoming capital, so out-of-state interests stepped up with shady schemes like Crédit Mobilier to get the thing built. That infusion of non-Wyoming money yielded lasting results that still influence Wyoming today.
Pennsylvania wildcatter Mike Murphy drilled the first producing well in Wyoming’s oil patch, and his discovery was quickly followed up by national oil companies that perforated our state to extract her wealth. Our coal industry too, which began to fuel non-resident-owned locomotives, is now dominated by out-of-state corporations.
Today’s emerging industries, from “green” energy to massive data centers, all owe their beginnings to outside money. Simply put, Wyoming would not exist without “outside money” as much as we would like to think otherwise.
Now, perhaps the question posed to the panel was directed specifically at the flood of “outside money” flowing into our state to influence our political thinking. That is a different kettle of fish (or money) entirely.
Lord knows there is plenty of it buying political ads, putting up billboards and packing our mailboxes full of garishly offensive flyers. It represents a tsunami of bullshit and, make no mistake, it originates from every point on the political spectrum.
The motive behind this mountain of dough is not profit, but power. And it is protected by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in “Citizens United”, which concludes that money equals free speech, covered by the First Amendment.
As I told the audience in Lander, the best way to insulate ourselves from this corrosive outside money is for every Wyomingite to make sure that their personal bullshit detector is fully charged and the filter is routinely cleaned. Our best defense against the caustic effects of this outside political money is to simply not believe what it says. That is something each and every one of us can do.
A better understanding of our own Wyoming history would help, too.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)MERIDIAN — By one early afternoon in late August, Dr. Colleen McNicholas had already inserted an IUD, seen a patient to provide gender-affirming care and helped a patient access HIV prevention medication. 

At the last Planned Parenthood in Idaho, located just outside Boise, she said the clinic handles “really anything that somebody needs for their sexual and reproductive health care, basically from puberty through menopause.”
After the Idaho Legislature’s near-total abortion ban took effect three years ago, the state has lost more than a third of its OB-GYN doctors — and new recruits aren’t making up for the losses, a peer-reviewed study recently found. Planned Parenthood has expanded services to fill in gaps left behind, said McNicholas, an OB-GYN at the clinic and the chief clinical transformation officer for the regional Planned Parenthood affiliate. 
Without Planned Parenthood, other Idaho health care providers couldn’t easily pick up the slack on routine reproductive care because there just isn’t enough infrastructure, McNicholas said. If Idaho’s only Planned Parenthood clinic closed, other health centers in Idaho would see a 23% increase in patients seeking contraceptives, according to research by the Guttmacher Institute that found that federally qualified health centers can’t easily replace Planned Parenthood. 
But the budget reconciliation bill known colloquially as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” passed by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump, will prevent Medicaid from funding any services at Planned Parenthood for a year because of its association with the broader organization and its clinics that provide abortion care. That’s on top of a federal law that bans federal funds from funding abortions, and the Trump administration recently stripping other federal funds from Planned Parenthood.

 Federal appeals court upholds law blocking Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood services

Despite the cuts, Idaho’s last clinic is here to stay, said Rebecca Gibron, the CEO of the largest regional Planned Parenthood affiliate, which covers Idaho and five other states. 
“We aren’t going anywhere. While it’s hard for us to operate in such a hostile political environment, we aren’t going to turn our backs on our patients in the same way that lawmakers have done,” Gibron told the Idaho Capital Sun.
A federal appeals court recently allowed the GOP-backed law’s provision blocking Medicaid from funding Planned Parenthood services to go into effect. The court, in a brief decision without explaining its reasoning, overturned a lower court’s block on the funding ban that came in response to a lawsuit by Planned Parenthood, States Newsroom reported.

Starting in October, patients who had used Medicaid at the clinic must pay out of pocket, Planned Parenthood announced in a news release after the court’s ruling. 
Idaho’s last clinic has been a “lifeline,” Gibron said. If it closed, she said more patients might not get treatment for the range of reproductive health care services that Planned Parenthood provides — risking undetected cancers, rising sexually transmitted infections and more unplanned pregnancies.
“This was never only about abortion. This is about dismantling a critical access to care safety net provider in the state of Idaho that provides comprehensive, compassionate sexual and reproductive health care,” Gibron said. “These politicians are going after Planned Parenthood because of who we are, because of the services that we provide, and because of what we stand for.”
 Even with Medicaid cuts, Planned Parenthood is looking to make care affordable and accessible

The clinic in Meridian became Idaho’s last clinic after Planned Parenthood closed locations in Twin Falls and in Boise following funding cuts during the first Trump administration.
An hour away from Boise, Planned Parenthood set up a new clinic in Ontario, Oregon, to provide abortions after Idaho’s near-total abortion ban took effect. And on the border of North Idaho, Planned Parenthood runs another clinic in Pullman, Washington, a short drive from the college town of Moscow, Idaho.
But as Idaho’s only Planned Parenthood clinic, the Meridian clinic draws people from across the state to visit for care. In the past year, some of the clinic’s roughly 5,000 patients traveled from more than a dozen rural Idaho counties, according to the organization.

About 15% of the clinic’s patients are on Medicaid, accounting for nearly 10% of its patient revenue. The goal is to keep treating those patients, and to find a way to fund their care without payments from Medicaid once the cuts from the budget bill come through, Gibron said.
McNicholas hopes people understand that Planned Parenthood isn’t fighting for just abortion access.
“Planned Parenthood is certainly accustomed to the fight, and this is just another sort of rock in that path that we are going to navigate,” she said. “We’re going to make sure that we are adapting to stay nimble, to make sure that as those tens of thousands of people lose their access to their health insurance, that we are thinking about ways that we can change our model to be affordable and accessible to them, even if they don’t have health insurance to cover those costs.”
 One patient scheduled a same-day routine check up, after struggling to find a gynecologist. Another, who was about to lose Medicaid, came in to get her IUD replaced.

Most days, patients can schedule a same-day appointment to the clinic, a rarity in a state with the worst doctor shortage in the nation.
That’s what Liana Young did for a check up.

Christina Aslett came in to get her IUD replaced.
She could’ve waited a few more years, but she was about to lose access to Medicaid because she earned too much money to qualify. But part of why she came in was because she wasn’t sure what the future would hold for “our rights as women and people with uteruses,” she said.
Aslett, 40, said she has been going to Planned Parenthood since she was 16 years old. 
When she first got pregnant at 22 years old, she didn’t feel ready. So she got an abortion, but not at Planned Parenthood.
Less than a year later, she got pregnant again and had her first child. Then she got an IUD from Planned Parenthood.
“You just know that they’re going to be there for you, whenever you need them,” she said.
She didn’t get pregnant again until she was 34 years old. She now has three kids. A few months ago, she got married.

The Wisconsin Senate passing the 2025-27 budget bill in July. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)State lawmakers have failed to find a solution to stop cuts taking effect in October to two Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs programs that help veterans struggling with homelessness and mental health issues. 
The Veterans Housing and Recovery Program (VHRP) is closing two of its locations, one in Chippewa Falls and the other in Green Bay, and the Veterans Outreach and Recovery Program (VORP), which serves veterans dealing with mental health and substance use issues and aims to reduce the suicide rate among veterans, is set to lose seven positions.
The VHRP has been the center of back and forth between Democrats and Republicans for months since the announcement of the closures in July. 
A Republican bill to fund the program received a hearing in September, but it was too late to stop the closures. 
VORP launched in 2015 with the help of a federal mental health grant. It is now state funded and Evers used American Rescue Plan Act funds in 2023 to expand the reach of the program, but those funds have run out. 
Gov. Tony Evers had requested seven positions and more than $1.1 million to help support the program, but Republican lawmakers stripped that proposal from the state budget. Those seven positions were set to expire in October without the additional funds, though the cuts have already taken effect with the state Department of Veterans Affairs reducing the number of regions under the program from 16 back to 11.
The additional employees had helped the agency reach more veterans, provide support in a more timely manner and give veterans more individual attention, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. In 2023-24, the program provided services to 2,222 people — a nearly 70% increase compared to the prior year.
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) and Sen. Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay) called attention to the cuts during a press call on Tuesday, blaming Republicans for the failure to provide the needed funding. 
“I’m frustrated, and I’m devastated at the same time,” Hesselbein said. “As of today, these facilities are closed and the veterans they once housed have been relocated.” 
Hoey said at the hearing on the bill from Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken) that the earliest the Chippewa Falls facility would be able to reopen is sometime after Oct. 1, 2026. The Green Bay location, he said, could be reopened relatively quickly if there was funding and depending on whether the federal government would approve a request for a change to its scope. 
Hesselbein noted that Evers and Democratic lawmakers have provided several opportunities for Republicans to keep the VHRP sites open and provide funding to VORP. 
Democratic lawmakers, led by Hesselbein and Rep. Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa), introduced a bill to provide funding for the VORP positions, but it hasn’t received a hearing in the Republican-led Legislature. No Republican lawmakers have signed on to it, nor have they introduced their own version that would provide the funding.
A separate bill, authored by Wall, Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) and Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Clare), would provide the necessary funding for the VHRP sites. It previously would have provided $1.9 million, but an amendment to the legislation increases that to $2.6 million, which, Wall said, would be necessary to restart the programs. 
“My disappointment is with the leadership of legislative Republicans that has not made this program, has not made that bill, has not made homeless veterans a priority over the last few months,” Wall said. “They’ve run out the clock until here we are on Sept. 30, with the funding going away now. It’s possible to revive these programs… but it’s going to take a little bit more money and a lot more time. In the best case, we’re looking at next fall before we can stand up these programs again.” 
Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) blamed Evers for the closures, again, in a statement on Tuesday, claiming that there is money available to fund the programs.
“The Legislature appropriated enough funding to support the Veterans Housing and Recovery Program,” Wimberger said. “Evers simply refused to spend it. The closing of veterans’ homeless shelters is his decision alone, and he quite literally is refusing to use available funding in the exact same manner as he did last year to run those facilities.”
Evers has previously rejected Wimberger’s claim, noting that a paper from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau to the Joint Finance Committee warned lawmakers that additional funds were needed for the program. 
A letter from Republican lawmakers also noted that there has been a balance that the Department of Veterans Affairs  returns to the state treasury at the end of the year, though Hoey has noted that the agency is “only allowed to spend the money [the Legislature] tell[s] us to spend.”
Wall made a similar point during the press conference, saying that “we don’t just write a blank check to the Department of Veterans Affairs or any other part of the state budget. What we do is say that there’s so much money in this budget line for this program and so much money in that budget line for this other program, and so the fact that the Department of Veterans Affairs had surplus money and other budget lines doesn’t mean that they could just willy-nilly take that and spend that any way they wanted to for the benefit of this program.”
Hesselbein said this is a continuation of Republicans’ “strange finger pointing.” 
Hesselbein used the deadline for the closures and cuts as an opportunity to talk about what Democrats would do if they were in the majority. Democrats are seeking to flip the Senate in 2026 and need to win two additional seats to do it.
“Republicans chose to do nothing,” Hesselbein said. “Rest assured in a couple of years, when I’m the majority leader, these kinds of antics won’t be tolerated in a Democratic majority, but unfortunately, while that day is on the horizon, it’s not here yet.”

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)The rate of children in Idaho without health insurance rose the second fastest in the nation recently, a new report found. 
From 2022 to 2024, Idaho’s child uninsured rate rose from 5.7% to 8.1% — growing Idaho’s number of uninsured children from 28,000 to 40,000 kids, according to a report released earlier this month by Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. 
The report analyzed health insurance rates for children across the country as states started to remove people from Medicaid after pandemic-era enrollment protections ended. That process, called Medicaid unwinding, contributed to Idaho’s sharp rise in the rate of uninsured children, the center’s executive director, Joan Alker, said at a webinar earlier this month. 
“All it takes is one broken arm on the school playground to financially devastate a family already struggling to make ends meet,“ Ivy Walker, a policy associate at the health advocacy group Idaho Voices for Children, said in a statement. “The number of Idaho children going without health insurance should be a wake-up call for Idaho policymakers and the unfortunate truth is that children’s access to health care is about to get much worse.”
Idaho did Medicaid unwinding fast, and most Idahoans who lost Medicaid through the process were removed for not replying to the state’s requests for information, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. Almost three-quarters of the nearly 50,000 kids who lost Medicaid were removed from the health insurance public assistance program for non-responses, Idaho Voices for Children said in a news release Tuesday. 
The group called on Idaho’s congressional delegation to help by extending enhanced premium tax credits families can use to buy discounted private health insurance through the state’s exchange. 
The credits are set to expire at the end of this year, and Congress hasn’t extended them. Without the credits, 35,000 Idahoans could lose health insurance because of steep premium hikes, the Sun previously reported.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A Tennessee Democratic lawmaker is accusing the state’s attorney general of revising and withdrawing a legal opinion on National Guard deployment, enabling the governor to send troops to Memphis in violation of the Constitution.
Reacting to Gov. Bill Lee’s decision to order Guard personnel to Memphis at the request of President Donald Trump, Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville questioned the moves of both leaders, in addition to Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti’s deletion and then changing of a legal opinion in April 2024. 
“That is not just reckless but seemingly lawless,” Yarbro said. “The reason that Americans are not used to seeing troops in combat fatigues patrolling American cities is not because nobody’s ever thought of it before. It’s because it’s illegal.”
Yarbro said the prohibition on military involvement in police work dates back to Tennessee’s 1796 Constitution. A change in 1870 further limited the governor from deploying National Guard troops in a public safety operation to “execute the laws” or be part of a domestic law enforcement agency.
“You either have the rule of law or you don’t,” Yarbro said.










The reason that Americans are not used to seeing troops in combat fatigues patrolling American cities is not because nobody’s ever thought of it before. It’s because it’s illegal.


– Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville


Lee announced last week Tennessee National Guard troops would be sent to Memphis as part of a crime-fighting effort made up of local, state and federal authorities. Guard personnel are to be deputized by the U.S. Marshals Services but are not to be armed or make arrests unless Memphis Police request it.
Yarbro said the attorney general’s website shows a blank page where it once held an opinion by former Attorney General Herbert Slatery about the constitutional requirements for deploying Guard troops. 
A different opinion by Skrmetti from January 2024 acknowledges the National Guard of Tennessee is “a militia for purposes of the Constitution,” Yarbro said. But an April 2024 revision says the Guard is a militia “only for purposes of federal law.”
Yarbro said he considers it “deeply problematic” for the attorney general to shift advice, especially when it involves sending troops into cities.
“When we’re not following the law and still exercising power, the technical word for that is tyranny,” Yarbro said.
The senator sent a letter to Skrmetti saying state law doesn’t authorize backdated revisions or undated withdrawals of formal attorney general opinions. Opinions are to be changed or omitted only when the legislature passes new laws or a court makes a conflicting ruling, according to Yarbro.
Sen. Yarbro Letter to Skrmetti re Opinions 21-05 and 24-01 (9.29.2025)
Skrmetti responded Tuesday by saying attorney general opinions aren’t legally binding. He said Slatery’s opinion was withdrawn in April 2024 because it didn’t “accurately reflect the state of the law.” He added that the office withdraws opinions when it finds the state of the law has changed or the analysis was incorrect.
“If the folks at the press conference are insinuating my office withdrew the opinion six months before the election to pave the way for Trump policies a year and a half later, they have bigger problems than this legal question,” Skrmetti said in an email. “If I could see the future like that, I’d be neck deep in Bitcoin and Pokemon cards.”
Yarbro, though, said the attorney general and governor don’t get to choose which state laws apply.
“If the attorney general of Tennessee wants to issue an opinion saying that this deployment is valid, that the Constitution of Tennessee does not apply to the Tennessee National Guard, he should have the guts to actually say that,” Yarbro said.
Republican Sen. Mark Pody, who represents Wilson County and part of eastern Davidson County, said Tuesday he believes the deployment is legal because the National Guard is “under the governor’s purview.”
If the federal government were to take action without the governor’s permission, that would raise constitutional questions, Pody said.
At least one court ruled Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in California without the governor’s approval was illegal.
Pody said he believes Skrmetti would have considered the legality of removing the 2021 opinion before putting out his own opinion.
The opinion by Slatery said only in cases of rebellion or invasion is the governor permitted to deploy the militia, a move the legislature must approve. Yarbro said he believes the legislature should have voted on this decision too.

Patrick Morrisey and state lawmakers to eliminate the state’s tax on overtime and tips. (Photo by JGI/Jamie Grill/Getty Images)West Virginia State Treasurer Larry Pack on Tuesday called on Gov. Patrick Morrisey and state lawmakers to eliminate the state’s tax on overtime and tips. Pack asked officials to consider taking up the matter during a special legislative session.
“President Trump promised to abolish the tax on overtime pay and tips, a centerpiece for his tax policies,” Pack said in a news release. “The goal was to help blue-collar and service industry workers who often rely on overtime and tips to make ends meet. Combined with the extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, President Trump has delivered, and then some, by enacting some of the largest federal tax cuts in history.”
Pack also spoke about the proposal during an interview with Talkline on West Virginia MetroNews. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed into law this summer, cut federal taxes on tips and overtime. According to the IRS, workers of certain occupations can deduct tips up to $25,000 annually during tax years 2025 through 2028.
Workers who receive overtime pay may also deduct the pay that exceeds their regular rate of pay — for example, the “half” in “time and a half” pay, up to $12,500 annually or $25,000 for joint filers. 
According to the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the nonpartisan Urban and Brookings institutes that aims to improve tax and fiscal policy, while the tax cuts are popular, few will actually benefit from them. 
Only about 3% of households will benefit from the deduction for tipped income in 2026. Their average benefit is $1,400, but the average for all households is $40, according to the center.
About 9% of workers will pay on average $1,400 less on their overtime as well, according to the Tax Policy Center. The average reduction for all households will be $130. 
In a statement Tuesday, Kelly Allen, director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said the state should focus on policies that strengthen the economic security of all workers, but called eliminating the tax on overtime and tips a “gimmick.”
“These policies help employers — not workers — by pushing more sectors to move to tips, which lowers costs for businesses while reducing economic stability for workers and costing consumers more,” Allen said. “We are all frustrated by the increasing number of transactions in which we are encouraged to tip, and these policies only exacerbate the issue. 
“Similarly, no tax on overtime helps employers, not workers, by encouraging excessive hours of work and putting downward pressure on base wages,” she said. “Workers shouldn’t have to work more than 40 hours per week to provide for their families.”
Pack’s proposal to eliminate tips and overtime from the state income tax comes as the state is already grappling with a potentially rocky future financial outlook. While the state ended fiscal year 2025 with a revenue surplus, growing expenses — from the Public Employee Insurance Agency, the Hope Scholarship and potential federal budget cuts — could pose challenges.
The state is also still settling financially after implementing several cuts to personal income taxes in recent years. In 2024, according to the state budget office, West Virginia reported $826 million in surplus. 
Fiscal year 2025 ended in July, with the state reporting about $338 million in surplus, according to a news release from Morrisey. But most of that money was already spent and committed by the time the fiscal year ended due to supplemental appropriations passed in the 2025 regular session.
In an emailed response Tuesday regarding Pack’s request, Drew Galang, deputy press secretary for Morrisey, said the governor’s administration is “making the tough decisions to put our state in a great place to return money back to our people.
“We did the hard work of paying for the last set of tax cuts during the last legislative session and have begun to put our state on a solid long term financial trajectory,” Galang wrote. “This will position the governor and the Legislature to provide significant and broad based tax relief for West Virginians during the upcoming legislative session.”

The new rules extend the work requirements to able bodied adults ages 18 to 64. Previously in Tennessee the work requirements – which can also be fulfilled by volunteering or attending job training — ended at age 54. The rules also require parents of children 14 and up to work, volunteer or attend training. Previously parents of children 16 and up were exempt.
More than 700,000 Tennesseans — or one in every 10 state residents – rely on the SNAP program to feed their families.
The new age requirements are part of an overhaul of the federal food assistance program under the Big Beautiful Bill Act, which makes the largest ever cuts to the federal anti-hunger program.
One Big Beautiful Bill Act food assistance cuts come with hefty price tag for Tennessee taxpayers

The law also shifts a significant portion of the financial burden for the program from the federal government to states. 
Until now the federal government has paid half of the $128 million in administrative costs Tennessee incurs to run the program and picked up the tab for the entire $800 million in cash benefits, according to 2023 data published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Under the new law, Tennessee will have to pick up 75% of the administrative costs and about 10% of the cash benefits. A recent analysis by the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth concluded Tennessee taxpayers may be responsible for an additional $110 million annually for the program.
The Tennessee Department of Human Services, which oversees SNAP, has set an Oct. 31 deadline for individuals to submit documentation showing they meet an exception to the work requirement rules. The exceptions include being pregnant or “medically certified as physically or mentally unfit for employment.”
SNAP recipients may submit their documentation electronically, access resources to find jobs or receive training and review the new requirements on the department’s website.

Members in the Senate failed to reach an agreement on a short-term government funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, meaning many major federal government operations will cease beginning Wednesday. 
None of the dozen government spending bills have passed Congress, which is different from previous shutdowns, when some of those appropriations bills passed and funded certain parts of the federal government. The last government shutdown occurred during President Donald Trump’s first term and lasted 35 days, from late 2018 into early 2019. The current shutdown could last longer and have a wider effect.

Republicans in the Senate need some Democratic support to pass a funding measure, but Democrats have refused to support the measure that passed the House without changes to Affordable Care Act tax credits. 
U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, both Colorado Democrats, voted on Tuesday against the Republican measure, which had previously passed the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Hickenlooper said in a post on X that while Republicans need seven votes to pass their funding measure, “Coloradans need their health care,” and he won’t vote for a bill that does not lower those costs. 
Senate Democrats had introduced their own continuing resolution, which would have extended Affordable Care Act enhanced premium credits. Republicans blocked the measure. Health insurance premiums in Colorado next year will increase an average of 28% for people who buy plans on the individual market unless Congress extends those tax credits, Hickenlooper said in a statement Tuesday.
Bennet in a post on X blamed Trump and Republicans for “refusing to negotiate with Democrats to prevent healthcare costs from skyrocketing and avoid a government shutdown.”
“If President Trump and Congressional Republicans allow the Affordable Care Act tax credits to expire, rural families in Colorado will see premiums soar by more than 300%,” Bennet said in a statement Tuesday night. “In total, more than 24 million Americans could see their health insurance premiums double.”
House members
All four of Colorado’s Republicans in Congress — U.S. Reps. Lauren Boebert of Windsor, Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs, Jeff Hurd of Grand Junction and Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton — voted in support of the measure when it passed the U.S. House earlier this month. 
Boebert said Democrats caused the shutdown and will use it “to try and show their rabid base that they’re ‘fighting’ Trump.” 
“They have a giant wishlist of demands totaling $1.5 trillion that they’re never going to get us to agree on,” Boebert said in a post on X. “It’s all a show so they can send out fundraising emails and act like they’re fighting.”
Evans said in a post on X that Democrats want a shutdown “because we won’t fund their extreme priorities like taxpayer funded benefits for illegal immigrants.” He released a statement Tuesday morning requesting his pay be withheld until the government reopens.
“If Senate Democrats force our troops to work without pay, Congress should be held to the same standard,” Evans said in a statement.
Republicans control both chambers of Congress, as well as the White House.
All four Democrats in the House from Colorado — U.S. Reps. Jason Crow of Centennial, Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood — voted against the measure. 
Crow said the Republican budget cuts will cause health care costs “to soar” and said the bill is funding “the dismantling of our democracy by this administration,” which he said he refuses to be a part of. He said because Republicans control the White House, House and Senate, they are to blame for the shutdown. 
Neguse told MSNBC that Trump has been dismantling the federal government over the last nine months and said it’s “ridiculous” to expect Democrats to support a Republican budget bill “that exacerbates the cost of living crisis that they have created.”
“They have a majority in the House and the Senate. They have the presidency,” Neguse said. “They have an obligation to fund the government. Their inability to do so is gross incompetence.”

The plaintiffs are seeking a class action designation to add more parties to their case.
Filed in the District of Columbia, the complaint alleges the Department of Homeland Security has created an illegal national citizenship database through its Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system. At least four states are using SAVE data to review voter rolls, even though it relies on Social Security data the agency considers unreliable, the lawsuit alleges.
The first state to plug into the SAVE system was Louisiana, where Secretary of State Nancy Landry announced Sept. 4 that she used the new database to scour state voting records going back to the 1980s. Her review found 390 noncitizen registered voters, including 79 who she said voted in at least one election over the past several decades. 
The 390 voters in question represent 0.01% of all registered voters in Louisiana, though Landry acknowledged the possibility that some of her findings could be in error or attributed to outdated information.
“The consolidation and unlawful use of Louisianans’ sensitive data without our knowledge is alarming and terrifying,” M. Christian Green, president of the League of Women Voters of Louisiana, said in a statement. 
Green’s chapter, its counterpart in Virginia and the national League of Women Voters are plaintiffs in the lawsuit with the Electronic Privacy Information Center and five individuals identified as J. Doe.

J. Doe 4 is a Louisiana voter who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2014, according to the lawsuit. The court filing also claims that Social Security records incorrectly state that J. Doe 4 is not a U.S. citizen.
Defendants in the case are the Department of Homeland Security and its leader, Kristi Noem, the Social Security Administration and its commissioner, Frank Bisignano, the U.S. Department of Justice and Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Trump administration officials have yet to publicly comment on the lawsuit.
The plaintiffs say the Trump administration has violated multiple federal laws by combining various government sources to form a national “Data Lake” under U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a subagency of Homeland Security. In addition, the lawsuit claims the separation of powers provision in the Constitution was violated when the executive branch chose to usurp Congress’ authority over elections. 
The alleged violations include the Privacy Act, approved in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal and amended in 1988 through the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act. The advocacy groups say the Trump administration has ignored prohibitions against disclosing, combining and comparing data from different federal agencies beyond allowed exceptions.
“Unfortunately, the Defendants in this case are ignoring these laws to create comprehensive databases of American citizens’ data …” the lawsuit reads. “The Plaintiffs in this case include a proposed class of millions of American citizens and permanent residents whose records have been unlawfully pooled into new or revised centralized records systems.”
Louisiana election investigation finds 79 noncitizens have voted since 1980s

The alleged violations began with the formation of the Department of Governmental Efficiency through an executive order from President Donald Trump, according to the lawsuit. DOGE initiated a “government-wide consolidation of sensitive personal data” that culminated with the approval of the SAVE system. Subsequent executive orders from Trump prompted states to begin sharing their voter data with federal agencies, the plaintiffs argue.
Without evidence to support his claims, Trump has repeatedly alleged widespread fraud took place in the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections. The states that have willingly joined the president’s SAVE campaign are Republican led, while Democratic state leaders are fighting the Justice Department’s attempts to compel them to share voter data.
The lawsuit filed Tuesday calls for the federal court to stop the Trump administration from compiling information illegally and for the new database to be dissolved.

(Getty Images)Absentee voting has quietly served Idaho for decades. It gives seniors, rural residents, working families, and military members a trusted way to cast their ballots. For many, it’s not just convenient but essential. And for our active-duty service members in the U.S. and abroad, absentee voting isn’t simply a matter of convenience it is the only way their voices can be heard.
A soldier serving away from home should never lose the right to vote for the leaders who shape the policies that affect their service. All veterans should always have a voice in the very democracy they helped defend. Absentee voting ensures that the men and women who have given so much for our country continue to have a say in its future.
Absentee voting isn’t mail-in voting. One common misunderstanding is confusing absentee voting with universal mail-in voting. They are not the same.

In Idaho, absentee ballots are available only to registered voters who request them in advance. Each request is verified, and ballots must be returned by strict deadlines.
Universal mail-in voting, on the other hand, automatically sends ballots to every registered voter, whether they asked for one or not.

Idaho does not use universal mail-in voting. Our absentee system is controlled, request-based, and full of checks that protect security and accountability.
Idaho has recently strengthened absentee voting even more:

Online ballot requests require either a state-issued ID or the last four digits of a Social Security number; but you must have first registered with your Idaho driver’s license or state-issued ID card number to request an absentee ballot.
Requests must be made annually.
Returned ballots must have signatures that match voter records, and county clerks carefully verify them. County election offices must have annual training on signature verification.

These steps are straightforward, transparent, and build public confidence. They also ensure that when a ballot is sent to a Marine in the Pacific, an airman in Europe, or a soldier stationed in the Middle East, that vote is every bit as secure as one cast in person at the polls.
Much of the handwringing about absentee ballots simply isn’t based on fact. Idaho election officials, Republican and Democrat alike, have testified that fraud is extremely rare. Paper ballots, signature verification, and post-election audits already safeguard the process. And in Idaho, when fraud does occur, it is prosecuted. The evidence shows absentee voting is secure and reliable.
Idaho has also put an end to ballot harvesting. Only the voter, or a close contact like a family member or caregiver, can return a ballot. No one can legally drop off a stack of ballots at the elections office. That safeguard further protects the chain of custody.
These reforms haven’t gone unnoticed. In 2024, Idaho improved its standing on The Heritage Foundation’s Election Integrity Scorecard, joining states recognized for significantly strengthening election security. The Honest Elections Project also praised reforms like requiring voter ID for every ballot and securing early and absentee voting, which Idaho has already put into practice.
The impact goes beyond rankings. In places like Kootenai County, absentee voting helps ease poll-day congestion, reduces pressure on poll workers, and keeps lines shorter. That makes Election Day smoother and more efficient for everyone. But above all, absentee ballots protect the voices of Idaho’s veterans and active-duty military, a group that above any other has earned right and expectation, that their vote will count.
At its heart, absentee voting is about access. It gives every eligible Idahoan a secure way to vote, no matter their circumstances. When politicians add hurdles just to look tough on elections, they aren’t protecting democracy, they’re getting in the way of legitimate voters.
 Idaho should continue building on this quiet success story by keeping access strong while making smart, thoughtful improvements.
Absentee voting in Idaho is secure, tested, and improving. More importantly, it keeps faith with every Idahoan, including those who have worn the uniform and stood watch so we can remain free to cast our ballots at home.

Fair spoke to the news outlet in an exclusive interview on the heels of President Donald Trump signing a memorandum directing federal law enforcement agencies to investigate what he claimed were wealthy donors and organizations funding left-wing political violence.
The memo could be used as a pretext to target civil rights organizations perceived to be enemies of the Trump administration and Republican causes in states such as Mississippi, Fair said.
“The charge from the administration, the most recent memorandum, seems to go after one type of organization — organizations that are critical of this administration, or that promote equality of opportunity for all,” Fair said. “We see this as a partisan attack on progressive nonprofits that seek to lift up due-process rights, First Amendment rights and the equal protection rights of all persons.”
The Southern Poverty Law Center — one of the nation’s most well-known civil rights organizations that rose to prominence by filing legal cases against white supremacist groups in the post-Jim Crow South — will remain undeterred from its mission, Fair said. But Trump’s memo last week and his administration’s vows to attack the financial and organizational networks that support progressive causes have sent many groups bracing for impact.
The center is part of a “civil rights ecosystem” that includes organizations such as the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, the ACLU, the NAACP, the Legal Defense Fund and Democracy Forward. All of these groups believe that the administration plans to target civil rights groups, Fair said. The SPLC has long attracted the ire of Republican politicians and groups who see the organization as biased against conservatives.
The organization’s work classifying “hate groups” is a particular point of contention, with critics saying the organization lumps mainstream conservative groups together with white supremacists and neo-Nazis.
Anger from Trump and his supporters toward progressive groups intensified after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Trump administration officials and allied media figures have claimed, largely without evidence, that progressive groups have encouraged physical violence against conservatives. Some conservative critics have trained their attention and large social followings on the center by name.

Fair said his organization condemned Kirk’s murder and has never condoned political violence of any sort.
“For 55 years, SPLC has been on the front lines of fighting hate and extremism in this country,” Fair said. “We were founded to fight for the civil rights of all persons, and that’s what we do every day. We believe that everything that we do is protected under the law.”
Fair said threats from the Trump administration against groups such as the center have arrived at the same time these organizations are working to blunt the impact of deep federal spending cuts approved by congressional Republicans.
Fair was in Jackson on Tuesday to kick off a “Truth, Poverty and Democracy Tour” around Mississippi. The multicity, week-long tour will connect Mississippians to advocates and resources that “address systemic barriers to health care, housing, education and voting rights,” the organization said.
Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the country, and Fair said the center plans to wage a “war on poverty,” harkening back to President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 State of the Union Address.
Three years after that speech, Democratic Sen. Robert F. Kennedy toured the Mississippi Delta to learn more about the region’s life-shaping poverty, a seemingly intractable problem that still persists.
The center’s plans to emphasize poverty-related issues — such as the Republican-pushed “big, beautiful bill” cuts to Medicaid and food assistance — represent a new strategy for the organization.
“We’ve adopted poverty as a new pillar of our work,” Fair said. “Historically, we have not done great work in that space, but we’re trying very intentionally to shift our focus so that we’re on the ground.”
Democratic state lawmakers said at a press conference later on Tuesday that they would continue partnering with groups such as the center on shared efforts to strengthen social safety net programs.
“I’m done trying to change the minds of some of the people in this Capitol building or change the minds of the people in Washington who are in control,” said House Minority Leader Robert Johnson. “Our job is to get them out. So this partnership will continue whether Trump funds it or not.”
While the shift to a full-throated focus on poverty-related issues might be a departure, Fair said the center would not change its tactics in response to federal pressure. 
“We have no intention of being silenced by this administration or any administration,” Fair said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/30112728/3X0A9903.jpg,,,2025-10-01 06:58:26.851998

Low-income Kentuckians getting much-needed cash payments through the Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program (or KTAP) will get less help starting in November. 
Dr. Steven Stack, the secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said last week that the “program grew more quickly than projected” after an overhaul two years ago. The number of participating families increased from around 10,026 in the 2023 fiscal year to 15,117 in 2025. 
In the program’s first update since 1995, Kentucky in 2023 increased KTAP payments and  raised income eligibility levels, meaning more families could receive assistance. The state also raised the asset test from $2,000 to $10,000, a change that helped older caregivers raising children on retirement savings. 
Lower monthly payments coming in November are “still higher than the amounts prior to 2023,” Stack said. 
Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear announced the cut in benefits during his weekly news briefing on Sept. 25. Beshear and Stack cited a strain on cabinet finances caused by an increase in the number of children entering foster care and the severity of their needs. 
“Not only did we see an increase in the number of children entering foster care, but the cost of their care also increased,” Stack said. “We have children in foster care who at times can’t be placed right away because the services they need simply are not available. In those situations, our DCBS (Department for Community Based Services) social workers have stepped in to provide around the clock care to make sure those children are safe. That has meant significant spending in staff overtime, security and other emergency supports.”
Advocates are criticizing Beshear’s administration for the move, saying the General Assembly should have been looped in either during the 2026 session or in a special session to address the issue.

“Clearly, the precedent is to involve them,” said Terry Brooks, the executive director of Kentucky Youth Advocates. “It’s intriguing in the sense that Gov. (Andy) Beshear places a high emphasis on legislative and executive branch collaboration, unless he doesn’t want to collaborate.” 
The Lantern asked the cabinet for more insight on the decision to move forward with the cut without engaging the General Assembly. 
KTAP, which comes from federal funds from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, benefits low-income families for a maximum of 60 months over the course of a lifetime, which do not have to be consecutive. Families are eligible for this assistance if they are low income, a Kentucky resident, a U.S. citizen or qualifying immigrant and a caretaker or parent of a child. The program also provides transportation assistance and has work and education requirements. 
Families getting $300 from the government “may not sound like a lot,” Brooks said, but “for these families, it’s a significant hit.” 
“​​It’s diapers and formula and clothes and cribs and medical expenses and school supplies,” he said. “None of those come cheap.” 
About 19% of Kentucky children lived in poverty last year, according to the American Community Survey (ACS), released by the United States Census Bureau in mid September. More than 500,000 Kentuckians participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
The lower KTAP payments will be especially challenging for kinship care families in Kentucky, Brooks said, who are already making a “significant economic sacrifice” to raise minor relatives and keep them out of traditional foster care. If they can’t make ends meet on their own, they can’t remain kinship caregivers, he said. 
​​About 42% of kinship families in Kentucky receive KTAP support, reports Kentucky Youth Advocates. 
“I’m a grandpa,” Brooks said. “And when I think about any grandparent being faced with the situation: ‘I can’t make it economically, and therefore I’m going to have to relinquish my grandchild to the state,’ that’s heartbreaking.” 
A ‘blow’ to ‘modest but vital lifeline’ 
Dustin Pugel, the policy director at the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, called KTAP benefits “a modest, but vital lifeline” for low-income Kentuckians who stand to suffer a “blow” in losing part of the help. 
Dustin Pugel
“To cut this benefit by a third in order to plug a budget hole without public input or regulatory approval is to rob Peter to pay Paul, and those who suffer the consequences are kids who can least afford it,” Pugel said. 
Prior to 2023, the benefit for a family of one making $742 a month was a maximum of $186, according to the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. A family of seven or more was eligible for up to $482 in assistance if they made $1,462 per month. 
Also, before the 2023 changes, Kentucky families had to be so poor to qualify — an income of no more than $12,000 a year for a family of three — that participation in KTAP had fallen to 10,000 families compared to 72,000 families in 1995.
In addition to raising the income eligibility levels, the 2023 update roughly doubled the maximum benefit. On the low end of current benefit thresholds a family of one making $890 per month can receive a maximum of $372 and, on the highest end, a family of seven earning $1,754 per month can qualify for up to $964. 
Now, starting in November, Kentuckians getting the benefit will see about a 35% decrease, according to a letter obtained by the Lantern, which was to be sent to KTAP recipients. The Lantern has asked the cabinet to confirm the benefit amounts, which are, according to that email: 

A family of one is eligible for up to $242. 
A family of two is eligible for up to $293. 
A family of three is eligible for up to $341. 
A family of four is eligible for up to $426. 
A family of five is eligible for up to $498. 
A family of six is eligible for up to $562. 
A family of 7 or more is eligible for up to $627. 

‘Penny wise and pound foolish’ 
Food and housing insecurity are already high in Kentucky, and Brooks worries the changes to KTAP will only worsen both. 
“I worry a lot about what it means for food insecurity, housing stability, all of those factors,” Brooks said. “We know that those are the exact issues that cause young people to have those adverse childhood experiences. When we’re creating instability in any way today, we’re going to pay for that in very real ways tomorrow.” 
Adverse childhood experiences, more commonly known as ACEs, refer to traumas or stressors in a person’s life before their 18th birthday. Adverse experiences in childhood and their lasting consequences cost Kentucky nearly $300 million a year, the Lantern has reported. 
“In a lot of ways, this decision could backfire, and it could be that we’re penny wise and pound foolish,” Brooks said. 
Stack stressed that families aren’t being punished.

“This is not a penalty for families receiving KTAP or for those participating in the Kentucky Works program, this change is the result of circumstances that go beyond any one program or household,” Stack said Thursday during Gov. Andy Beshear’s weekly press briefing. “We recognize that these reductions will result in added burdens, and we are committed to helping families connect with other resources where possible.” 
Stack said any people affected by this “difficult news” can call 1-855-306-8959 for help locating other assistance. The changes go into effect Nov. 1. 
“Changes like these are not easy, and they are never welcome,” Stack said. “When financial resources are available, we are committed to directing them to support Kentuckians. Unfortunately, the other side of the coin is that when demand increases or funding is reduced, programs must be adjusted to stay within the designated budget allowed.” 
Pugel with the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy said the executive branch should work with the General Assembly to “return to the lawfully set benefit levels in KTAP while also fully funding vital services for vulnerable children in foster care.” 
“When there are budget holes, the answer is not to raid flexible funds already being used to care for the poorest children in Kentucky, but to engage the General Assembly,” Pugel said. “These children are not in competition. They are among the Kentuckians who can least withstand the deeper hardship this decision brings.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Clean energy jobs continued to grow in Kentucky last year, though at a slower pace, according to an annual report focusing on the economic impact of such jobs. 
Kentucky ranked 28th in the country for clean energy employment with more than 40,000 jobs; it ranked 11th for “clean vehicle” jobs with more than 9,000.
The report published in September from E2 — which  describes itself as a nonpartisan organization advocating for “smart policies that are good for the economy and good for the environment” — analyzed federal data from 2024 finding that clean energy jobs across the country grew by 2.8%, outpacing the growth of the U.S. economy and adding nearly 100,000 jobs.
The annual report found Kentucky’s clean energy jobs grew  by 2.4% in 2024, a significantly slower pace than recent years when Kentucky was among the fastest in growth in clean energy jobs. The pace of clean energy job growth nationally was the slowest since 2020, the report said.
E2’s definition of clean energy jobs is broad, including employment connected to renewable energy generation, electricity storage and transmission upgrades, electric and hybrid vehicle manufacturing and energy efficiency upgrades. 
E2 stated that policy moves by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress this year are not reflected in federal employment data from 2024, but that the moves threaten “future growth and, increasingly, the health of the U.S. economy at-large.” 
The E2 report found Kentucky was among the top 10 states last year for growth in jobs connected to renewable energy generation, energy storage and modernizing the electricity grid. 
Renewable energy generation jobs in Kentucky grew by 6.1% with more than 2,200 of the state’s jobs in that category coming from solar energy. Jobs related to energy storage including utility-scale batteries and modernizing the electric grid in Kentucky grew by 11.1%. 
Congress accelerated the phase down of tax credits benefiting clean energy production and electric vehicles through the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in July, despite warnings from the renewable energy industry that hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost nationwide.
In a Wall Street Journal op-ed earlier this year, Republican Kentucky U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie said as the OBBBA was moving through Congress the legislation would end spending on “Green New Deal-style waste” and “reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.”
The federal $7,500 tax credit encouraging the purchase of electric vehicles ended at the end of September due to the passage of the OBBBA. Across the country, automakers are largely leaning into producing gas-powered vehicles under the Trump administration, though Ford Motor Co. announced in August it was converting a Louisville plant to manufacture electric trucks. 
BlueOval SK, an electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant that’s a joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and South Korea-based SK On, started production in August with more than 1,400 employees. The plant is one of two planned in Hardin County with Ford Motor Co., with Ford Motor Co. previously deciding to delay battery production at the second plant.

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Earlier this year, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston announced the city faced a $200 million budget deficit for 2026. To address the deficit, the mayor declared that there would be budget cuts and layoffs to make up for the lack of resources.
On Aug. 18, the first of these actions was felt with the layoff of 169 city workers, with most of the losses coming from the Office of Human Rights, Office of Child Services, and Department of Transportation and Infrastructure. Notably, the Department of Public Safety received zero layoffs despite consuming the vast majority of the city’s budget.
As if a slap in the face, mere weeks later the mayor announced that Denver police would receive a 15% raise over the next three years. By comparison, one of the most notable worker strikes this year saw waste management workers in Philadelphia refusing to collect garbage for several weeks as they held out for a cost of living raise. The workers were required to live in the city, but their wage wouldn’t allow for it. They won a 3% raise over the next three years. Denver police also received cost reimbursements for uniforms and other benefits, all in the wake of the largest layoffs Denver had experienced since 2011.

Johnston is not solely to blame for the budget difficulties Denver is experiencing — after all, the city’s problems reflect a number of mayoral administrations that have mis-prioritized and misspent our budget for decades, dating back to then-Mayor John Hickenlooper embracing the wave of development, urban renewal, and gentrification inspired by the 2002 book “The Rise of the Creative Class,” by Richard Florida. Under Hickenlooper, two of Denver’s most expensive development projects began: the Denver jail and the Convention Center hotel. This contrast and priority in investment would establish a direction that Denver continues in 2025: funding for jail and police for local residents and luxury, high-end experiences for visitors. 
While he’s not solely to blame for the budget crisis Denver faces, Johnston is largely responsible for it. Through a combination of high-cost development projects, rebranding of the downtown area, and niche ideas such as House1000, All In Mile High, Roads to Recovery, and the Office of Neighborhood Safety (all of which have failed to address core causes and solutions of our mental and behavioral health crises), city staff and residents are struggling to keep up with the mayor’s ideas — and struggling to pay for them. 
Johnston’s actions to address the budget crisis have met immediate and harsh criticism. Council member Stacie Gilmore was pointedly critical of the layoffs, with her husband being one of the 169 city workers who were dismissed. Upon the release of the proposed budget recently, City Clerk and Recorder Paul López called the mayor’s budget decisions “a threat to democracy” given the divestment of polling places and election judges. Denver Auditor Tim O’Brien also criticized Johnston’s proposed budget, warning the mayor to stop interfering with it.
Among the highest concerns from City Council were the planned funding cut to the Denver Support Team Assisted Response program, which almost reaches $1.5 million. The STAR program is already underfunded, responding to only 50% of the 911 calls that are eligible for it. As a representative of the STAR Community Advisory Committee, I believe that any divestment from STAR would result in direct harm to people in crisis. 
Launched in 2020, the Denver STAR program inspired hundreds of cities to explore similar programs and promised a more effective, appropriate response to certain 911 calls while saving the city money. But the city has never allowed the program to be fully implemented, blurring Denver’s various responses with redundant programs that involve a police response, such as the Street Enforcement Team, Homeless Outreach Team, and the failed Substance Use Navigators, which will be relaunched under Denver Department of Public Health and Environment. 
By contrast, the Albuquerque Community Safety Department, started the same year as STAR, has three times the budget of STAR. The Seattle CARE program is set to receive another $9.2 million. And other programs like Atlanta PAD and Durham HEART have received proper investment to succeed. All of these programs were represented along with other premier alternative response programs and national leaders in a letter to the mayor urging support for STAR. 
In 2020, there seemed to be a near-consensus that policing in the United States needed major reform and many cities conceded that new interventions in crisis response and public safety were needed outside of policing. Yet, the Johnston administration has doubled down in investing more into policing through the absence of cuts and layoffs to Public Safety in the midst of massive cuts everywhere else in the budget, increasing police pay, a $74 million line item in the Vibrant Denver bond for a new training facility, inundating 16th Street and downtown with security and police, and the allowance of the police policy of “Education-Based Development,” designed to circumvent existing disciplinary measures for officers. In short, these policies are reflections of a national environment fostering expansions of police, including executive orders from President Donald Trump to remove accountability, criminalize homelessness and mental health, and take over major cities with federal law enforcement and National Guard.
Meanwhile, longstanding businesses are shutting down due to widespread construction, roads are increasingly difficult to navigate due to constant road closures, and large investments in development projects are stripping Denver of desperately-needed funding in other areas. It’s now up to City Council to offer their priorities and proposals.
As it relates to STAR, City Council unanimously approved a proclamation earlier this year committing “to scaling this model in alignment with the program’s original vision.” But it’s clear that Denver cannot afford the decisions of this mayor — literally. And residents are paying for a city they may never get to see and enjoy.

The group has just four meetings left to come up with three possible school district maps for state lawmakers, and anxiety among members is mounting.

The school redistricting task force, now at its halfway mark, began its review of a draft map for the first time since launching in August. The group is tasked with proposing up to three possibilities to the Legislature by Dec. 1.
During the task force’s fourth meeting on Monday, Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, and Dave Wolk proposed a map of 14 school districts that nearly mirror the state’s 15 career and technical education regions, each identified by the technical education center that anchors it.
One of the hypothetical school districts would combine the boundaries of two service regions in northwest Vermont, those encompassing Cold Hollow Career Center in Enosburg and Northwest Career & Technical Center in St. Albans.
Wolk is Gov. Phil Scott’s appointee to the board. He is a former state senator and the longtime president of Castleton University. Beck works as a classroom teacher at St. Johnsbury Academy, a private school that operates a center for career and technical education.
Prepared with the help of Agency of Education officials, the proposal would create districts that “span a greater variety of communities” and that “eliminates artificial barriers to ensure that students have the same opportunities to succeed, regardless of where they live,” the proposal reads.
During the meeting, Beck called it a “rough-edged proposal,” telling fellow task force members that the goal was to put the proposal forward to jumpstart the process.
“There’s a whole bunch of different decision points, a whole bunch of different things to consider,” Beck said. “This is a first pass at what something like this might look like.”

‘Running out of time’
The school redistricting task force is confronting a gargantuan task under a tight timeline. The 11-member task force, made up of legislators, former superintendents and other experts, was created under Act 73 to craft new school district boundaries for Vermont’s public education system in time for next year’s legislative session, which starts in early January.
The goal is to create three map configurations to consolidate the state’s existing 119 school districts — currently contained within the 52 supervisory districts or supervisory unions — into anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts.
But with four meetings left, and a Dec. 1 deadline to submit those three maps to the Legislature, task force members on Monday said they were feeling the pressure.
“We’re running out of time to put out ideas,” said Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Windsor Orange-2, a member of the task force.
Much of the state’s public education system is feeling the anxiety as well. 
Jay Badams, a former superintendent and a task force member, cautioned the board that they “need to be super sensitive to the fact that we’re creating huge public anxiety around this.”
“And it’s because we’ve got this deadline,” he said. “We’re going to build this foundation in three more meetings, that we’re going to build a whole house on, and it’s going to serve the children of this state for decades? I’m sorry, I feel a lot of pressure to get it right.”
Rep. Edye Graning, the co-chair of the task force, addressed the “frustration and concern that is bubbling up in every single community across the state” as education leaders wait on the task force’s work.

“I really want to reassure the public and reassure everyone here that we are working really hard to get up to three maps that will work for the state,” she said. “It takes time, it takes a lot of effort, and the work that we do, we hope the Legislature will take very seriously and use in its work over the next session.”
‘Elephant in the room’
Task force members appeared sympathetic to using career and technical education regions as the organizing principle behind at least one of their map proposals, though many questions remain unanswered.
The proposal was “still very much in its early stages,” Toren Ballard, the communications and policy director with the Agency of Education, said at the meeting.
For one, that map, as presented, would be lopsided, with the Burlington Technical Center and the Center for Technology in Essex representing one district with more than 22,000 students.
The second largest district, home to the Stafford Technical Center in Rutland City, would have more than 7,000 students. Nine districts, Stafford included, would have between 4,000 and 8,000 students, as suggested in Act 73’s language. Five districts would fall below the 4,000 threshold, with the lowest student count in a district anchored by Bradford’s River Bend Career and Technical Center, with just over 2,000 students.
Another unanswered question — the “elephant in the room,” as task force member Jennifer Botzojorns put it — was the question of how these hypothetical districts would be governed. Specifically, which district governance model would be used, supervisory districts or supervisory unions. 
Supervisory unions and supervisory districts both provide back office functions such as accounting and payroll and may oversee the provision of special education services and curriculum coordination. But the two systems differ in their structure: supervisory unions are made up of school districts that each have their own board of directors, while supervisory districts have only one governing board.
“I think that that needs to be encapsulated in our drawing of maps and moving forward,” Botzojorns, a retired superintendent for the Kingdom East School District, said.
In addition to continuing work on the career and technical education draft map, task force members on Monday agreed to propose a map at a future meeting that centered on existing county boundaries, and another that centers on establishing comprehensive, regional high schools.
Sen. Martine Gulick, D-Chittenden Central, a co-chair of the task force, said whatever plan they put forward for regional high schools “has to include some kind of construction aid.”
“It has to look that idea and that problem in the face,” she said. “We cannot ignore it anymore.”
Task force members also agreed to work on a map organized around regional BOCES, or a Board of Cooperative Educational Services, a type of educational governance entity used to help school districts collaborate on services such as special education and transportation.
The Mountain Views Supervisory Union in August became the first public school governing body in Vermont to adopt such a structure. Sherry Sousa, the superintendent of the supervisory union, gave a presentation to the task force about the structure on Monday.
More maps will likely be proposed at the task force’s next meeting on Oct. 10. Graning, the co-chair, cautioned members that “there will be many details that we can’t figure out in the next four meetings.”
“But we’re not creating the law,” she said, “we’re creating a map.”

(Photo courtesy of the Smithsonian)One of Virginia’s crown jewels of tourist attractions, the Discovery Space Shuttle, could be blasting off somewhere else as U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine seek to prevent the move from its home in Virginia to Texas. 
The effort to relocate the space shuttle comes as support has increased for moving it to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, which is considered central to the United States’ human spaceflight program. Republican U.S. Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, both from Texas, are pushing the relocation effort. The ship has been at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum in Chantilly since 2012.
Last week, the senators wrote a letter to Senate appropriators, hoping to block federal funding included in the Big Beautiful Bill Act for relocating the shuttle, arguing that it would waste taxpayer dollars, put it at risk of damage and diminish public access. 
The Smithsonian estimated that transporting Discovery could cost more than $50 million, with another $325 million needed for planning, exhibit reconstruction and new facilities, the letter states, exceeding the $85 million appropriated in the Act.
“From a public access standpoint, the Udvar-Hazy Center, located in the Washington, D.C. region, offers free public admission and draws millions of visitors annually, including students, veterans, and international tourists,” Kaine and Warner wrote. “The Smithsonian provides Discovery with professional stewardship and global visibility. The Smithsonian is unique among museums for providing visitors with access to a national treasure meant to inspire the American public without placing economic barriers.”
The center has become one of the top 20 most-visited museums in North America, garnering more than a million visitors per year, according to the Smithsonian. 
Between 1984 and 2012, Discovery orbited the Earth almost 150 million miles more than its two predecessors, flying 39 missions. The ship, named for renowned sailing ships of exploration, was transferred to the Smithsonian by NASA in April 2012.

Recently, the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum announced plans to expand the center in Northern Virginia, following the last major construction project in 2003. The project will enable the Smithsonian to showcase more artifacts and new acquisitions, likely enhancing the shuttle and the center’s offerings. 
Construction is expected to be finished by the end of 2028.
In an August interview, Cornyn said the then-NASA Administrator and former Discovery astronaut Charles Bolden Jr. gave Houston “short shrift” when it came to considering the city as one of the homes for four retiring shuttles in 2010. Bolden assigned the remaining three shuttles to California, Florida and New York.
However, Cornyn believed the Johnson Space Center is “a natural place” for the ship to be located, as it is the home of human spaceflight. 
As part of the process to have Houston reconsidered, the Act required the current administrator to make a new determination, which favored Houston. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, nominated by President Donald Trump, is serving as the acting administrator. 
Cornyn said he hopes that when current and future generations see the shuttle, they will find inspiration in subjects related to the space industry.
“Seeing this firsthand and understanding its significance will hopefully make a very positive influence on them and their life, and it would be great for tourism and the economy,” Cornyn said. 
In a statement to the Mercury, the Smithsonian said it owns the Discovery and holds it, along with all its collections, in trust for the nation.
“The Smithsonian has a unique responsibility to properly manage, preserve, and make accessible the collections in its care for current and future generations to appreciate, enjoy, and study,” the research institute stated. “The Smithsonian carries out its stewardship responsibilities through systematic collections management policies, procedures, and plans based on professional and discipline-specific best practices. The Smithsonian will carefully evaluate any request to move Discovery in light of these obligations.”

This crushing reality has defined my life for the past two years and, unfortunately, other Virginians may be experiencing the same thing. 
Health insurers rely on a mechanism called prior authorization when reviewing claims. While companies claim this process reduces wasteful spending and unnecessary procedures, prior authorization has devolved into a profit-driven tool that too often puts necessary medical care out of reach. The numbers tell the story: care denials increased an average of 20.2% for commercial claims between 2022 and 2023 alone. Some corporate insurers are now misusing AI and automated processing to categorically deny patients’ claims.
Unfortunately, my experience with prior authorization from insurance companies is not unique. Here in the commonwealth and across the country, countless people face care delays and coverage denials that raise costs for patients and hospitals, putting lives at risk while boosting profits for corporate insurers. If lawmakers do not hold corporate insurance companies accountable for stripping patients of vital care, we all will continue to suffer the consequences. 
Two years ago, my world looked entirely different. I was launching my legal career and living life like any other woman in her 20s. Then, in 2023, I was diagnosed with immune-mediated small fiber neuropathy, a condition that subjects my body to relentless, burning-like pain, as though my body were on fire. Every aspect of daily life became a struggle, turning simple tasks into ordeals and basic, everyday movements into agony. 
To treat this debilitating condition, my specialists recommended intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions, hoping to provide relief from my near-constant suffering. While they acknowledged that patients don’t always respond to IVIG, they believed it was worth trying, despite the steep price tag of over $10,000 for a single infusion every four weeks until my disease was in remission.
Before the infusions, I lived with constant pain levels hovering around seven out of 10. When I finally received IVIG, it transformed my life, dropping my pain most days to between two and three. This was the first time in roughly two years I had experienced such relief. After two years of suffering, I had found what I desperately needed. I was living proof that this treatment was medically necessary for my condition.
However, my insurance company saw things differently. They repeatedly denied coverage, claiming the treatment wasn’t “medically necessary” despite my doctors emphatically insisting otherwise. The Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Insurance, the state agency responsible for resolving prior authorization disputes, upheld every denial with troubling deference to the insurer’s position.
Rather than independently evaluating the medical evidence, regulators seemed to simply rubber-stamp the insurer’s definition of medical necessity. Even during peer-to-peer reviews where my doctors spoke directly with insurance representatives, my insurance company was still unwilling to discuss the merits of IVIG. During one peer-to-peer review, a representative insisted on reading the denial letter, refusing to do anything else other than repeating the letter my doctor and I had already received.
Hoping to strengthen my case with insurers, my doctor and I agreed to do a trial run of IVIG, where I would access treatment by paying out-of-pocket. Meanwhile, if my treatment proved helpful enough, my doctor would once again attempt to get insurance to cover IVIG, this time by citing my reduced level of pain.
The financial reality was crushing. Without insurance coverage, each treatment costs over $10,000 — an astronomical sum to pay repeatedly, especially when I’m already spending more than $600 monthly in insurance premiums. To help cover these costs, my parents have been draining their retirement savings. The financial sacrifice of my family, combined with the repeated denials, took a profound psychological toll. I began to see myself as a burden on everyone and everything around me. These situations strip patients of more than just medical care; they rob us of hope, dignity and autonomy.
My experience reflects a systemic failure embedded deep within America’s corporate insurance industry. The system creates a bureaucratic maze of endless forms, appeals and peer-to-peer reviews designed to discourage patients from fighting back, and it works. 
On average, only one in every 500 prior authorization denials is even disputed and nearly 90% of physicians report personally witnessing insurance company policies negatively affect their patients’ clinical outcomes. I wasn’t denied because my treatment was ineffective or inappropriate – I was denied because a third party presumed to know better than my doctors.
My story echoes that of thousands of patients across America. The number of cases where doctors’ medical judgments are overruled by algorithms continues to climb. Mass coverage denials and delays don’t just drive up costs for patients and hospitals; they also put lives at risk while padding the pockets of corporate insurance companies. 
Recent months have generated public outrage over prior authorization delays and denials, placing corporate insurers under greater scrutiny. The health insurance industry has promised reform, but I remain skeptical. Even if these promises materialize, I question whether change will come quickly enough for patients like me who endure constant pain or for those in need of immediate lifesaving treatments. 
Our stories demand immediate reform at both the state and federal levels. Regulators must stop blindly deferring to insurers’ narrow definitions of medical necessity. No one should be forced to choose between unbearable pain and depleting their parents’ retirement savings. I’m speaking up not just for myself, but for every patient who’s been told to wait, suffer, or simply give up.
The system is broken, and we are paying the price: in pain, in hope and in dollars we don’t have. It’s time for that to change. Policymakers, at the state and federal level, need to scrutinize insurer practices and regulate them to ensure Americans get the care they need.

RICHMOND, Va. — The upcoming Virginia gubernatorial election will make history, with the state’s first female governor poised to take office in January, but it is not generating as much money as some past races.
Republican nominee and current Lt. Gov Winsome Earle-Sears and Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger are making their final pushes to voters before they fill out their ballots.
Even with the historic implications, total fundraising for this gubernatorial race is substantially down from other recent elections, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.
(Graphic courtesy Virginia Public Access Project)
 Why the fundraising decrease?

Political Action Committees, or PACs, are tagged as the industry that gives the most money in Virginia statewide races. As of Sept. 29, just over $16 million has been donated from PACs on both sides of the aisle, a notable decrease from the $40.5 million donated in 2021 and the $36 million donated in 2017, although money is still coming in, according to VPAP.
This year’s numbers are lower than recent elections, but it doesn’t necessarily mean the election is not drawing interest, according to Richard Meagher, professor of political science at Randolph-Macon College.
“Sometimes it’s an outlier, like in 2021 you have a very, very wealthy individual, Glenn Youngkin, running against a very, very well-connected fundraiser, Terry McAuliffe,” Meagher said.
Because the last election raised such high financial numbers, it may be skewing ideas of what to raise in future elections, according to Meagher.
Outsider Funding
Both nominees have garnered a substantial amount of funding from individual donations outside of Virginia, according to VPAP. Spanberger has seen nearly 42% of her individual donations come from out-of-state contributors, while Earle-Sears has received 36% from such donors..
“That’s more and more the trend,” Meagher said. “Being a Democrat in Virginia matters much more to national Democrats than it used to.”
Virginia is 1 of 4 states in the country that hold odd-year elections outside the year of a national election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
This draws participation from both political parties nationally, as they may not want to wait until their next election to try and make a difference, according to Meagher.
 Miscellaneous groups provide major cash infusions

The second highest industry to donate to statewide candidates are labeled miscellaneous groups, according to VPAP. They have donated $14 million toward both political parties as of Sept. 29.
Within this industry, retirees top the charts in total money donated, with in and out-of-state donors. In a close second, nonwage earners have contributed several million dollars to nominees in this race.
Donors within this category do not list their occupations or backgrounds, so it cannot be determined what industry they would align to, according to a VPAP representative. Thus, they are listed as nonwage earners.
 Advocacy groups

Single issue groups claim the No. 3 spot for statewide candidate donations.
Donations tagged environmental groups lead at $3.6 million, with most coming from nonprofit Clean Virginia, which now competes against Dominion Energy with political donations.
Miscellaneous single issue groups such as veteran groups are in the second top donors under this category, followed by abortion rights and gun control.
  Real estate, gaming industries contributing more 

Real estate is the No. 4 top by industry, with $5.8 donated so far.
Developers lead the fundraising charge within the real estate industry, with over $2.1 million donated, according to VPAP. Several of the top donations are to Republican candidates.
“Real estate developers always donate money,” Meagher said. “They’re always a kind of powerful interest. Sometimes they focus more on local constituencies … they might work in local elections because they think they can get something out of it.”
Also paying into the political pot now is gaming, notably sports betting. Gaming has only been legal for a handful of years in Virginia, but it has been a large player within the state’s economy. The state has made nearly $2 billion in revenue from sports betting within the state since the first legalized bets were accepted in January 2021, according to numbers from the Virginia Lottery.
The rise of the gaming lobby in Virginia is a result of new casinos and legalization of online sports betting.
“That’s why you’re seeing more and more money being thrown around,” Meagher said.
 Grassroots fundraising a ‘good sign’

Since Virginia’s last gubernatorial election, Spanberger has received a higher amount of cash contributions of $100 or less and from a greater number of donors than her opponent, Earle-Sears, according to VPAP.
“If you’re looking at the strength of a candidate, you don’t want to just look at their dollar amount totals, you want to look at the number of contributions they get,” Meagher said.
This number heavily favors Spanberger, which suggests support for her campaign is deep, and is more of a grassroots effort than Earle-Sears.
“I think one of the reasons that people are really bullish on the Democrats’ chances this year is it’s not just that the money is coming in from big money donors in the national Democratic groups, it’s that the money is coming in from individuals,” Meagher said. “People are fired up to give their $20, their $10, their $50 to Spanberger.”
 Money isn’t everything

Even though the financials seem to heavily favor Spanberger, this does not mean she is guaranteed to win. All polls have Spanberger ahead of her opponent, but there is no victor until all the ballots are officially counted.
“Just because you have more people than the other side who are going to cut you checks doesn’t mean that those people are all going to vote, or that they translate into the same amount of votes,” Meagher said.
Early in-person voting is open until Nov. 1. Election Day is Nov. 4, with polls open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.

Eleven other counties have low access to care, according to the March of Dimes' latest report. (Stock photo by John Fedele/Getty Images)“You always need to be thinking about how to protect yourself; you never know what you might be accused of.”
This was a piece of advice given to me by the OB-GYN physician I was working with as an aspiring medical student.
After leaving the ultrasound room of a patient who was just informed that her pregnancy was no longer viable, I was learning the hard truth about what it meant to be an OB-GYN in South Carolina.
When medical care after a miscarriage can so closely mirror medical care during an abortion, and laws are written by individuals with no medical training, physicians are left in fear of being criminalized for providing medically necessary care.
This fear and hesitation leads to subpar care and worse outcomes for patients in South Carolina. As a born-and-raised South Carolinian about to begin my medical education, it was then that I realized I would have to leave the state.
Restrictive abortion bills such as S.323, which will be heard Wednesday by a Senate Medical Affairs subcommittee, are harrowing to medical students and physicians in training.
With no exceptions for rape, incest, or fatal fetal anomaly, it is one of the most restrictive abortion bans ever introduced.
The bill even criminalizes providing information about how to receive an abortion.
Medical providers who perform abortions outside of life-threatening circumstances face loss of licensure and prison sentences of up to 30 years.
Current South Carolina abortion law, which is already one of the most restrictive in the country, defines an exempted medical emergency as a “condition which, on the basis of the physician’s good faith judgment, so complicates a pregnancy as to necessitate an immediate abortion to avert the risk of her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of major bodily function.”
When physicians may have to prove to a court of law that their pregnant patients were at serious risk of injury or death, complications which could have been averted are forced to progress. Uncertainty and hesitation when making life-or-death decisions directly harms patients facing emergency situations.
For many providers, this risk is too great to take on.
More than 45% of physicians who completed residency training in South Carolina from 2014 to 2023 left the state to practice. That’s a higher proportion than the nationwide average, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges’ 2024 Report on Residents.
Since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson decision, studies indicate a pattern of doctors and trainees leaving states with restrictive laws or deciding not to train there at all.
With fewer health care providers left behind, shortages are felt most acutely in small, rural communities.
South Carolina consistently falls below the national OB-GYN physicians per capita, and the shortages are projected only to worsen as the population ages and demand increases.
Within the state, six counties already have no obstetric providers and no hospitals or birthing centers providing obstetric care, according to the March of Dimes’ 2024 report.
S.323 threatens to turn these shortages into a full-blown crisis for anyone who needs prenatal care, emergency treatment, or routine gynecologic services.
Lawmakers who insist they are protecting life need to grapple with the reality that these policies are pushing critical providers and students outside of South Carolina.
If the goal is healthier mothers and babies, we cannot afford to drive away the health providers who can make that goal possible.
I have lived in South Carolina for my entire life. I attended high school, completed my undergraduate degree, and am working towards earning my medical degree in South Carolina with plans for a career in primary care.
Before the current abortion law passed in 2023, I was dedicated to remaining in my home state to practice, hoping to do my part to improve the state’s physician shortage.
However, lawmakers are pushing me and many other future physicians away. South Carolina needs to consider whether or not the health of the state is truly a priority.

In addition to Derry, the provider has locations in Concord, Bedford, Dover, Londonderry, Raymond, and Windham. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)This past summer, one of Dr. Amy Boutwell’s patients needed an imaging test done, but Lahey Hospital and Medical Center, which is down the road from her practice in the Boston suburb of Lexington, Massachusetts, told her it would be a five-month wait.
“And I said, ‘Gosh, there’s got to be a better way,’” Boutwell said. “The question that came to my mind was, ‘Isn’t there some sort of independent imaging center where I don’t have to send her through the big, expensive, and busy health care system?’”
Her search turned up nothing nearby in Massachusetts. But located 30 miles north, just over the state line in Nashua, she found Tellica Imaging. She learned the newly opened independent imaging center could take her patient the next day and at a much lower cost. It worked out so well, she began sending more patients there. Boutwell’s status as an independent doctor made it possible. Doctors working in big health systems, she said, typically send patients to the imaging facilities within their own system.
“We live in Metro Boston. We’re used to using large health care systems,” Boutwell said. “This patient might have said, ‘I know and trust the health care infrastructure of Massachusetts,’ but instead, I think it’s really telling in this day and age, patients want access. They want transparency around pricing. They want easy and convenient. Of course, we need to know that the quality is going to be high and trustworthy. But for me as a doctor, and for my patient, in this case, we both were really compelled by, ‘It’s quick and it’s easy and it’s inexpensive,’ so let’s go to New Hampshire.”
For the longest time, Boutwell was perplexed as to why she couldn’t find centers like Tellica closer to her.
“I just thought, how’s it possible here in the medical mecca of the world, I don’t have an independent imaging center?” Boutwell said. “And I didn’t really know why.”
Many point to a primary culprit: “certificate of need” laws, which require health care providers to seek permission from state regulators for any new services they’d like to provide. 
Under the laws, providers must prove to regulators that any new proposed services are necessary. Certificate of need laws also allow would-be competitors to weigh in and contest applications by arguing they already offer the service and, as such, a new provider is unnecessary. 
The laws have been in place in some states since the 1960s, but the 1974 National Health Planning and Resources Development Act mandated every state institute them. Proponents believed the laws would restrain health care costs, increase quality, and provide better access to care for traditionally underserved communities. However, many experts in the field argue they’ve done the opposite. Congress repealed its federal certificate of need mandate in 1986, but 35 states, including Massachusetts, still have the laws on the books, according to the National Academy for State Health Policy. The laws vary based on what types of care are subject to the laws and how the process works.
New Hampshire is the only New England state without certificate of need laws. 
Dr. Jeffrey Gold, a direct primary care physician in Salem, Massachusetts, is another Bay State doctor who sends patients to independent New Hampshire imaging centers. He said Derry Imaging, which is roughly 45 miles away from his practice, might charge around $700 for an MRI. However, Gold said that at one of the large health systems in Massachusetts, such as Mass General Brigham, “you’re shooting a dart in the wind.” He said a patient won’t know exactly what they’re being charged until after the x-ray is complete. In some cases, Gold said, once insurance and the health system finish negotiating the patient could be asked to pay roughly $1,500 (while insurance pays another $1,500).
Gold provides a unique type of care called direct primary care, where patients pay a monthly fee out-of-pocket for unlimited access to his services. He said this allows him more time with patients and to consider patients’ costs, among other things. He often advises patients to go to independent imaging centers in New Hampshire, even if their insurance won’t cover it, because paying Derry Imaging out-of-pocket is often cheaper for patients with high-deductible insurance policies. Though he notes he can sometimes get good prices at private orthopedic centers for some services, those facilities are increasingly being purchased by larger health systems.
In Massachusetts, Gold argues certificate of need laws have constrained the free market because when big health systems like Lahey and Mass General already offer imaging, it makes it harder for smaller providers to prove their services are needed. However, New Hampshire repealed its certificate of need laws in 2016 and so this phenomena hasn’t occurred here.
Indeed, analysis from the Mercatus Center, a think tank based at George Mason University, estimated in 2020 that Massachusetts nonhospital providers would’ve likely performed 80,388 MRIs annually if the state had no certificate of need laws as opposed to the 58,960 it did perform. The organization also estimated that without certificate of need laws, nonhospital providers would’ve performed 758 PET scans as opposed to 420. The researchers found no statistically significant change for hospital providers, suggesting the laws could be protecting hospitals from competition. The analysis estimated that, across all services subject to certificate of need laws, annual health care spending would’ve fallen $320 per capita without the laws.
“Neither theory nor evidence suggest that CON (certificate of need) laws work as advertised,” researcher Matthew Mitchell wrote in a 2024 report in the academic journal Inquiry. “While advocates for the regulation have offered several rationales for its continuance, the balance of evidence suggests that the rules protect incumbent providers from competition at the expense of patients, payors, and would-be competitors.”
In New England, this has created an interesting dynamic. Patients in southern New Hampshire often travel to the Boston area for treatment at larger hospitals. However, as costs and wait times rise in Massachusetts, doctors say it makes sense to go the opposite direction for certain services. Boutwell said the “cost of care in Massachusetts and access to care in Massachusetts is at an all time high and an all time low.”
“This is not a story of people who can’t afford care going to New Hampshire,” she said. “With the classic cycle of people from the north coming into Boston, you might think, ‘Well, maybe people who are price sensitive will be people who don’t have access, you know, people who don’t have the money.’ But in this case, we’ve got all the benefits of who we are, and we’re making an educated choice to say, ‘You know what? Let’s go to New Hampshire.’”

(Photo by Steven Senne/The Associated Press)One morning earlier this year, as Deb Capistrano came on duty for her shift as a nurse in her hospital’s stroke unit, her colleagues from the night shift warned her that one of her patients for the day was a man who’d been threatening to harm them.
Capistrano has been a registered nurse for 17 years. Threats of violence aren’t new to her. Across the nation, hospitals have become some of the most violent workplaces in America, where health care workers experience workplace violence at triple the rate of all other private industries combined, federal statistics show.
For Capistrano, the worry that she could be hurt while doing her job is always in the back of her mind.
But in California, where she works, robust state law requires hospitals to create detailed violence prevention plans specific to the needs of each hospital unit, with input from frontline workers like nurses.
When Capistrano arrived on duty, nursing management already had a plan to keep her safe. For example, every time Capistrano entered the patient’s room she had an escort, and hospital security did their rounds more frequently on her unit.
“In that moment, I felt really safe,” she told Stateline. “There were a lot of different things in place that day to prevent any harm. I think that’s largely due to having that law in place.”
Health care workers such as Capistrano make up just 10% of the American workforce but experience 48% of the nonfatal injuries from workplace violence, according to federal data.
And the threat is increasing. The number of health care providers who reported harassment at work from patients, patients’ families and colleagues more than doubled between 2018 and 2022, according to the latest data available from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Research has found workplace violence in health care is increasingly common due to a number of factors. Some are organizational: not enough staffing, long patient wait times or lack of appropriate security. Patients’ expectations about how fast or easy it should be to access care appear to have increased in recent years, as the costs of health care have gone up.
Researchers have also found that public attitudes are being shaped by politicians who might promote or undermine health services for political gain, particularly relating to contentious topics such as vaccination, masking or abortion.
With threats against nurses, physicians and other staff on the rise, state lawmakers and hospital officials are scrambling to put stronger protections in place. Those include increased criminal penalties, armed security guards and violence prevention plans.
This year, Ohio, Oregon and Washington enacted laws designed to curb workplace violence in health care spaces by requiring employers to create and carry out detailed violence prevention plans. Such plans can include risk assessments specific to each hospital unit, staff training on de-escalation techniques, increased security and a clear policy for reporting incidents.
Dozens of states — including California, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine and Texas — have enacted laws aimed at curbing violence in hospitals and clinics, the vast majority of them in the past decade. Legislators in other states, including Alaska, Massachusetts, New York and Wyoming, introduced similar legislation in their most recent sessions.
Prevention and punishment
A few years ago, during a shift in the emergency department at a hospital in Maine, nurse Meg Sinclair was tending to an older patient who became increasingly agitated. The patient grabbed both sides of her stethoscope and tried to strangle her.

Sinclair, who now works at Maine Medical Center in Portland, has been a nurse for 11 years. She’s spent most of that time in hospital emergency departments, where the potential for chaos never feels far away. A fellow nurse recently told her about getting her nose broken by a patient.
“It’s kind of crazy because nurses unfortunately normalize these horrific things that happen to them,” Sinclair told Stateline.
“You’re feeling scared in an environment where you shouldn’t have to, in your workplace where you’re trying to help people.”
In Maine, a 2023 law toughened the punishment for assaults that occur in a hospital emergency department.
To Sinclair, the law felt performative. She believes adding harsher penalties doesn’t do much to prevent assault from happening in the first place.
“It’s just not effective because it’s reactionary,” she said. “It’s frustrating, because the last thing I’d want to do is blame the patients. They’re often sick and scared, and not in their right mind.”
But proponents of such laws have said they’re needed to help law enforcement hold offenders accountable. Other states, such as Georgia, also have increased criminal penalties for assaults on nurses and other health care workers.











You’re feeling scared in an environment where you shouldn’t have to, in your workplace where you’re trying to help people.


– Meg Sinclair, an emergency nurse in Portland, Maine



Maine Democratic state Rep. Holly Stover introduced a bill this year to extend her state’s harsher penalties to assaults on all health care workers, not just those working in the ER. She told Stateline that the penalties would only apply to people deemed competent to face such charges, not those unable to understand the consequences of their actions.
Her bill passed the House but was indefinitely postponed in the Senate in June. While Stover will leave office next year due to term limits, she hopes another lawmaker will reintroduce the bill.
“I’ve seen workers who have had broken cheekbones, broken noses, broken jaws,” said Stover, who has worked in health care and social services, and serves as a trustee for her local hospital.
“Any legislation that can better address the prevalence and potential for violence in health care settings is going to be critically important.”
Other states have focused on stepping up hospital security. A 2023 North Carolina law, for example, requires hospitals with emergency departments to have a law enforcement officer — not just unarmed security guards — on campus at all times.
But many hospitals have already gone down that road.
Hospital police forces
In September, WellSpan Health, a nine-hospital system in southern Pennsylvania, announced it would create its own private police force, adding armed officers to supplement its unarmed security team. The system will also be increasing its weapons detection equipment at hospital entrances.

WellSpan is in the same region of Pennsylvania where, in February, a gunman entered the intensive care unit at UPMC Memorial Hospital and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police. The shootout left one officer dead, and it wounded a doctor, a nurse, a hospital custodian and two other officers.
A growing number of hospitals are launching their own police forces, said Tony Pope, the chief of police and emergency preparedness at Columbus Regional Health in Columbus, Indiana, south of Indianapolis.
At least 29 states allow hospitals to create their own police forces, with officers who can carry firearms and make arrests, according to the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety, a professional association for safety and security directors at health care facilities. Pope, who is president-elect of the association, said the levels of authority and jurisdiction for such officers can vary from state to state, but they’re able to carry firearms and make arrests.
At Indiana’s state police academy, health care is the fastest-growing contingent of police officers in the state, Pope said.
High-profile incidents nationwide have prompted more health systems to beef up their security. In 2023, a man opened fire in the waiting room of an Atlanta medical practice, leaving one woman dead and four others wounded. A few months later, a visitor at an Oregon hospital opened fire and killed a security guard, and a doctor was shot and injured at a Dallas-area medical center. The year before, a man killed his surgeon, another doctor, a receptionist and a visitor at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office.
Workplace violence cost hospitals an estimated $18 billion in 2023 alone, according to a recent report from the American Hospital Association.
Pope said his force in Columbus has seen a 56% reduction in violent incidents since 2023.
And police forces aren’t just for the big systems anymore. Smaller hospitals, too, are testing the waters. In July, the 25-bed Perry County Memorial Hospital in southern Indiana announced it would begin hiring officers for its new police force this fall.
Scrubs and security
Sinclair often talks with other nurses about their workplace needs as a member of her local nurses union. She believes the best action state legislators could take to combat violence in health care is to require hospitals and other clinics to maintain certain nurse-to-patient ratios and penalize employers that exceed them.
When hospitals buy physician practices, prices go up

“When we’re short-staffed and someone’s begging for help and you can’t get to them because you’re running between eight different rooms putting out fire after fire, then you get the verbal assault, the hair pulling,” said Sinclair, who said she’s experienced all of those things.
“You have to meet people’s needs or else they resort to things they otherwise wouldn’t do.”
Nursing groups have for years requested nurse-to-patient ratios. Only a handful of states, including California, have passed such laws.
Hospital systems and other employers argue ratios don’t give them needed flexibility in hiring, and could threaten the financial safety of some institutions that might be forced to close units if they can’t meet the ratios.
Pope said that in his experience, hospitals and other health employers likely need several different laws and policies in place, from prevention plans to added security measures.
“When it comes to addressing workplace violence, it really is important for health care facilities and systems to have that multipronged approach,” he said.

(Photo by Susan Tebben/Ohio Capital Journal)Ohio Statehouse lawmakers missed their first deadline for congressional redistricting, with Republican lawmakers defending the move to kick the process over to the Ohio Redistricting Commission without them ever introducing or negotiating on a map.
The constitutional amendment passed by Ohio voters in 2018 required lawmakers to negotiate in good faith and attempt to pass a bipartisan map by Sept. 30 before the process went to the redistricting commission.
The Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting met Tuesday in the House Finance Committee room for their second meeting of the month, on the day of the first deadline mentioned in the Ohio Constitution for passing a bipartisan map.
The committee began with Senate Leader Nickie Antonio supporting the Democratic map proposal, which is still the only map that has been formally introduced by either side of the General Assembly.
The congressional map proposed by Ohio legislative Democrats at a Tuesday press conference.
The Democratic map presents a breakdown of eight Republican-leaning districts and seven Democratic-leaning districts in the congressional delegation, which they say came from taking an average of the last decade of voting results.
That average means a state ratio of 56% Republican to 43% Democrats.
The current map has 10 Republican districts and five Democratic, for 66% Republican control.
Republican lawmakers during the meeting argued that an average of the last decade of voting trends is not required by the constitution for congressional redistricting.
Amid Antonio’s testimony and questions from legislators, it was once again made clear that the process would be continuing into October and a vote would not be held on the Democratic map.
“I’m pragmatic enough to know … that (lawmakers passing a map with bipartisan support) is not only unlikely but impossible,” Antonio said. “We do not have a session today.”
“If needed” sessions that had been scheduled for both the Ohio House and Ohio Senate were cancelled before the Tuesday meeting, indicating the committee wouldn’t be holding a vote on a map.
State Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, claimed Antonio’s mention of the Sept. 30 deadline omitted the clauses of the Ohio Constitution that come after it.
“Can we just basically agree there are two options here in the constitution, and not passing a map by Sept. 30 is in no way a violation of any deadline, correct?” Stewart asked.
Antonio countered, saying the people “really wanted us, in this first step, to take the opportunity to work together in a bipartisan way.”
According to the constitution, if a bipartisan map isn’t adopted by the end of September, the process moves to the Ohio Redistricting Commission with an Oct. 31 deadline.
If no bipartisan map comes out of the commission, the decision-making returns to the General Assembly.
The map can be passed without bipartisan support at that point with a simple majority vote by Nov. 30.
At last week’s committee meeting, committee co-chair Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, agreed that while the September deadline is in the constitution, though he said the existence of the other deadlines opens up opportunities for passage “in the next couple of months.”
“I know that everybody wanted something done by today,” Bird claimed, “but we’ve still got a couple of months and we’ve still got time to keep talking.”
Co-chair state Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Twp., also maintained an argument she made in the last meeting, that though the Democratic lawmakers are seeking a “fair map,” fairness is not a word used in the constitutional process of redistricting.
“The word ‘fairness’ is not in the constitution (with regard to redistricting), right?” Timken asked, eliciting laughter around the committee room.
Antonio said it’s difficult to talk about representation in drawing districts without taking fairness into account.
“Fairness was a part of the will of the people, and so through that lens, we used a fair measurement to be able to see how the people are voting, especially in national elections,” Antonio said.
Ohioans who spoke in support of the Democratic proposal noted the lack of opposition testimony to the Democratic map and once again accused the committee of a lack of transparency.
Math teacher and Columbus resident Tom Reardon counted the more than 140 testimonies submitted at the last meeting.
“What percentage of the testimonies were for gerrymandering, which is being done right now in our state? The answer is zero,” Reardon told the committee. “No one came and supported what you’ve been talking about.”
There was one person who came to Tuesday’s meeting who didn’t support the Democratic map.
Paul Miller was active in the last round of congressional redistricting, presenting his own proposal and accusing “liberal activists” of messing with the process.
His testimony submitted on Tuesday continued that message, with him claiming “Democrat activists were being entirely disingenuous.”
“In any case, the real issue persists with the present incarnation of their plan to flip Republican seats in the fact that they’re doing it at all,” Miller told the committee in his written testimony. “Instead of pitting Republicans against each other in primaries, now they just want to take them out right before the actual elections.”
Columbus resident Pari Sabety said the hour-long discussion that had already happened before she spoke hadn’t changed her mind about how the process was going.
“There’s no transparency here,” Sabety said. “Let’s be clear, you hold the reigns in this process, you are the supermajority and you have managed to rig this process to suit your end goal.”
 No negotiations
On claims from Republican lawmakers that Democrats are trying gerrymander through their proposal, Antonio referenced comments from Assistant Minority Whip Rep. Desiree Tims, D-Dayton, at last week’s meeting.
“The minority does not hold any legislative power or majority, let alone the ability to gerrymander,” Antonio said.
Republican committee members also pointed to comments they said indicated the Democrats wouldn’t agree to a map that was less than 8-7.
“The Democrats said ‘8-7, take it or leave it,’ firm offer,” claimed state Rep. D.J. Swearingen, R-Huron. “So what are Republicans supposed to do … after we hear something like that?”
Antonio denied having said “take it or leave it,” and said she was “saddened that I didn’t communicate as well as I thought I did … that we were open for discussion.”
“I am always, and have been from the beginning, open to discussion,” Antonio said.
In fact, Antonio said, she reached out to Republican leadership before the process began to ask about a plan.
“I did knock on the door, quietly, respectfully, individually,” Antonio said. “…I got a response that was ‘It’s coming, there’s something coming.’”
Bird and Timken told reporters after the meeting adjourned that with no action that they don’t know of any discussions by their respective Republican caucuses about the drawing of a map.
“There’s not a map that I know of,” Bird said.
Timken said the caucuses plan to follow the process “through to the end of November.”
This indicates Republican lawmakers expect no bipartisan agreement from the Ohio Redistricting Commission before Oct. 31.
Bird was unmoved to see only one opponent of the Democratic maps come to the two meetings, pointing to a push from the Democratic Party to bring in supporters.
“I think we’ve all seen there’s been many calls and social media from the Democratic Party to have people come and testify,” Bird told reporters. “You’ve not heard that from the Republican Party. I don’t know that that’s good or bad, but we’ve heard a lot of testimony and, like you said, mostly one-sided.”
Now that the first legislative deadline has passed, the Ohio Redistricting Commission will need to be reactivated by Gov. Mike DeWine.
The governor is required to also serve on the commission, along with the state auditor and secretary of state. The General Assembly will be represented with two Republican legislators and two Democratic legislators.
Whenever the map is adopted along the way, if a court challenge is presented to it, the Ohio Supreme Court will have jurisdiction over lawsuits against the map.
Republicans added party labels to Ohio Supreme Court beginning in 2022 and now control the court 6-1.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-01 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"As Trump calls for $100K H-1B visa fee, CT employers face uncertainty",P.R. Lockhart and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/01/trump-h-1b-visa-fee-ct-employers/,"Many CT companies use the H-1B visa to hire specialized employees, but the new policy could make that financially unfeasible for some.","On Sept. 19, Tariq Islam was starting off the weekend at a wedding in Hartford. But late in the afternoon, as the celebration picked up, text messages began to flood his phone. Islam’s work colleagues — fellow executives of the engineering firm run by Islam’s father — had a concern that could not wait.
Without warning, the federal government had announced a new national immigration policy affecting high-skilled temporary workers. In a proclamation, White House officials said they sought to “impose higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program.” The changes were intended “to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers.” 
Specifically, a $100,000 fee for each new employee seeking an H-1B visa was set to take effect in less than 48 hours. 
The announcement threw Islam’s weekend into chaos. “I just started seeing massive emails from a lot of panicked employees,” said Islam, who serves as chief of staff for AI Engineers Inc., a Connecticut-based engineering consultancy. 
The company’s immediate concern was that employees who were traveling internationally wouldn’t be able to get back into the U.S. unless the $100,000 fee was paid. “We have several employees who are maybe visiting family in India, Nepal, China,” he said of discussions that weekend. “We needed to tell them to get a flight back to the United States, like, ASAP.”
That Saturday, the Trump administration made attempts to clarify things. The new fee, which took effect on Sept. 21, would only apply to employees who received a first-time H-1B visa in the upcoming 2026 lottery. Employers would only be required to pay the fee once, and new workers would not be able to enter the country if the $100,000 hadn’t been paid. Current H-1B visa holders, like the roughly two dozen visa holders employed by AI Engineers, would be able to reenter the U.S. with no problem. 
But the proclamation still left many unanswered questions and raised concerns about what the change might mean for skilled foreign workers already in the country. Islam’s family-run business, which employs some 350 engineers that work on transportation and infrastructure projects, uses the H-1B visa to hire highly specialized design engineers, workers whose knowledge, skills, and experience are vital to the company. 
The new policy, Islam said, makes that “financially unfeasible.” 
The move by the Trump administration comes amid a broader crackdown on immigration. The specific focus of this restriction — the H-1B visa program — marks the administration’s biggest move yet to rein in skilled migration, a prominent contributor to the ranks of America’s tech workers, entrepreneurs, researchers and physicians.
The short- and long-term effects of the change are unclear. But economists and immigration experts say they could be widespread. 
In Connecticut, the change could reshape the workforce in sectors that rely on highly skilled temporary employees, shaking up the state economy at a time when businesses are already struggling to fill open roles and grow their labor force.
“The risk to the Connecticut economy is that you lose not just these individuals, but the ecosystems that they ultimately support,” said Dustin Nord, director of the CBIA Foundation for Economic Growth and Opportunity. 
Connecticut’s H-1B workforce, by the numbers
H-1B visas allow highly-skilled workers temporary employment in the U.S for up to three years, with the possibility for an additional 3-year extension. Workers fill a variety of roles, but the program has been most closely tied to America’s tech workforce, particularly computer programmers and IT workers. 
To obtain an H-1B visa for an employee, privately-held companies must enter a lottery process to receive application slots. Successful companies then submit completed applications for the selected workers. Nationally, there are roughly 85,000 visas available each year: 65,000 of those are for workers in specialized fields, with an additional 20,000 visas available for workers with advanced degrees from a U.S.-based institution.
Prior to the fee changes earlier this month, H-1B applications cost between $2,000 and $5,000, with additional fees and potential costs for legal assistance pushing the total as high as $10,000 per employee for some companies.
Connecticut’s H-1B workforce is largely concentrated in the state’s largest cities, including Hartford, New Haven and Stamford. But Nord said H-1B workers can be found in positions across Connecticut, spanning the majority of the state’s towns and cities. Limited federal data makes it difficult to know exactly how many H-1B visa holders are currently in the state and how many visas are ultimately used by each company, but estimates suggest that somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 workers could be present.
There is more data available on the number of visa applications and approvals, although it doesn’t show exactly how many visa holders actually complete the H-1B process and start work. In fiscal year 2024, Connecticut companies were approved for 453 new H-1B workers. After petitioning for a spot in April 2023, these workers were selected in the lottery process and approved for work in the U.S.
Recipients of the visas are mostly clustered around Hartford and parts of Fairfield County. The majority of visa holders’ positions were in science, engineering and technology. 
In 2025, hundreds of H-1B applications have already been submitted in the state. The visa process for the year will be completed in October, when new visa recipients officially receive H-1B status. 
While a range of companies employ H-1B workers in Connecticut, there are three areas in particular that would be most affected by the recent changes: entrepreneurs and startup founders, university-employed researchers and professors, and health care workers — particularly physicians. 
“We already have a shortage of doctors, nurses and health care workers,” said Dana Bucin, a Hartford-based immigration attorney whose firm helps businesses with H-1B applications in a handful of states, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey. 
“After we cut the access to H-1B for these professions,” she added, “it may be at a crisis level.”
A source of doctors, researchers, and innovators
As the data shows, Yale University is one of the leading employers of H-1B workers in Connecticut. The visa holders are typically employed in university departments as tenure-track faculty, making them a vital source for academic advancements and student support. The changes could cost the university millions in fees if it were to maintain its current number of visa workers.
So far, Yale has offered little public comment on what the policy change might mean. A news release, published on Sept. 20 by Yale’s Office of International Students and Scholars, said the changes would not affect already granted visas. The notice said the school “will update our guidance as we gain more clarity about H-1B change of status or amendment petitions.” 
Representatives for the university declined to offer additional comment on the potential impacts of the $100,000 visa application fee, referring only to this previous statement. 
The University of Connecticut, another institution that applies for many H-1B visas, also did not offer a detailed comment when asked about the visa changes and their potential effects for university employees. Spokesperson Stephanie Reitz said in an email, “UConn is currently assessing the federal directive and its potential impacts on university programs.”

Many universities employ H-1B visa holders as faculty, researchers and doctors. It is currently unclear if higher education will receive any sort of exemption from the fee. 
But the labor force effects could stretch beyond universities. The changes could also hit the state’s health care workforce, reducing the number of available physicians and nurses at a time when the state is already struggling to fill positions. 
“The H-1B visa program is essential to helping hospitals recruit highly skilled physicians and other health care professionals to meet the care delivery needs of patients — including those in rural and underserved areas — as we work to grow and train the future health care workforce,” a spokesperson for the Connecticut Hospital Association wrote in an emailed statement. “At a time when the health care workforce nationwide is experiencing shortages, we stress the importance of ensuring that federal policies do not make it more difficult to attract and retain health care professionals.”
Mariam Hakim-Zargar, an orthopedic surgeon in Torrington and the president of the Connecticut State Medical Society, said the $100,000 visa fee could escalate these difficulties even further. “We definitely have a hard time recruiting and retaining doctors in our state, and this is just going to add an extra financial burden,” she said.
Hakim-Zargar added that while national organizations, like the American Medical Association, have recently called for the Trump administration to create an exemption that would protect health care employers from the visa application fees, the damage may already be done. 
“Why would somebody want to come to the United States for training with all this uncertainty?” she said. In the coming months, Hakim-Zargar added, it’s possible that medical professionals utilize incentives “to go to other countries, Canada, European countries, for their training instead.” 
As policy changes go into effect, concerns of a deeper economic impact
With the visa changes still so new, many employers in Connecticut haven’t yet figured out exactly what they’ll mean for their businesses. And the changes have amplified an already deep sense of uncertainty for those facing changing trade policy. Raising the visa fee for skilled workers so significantly changes the cost structure for employers across sectors. 
Economists said H-1B visas have become an important facet of the nation’s immigration system, allowing the country to attract high-skilled workers that complement America’s workforce. 
“It’s the main bridge between university educated, bachelors, masters, PhD workers with specialized skills around the world and the US economy,” said Michael Clemens, a professor at George Mason University and a fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “This is the bridge that they’re dropping multiple bombs on.”
If the fee drives down the number of H-1B applications significantly, there is a concern that some industries could face a short-term decline from a reduced number of available workers. 
But more than that, economists worry there could be a longer term economic impact, as some companies turn to offshoring and remaining domestic employers struggle to fill positions left vacant for an extended period. 
“Immigrants to a country tend to have a different distribution of skills, and because they have slightly different skills from the native born, that allows everyone to specialize more and in what they’re good at,” said Jennifer Hunt, an economist at Rutgers University. “And when people specialize more in what they’re good at, the economy is more efficient.”
The $100,000 H-1B visa fee, she said, “could shut down the H-1B program almost entirely.”
Those effects could be potentially magnified by the fact that the administration has not yet made many aspects of its policy clear. Bucin, the immigration attorney, said while the policy has already taken effect, employers aren’t clear on how to actually submit the $100,000 application fee or how the process will be managed.
“There are things wrong with the H-1B program, but when you get a sprained ankle, you don’t cut off your leg.”Michael Clemens, George Mason University
Kris Klein Hernández, a history professor at Connecticut College, said the administration has not explained its plan to replace the loss of highly skilled migrant workers. “It’s not helpful,” he said of the recent policy change. 
“If you’re going to charge to bring in outside talent, then there needs to be some sort of program for Americans to get the proper training, then to get hired into the roles that weren’t being filled with Americans in the first place,” he said. “I don’t see that in the policy.”
So far, the Trump administration has maintained that the changes are necessary to curb abuses in the visa system, arguing that the H-1B visa has been used to hire lower-skilled workers for far less than an American employee would demand — tying these workers to companies that then exploit them.
The visa program has also been criticized for lacking proper guardrails, with politicians on both sides of the aisle seeking reforms over the years. In 2024, a report from Bloomberg found that staffing companies had been able to submit multiple visa applications for the same employee, gaming the system to receive higher amounts of visa slots. 
In August, the conservative Heritage Foundation argued that the current visa lottery program “disproportionately benefits large tech firms and — mostly foreign — outsourcing companies, often at the expense of smaller employers.” 
Clemens said those concerns should call for additional reforms to the system rather than the $100,000 fee the administration is now using. “There are things wrong with the H-1B program, but when you get a sprained ankle, you don’t cut off your leg,” he said. 
Islam, the AI Engineers executive, said that in the future his firm will likely stop pursuing new H-1B applicants. “It doesn’t make sense to pay 100K to bring them over,” he said. 
As a result, Islam expects the workload for the company’s current engineers to increase. With regional competition from larger markets in New York City and Boston, and industry organizations highlighting a shortage of civil engineers in the U.S., there aren’t many workers who can immediately fill the sort of bespoke design engineering roles his firm needs, he said.
With the visa changes being so recent, the exemptions to the fee undecided, and the first affected employees not entering the lottery until next year, it will be some time until the exact effects of the H-1B changes on Connecticut — and the nation at large — are apparent. But for now, the visa change has fueled concerns about the future of the nation’s economy and one portion of the workforce that helps drive it. 
“The business world functions on predictability,” said Bucin. “Volatility is not good for the economy, or for employers.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AI-Engineers-scaled-e1759268439113-1024x707.jpeg,,,2025-10-01 05:57:16.071405

The Rail Commission approved: 

A $350,000 grant to First Quality Tissue Midwest, LLC for installing rail infrastructure to help the company’s new plant in Defiance. 
A $1.2 million grant to rehab a bridge on Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway’s Rook Subdivision in Tuscarawas County.
A $174,000 grant to Wilmington Iron & Metal Company (Clinton County) to grow its on-site rail capacity. 
A $497,875 grant to RJ Corman Railroad Company to support a project rehab part of the St. Marys Subdivision in Mercer and Auglaize counties. 
A $150,000 grant to the Kraft Heinz facility in Fremont (Sandusky County). 

“These five projects represent a significant commitment to improved safety and economic development in the state,” Ohio Rail Development Commission Executive Director Matthew Dietrich said in a statement. “Together these projects demonstrate just how important rail is to Ohio’s economy.”
Passenger rail 
The first round of the Federal Railroad Administration’s Corridor ID Program was announced in late 2023 and 69 routes were selected, including four Ohio routes. The program involves intercity passenger rail planning. 
Ohio’s four routes are 3C&D (Cincinnati, Dayton, Columbus, Cleveland); Cleveland – Toledo – Dayton; Midwest Connect (Chicago – Ft. Wayne – Lima – Columbus – Pittsburgh); and Amtrak Cardinal enhancements.
The Ohio Rail Development Commission is sponsoring studies for the 3C+D Corridor and the Cleveland-Toledo-Detroit Corridor.
The initial 3C&D Corridor proposal includes three daily round trips; and it could add 1,100 jobs and add more than $100 million to Ohio’s economy, according to All Aboard Ohio, a nonprofit that advocates for public transportation and passenger rail.
Midwest Connect is sponsored by the City of Fort Wayne, Indiana and the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission. It envisions two to four daily round trips, according to the Ohio Rail Plan.
Amtrak’s Cardinal route connects New York to Chicago with stops along the way in Washington, D.C., Charlottesville, Cincinnati and Indianapolis. It currently runs three times a week, but it could possibly run everyday. 
Despite the efforts at the federal level, All Aboard Ohio was disappointed there was not more about passenger rail in the Ohio Rail Plan, said All Aboard Ohio Executive Director John Esterly. 
“Since these projects are so large scale, and since it’s something that has been very clearly demonstrated to be a priority for many Ohioans, it seemed like a bit of an oversight that there wasn’t more in there about passenger rail,” Esterly said. “It is almost exclusively a document describing freight rail and freight rail expansion in Ohio.”
There is a 13-page chapter in the Ohio Rail Plan on passenger rail. 
“I’ll be honest, it was a little puzzling to me because there’s an entire chapter,” Dietrich said. “It’s a very prescriptive format that we have to follow to be federally compliant.”
The Rail Commission submitted the first step for their two routes over the summer and the next step is when detailed planning and design happens. Amtrak also submitted the first step for the Cardinal route. 
“The next step in the process that we’re waiting for approval from the FRA is to develop those studies,” Dietrich said. “And those studies will develop something called the Service Development Plan, which will provide capital cause from ridership estimates, equipment needs (and) scheduling.”
Slightly more than three quarters (78.4%) of Ohioans say enhancing the rail network is important or very important, according to the Ohio Department of Transportation’s 2024 Transportation Preference Survey.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)This past weekend more than a hundred Ohioans demonstrated outside the Statehouse against a pair of bills that could effectively outlaw some immigrants from owning land in the state.
Ohio House Bill 1 and Ohio Senate Bill 88, prohibit citizens of countries designated “foreign adversaries” from owning land within 25 miles of “critical infrastructure.”
Although people from a variety of backgrounds spoke at the event, the effort is being led by people of Chinese descent. They note that the measure is meant to restrict their ability to own a home or a business.
Ying Wu described herself as a mother from Dublin, and “an Ohioan by choice.”
She explained that after her husband finished his medical training, they had several options on where they could live. They chose Ohio because they saw it as a good place to raise a family.
“This is not just where we live, it’s who we are,” she said. “But lately, this promise feels fragile.”
“Bills like HB 1 and SB 88 don’t see the life we built,” she went on. “They look at our family and see a label. They listen to our story, and they hear an accent. They send a message to us: You will always be other. You do not belong.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bills’ sponsors pitch their plan as a national security consideration, but critics like Wu say the proposals attempt to codify racism.
For instance, state law defines critical infrastructure so broadly — extending to power lines, telephone poles, and sewage pipes — that effectively the entire state would be off-limits.
Opponents see Ohio’s proposal, and similar efforts in states like Florida, as a return to the so-called alien land laws that sprung up in 1900s.
Those laws employed seemingly neutral language, applying to individuals “ineligible for citizenship,” to target Asian immigrants and bar them from purchasing land.
“While these laws did not explicitly target Asians, the purpose behind them was very clear,” explained Abby Chin, past president of the Asian Pacific American Bar Association of Central Ohio.
Chin and others say Ohio’s “foreign adversaries” provision is another broad framing calibrated to achieve targeted ends.
Although the restrictions would likely apply to citizens of Iran, North Korea, and Russia, the sponsors make no secret that their primary concern is immigrants from China.
“The People’s Republic of China, Communist China, has not hidden the fact that their goal is not just to compete and outperform the United States, it is to take over the world — they actually meant this,” the bill’s sponsor state Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, claimed in a February committee hearing.
The Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment restricts the government from discriminating based on several protected classes, including national origin and alienage.
In February last year, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals put Florida’s law barring foreign land ownership on hold.
In a concurrence, Judge Nancy Abudu specifically cited the Equal Protection Clause.
Rev. Dan Clark from the United Church of Granville called Ohio’s proposals “legalized xenophobia.”
“It is unconstitutional. It is un-American. It is unfaithful and it is immoral,” he said. “Our Constitution promises more than this. The Fifth Amendment guarantees due process. The 14th guarantees equal protection. The Fair Housing Act outlaws discrimination based on national origin. HB 1 and SB 88 tramples all of these protections.”
In addition to their dubious legality, Chin said the measures are misguided.
Taking a broadbrush approach ignores nuance. Immigrants in Ohio could be refugees or dissidents from a designated country, for instance, he noted.
“These bills equate innocent individuals with the governments of countries that they come from,” she said. “In other words, it sets restrictions without any evidence that the individual has done anything wrong.”
Because Bowling Green State University Professor Louisa Ha is a citizen, the proposals won’t affect her ability to own land. But she’s still worried about how the bills target immigrant communities.
She’s specifically concerned that the Ohio Secretary of State would regularly update the list of foreign adversaries.
“Depending on politics, any other country can be added to that list,” she said, “so all immigrants are vulnerable.”
Far from making the state more safe, Ha said, laws that single out specific communities breed mistrust and hostility.
“As an immigrant, I don’t want to live in a community that sees immigrants as enemies,” Ha said. “I don’t want my children, who grew up and (were) born here and speak English as their first language, (to) be seen as perpetual foreigners in their own country.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Ohioans will need to bare it all in order to watch online pornography, now that the state’s age verification requirement went into effect on Tuesday.
With thousands of pages of policy reform, the state’s massive operating budget, which includes the porn changes, impacts everyone.
Immediate changes
You will need to submit your proof that you are an adult to watch internet pornography.
“We’re gonna preserve and protect the innocence of our kids here in the state of Ohio,” state Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania, said.
Age verification would be done by submitting a photo of your state ID or by entering your personal information into a third-party system that will then run your details through other online or government databases — it could also use facial recognition technology, capturing photos of users.
Companies would be penalized if they don’t comply.
The provision states that an establishment primarily centered on explicit content and generating a significant amount of revenue from such content must comply with this law.
However, others that host pornography may still be subject to the law.
News media organizations, as well as cable and streaming providers, have an explicit exemption.
Williams said that this won’t impact social media sites like X (formerly known as Twitter) and Reddit, even though both of those platforms contain easily-accessible pornography.
Clevelander Mallory McMaster fears that data could be leaked.
In 2024, hackers have stolen medical, financial, and legal data from at least hundreds of thousands of Ohioans at both the state and local levels. Many of the reported cyberattacks do not state how many consumers have been impacted.
“Creating a log of the pornography that we watch is not a direction that we want to go in as a country,” McMaster said.
It’s also likely that explicit video giant PornHub pulls out of providing content to Ohio. The company has removed some of its sites in states with age verification laws. As of publishing, they have pulled out of 17 states.
Another change taking effect Tuesday involves the driver’s license process.
Under state law prior to Sept. 30, 18-year-olds and older can simply apply for a license, bypassing the majority of training requirements, like classes. But soon, drivers under 21 will be required to complete the same training that minors do.
“Inexperience is really the number one killer,” Gov. Mike DeWine said Monday. “It’s the number one cause of crashes.”
The Ohio Chamber of Commerce’s Tony Long warns that this policy could impact the economy, as 18- to 20-year-olds could be bumped out of the job market.
“One of the hardest things for the workforce is finding adequate transportation, so this adds to that,” Long said.
Goes into law, but delayed results
Although it goes into law on Tuesday, you won’t see some budget provisions change for a few months, like with the state’s income tax.
The state is moving to a 2.75% flat income tax, meaning the highest earners in the state, those making more than $100,000 a year, will no longer have to pay 3.5% in income tax, making them equal to the lower tax bracket.
This will be phased in over the next few years; however, those earning $100,000 or more will see the decreases reflected in their next filing period.
The bracket will go from 3.5% to 3.125% in 2026 and down to 2.75% in tax year 2027.
“We are making Ohio more competitive, more open for business,” House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, claimed.
This law also allowed the Cleveland Browns to receive $600 million in unclaimed funds for a new stadium in Brook Park.
Lawmakers also adjusted the state’s Art Modell law so that current Browns owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam, prominent campaign donors, could move the team out of the city of Cleveland.
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship has been kept by the lawmakers, guaranteeing admission to a public university for each high school graduate in the top 10% of their graduating class. The students would also get $5,000 each year in financial aid.
However, new this year, the bill requires students to sign a “statement of commitment” to stay in Ohio for three years after graduation.
High-performing public schools will have the opportunity to gain some additional school funding. If a school earns a 4- or 5-star ranking on its report card, it becomes eligible for additional funding.
Won’t be going into effect
A provision that changed the makeup of the state teachers’ retirement system board did not go into effect on Tuesday.
Currently, a Columbus court has temporarily blocked lawmakers from removing the majority of educators from the board.
“Right now with the educators on board, I know that decisions are made because they’re really thinking about what’s gonna happen not only to the future of others, but to their own future,” retired teacher Mary Binegar said.
“When you take that factor out of those decisions and it’s made by people that have nothing to do with that system, then I think it’s a whole different perspective.”
A last-minute provision in the state budget changed the makeup of the board from seven elected teachers — five contributing and two retired — to three elected, after seats are phased out over several years. Two of the educator seats will be for active educators, and only one retiree seat will be available.
Republican leaders note that additional blocked provisions could take effect soon, as lawmakers continue to debate overriding the governor’s vetoes on school-related property tax items.
“We shouldn’t be seeing these unanticipated, unexpected spikes in property taxes the way we are,” Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, said. “We need to fix the system.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)“Don’t take Tylenol!” I overheard one of my nursing students say as I returned after a break to the class. This was after a physician had shared that one of his patients told him to learn more the risks of Tylenol.
Confusion about Tylenol, which is considered a Pregnancy Category B substance safe for use throughout pregnancy, has surged after President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested at a news conference that there might be a correlation between the medication and autism spectrum disorders. To date, no consistent association has been found.
A study on the subject comes from some of the country’s premier researchers, including Andrea Baccarelli from Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health. In this paper, a new method called Navigation Guide Methodology uses meta-analyses and other statistical analyses to scrutinize existing evidence. Their results suggest that pregnant women limit Tylenol use. Their method uses data to fast-track development of recommendations that help prevent harmful exposures of humans to environmental agents in the environment.
Establishing a causal association has been difficult in this situation. First, conducting randomized controlled studies — in which participants are randomly given a drug or not and variables in the environment are controlled — on pregnant women is not feasible and ethically abhorrent. Second, laboratory research on this topic is still scant and unclear. One theoretical study suggested that the NAPQ1-breakdown product of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol) can cause in utero mitochondrial damage.
However, many of these newer studies exhibit the same limitations as earlier research. That is, reliance on maternal self-report; lack of detailed data on dosage, duration and timing of exposure; as well as failure to control for genetic and familiar confounders.
While existing studies suggest an association between heavy use of Tylenol and autism spectrum disorders, a causal relationship remains to be established. Tylenol use in mice has been shown to cause defects in cartilage development by negatively affecting genes that control limb development. Cartilage malformations have also been noted in zebrafish embryos exposed to Tylenol. Some researchers point to the presence of hypermobility and abnormal gait in people with autism spectrum disorders and ADHD as a corollary to Tylenol exposure in the womb.
Another animal study treated pregnant mice with 100 or 400 mg/kg a day in the second trimester, or 400 mg/kg a day in the second or third trimester and examined maternal fetal blood phenotypes, pregnancy results and organ development. It found that some lipids, enzymes and hormones were changed. Researchers also observed that Tylenol administration stunted the formation of connections in the developing hippocampus.
There was an observational follow-up study on 2.5 million children in Sweden born between 1995 and 2019. This study used sibling control analysis — looking at and controlling for factors such as genes and the environment shared between families — and found that previously reported associations were absent.
This indicates that any associations were likely the results of familial confounding: when families share genes and the environment. For instance, a mother’s genetic risks for ADHD could also predispose her to headaches and infections that might require Tylenol use. People would likely link the ADHD in the child to Tylenol, use even though it was the mother’s ADHD that led to her use of the drug.
What happens if you do not treat high fever during pregnancy? In fact, high fever during pregnancy, even hot temperatures from saunas and bathtubs, can cause severe damage to the developing fetus, including neural tube defects, craniofacial deformities and congenital heart defects.
Public health experts and medical bodies are resisting. The American Academy of Pediatrics denounced the announcement linking Tylenol with autism. FDA Commissioner Martin Makary downplayed the warnings from Human and Health Services in a letter to American physicians that encouraged minimization of use during low-grade fevers and stressed the lack of any causal relationship as well as the fact that Tylenol remained the safest painkiller during pregnancy.
However, a concerning development is the decision by the FDA to change labels on products that contain acetaminophen, which remains the only over-the-counter drug to treat fever during pregnancy.
Association does not mean causation. More research data will be needed before recommending that pregnant women avoid Tylenol to prevent neurodevelopmental disorders in the newborns.

(Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)Five years ago, as I prepared to leave my Army uniform behind, I faced two life-defining decisions. First: where to raise my young family. My wife and I knew we wanted our girls to grow up where we had, surrounded by family and Nebraska’s “Good Life.”
The second proved harder: What career would let me serve? In energy work, something clicked. As a soldier who’d served in places where reliable power wasn’t guaranteed, I understood the fundamental link between energy and prosperity.
But Nebraska’s energy future faces a critical threat: Washington’s broken interconnection process. If we want to power our homes and family farms and next-generation AI data centers, we need to drag this decades-old system into the 21st century.
News focuses too much on the sources of our power — natural gas, nuclear and renewables like wind and solar — and not nearly enough on how those power sources actually connect to the grid to send power to the places where it’s needed.
That process is called interconnection. And, as you would expect from something dominated by nearly century-old federal rules and regulations, it’s slow, difficult and expensive — and in need of serious reform.
Consider that the average wait time for new generation projects to connect to the grid has grown from less than 2 years in 2008 to nearly 5 years for projects completed in 2023. As of late 2023, roughly 2.6 terawatts of proposed generation and storage — more than twice the entire current U.S. installed capacity — sits trapped in interconnection queues nationwide.
In our part of the country, the problem is acute. For projects submitted between 2018-2020 across the Southwest Power Pool, completion rates fell below 10 percent. In other words: More than 90 percent of proposed energy projects never come online, largely because of delays, compliance costs and regulatory uncertainty, according to the 2024 Advanced Energy Interconnection Scorecard.
This bottleneck threatens to become catastrophic as demand for electricity climbs faster than it has in decades. Data centers, AI, electric vehicles and advanced manufacturing are reshaping America’s grid.
Here in Nebraska, the Omaha Public Power District is planning for roughly 100 megawatts in additional demand each year — an enormous jump from the handful of megawatts we previously added annually.
When we can’t connect new, cheaper power sources quickly enough to meet growing demand, we’re forced to rely on more expensive alternatives, especially during peak times. That’s a key reason why Nebraska families have watched their utility bills tick upwards over the past few years.
While federal regulators have attempted some piecemeal reforms, the backlog remains massive, and the process still moves too slowly for the growth we expect.
Solutions aren’t complicated. First, FERC must ensure its new cluster-study deadlines are met and enforceable. Projects that meet technical requirements deserve timely decisions, not indefinite delays.
Second, American interconnection should transition to a “connect and manage” approach, similar to those used in Europe – where ready projects can connect to the grid while system upgrades proceed in parallel, with clear operating constraints to maintain reliability.
Third, Nebraska should lead a coalition of states to demand prioritization of shovel-ready projects. If a project has secured financing, ensured site control and received local support, it should move forward.
Nebraska enjoys abundant access to diverse energy resources. We have a skilled workforce, and we’re grateful to have something no other state can claim: A 100 percent public power system that puts ratepayers first instead of shareholders.
But those advantages mean nothing if federal red tape prevents us from connecting new power to the grid. It’s time to push back against broken processes and embrace a streamlined, practical approach that ensures lower rates and greater reliability.
My daughters, and every other member of Nebraska’s next generation, deserve nothing less.

DemasIn the thick of a government shutdown that lasted just one hour, the Michigan House and Senate passed a continuation budget to hold the state over for the next eight days – a move that was described as giving legislative staffers some cushion to finish drafting the final budget deal hammered out into the small hours of Wednesday morning.
The continuation budget is a modified version of the House’s government shutdown avoidance plan passed in March, offering to fund the state at just a fraction of the previous fiscal year’s spending. The hold over budget would fund the government over the next week at $1.56 billion with $272.3 million from the General Fund.
In many ways, the plan was designed by the Republican-controlled House for the very situation that the Legislature faced this week and for the few months that preceded it: A divided government unable to see eye-to-eye on key priorities; a House that took forever to pass its own budget; and a Senate that couldn’t get its road funding plan in order until just before the end of the fiscal year.

Although House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and his caucus said in March that the plan was simply a “break glass in case of emergency” tool, the Democrats in the House predicted that the plan signaled Republicans’ zeal to see the government shut down in some fashion.
But as the situation worsened over time, plenty of blame was to be shared among Republicans and Democrats when, on Tuesday afternoon, the respective chambers were still negotiating and working out the loose framework they agreed to last week.
An announcement from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Hall and Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) later on Tuesday evening said a final budget had been agreed to and all that was needed was to draft the bills and put them up for a legal review.
That takes some time, and it was impossible to expect that to be completed by the end of the fiscal year at midnight on Tuesday.

Whitmer also made the rather bizarre proclamation that the government would not shut down, but offered no real details on how she would keep it open. There was much speculation around whether the governor would issue an executive directive to keep spending, but at what levels of the now-lapsed fiscal year was unclear.
Many surmised that the move would be unconstitutional seeing as how a provision in the state Constitution dictates that no government spending could commence without an appropriations bill in place for the next – or in this case, the new current – fiscal year.
Eventually, the fiscal year ended, and on Wednesday at 12:01 a.m., both chambers adjourned, resumed session and went back into caucus meetings as the government was, constitutionally speaking, shut down.
Soon afterward, it became apparent that there was no longer a need for any Whitmer executive spending action.
The Senate announced that it would discharge House Bill 4161, which was now properly labeled as a stopgap to avoid a prolonged government shut down, from the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Reconvening at 12:30 a.m., the upper chamber quickly entered recess before returning just before 1:30 a.m. to take up a substitute for the stopgap bill providing funding until Oct. 8.
After adopting the substitute, the Senate approved the measure 31-2.
Sens. Jim Runestad (R-White Lake) and Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater) voted against the bill, while Sens. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs) and Michelle Hoitenga (R-Manton) did not vote at all. The chamber granted the bill immediate effect.
Following the vote, Brinks told reporters the measure would last for a week to give the Legislature time to finish writing the final budget bill. 
“We do have a budget agreement,” Brinks said. “We’ll get the bill written, and we will vote it out as soon as possible, after it’s ready.”
While Brinks said there was a strong framework in place last Thursday, there were a number of details that needed to come into place, and the bill simply wasn’t ready for a vote leading into the deadline.
“I certainly wish that we weren’t here at this moment tonight, but I think the important thing to remember is that we were able to come to an agreement, even in a time like this, with divided government,” Brinks said. “We will be keeping government services open. The people in Michigan can still get what they need from their government for the next week, despite this minor delay.”

The bill then moved to the House. 
After taking leave to caucus, Democrats and Republicans reentered the House chamber and passed the bill on a 103-4 vote. The only no votes came from Republican Reps. Steve Carra of Three Rivers, Jim DeSana of Carleton, Tom Kunse of Clare and Jaime Greene of Richmond.
Democratic Reps. Peter Herzberg of Westland, Regina Weiss of Oak Park, and Karen Whitsett of Detroit did not cast votes for the bill.
Democratic Minority Leader Rep. Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) said that it went without saying that the whole budget process this year was “highly unusual.”
“The House Democrats were excited to be able to play a role here to make sure that we’re getting this state one step closer to making sure our departments and our employees have some certainty in the process,” Puri said. “House Democrats are committed to showing up day in and day out, no matter how long this process is drawn out, and to making sure that we’re advocating for the values that our state needs.”

State Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn), a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said that those watching closely clearly saw that votes from House Democrats were needed to get the stopgap spending bill across the finish line and avoid a full government shutdown while the work continues.
“That’s been constant since last week heading into negotiations. Our votes and our caucus participation has been, I think, crucial to making sure we’re avoiding a full blown shutdown,” Farhat said. “And if you see what’s happening in D.C. right now, where they’re not even able to work together, I think in Michigan, we’re showing a new path forward and showing a way that we can come together on bipartisan common sense wins – whether that’s quality public schools, that’s long term road funding, and that’s making sure we’re funding our public safety.”
Republican Majority Floor Leader Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) said the base budget is done and agreed upon, and that they’re now in the processing phase. He expected the chamber to vote on the conference committee budget on Thursday.

The Senate is set to return from recess at 10 a.m., with the Senate Appropriations Committee meeting at noon to discuss a host of legislative spending requests – also known as earmarks or pork projects. The hearing is  required by new transparency rules put in place by the Senate earlier this week, mirroring those put in place by the House earlier this year.  
The House is slated to return at noon and has no plans to take any votes on the final budget, but may act on policy issues or other vehicle bills for the incoming final plan.

Sears,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/10/01/maryland-lawmakers-briefed-on-potential-effects-of-government-shutdown/,Maryland lawmakers were warned Tuesday of the potential of tens of millions in lost economic activity and revenue under the federal government shutdown that began at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.,"The U.S. Capitol building at night. (File photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Maryland lawmakers were warned Tuesday of the potential of tens of millions in lost economic activity and revenue under the federal government shutdown that began at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.
Chief Deputy Comptroller Andrew Schaufele, in a briefing before the Joint Federal Action Oversight Committee, estimated that the state could lose $700,000 per day — possibly more — in tax revenue in a shutdown.
More than that, Schaufele warned that a shutdown compounds the state’s current economic instability that stems from President Donald Trump’s ongoing efforts to shrink the number of federal employees, agencies and spending.
“I think what is missing in all of this analysis I’ve given you here is that this is one more level of instability on top of what our federal ecosystem is going through right now … and how that amplifies the downsides of what our families and businesses are going through is very uncertain,” Schaufele said.
None of the estimates take into account the potential for massive firings of federal employees during a shutdown that Trump has threatened. Also, the estimates do not include federal employees who opted to take a buyout earlier this year and leave their jobs this fall — so-called “fork in the road” employees.
Annual federal spending in Maryland exceeds $150 billion. It is an amount that includes wages, retirement payments, contracts, grants, and other direct payments. About 13% of all households in the state have at least one person who receives a paycheck or retirement income from the federal government.
Federal government shutdown begins, with no easy exit in sight

The last federal shutdown — which began at the end of 2018 and ended in 2019 — lasted more than a month. Nationally, the event curtailed an estimated $3 billion in economic activity, according to Schaufele, citing a Congressional Budget Office analysis.
Maryland would account for about 15% of that figure or roughly $13 million per day, he said. “if you make various assumptions about how that flows down into our revenue stream, that could be about $550,000 of lost revenue per day of government shutdown” last time, Schaufele said. Accounting for inflation since 2019, that would be about $700,000 today.
“It’s worth noting that that 34-day most-recent shutdown was not a complete shutdown, as this one would be,” Schaufele said.
But he told lawmakers “I think the risk is to the upside there that if anything, this one could be a bit more significant given what has taken place prior and the words that are coming out of the current administration.”
Even so, Schaufele said the lost revenue in 2019 was about 1% of what Maryland collected.
“So, while these things are intimidating and significant and they create uncertainty and distortions, the ending fiscal effect is not always as severe as the psychological effect, and I think the long-term economic effects,” he said.
“I think the irony of these federal government shutdowns is that they are likely to drive up federal costs over the long run,” Schaufele said. “The uncertainty is the worst aspect of this from a business point of view, from an employee point of view, uncertainty drives risk. Risk drives increased costs.”
The briefing to lawmakers Tuesday came less than 10 hours before the midnight deadline for a shutdown, when there was still a remote chance the Senate Republicans and Democrats might reach a deal to keep government open.

“I believe in miracles, and that miracles do happen, but if the government does shut down, please note this, today’s conversation won’t be the last,” Miller said at Tuesday’s hearing.
Matthew Verghese, the state’s federal lobbyist, painted a more pessimistic picture of the final hours.
“We are essentially in the twilight hour of funding of the federal government today and without action by the Senate – the U.S. House of Representatives is out of session today — we will shut down for the first time in seven years,” Verghese said. “We are heading towards a full federal government shutdown.”
Verghese added that “very large differences” between Republicans and Democrats “continue to exist and show us why we’re barreling towards a shutdown today.”
The House, with its Republican majority, passed a bill Sept. 19 that would fund the government through Nov. 21.
That plan stalled in the Senate. While Republicans hold the majority in the chamber, they need the votes of a small number of Democrats to reach a required 60-vote threshold needed to head off any filibusters.
Senate Democrats are holding out for their own version of a budget extension that restores health insurance subsidies that are part of the Affordable Care Act. The program was cut this summer as part of a tax cut package backed by President Donald Trump.
Senate President Bill Ferguson said if the program is not restored, Maryland residents could see insurance premiums jump by as much as 20%.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) called on Gov. Wes Moore (D) to encourage Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks to not use healthcare premiums as an excuse to force a shutdown.
“I mean, that’s a policy issue, and this committee, and as well as some other joint committees that we have here in Maryland are discussing Medicaid and the effects of that,” Hershey said. “But at the end of the day, this is a continuing resolution to keep the federal government open. Why are those issues being brought into this negotiation, rather than…the bipartisan support that’s needed and has been achieved every other time in order to keep the government open?”

Jones (D-Baltimore County) at a Randallstown news conference last week, flanked by the governor and senate president, who gathered to tout an electricity bill refund heading to customers amid soaring energy costs. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Maryland opened the door Tuesday to a program that could fast-track energy projects through the state’s regulatory process in hopes of boosting the amount of power generated in the state.
For the next 30 days, the Public Service Commission will accept applications for large-scale power projects or “dispatchable” generation, which can provide energy quickly during periods of peak demand.
Selected applicants will get an expedited PSC review that could lead to a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity — a green light for construction — in 295 days, or nine to 10 months.
Lawmakers, utilities and energy companies are expected to watch the 30-day application window closely, with Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) at an event last week calling it a litmus test for the future of energy generation in Maryland.
“That will be very indicative as to what the market may look like for domestic generation here in Maryland,” Ferguson said. “We will learn a lot from that open auction to see what merchant generators will put forward.”
But few, if any, said they are expecting major new projects to enter the fray, such as a gas-fired power plant, in part because the new law does little to change the challenging economic conditions for the industry.
“It doesn’t change the fundamental economics of building a power plant, right?” said Maryland People’s Counsel David Lapp. “And those economics are probably not good in Maryland, because we’re not near big sources of gas, like in Pennsylvania.”

The expedited review is one part of the energy legislation, called the Next Generation Energy Act, developed by Democratic leadership and pushed through the General Assembly this year in response to high gas and electric bills, amid intense concern from consumers.
Leading lawmakers and Gov. Wes Moore (D) have said they believe that Maryland must generate more energy in-state in hopes of reducing consumers’ bills, as power demand is projected to soar in the 13-state electric grid that includes Maryland — chiefly because of artificial intelligence and data centers.
PSC Chairman Frederick H. Hoover said in a news release Tuesday that the fast-track procedure “provides a pathway to encourage new generation development and improve resource adequacy in Maryland without the State or ratepayers making a financial commitment.”
Moore said in June that he felt the Next Generation Energy Act “didn’t go far enough” to attract new power generation, calling on lawmakers to further incentivize nuclear power in particular. More recently, he has softened his tone.
“I do think the Next Generation [Act] that the General Assembly worked on and passed was an important piece of legislation,” Moore said. “And I do know that we are going to be working together, not just in this next upcoming session, but in this session going forward, to ensure greater relief for our ratepayers.”
Only certain types of power generators are eligible for the expedited review, under the Next Generation Energy Act.
One criterion is Effective Load Carrying Capacity, which measures a resource’s ability to contribute energy to the grid during peak demand periods. Projects seeking fast-track approval must have an ELCC rating at or above 65%, according to the most recent ratings developed by PJM Interconnection, the power grid operator for Maryland and 12 other states. And they also must have greenhouse gas emissions lower than coal or oil.
That list includes nuclear, various types of natural gas-fired power plants, offshore wind, steam and certain types of battery energy storage. The list excludes solar and onshore wind, among other power projects.
But all large-capacity projects — at least 20 megawatts — are eligible, so long as they have also applied to connect to the PJM grid.
Lapp, who represents utility ratepayers, has expressed skepticism that more in-state generation is needed, adding that planned transmission upgrades will ease some of the burden. He argues that most of the projected demand increase from data centers comes from outside Maryland, calling into question the need to impact Marylanders with power plant development.

Eligible projects currently in PJM’s queue include a large amount of solar projects coupled with battery storage, in addition to a gas plant upgrade, said Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action, a coalition of utility-scale solar, wind, and battery storage developers in the mid-Atlantic.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if there isn’t a lot of response to this procurement, because we know which projects would be reasonably positioned to respond to it, and I can say on behalf of my members that, generally speaking, the CPCN process has been relatively time-efficient,” Vaughan said. “Utility-scale solar developers are not seeing the CPCN process as the primary barrier to deployment in Maryland.”
Vaughan said some of his members may prefer to apply to a separate solicitation created by the General Assembly, for front-of-the-meter transmission energy storage devices, to be issued by January 2026.
And since state lawmakers gave final approval to the energy package in April, Ferguson noted, the market for renewable energy generators has changed, with passage of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” which eliminated substantial Biden-era tax credits for clean-energy projects.
“The evisceration of credits for renewable energy projects has changed the landscape dramatically,” Ferguson said.
Ferguson said that large renewable energy projects are in a “near-halt” position because of the new law, which may force the General Assembly to adjust its strategy.
“That’s something we’re going to have to take into consideration as we approach next session,” Ferguson said. “Now we’re working in a different financial landscape, where half of the energy projects that are the cheapest to build have been taken off the table.”
There could be a short-term increase in the pace of development, Vaughan said, as companies race to begin construction before July 4, 2026, when the tax credits lapse. It’s possible that some developers could try to use the fast-track before the PSC to try and meet that deadline, he said.
“This accelerated CPCN fast-track really could provide a make or break opportunity for those projects to get their CPCN if they feel that they’re at risk,” Vaughan said.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Two state education boards approved additional metrics Tuesday to improve student achievement, including measures to shrink the achievement gap between student groups, but they didn’t set a timeline for meeting that goal.
It was the second meeting this year between the Maryland State Board of Education and the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Accountability and Implementation Board. More than a year ago, the two boards approved “ambitious” goals on student achievement, attracting and retaining a diverse teacher corps and reducing chronic absenteeism.
The measures approved Tuesday deal with student groupings such as race and ethnicity, disability and language. Although results this spring from the Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program test showed modest gains overall in language arts and math, achievement gaps between various student groups was substantial.
About 75% of Asian students and 68% of white students were proficient in language arts, for example, but only 39% of Black students and 34% of Latino students reached proficiency. Percentages were lower for students with disabilities (15%) and multilingual learners (11%). About 34.5% of “economically disadvantaged” students were proficient in language arts.
Minor gains made in Maryland test scores, but wide demographic gaps remain

Math proficiency scores were even lower for those students:

Blacks: 14%
Latinos: 13.8%
Economically disadvantaged:13.1%
Students with disabilities: 7.6%
Multilingual learners: 7.2%

State Superintendent Carey Wright said it will take more work than just looking at an entire subgroup of students to make gains.
“When you get your data back in, you look to see who’s doing well, who’s not,” Wright said to reporters after the meeting’s morning session. “We continue to do that work with the schools, but I think that you can’t just look at a whole subgroup and assume that one intervention is going to be the same for all kids in a subgroup. You better really look at each individual student.”
One way to help those students is through implementation of a goal approved last year to cut chronic absenteeism by half, from 30% reported in 2022-23 school year to 15% during this school year. Any student who misses 10% of school days is considered chronically absent; the current chronic absenteeism is 25%.
“If the kids are not in school, it is difficult to ensure that they get the kind of instruction that they need. So we are looking at those things comprehensively,” Blueprint board chair Isiah “Ike” Leggett told reporters.
The state formed an attendance task force and is partnering with a nonprofit called Attendance Works to come with up solutions, such as having all 24 school districts have a group “responsible for implementing the systemwide attendance strategy and supporting school attendance teams.”
No specific goal was set on how much of an improvement the state is looking to see in those student groups.
At least two goals established Tuesday are to increase kindergarten readiness rates for each student group and decrease achievement gaps among those students, with some data anticipated by December.
Geoff Sanderson, deputy state superintendent of accountability for the State Department of Education, said a data dashboard will be presented to state board of education next month.

Several education advocates, who support the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan and serve as members of the Blueprint Coalition, said more work must be done to improve student achievement.
sharlimar douglass, lead advocate and education policy analyst for the Maryland Alliance for Racial Equity, said Blueprint implementation should focus on racial equity.
“This means prioritizing investments in high-quality instruction, early literacy supports, rigorous and relevant math curricula and culturally affirming learning and guidance,” she said during public comment to both boards. “If we are not centering children’s humanity through love, there is no strategy, no professional book, or instructional method in the world that can prepare the teacher to elevate the child.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Joshua-Michael-Ike-Leggett-and-Brit-Kirwan-9-30-2025-1024x623.jpg,,,2025-10-01 01:57:56.669400

How many people know that during World War II the U.S. government funded childcare and school meals for hundreds of thousands of children. During the war millions of women were called from their homes to work in factories and production lines.  Women could not perform these essential jobs without childcare. Children’s care and nutrition was rightly seen as essential. In response, a nationwide network of childcare centers was established.

Credit: Carol Williams
In 1943, my mother was asked to set up and manage the childcare network for Evansville, Indiana. She insisted that every child receive a hot school meal. The result: in Evansville and across the United States was the most comprehensive childcare system ever created in this country. It is estimated that at its peak, 3,000 centers across 49 states served up to 600,000 children ages 2–12. Open year-round, often 12 hours a day to coordinate with factory shifts, these centers offered meals, education, recreation, and health care —a true whole-child approach. After the war, returning men reclaimed factory jobs, and women were pressured to leave the workforce. By 1946, funding was eliminated and the system collapsed.
Fast forward to 2025: more women than ever are working, often out of necessity in the face of skyrocketing living costs. Connecticut has taken a bold step with the Early Childhood Education Endowment, aiming to build a comprehensive childcare system for pre-K to six that includes school meals but there is still no plan to provide free school meals for all children.
Universal, nutritious school meals are not a luxury. They improve student health, reduce the risk of chronic illnesses like obesity and diabetes, boost learning and academic achievement, reduce stigma for children, and mitigate the stress of food insecurity for families.
Meanwhile, federal support that helps feed needy children is under threat. Food banks have already experienced deep cuts. Covenant Soup Kitchen in Willimantic is receiving 400 pounds a day less food due to these cuts. It is likely in the near future that there will be cuts to SNAP and reductions in school meal subsidies that will leave thousands of children hungry. Connecticut cannot wait.
Our governor and legislative leaders must act now, in the upcoming special session, to ensure free school meals for all children.  We succeeded during World War II. Surely, in one of the richest states in the nation, amid record-high food prices, we can provide healthy breakfasts, lunches, and snacks for every child.
Feeding our kids is not charity —it’s common sense, and it’s an investment in the future of Connecticut.

Laws can take effect immediately upon being signed, on July 1 with the start of the state’s fiscal year, on Oct. 1, or even on Jan. 1.
Many of the laws that take effect today change the state’s criminal or civil statutes.
Here are some of the more interesting statutory changes the Legislature passed in the spring and Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law that take effect today.
 SB 150 Trooper’s Law

The story of how Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Orlando Morales found an abandoned dog along Interstate 75 as Hurricane Milton advanced tugged at heartstrings and made headlines. The Leon County Humane Society, where the rescued dog was transferred, named the bull terrier “Trooper” to honor  Morales, who found the dog after responding to a report of an animal in distress. 
“It took several loops, but I thank God that He gave me the right time and right place of where to be, and after the second or third loop, I was able to find a dog clearly in water, in distress,” Morales said. “And it was a horrific moment to be in.”

Trooper’s owner, Giovanny Aldama Garcia, 23, was arrested on Oct. 14 2024.
Sen. Don Gaetz, a former Senate president, moved quickly to file the legislation (SB 150) that makes it a third-degree felony to restrain and abandon an animal during a natural disaster.
 SB 168 the “Tristin Murphy Act”

Among other things, this new law requires the state’s Northwest Regional Data Center to develop a behavioral health care data repository to create, collect, and analyze existing statewide data related to behavioral health care in the state. The results are intended to clarify the scope of and trends in behavioral health services, spending, and outcomes. plus the relationship between behavioral health, criminal justice, and incarceration.
The center is required to collaborate with the state Commission on Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder to develop and submit to legislative leaders by Dec. 1 a data collection and analysis implementation plan and proposed budget for the work. The center is required — beginning  Dec. 1, 2026 — to annually submit a report to the governor and legislative leaders on the trends it finds.
 HB 253 No flippers in Florida

Florida has joined the likes of Texas, Washington, and Tennessee in making it illegal to sell or manufacture license plate flippers, devices that allow drivers to obscure or conceal their license plates at the press of a button. While they were traditionally used at auto shows, allowing cars to switch between custom and decorative plates, the flippers can also be used to hide license plates from law enforcement, toll systems, or automated speed cameras.
Possessing a license plate flipper is a second-degree misdemeanor under the new law while selling or manufacturing a flipper is a first-degree misdemeanor.

 HB 437 Electronic monitoring

Rep. Dan Daley’s legislation increases the criminal penalties for tampering with electronic monitoring devices and mandates termination of pretrial release for anyone who interferes with their electronic monitoring device.
Daley, a Democrat from Coral Springs, is an assistant state attorney in Broward County. On the House website, Daley says he filed the legislation to “enhance the integrity of our criminal justice system.” 
“By removing these devices, offenders could disappear and potentially commit more crimes while avoiding accountability,” Daley’s statement says.
The new law also alters the penalties a court can impose upon adults for intentionally removing, destroying, or tampering with an electronic monitor, tying the level of the new offense to the severity of the underlying crime.
 HB 693 Capital felonies and the death sentence

Beginning today, juries can take into consideration whether a crime victim was gathered with one or more persons for a school activity, religious activity, or public government meeting as an aggravating factor in determining whether a defendant who has been convicted of a capital felony is eligible to receive a death sentence.
The list of aggravating factors before the changes in the new law required the jury to make one or more of eight findings, stemming from the capital felony being committed by a convicted felon, to the defendant knowingly creating a great risk of death to many people, to a capital felony being committed for pecuniary gain.
 HB 757 Lewd lascivious images/child porography

Possession of a lewd or lascivious image with intent to promote the image now is a second-degree felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison, 15 years of probation, and a $10,000 fine. 
Possession of a lewd or lascivious image without the intent to promote it is now a third-degree felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
The new law makes it a third-degree felony to solicit child pornography. It adds to the list of third-degree felonies willfully generating an altered sexual depiction, soliciting an altered sexual depiction, and possessing any altered sexual depiction with the intent to maliciously promote without the consent of the identifiable person.
The identifiable persons who didn’t consent to their image being promoted can now sue for damages up to $10,000 or actual damages incurred, as well as reasonable attorney fees and costs.
 SB 948 Rental rights

Landlords are now required to give tenants and prospective tenants information regarding flood risks and past flooding of their rental properties. Tenants who do not receive the mandated disclosures who suffer substantial damages due to flooding can terminate their leases and are entitled to a refund of their deposits under the new law.
 HB 1121 Drones and contraband

Taking a page out of Georgia’s experience with a drone-based contraband operation at prisons, the Florida Legislature passed a bill this spring that increases penalties for a person who operates a drone over or near a critical infrastructure facility or operates or possesses a drone with an attached weapon or firearm.
Specifically, the new law increases the penalty from a second-degree misdemeanor to a third-degree felony if the drone is operated over a critical infrastructure facility, including detention centers, unless the operation is authorized in compliance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations.
Bill sponsor Rep. Jennifer Canady says on the House website that Georgia arrested 150 people in the Operation Skyhawk sting, which focused an alleged drone-based contraband operation in Georgia prisons.
“Every type of contraband, from cellphones and drones to drugs and weapons, were confiscated. Florida needs to be forward-thinking in the oversight of technology that can be used for harm.”
The new law prohibits a person from possessing or operating a drone carrying a weapon of mass destruction or a hoax weapon of mass destruction. A violation is punishable as a first-degree felony. 
“By enacting these changes, Florida will take a proactive stance in curbing the misuse of unmanned aircraft systems, helping to safeguard critical infrastructure, improve prison security, and protect the public from potential domestic threats,” Canady’s statement says.
 HB 1351 Sexual predators, offenders, and reporting requirements

Sexual predators and offenders now have to report where they work and their work phone numbers under a new law that takes effect today. The law requires local law enforcement officers to verify a sexual predator’s address four times a year and once per year for sexual offenders. 
There is no definition in statute of sexual offenders but there are legislative findings that describe repeat sexual offenders and sexual offenders as people who prey on children and who present an extreme threat to the public safety.
 “Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant,” the statutes say.

 SB 1386 Protecting power workers

Florida residents know hurricanes can bring power outages and that can make folks overheated and angry. To protect line workers and others from irate residents, regardless of whether it’s hurricane season, the Legislature passed SB 136. The law reclassifies criminal charges for knowingly committing an assault or battery against a utility worker while he or she is engaging in work. 
The staff analysis of the new law notes there “have been several reported instances of assault or battery against a utility officer in Florida over the past few years.”  They include a Hillsborough County resident who in a fit of anger “backed his vehicle into the utility pole and then threatened to shoot the utility workers who attempted to prevent him from fleeing the scene. Another instance took place in February 2025 involving a woman from Polk County who released her dogs on two utility workers who were investigating possible utility theft.”

Newsroom employees at the News and the Peninsula Clarion submitted their resignations on Monday, Sept. 29, 2025, to protest the actions of the newspaper's ownership. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Reporters and editors at the Homer News and Peninsula Clarion announced their resignations on Monday, citing a decision by the papers’ corporate owners to bow to political pressure to amend an article about a vigil for the slain far-right activist Charlie Kirk.
The resignations, which include two editors and two reporters based in Homer and Kenai, were scheduled to take effect in two weeks, but managers at Carpenter Media Group fired all four immediately. 
Carpenter Media Group, an international chain, owns the News, Clarion and the Juneau Empire, as well as the Yukon News and hundreds of other newspapers in the Lower 48 and Canada.
The resignations follow a similar mass resignation at the Juneau Empire earlier this summer. 
When combined, both actions leave Carpenter Media Group with a single in-state Alaska reporter among its three newspapers.
Mary Kemmis, senior vice president of Carpenter’s publications in Alaska and Canada, did not return phone calls seeking comment on Tuesday, nor did Chloe Pleznac, the reporter who authored the original article.
Jake Dye, a former reporter for the Peninsula Clarion and one of the people who resigned this week, said by phone that Carpenter’s handling of the story was “problematic in a lot of ways.”
Charlie Kirk, a far-right commentator, free speech activist and Christian nationalist who was an ally of President Donald Trump, was shot and killed on Sept. 10 at an appearance in Utah. One person has been arrested and charged with his killing and is awaiting trial.
Since his killing, conservatives, including many Republicans, have held rallies to memorialize Kirk.
After a vigil in Homer, Pleznac published an article describing Kirk as a “far-right political activist and Christian-Nationalist icon,” and went on to describe his “often racist and controversial views” before going on to detail the vigil.
Soon after the article was published, Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, published a letter on official state legislative letterhead that criticized the characterization of Kirk and the Homer News coverage and said in part, “If the paper continues to treat community events as opportunities for partisan spin, the consequence will be financial as well as reputational.”
After the letter, which was reprinted on her legislative Facebook page, Carpenter officials rewrote the article without consulting editors or reporters at the Homer News, according to the resigning staff, according to the staff who resigned.
Afterward, Vance thanked the newspaper’s owners for the change.
Vance did not answer a phone call and text message Tuesday asking about the incident.
In their resignation letter, Carpenter’s Alaska reporters and editors said they don’t have an issue with Vance’s perspective but “what we do have a problem with is Carpenter Media management changing a story at the behest of an elected official. We believe this destroys the credibility the public has placed in us as reporters and editors.”
The worry, the resigning staff said, is that having once caved to political pressure, Carpenter Media will invite further attempts to steer news coverage by political officials and people who are part of the story.
“We cannot do our jobs knowing that pressure from an elected official can mean our stories are edited without prior consultation with us,” the resignation letter says.
Vance’s letter to Carpenter Media comes amid nationwide pressure by Republican and conservative officials to clamp down on language deemed critical of Kirk. Some states have launched investigations of university officials and other public employees for comments made on social media.
The three publications were owned by Georgia-based Morris Communications until 2017, when they were purchased by New Jersey-based GateHouse Media. Later that year, they were sold again to Washington-based Sound Publishing, a division of Canada-based Black Press.
Carpenter Media Group bought Black Press in 2024.
In Juneau, the entire reporting staff of the Juneau Empire — including seasonal interns — resigned simultaneously amid complaints about low pay, benefits and a lack of institutional support. 
The former editor of that newspaper has since gone on to help start an independent, nonprofit newsroom for capital-city news.
Dye, by phone on Tuesday, said he’s not sure what’s next for either himself or the Peninsula Clarion. Journalism in Alaska as a whole is in a dim spot amid budget cuts to public media, he said, but he’s trying to stay optimistic.
“There’s not a lot of light at the end of the tunnel, but I guess I truly believe that somehow, things are going to work out for the state and for us,” he said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/15-Homer-News-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-30 23:57:33.773472

(Photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Holly Hugunin/U.S. Coast Guard)After months of uncertainty amid the Trump administration’s deep cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the council that manages commercial fisheries in federal waters off Alaska now has all the federal funding that had been allocated to it for 2025 operations.
But the North Pacific Fishery Management Council now faces a new source of uncertainty: the federal government shutdown.
The funding and shutdown complications have reshaped the council’s October meeting, underway this week.
The meeting is being held entirely online, based on a decision made in June when officials were unsure if they could pay for an in-person event in Anchorage, the usual meeting site.. At the time, the council had received less than half of its grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for 2025 operations.
Later in the summer, the council got assurances that it had its full operational grant, said executive director Dave Witherell.
“The good news is that in July, we received an additional allotment of grant funding, and in August, we received the remainder of the 2025 grant funding,” Witherell said by email.
The news about funding came too late for the council to change its plans and switch to an in-person event.
The meeting agenda, meanwhile, has been hastily revised because of the likely absences later in the week of many federal scientists who normally present to and advise the council.
Ian Stewart, co-chair of the council’s Scientific and Statistical Committee, advised his colleagues of the late agenda switches as the shutdown loomed.
“We have got some fairly major schedule changes today in order to make the best use of our time with the federal employees while they’re with us,” Stewart said on Tuesday, the second day of that committee’s meeting.
North Pacific Fishery Management Council meetings start with meetings of the organization’s Scientific and Statistical Committee and Advisory Panel. The full council starts its proceedings a few days later, using advice from the affiliated committees. This week, the full council is scheduled to start its meeting on Thursday.
The impacts of both the budget uncertainties and the shutdown create a less-than-ideal situation, officials said.

	Witherell said in-person meetings are “highly preferable” for the council because they allow for conversations and information exchanges between advisers, scientists, council members, council staff and the public, he said.
The public can still tune in to the online meeting and give oral testimony, though the deadline for written comments has passed.
“In-person meetings also build trust and relationships as people get to speak to each other during breaks and before and after the meetings,” he said by email. “One could make the case that more informed decisions lead to better outcomes.”
The shutdown challenges now threaten to force postponement of some of the work the council had expected to do at the current meeting, Witherell said.
Among the items on the agenda at this meeting are decisions about Bering Sea snow crab and red king crab management. Those are high-profile issues because key harvests have only recently resumed after being shut down for consecutive seasons because of stock crashes.
Also on the agenda, and due for a final council vote, are adjustments to rules for what is called the “maximum retainable amount,” a metric used for the incidental catch of untargeted species by commercial fishing vessels. The changes being contemplated could apply to all commercial vessel types operating in the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands and Gulf of Alaska.
Wetherell said the proceedings are being adjusted to account for the possibility that federal scientists might not be able to participate.
If scientists from NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service are not available to answer questions, the council’s members will have to decide whether they have enough information to proceed with action, Wetherall said.
One agenda item that will be dropped if there is a shutdown is discussion of what is known as Essential Fish Habitat, or EFH, Wetherell said. Identification of Essential Fish Habitat informs fishery plans.
A federal government shutdown threatens to limit the availability of fish stock information used to guide harvest management, the executive director of NOAA’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center said Tuesday.
Bob Foy, who heads the center, said there is a contingency plan in place for a federal government shutdown.
If the shutdown lasts for fewer than five days, “then we would plan for all the assessments to be completed as scheduled for the current year,” he told the Scientific and Statistical Committee.
But impacts of a long shutdown could be serious, Foy said.
“If we go greater than 15 business days, that’s going to dramatically impact our ability to produce our stock assessments in time for our internal and your review deadlines. We would not likely meet any of those deadlines,” he said.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A woman sentenced to life in a Georgia state prison has been convicted of manufacturing and sending bombs to federal courthouses in Anchorage and Washington, D.C. while incarcerated.
No one was injured by the incendiary devices, which were detected and defused. 
Lena Summerlin, who is transgender and is identified in court records by her birth name, David Cassady, pleaded guilty to two federal felonies and was sentenced last week to two concurrent 40-year terms in federal prison. She is already serving a life sentence in state prison for a variety of crimes.
Three other charges were dismissed as part of a plea deal signed in March.
Summerlin’s sentence, announced last week by prosecutors in South Carolina, was covered by Court Watch, a national newsletter covering events in federal courthouses across the country.
According to court documents, in January 2020, Summerlin sent two crude devices consisting of batteries and alcohol-based hand sanitizer to the U.S. Justice Department in Washington, D.C. and the federal courthouse in Anchorage.
“My plan, under no circumstances, was to impose harm on anyone,” Summerlin said in a sentencing document. “It was simply to obtrude awareness of the downtrodden, murderous conditions at Georgia State Prison.”
Summerlin has repeatedly alleged that conditions in Georgia prisons are violent and did not provide adequate protections for LGBTQ individuals. In 2018, she won a financial settlement after physical and sexual assault by other inmates and a prison guard.
As part of her plea deal, she requested that she serve her sentence in a federal prison, where she believes conditions are better for transgender inmates.
Sentencing documents were unclear as to why Summerlin chose to send a bomb to Anchorage, and federal officials familiar with the case did not answer questions about the incident.
According to court documents, the device Summerlin sent to Anchorage was opened by a clerk who triggered a panic alarm when she noticed wires in the package.
U.S. Marshals evacuated the courthouse, contacted bomb technicians and authorities.
Summerlin manufactured three other similar devices that were not sent through the mail. When the devices sent to Anchorage and Washington, D.C. were not immediately discovered, she announced her plans to prison officials in Georgia. 
It was not clear why federal prosecutors waited four years after the 2020 incident to charge Summerlin with a crime. The case was filed in Georgia’s southern U.S. District Court but prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in South Carolina.
In a sentencing memorandum, prosecutors wrote that regardless of Summerlin’s reasons for sending the devices, they “cannot mitigate or alleviate the seriousness of this case. The Defendant put innocent people in harms way who had no contribution to any alleged mistreatment in prison.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC08582-straightened-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 21:56:54.570728

Senate Democrats again on Tuesday blocked Republicans’ temporary government funding bill, citing the expiration of Affordable Care Act enhanced premium tax credits that since 2021 have lowered health insurance costs tied to an enrollee’s income. The standoff means a federal government shutdown will begin after midnight Tuesday.

Tony Gonzales, of Indiana County, Pennsylvania, told the crowd he worries how losing the premium tax credits will affect his family’s finances as he continues treatment for thymic carcinoma, a rare cancer he was diagnosed with two years ago.“I need these subsidies. If the rich and the Republicans can go out there and have money for tax cuts, to buy another yacht, to go out in space, why can't I at least have health care to address my needs, my wife's needs, and maintain a lifestyle that we deserve as an American family?” said Gonzales.Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said her constituents are “standing on a health insurance cliff right now” and she will not support a Republican funding proposal until GOP lawmakers agree to extend the health insurance subsidies.

“When I hear them say, ‘oh, we'll look at this in December, we'll look at this in January.’ This is not a December thing. This is not a January thing. This is a now thing,” she said.Open enrollment for health care plans begins Nov. 1 in most states, except Idaho, where it begins Oct. 15.

Annual insurance premiums could double on average in 2026 if the subsidies expire at year’s end, according to an analysis published Tuesday by the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF.The enhanced premium tax credits were extended through 2025 under the Democrat-led budget reconciliation law in 2022, otherwise known as the Inflation Reduction Act.

(Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)FAYETTEVILLE — A federal judge delayed ruling Tuesday in a case challenging new state laws that plaintiffs argue violate the First Amendment and hinder their ability to collect signatures for citizen-initiated ballot measures. 
The original suit was brought by ballot committee Save AR Democracy and the League of Women Voters of Arkansas, which is in the process of gathering signatures for a 2026 ballot initiative. League President Bonnie Miller and Benton County chapter President Danielle Quesnell are also plaintiffs. 
Two other ballot question groups, Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, joined as intervenor-plaintiffs in July. Arkansas Secretary of State Cole Jester and Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin are defendants. 
The plaintiffs say the laws are intended to stifle direct democracy, a process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. They asked Chief Judge Timothy Brooks of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas to issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against six of the laws they are challenging while the lawsuit is ongoing. 
Brooks’ delay means the 2025 laws, now in effect, will continue to apply.

The 2025 laws include numerous rules that significantly tighten the requirements for signature gathering on ballot initiatives. Canvassers must now inform signers that petition fraud is a criminal offense, request a photo ID from potential signers, and ensure the potential signer reads the petition’s ballot title or has it read to them, with failure to do so resulting in a misdemeanor charge. Another 2025 law prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level. 
Another recent law the plaintiffs are seeking to halt requires ballot question committees to submit all the names and addresses of canvassers to the Attorney General’s Office in advance of certification, a provision the plaintiffs’ attorneys argue would essentially make public sensitive private information that bad actors could take advantage of, as the records are subject to public disclosure under the state’s Freedom of Information Act. The law also gives the attorney general discretion to toss out signatures if canvassers did not disclose their names and addresses prior to submitting the petitions.
A 2023 law also being challenged by the plaintiffs in Pulaski County Circuit Court forces canvassers to collect signatures from voters in 50 counties, as opposed to the previous 15-county requirement.
Brooks did not indicate which way he intended to rule, but emphasized it will take time to come to a conclusion after nearly four hours of debate, in addition to hundreds of pages of court documents and affidavits he accepted into the record on Tuesday. 
“There’s a lot for the court to consider,” Brooks said. “But we will issue a written judgement as soon as we can.” 
In comments immediately following the hearing, Miller told the Arkansas Advocate she was “feeling good” about the afternoon’s proceedings. 
“This has been something that we’ve been working on for a really long time, so it was wonderful to be in court today,” Miller said. “We’re hopeful that we can get some relief because we’re out collecting signatures right now.”
David Couch, attorney for the League of Women Voters of Arkansas, also took a positive view.  
“I feel just as good coming out as I went in,” Couch said immediately after. “I think these laws are unconstitutional. I think we clearly showed that to the judge today.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders Tuesday for setting a special election to fill her father’s seat for next June, leaving his district without representation during the 2026 fiscal session.
Speaking at a press conference at the state Capitol called by Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, Amber Sullivan said her efforts to get answers about the timing of the special election have gone nowhere. She urged Arkansans to contact Sanders’ office and state legislators.
Stubblefield died Sept. 2. Sanders declared the seat vacant on Sept. 15.
“My father represented his people. He loved his state, loved his country and he loved Franklin County,” Sullivan said. “His seat should not go unrepresented for eight months, nine months — it shouldn’t go five months unrepresented.”
After resistance, Sanders revises election date to fill vacant Arkansas Senate seat

Arkansas law requires governors to call a special election to fill a vacant legislative seat within 150 days, unless they find it impractical or too burdensome to do so. Jan. 30 would be 150 days from Stubblefield’s death; Feb. 12 would be 150 days from Sanders’ declaration of a vacancy.
Last week Sanders said she set the special election dates to coincide with next year’s midterm elections “to save taxpayer money,” streamline the election process and maximize voter turnout. She later revised the schedule after bipartisan outcry, but the general election will still fall after the conclusion of the 2026 fiscal session.
The special primary currently coincides with the midterm primaries on March 31, 2025. The special general election will be June 9. The Legislature’s fiscal session starts in April and ends May.
Sullivan said the need for a more immediate election is about more than having a voice on the controversial Franklin County prison project, which her father and many in Senate District 26 strongly oppose. The voters in District 26 “deserve a voice” in legislative debates on matters such as health insurance and education that will come up between now and next June. She called on Sanders to move the election up.
King excoriated the scheduling move by Sanders, comparing her revised decision to hold the special general election next June to voter fraud. He said the governor was intentionally trying to deprive District 26 of a legislative voice. One vote in the Senate, he said, “can impact millions of dollars.”
“This governor believes that [District 26] should not have representation during one of these crucial times,” said King, who has been, like Stubblefield, a vocal opponent of the prison site chosen by Sanders’ administration. “These people in Franklin County, who are going to be the most possibly impacted for decades, are not going to have a voice down here.”
Feds considering immigration detention facility at Franklin County prison site

Sanders spokesperson Sam Dubke on Tuesday repeated Sanders’ assertion that the election-date decision was meant to save the state money.
“Following conversations with election officials, the Governor decided that holding the primary for District 26 on the statewide primary date and holding the special election on the soonest possible primary date afterward saves taxpayer dollars and ensures the election is free, fair, and secure,” Dubke wrote in a text message.
The cost of holding an election entirely separate from the regular dates ranged from $41,000 to $55,000, depending on if poll workers were hired, according to a spokesperson from Secretary of State Cole Jester’s office. Under the current schedule, that means the state stands to save $20,500.
King invoked former President Theodore Roosevelt and said the idea that an election could not be held sooner was “bullfeathers.” He pointed to the 2021 special election to replace former Republican Sen. Lance Eads in District 7. Eads resigned at the end of October 2021. His replacement was elected at the beginning of February 2022.
“You’re basically allowing stolen representation,” King said.
Samantha Boyd, Jester’s spokesperson, said state and federal law contained “minimum timeline standards” for overseas voters and members of the military that made June the earliest possible date for the general election with a March primary. She also said under current law, absentee ballots must be prepared by a county election board at least 47 days in advance of a primary or general election.

During the closure, police searched the Elvey Building and surrounding areas.
Just before 10:40 a.m., the university police department issued an “all-clear” message saying that they found no explosive device. The campus reopened, classes resumed, and employees returned to their offices.
Police say the threat remains under investigation.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Tuesday he is hopeful the Trump administration will come up with a plan to “improve morale among farmers” in response to the apparent loss of the Chinese soybean export market. 
China is historically the largest foreign buyer of U.S. soybeans, but after leveraging retaliatory tariffs in response to those imposed by President Donald Trump, the country has turned elsewhere for its soybean shipments this year. 
According to reporting from Reuters, China bought roughly 1.3 million tons of soybeans from Argentina. The same week, the Trump administration announced a $20 billion bailout deal with Argentina. 
Grassley, during a call with reporters Tuesday, reiterated his previously expressed “resentment” at the Argentinian bail-out that coincided with the country lowering its export taxes and China swooping into make a deal.
“You can’t blame China for jumping in to save their own money and get their own products cheaper,” Grassley said. 
The Iowa Republican said he has been in conversation with U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins about the situation and said she is working on a solution to help farmers “without getting money from Congress.” 
Grassley said Rollins and the president have mentioned using money from U.S. imposed tariffs to support U.S. soybean farmers, but he said “nothing’s put together yet.” 
Grassley said the challenges associated with the loss of market for soybean farmers are “reminiscent” of farmer struggles during the farm crisis of the 1980s. 
Iowa Soybean Association President Tom Adam said in an article published by the association that the federal government’s “lifeline to Argentina” was “poorly timed and inexcusable.” 
“This is especially true considering the much-publicized financial pain U.S. ag has been experiencing due to an ongoing trade war with our country’s most reliable and significant purchasers of soybeans,” Adam said in the article. “With harvest underway in Iowa and throughout key soybean growing regions around the country, now is the time for making U.S. soybean sales, not empowering our competitors.” 
Iowa Soybean Association’s senior director of market development, Grant Kimberly, said the amount of beans China will be able to purchase from Argentina could be enough to “sustain its needs for soy” until Brazil harvests its soybean crop in January.
China first turned to Brazil for soybeans during the trade wars of Trump’s first term in office. The trade war in 2018 caused serious market loss for U.S. farmers and resulted in more than $23 billion paid to farmers, from the federal government, for relief. 
Grassley said the best thing the president can do for U.S. farmers is to reach a settlement “very quickly” with China.
“I want the bottom line to be that farmers don’t want to get money from the federal treasury, they want to get it from the market,” Grassley said. 
Grassley criticizes Dems as shutdown appears imminent
Congressional Democrats are standing firm on a series of demands, that Republicans disagree with, on the stopgap spending bill that would prevent a government shutdown. 
Grassley said instead of passing the “clean” funding bill Republicans proposed that is “nearly identical” to one that passed six months ago, Democrats are instead appeasing “the radical activists in their base.” 
Midnight federal shutdown edges closer as US Senate fails to agree on spending bills

“Democrats voted 13 times for a clean, short term funding bill under President Biden,” Grassley said. “The only difference I see now is Democrats see a Republican in the White House.”
If the Senate does not pass a bill by midnight on Tuesday, the government will shut down and hundreds of thousands of government employees will be furloughed.  
Grassley said the holdup is that Democrats want to attach a “massive partisan spending bill” that will cost taxpayers “more than $1 trillion.” 
According to reporting from States Newsroom’s D.C. Bureau, Democrats’ bill accounts for rising health care costs they assert have occurred from the Republican sponsored tax and spending cuts law referred to as the “one big beautiful bill.” 
“You’ve heard me say before, government is a service to the people,” Grassley said. “How can you serve the people if government is shut down? It costs money to shut government down, it costs money to open the government back up again. I hope my Democrat colleagues will drop their partisan proposal and work with Republicans to keep government open.”

Catherine Cortez Masto was one of only two Democrats voting with Republicans against a government shutdown Tuesday.
Cortez Masto was also one of ten Senate Democrats who voted with Republicans in March to avert a shutdown.   
“This administration doesn’t care about Nevadans, but I do. That’s why I cannot support a costly shutdown that would hurt Nevada families and hand even more power to this reckless administration,” Cortez Masto said in a news release Tuesday afternoon. “We need a bipartisan solution to address this impending health care crisis, but we should not be swapping the pain of one group of Americans for another. I remain focused on protecting health care for working families, and I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to tackle this problem.”
John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was the other Democrat voting for a continuing resolution to keep the government operating for another seven weeks beyond Sept. 30. Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Senate Democrats, also voted to keep the government open.
Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky voted with the majority of the Democrats in opposition to the resolution.
Cortez Masto’s office noted a shutdown would “force tens of thousands of Nevada military personnel, union members, law enforcement agents and military nurses to work without pay.”
Union contractors at the Nevada National Security Site would be out of work and would not receive pay in the event of a shutdown, according to Cortez Masto’s news release.

(C-SPAN screengrab)A federal judge Monday granted defense motions to disqualify Nevada’s Acting U.S. Attorney Sigal Chattah in three felony cases brought by Chattah after her term as Interim U.S. Attorney expired in July. 
Chattah was initially appointed Interim U.S. Attorney by Attorney General Pam Bondi for 120 days. When her term expired at the end of July, Bondi appointed Chattah as Acting U.S. Attorney, a position that could keep her in the post indefinitely. 
A provision of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows the administration to fill a vacancy by appointing the first assistant as acting U.S. Attorney. However, Chattah never held the position of top deputy. 
“Alternatively, the President may direct either certain senior officials of the agency or any Senate-confirmed official to serve as the acting officer,” the act says. 
Only two of President Donald Trump’s second-term picks for U.S. attorney have been confirmed by the Senate.   
In a move designed to prevent Chattah from serving in the acting role, Nevada’s Federal Public Defender filed motions to dismiss three indictments brought by Chattah after her term as U.S. attorney expired. In the alternative, the public defender asked the court to “disqualify her (Chattah) and the attorneys she supervises.”
The Vacancies Reform Act, Judge David Campbell wrote in an order released Tuesday, “is a carefully crafted assertion” of Congressional power. “Its purpose would be defeated if the Executive Branch – the very branch Congress was trying to constrain – could choose whomever it wanted, whenever it wanted, and fill the vacancy simply by declaring that person to be first assistant.”
The administration’s position, according to the public defender’s motions, that it may “backfill anyone of their choosing into the first assistant role post-vacancy and thus elevate that person to the acting role — is wrong.” 
The minute order filed in the case says Chattah and her attorneys are disqualified from supervising the cases. 
The Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice, an organization of criminal defense lawyers, filed an amicus brief in the cases. 
“By bypassing the Senate and naming Sigal Chattah as an ‘acting’ U.S. attorney, it’s clear the Trump administration knows Ms. Chattah is unconfirmable,” Nevada’s senior U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said in a statement in July. “This unprecedented maneuver sets a dangerous standard and risks holding up critical criminal cases just so that President Trump can play political games. At the end of the day, my position remains the same: Sigal Chattah is unfit for this role.”
Also in July, U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen called Bondi’s appointment of Chattah as acting U.S. Attorney “an outrageous attempt by the Trump Administration,” adding the president “knows Chattah would be soundly rejected by both sides of the aisle,” if brought before the Senate for confirmation. She called on the legal system “to immediately remove her.” 
Last month, a federal judge ruled Alina Habba, the Trump administration’s pick for U.S. Attorney of New Jersey, has served “without lawful authority” since July 1, when her 120 day appointment expired. 
A panel of federal judges named Habba’s deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the post, in accordance with the law, but the Trump administration fired Grace and reinstated Habba. The administration is appealing the ruling that Habba’s tenure ended July 1. 
Nevada’s federal judges had the opportunity under the law to name a replacement for Chattah, but did not. In a July letter, 116 former jurists from around the U.S. urged the Nevada judges “not to entrust Chattah with authority we fear she will misuse.”
On Tuesday, Reuters reported Chattah asked the Department of Justice to launch an investigation into the 2020 election, and hopes the outcome assists Republicans in winning the Congressional seat held by U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford.
In August, Chattah told KLAS-TV that a federal election case is underway and dismissed questions about her potential conflicts of interest, given her partisan role as Republican National Committeewoman, which had unsuccessfully filed suits claiming Joe Biden’s 2020 defeat of Trump in Nevada was fraudulent. Chattah relinquished her RNC role after she was appointed U.S. Attorney.   
“We prosecute the crime, not the criminal. Period. End of story, ” Chattah said in the KLAS interview. said. “It’s a non-partisan issue. Whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat, or you know, you’re legally here, illegally here, whatever your crime is, we prosecute the criminal.”
The Reuters’ story reports Chattah is also seeking to exonerate six Republicans charged by Attorney General Aaron Ford with posing as fake electors in 2020 in order to cast Nevada’s electoral votes for Trump. The first case, filed in Clark County, was dismissed for lack of venue. That ruling is being appealed. Ford also filed a second case in Carson City.  
Chattah represented one of the men charged by Ford. 
“She is urging the Justice Department to pursue an investigation that she says is going to exonerate her former client,” Kathleen Clark, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, told Reuters. “I believe that action on her part violates the impartiality regulation.”
During her unsuccessful run in 2022 for Nevada attorney general, Chattah declared her Democratic opponent, incumbent Ford, a Black man, “should be hanging from a f–king crane”; longed for fewer “pronoun badges” and transgender individuals in America, while describing them with an offensive slur; and invited comparisons with Sen. Joe McCarthy and former Pres. Donald Trump by calling for the imprisonment of political foes.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-3-28-25-at-2.00-PM-1024x543.jpeg,,,2025-09-30 19:58:05.491807

The answer is no: The commission will miss that deadline by at least one week, in the wake of two resignations sought and received by Gov. Jim Pillen of liquor regulators who jointly served on the medical cannabis board.
The Medical Cannabis Commission confirmed the new timeline Tuesday at a meeting originally meant to approve the first cultivator licenses and move toward the first steps of a medical cannabis supply chain in the state. However, two of the five cannabis commissioners resigned Monday, both of whom served on a three-member team evaluating and scoring cultivator applications received by Sept. 23.
Now, the remaining commissioners will independently review applications by next Tuesday, when commissioners will meet to decide whether to award up to four cultivator licenses.

“We would just ask for your understanding that this is a situation that none of us created in this, where we’re at right here,” Commissioner Lorelle Mueting of Gretna said Tuesday. “We would just hope you understand that we’re working through this the best that we can to make sure that we get the licenses issued in a timely manner and evaluated and issued in time.”
Resignations impacted timeline
Dr. Monica Oldenburg, an anesthesiologist who chairs the commission, had been on the initial evaluation team with former Commissioners Bruce Bailey of Lincoln and Kim Lowe of Kearney. The plan was to average out scores before this week’s meeting and then vote on whether to grant the first licenses.
Oldenburg, a May appointee of Pillen’s, has a narrower view of what the voters passed than Bailey and Lowe, such as on smoking. Bailey had the most permissive view of voters’ wishes.
Under a state law passed by about 67% of voters last November, with majority support in 46 of 49 legislative districts, the commission needed to, “No later than October 1, 2025, begin granting registrations to applicants that meet eligibility standards and other requirements established by the commission.” The guidelines were established by an early July 1 deadline set by voters.


Upcoming medical cannabis dates

Oct. 31, 9 a.m. — Legislative hearing on the implementation of medical cannabis in Nebraska, pushed by State Sens. John Cavanaugh, Ben Hansen and Rick Holdcroft (Nebraska State Capitol, Room 1023).


Bailey and Lowe resigned Monday, tossing a major wrench into whether the commission would meet its Wednesday licensing deadline.
Pillen’s request followed the unsealing last week of federal corruption charges against former Liquor Control Commission Executive Director Hobert “Hobie” Rupe. Rupe has pleaded not guilty. The indictment did not implicate any member of the Liquor Control Commission.
While Pillen has rejected all of the pending Liquor Control Commission regulatory changes proposed under the former director, his staff has confirmed that he has no plans to shelve medical cannabis regulations.
Bailey had chaired the Liquor Control Commission and served since 2014. Lowe had served on that commission since 2021. Retired Judge J. Michael Coffey joined the commission in June, a vacancy created after Pillen had previously requested the resignation of a third commissioner, Harry Hoch Jr., in May.
Oldenburg, Mueting and Coffey will review applications on metrics that have not been publicly released. Passing applicants need to average at least 70 out of 100. Applications were entered into a “lottery” to randomly order submissions.
Pillen opposes the legalization of recreational marijuana and has said Coffey, Mueting and Oldenburg — all his appointees — will keep Nebraska’s medical cannabis system carefully regulated. He will appoint two commissioners to succeed Bailey and Lowe.
Licensing lawsuit likely
The commission also faces a potential legal threat from Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers. His office has threatened to sue the commission once the first licenses are issued.
“This office has long held that any attempt to license entities to dispense marijuana in Nebraska violates the federal ban [on marijuana],” then-acting Deputy Solicitor General Zach Pohlman testified at a March legislative hearing. “If the Medical Cannabis Commission tries to do so, the Attorney General’s Office will challenge that action as preempted and unenforceable.”

The office has repeated the stance multiple times, including in a separate citizen-led lawsuit seeking to overturn the voter-passed laws, in which Hilgers and Pohlman say it should be the AG’s Office, not a citizen, to challenge the laws’ constitutionality. 
A spokesperson for Hilgers declined to confirm last week whether this remained the position of the Attorney General’s Office. A Pillen spokesperson, when asked last week whether the governor supported Hilgers’ efforts, directed questions to the AG’s Office.
A separate voter-passed law authorizes anyone with a health care practitioner’s recommendation to possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis in Nebraska. It passed with 71% voter support last November, including majority support in every legislative district. Nebraska became the 39th state to authorize a medical cannabis program.
‘We can get started today’
Troy Burgess, one of the cultivator applicants, said Tuesday that once a cultivator begins growing marijuana, it could be five months before anything is sent to a product manufacturer (another license type) and another 4-6 weeks before it is ready for sale at a dispensary (another license type). 
“These patients need relief. We need to get it to them,” Burgess told the commission. “We can get started today.”

The proposed regulations the commission is considering would cap the four licensed cultivators to no more than 1,250 flowering plants each at any one time. With two expected harvests in the year, that’s up to 10,000 harvestable plants, if all plants are grown successfully and are contaminant-free. The commission is anticipating an initial program to support about 20,000 patients.
All products would need to meet strict testing requirements as set by the commission.
A public hearing on the proposed regulations is set for 1 p.m. on Oct. 15 at the Nebraska State Office Building. The hearing could last up to three hours, with testifiers limited to two or three minutes apiece. 
Written comments can be submitted up to 11:59 p.m. on Oct 15 by mail to the Nebraska Medical Commission, PO Box 95046, Lincoln, NE 68509-5046; by fax at 402-471-2814 or by email to mcc.contact@nebraska.gov.
‘Integrity’
Dominic Gillen of Bellevue, who has worked with advocates of medical cannabis for more than a decade in Nebraska, spoke to the commission Tuesday about “integrity” and said the full weight of voter trust is on commissioners, not politicians behind the curtain “pulling the strings.”

“The integrity of a lawful election is being stolen by self-righteous politicians who beat their chests, trumpeting election integrity while quietly using you as a commission to undermine it,” Gillen said.
Many Nebraskans again urged the commission to approve of smoking, vaping and raw flower sales, which its proposed regulations reject. Angelica Marsaglia told commissioners they needed to implement the law, not rewrite it.
“That exceeds your authority, undermines the will of the voters and is unlawful,” Marsaglia said.
Gillen said Bailey was guilty of “honoring his commitment to the voters” and “should be hailed as a hero” for standing up for voters, such as pushing for more cultivators and a higher plant cap.
“The politicians have made their heartless choice,” Gillen said. “You, on the other hand, still have one.”
The Medical Cannabis Commission will meet next at 2 p.m. Oct. 7 in Lincoln.



What would the latest medical cannabis regulations mean?
If finalized, the state’s medical cannabis regulations would license up to four cultivators, four product manufacturers, 12 dispensaries and 12 transporters. The guidelines would also establish a “Recommending Health Care Practitioner Directory” and also make Nebraska’s program essentially a low-THC variety.
Under the regulations, patients or caregivers could purchase up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis in a 30-day period, which is about 142 grams. Of that, patients could purchase no more than 5 grams of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) from the same dispensary within 90 days. Delta-9 THC is the part of cannabis most associated with a “high.”
The regulations would allow no more than 12 medical cannabis dispensaries statewide, arranged by judicial district. That could mean one dispensary in Douglas County (584,526 residents), Lancaster County (322,608 residents), Sarpy/Cass Counties (217,202 residents) and Buffalo/Hall Counties (112,979 residents), according to 2020 census data.
Dispensaries would not be able to sell smoking or vaping products or edibles of any kind. Oral tablets with a “thin layer” of flavoring to make the products easier to swallow could be sold.
Under current law, a patient or qualified caregiver with a recommendation from any health care practitioner can legally possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis, in any form. But no licenses have yet been issued, so cannabis can’t legally be purchased in Nebraska yet.
The latest set of emergency regulations ends Dec. 7. Commissioners say that set of regulations can be extended for one additional 90-day period.
Once the Medical Cannabis Commission approves a more permanent set of regulations, commissioners will send the regulations to Attorney General Mike Hilgers for legal review and Gov. Jim Pillen for final approval.

Sept. 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThe Michigan Legislature won’t be going home Tuesday night as a final budget plan is drafted and reviewed by legal experts before coming up for a vote – which could happen on Wednesday at the earliest.
That means it is very likely that the government could enter at least a partial government shutdown while the House and Senate work out a continuation budget that would fund operations in the short-term, a promise Gov. Gretchen Whitmer made to state employees earlier on Tuesday.
Few legislators who spoke to reporters at the Capitol wanted to call it a government shutdown, but it was clear by their statements that there was no solid timeline to vote on that continuation plan before the clock strikes midnight on the fiscal year.
The facts on the ground somewhat contradicted a joint statement put out late Tuesday afternoon by Whitmer, House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), which indicated that they had a deal on a final budget plan.
There was also a continuation bill already in the Senate, as the GOP-led House somewhat anticipated that the situation would come to this breakdown months ago. The Senate has yet to pass that government shutdown avoidance plan.
After hours of meeting behind closed doors and with few details leaking through, the respective leaders of the Legislature and Whitmer said late Tuesday evening that they had finalized a budget deal that solidifies the loose framework brokered last week.
And while that was a positive development in the down-to-the-wire budget cycle, details on a hold-over budget to keep the government open weren’t readily available with less than six hours until the end of the current fiscal year.
State Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn), a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said the House was working hard to ensure that the budget was done as soon as possible. He said that no one in state government wanted to see any lapses in government services that people can count on. That included free school breakfast for K-12 students, Medicaid services, and more.
When asked how long the legal review and budget drafting process would take – if it could happen before midnight Tuesday to avoid a shutdown or the need for a continuation budget, setting up a vote on Wednesday morning – Farhat said they were exhausting every single option.
“‘Speaker Farhat’ would have had this done on July 1,” he said. “We have to get this budget done in the most responsible manner possible given the constraints we’re facing. So everything is on the table right now.”
When asked if, in his experience, between now and midnight was enough time to get that busy work done, Farhat said in his experience, the budget would have been done in July.
“These are uncharted waters, but we have the expertise and the membership to be able to handle this moment,” Farhat said.
That said, the intent was to keep representatives and senators in Lansing for as long as it takes, which could mean work into the early morning.
Farhat was asked if there will be at least a few hours gap between the end of the fiscal year and a continuation budget vote to keep the lights on, but he could not say if that was the case or how soon the chambers would pass such a bill.
“There’s been a deal that … they’ve come to and it’s being drafted,” Farhat said. “As soon as the drafting is done, we’ll have time to review it. We have time to be able to ask our questions and deliberate on it. We’ll take action, the clerks will do their job and it’ll get to the governor’s desk.”
State Rep. John Roth (R-Interlochen), who also sits on the House Appropriations Committee, said that there already was a continuation bill sitting in the Senate.
“They can [vote on] that and we could be ready,” Roth said.
It’s still unclear if the Senate is considering that as an option, or if they’ll put up their own continuation budget, which would have to reach the House before it moves to the governor, further complicating the process.
Farhat was asked if he’s had any conversations with his Senate counterparts on moving that bill.
Negative, Farhat said. But minutes later, he was seen in the Senate chatting with state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, and state Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton). Reporters also saw Democratic senators passing around a large folder which appeared to contain a resolution, but it was unclear if that was the continuation budget resolution in question.
Democrats went into caucus soon afterward.
Roth said that despite the uncertainty of the evening, the Legislature was close to being done with the budget cycle. He said he was hopeful that a vote would occur sometime Wednesday, but there were indications that it could also be another long day or night.
“Tomorrow won’t be the fact that we don’t agree on things, it’s just, ‘can they get the paperwork done?’” Roth said. “We are not going to go forward until we get some more clarity. We’re going to go after midnight. And we won’t go home until we have something ready to go at 12:01 a.m. We’ll take a few hours, get some sleep, and come back as early as we can.”
While the drafting occurs and lawmakers sit waiting, several said they were upset that they still haven’t seen the details of the final plan or how they were going to move forward with keeping the government open during a partial shutdown.
“MI budget update: At some point in the near or distant future we should receive information on what may or may not be in the budget, which we hope to vote on sometime between last week and the end of October,” state Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Livonia) posted on social media.

The instruction came after BOP Director William K. Marshall III posted a message on the bureau’s website late last week, in which he wrote that the union had become “an obstacle to progress instead of a partner in it.” He said it was “time for change,” and then thanked the president and Attorney General Pam Bondi for allowing him to make that change. 
“Today, I’m announcing the termination of our contract with CPL-33 effective immediately,” he wrote.
The decision reverberated in the 122 communities that house federal prisons around the country, including Connecticut.
This state is home to one federal prison, the Federal Correctional Institution Danbury, a low-security, mixed-gender facility where Steve Bannon, a former adviser to President Donald J. Trump, once served a 4-month sentence for ignoring a subpoena in Congress’ investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
FCI Danbury houses 1,250 inmates, according to the prison’s website, and its employees are represented by labor union AFGE Local 1661.
The local negotiates its contract with the BOP as part of the national Council of Prison Locals. The union negotiates for job security, fair discipline and safety conditions. Pay and time off are set by Congress.
The current agreement between the federal prisons and their employees was slated to run through May 2029.
“By getting rid of our collective bargaining agreement, they’ve also invalidated all of our local agreements,” said Robert Curnan, president of the Danbury local. “So they can pretty much do whatever they want, as long as it’s not against the law.”
“They’re basically telling us they don’t believe we have any authority whatsoever,” he said.
In the message on the bureau’s website, Marshall said, “This isn’t about taking things away, it’s about giving you more,” adding, “The whole purpose of ending this contract is to make your lives better. Period.”
He said pay, benefits and civil service protections would remain the same, and that employees would not be fired or disciplined without cause and due process.

But the message concerned Curnan. He said the union pushes for critical protections. 
For example, the Danbury union advocated for seniority in job assignments; Curnan said he’s worried job placements could be made more arbitrarily now. Also, as a result of the BOP change, local unions no longer have the right to represent employees in disciplinary meetings, he said.
Curnan said that without union advocacy, employees could be moved off of their primary duties to cover staffing shortfalls more often. That could mean teachers being asked to serve as correctional officers, thus leaving educational programs understaffed.
Curnan said moves like this could lower morale and worsen the prison’s staffing shortage. “I have a feeling that conditions are going to decline and people are going to leave,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP24307090973664-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 19:58:05.491807

The states targeted by the new restrictions all have refused to deploy law enforcement for federal immigration actions. Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark says that’s unconstitutional.

Vermont is among a dozen states pushing back against new restrictions placed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on emergency preparedness grant funding. The states facing the funding restrictions had all refused to allocate law enforcement resources for federal immigration activities.
State Attorney General Charity Clark joined her latest lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump’s administration, calling the new rules and grant allocations unconstitutional. Attorneys general from 11 other states, including Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New York, are also participating in the lawsuit. The lawsuit specifically names Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and top Federal Emergency Management Agency official David Richardson, both in their official capacity.
At issue in the lawsuit are two grant programs run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, one targeting homeland security, the other emergency preparedness. The former, the Homeland Security Grant Program, is FEMA’s largest grant program, allocating nearly $1 billion to states and municipalities each year. 
FEMA had previously notified the 12 states that they would receive $459 million through the Homeland Security program, according to a press release from Clark’s office. But on Saturday, the states were collectively awarded $226 million — a more than 50% reduction of what the states were promised. The administration also cut the period of time that all states are allowed to spend the allocated funds from three years to one. 
A FEMA press release announcing the reduced funding on Monday said, “Recipients of grants will no longer be permitted to use federal funds to house illegal immigrants at luxury hotels, fund climate change pet projects, or empower radical organizations with unseemly ties that don’t serve the interest of the American people.”
Vermont received all of its previously allocated funds, but now will have only one year to put them to use. The large majority of the federal grant money is awarded by the state to municipal subgrantees such as towns or water districts, which are often on different budgetary timelines. The shortened timeframe could pose significant hurdles to the funds’ implementation, the Attorney General’s Office said.
Vermont receives approximately $4.5 million through the Homeland Security Grant Program and approximately $2.75 million through the Emergency Management Performance Grant, according to the Attorney General’s Office. 
“The Trump Administration is trying to unlawfully reallocate federal homeland security funding based on a state’s willingness to comply with the Administration’s political agenda,” Clark wrote in a press release. 
“But under the Constitution, it is Congress – not the President – who has the power of the purse,” she added. “This reallocation also includes an unlawful attempt at drastically shortening the timeframe during which funds must be spent, effectively setting states on a race against time to use the funds before one year is up.” 
Vermont Emergency Management oversees the implementation of the grant funding in the state. In an email, Vermont Emergency Management spokesperson Mark Bosma relayed a message from the homeland security unit of the department, saying, “They are in the process of evaluating the award conditions for this grant, so it would be premature for them to discuss it.” 
Vermont has refused to use its law enforcement to assist in the federal government’s aggressive immigration crackdown. Gov. Phil Scott twice declined to send the Vermont National Guard to assist the Trump administration this summer. The first request was explicitly to assist the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in its work. Also, Vermont law forbids local and state law enforcement agencies from participating in federal immigration enforcement actions. State lawmakers went even further to tighten the statute earlier this year.
The lawsuit argues that cutting congressionally allocated funding for political aims — such as punishing states that are not assisting the Trump administration in its immigration enforcement activities — is in stark violation of the Constitution. 
The changes made to the grant awards and timeframe also violate the Administrative Procedure Act, a statute that lays out specific protocols federal agencies must follow when changing regulations or programs, the lawsuit said. The law essentially aims to establish best practices in regulations and prevent this kind of political whim from dictating agency actions, as legal experts have outlined.

State budget-writers have been wringing their hands for months about the anticipated impact of the sweeping federal law enacted on July 4, and on Tuesday, they took the unusual step of hosting a mid-year checkup.  
The prognosis they heard — that a slowdown is likely but Massachusetts might avoid a full recession — could force action in the next few months to rein in spending on local projects, recalibrate revenue forecasts, or adjust the state’s tax code. 
“There’s really no margin for error,” Administration and Finance Secretary Matthew Gorzkowicz said at the State House hearing he held alongside the Legislature’s two Ways and Means Committee chairs. 
Revenue Commissioner Geoffrey Snyder told officials his office expects the new federal law will shrink state tax collections this fiscal year by more than $650 million.  
The fiscal year 2026 state budget Gov. Maura Healey signed in July does not account for that estimated hit, which Snyder newly revealed during Tuesday’s hearing, and officials will need to adjust their approach several months into the cycle. 
“Obviously, $650 million at any point in time is significant and daunting, to say the least, for us as budget-writers,” said House Ways and Means Committee chair Aaron Michlewitz. 
That’s not the only upheaval on the way. The sweeping federal bill could also shrink federal funding for health care here by $532 million in federal fiscal year 2026, according to an analysis from the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. If Congress decides not to extend pandemic-era tax credits that help Americans pay for health insurance, the Massachusetts Health Connector marketplace would need an extra $255 million from Beacon Hill to keep its most subsidized option available at current rates. 
Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation president Doug Howgate said the billions of dollars in reduced federal health care spending on Massachusetts is a “challenge that’s going to cascade through the rest of the budget.” 
“These are ticking time bombs, and we know when they’re going to go off,” he said. 
Several of the experts invited to appear before policymakers offered a similar big-picture forecast: that the state’s economy will endure a sluggish period in the months ahead without fully tumbling into recession territory. 
“My sense, based on what we know today, is that we’re not going to be moving in the coming year into a recession, but that a slower-growth, higher-cost environment is going to be there,” said Michael Goodman, a UMass Dartmouth professor and co-editor of the state-focused economic journal MassBenchmarks. 
The Legislature has been happy in recent years to ramp up state spending, in part using newly available money from the surtax on high earners, with buy-in both from Healey and from former Republican governor Charlie Baker. Over the past decade, the bottom line of the annual state budget has grown by more than 58 percent. 
Now, federal pressures — including the prospect of an extended government shutdown — are colliding with the more routine ebbs and flows in state economic performance to darken the outlook. Job growth has been mostly flat for more than a year, and tax collections are middling apart from the surtax. 
A key indicator will come when the Department of Revenue publishes a report next week detailing how much the state collected in taxes in September. As of September 25, Snyder said, collections were “showing little to no growth versus last year.” 
Revenue Commissioner Geoffrey Snyder addresses Beacon Hill budget-writers at a September 30, 2025 event about the state’s economic outlook.
Beacon Hill has already built in a few bulwarks. Legislative negotiators left a more than $800 million cushion in their annual budget agreement to offset expected spending pressures or revenue drops. 
That could help absorb the sizable decline in tax collections, but officials suggested it might not be straightforward. Michlewitz said there are “more issues at hand than just what this potential revenue piece may be,” and his Senate counterpart, Michael Rodrigues, warned of “tremendous growth” in health care needs. 
“We understand that there’s $860 million on the balance sheet,” said Gorzkowicz, referring to the funding cushion lawmakers built into the 2026 budget. “How it’s used has yet to be decided, and there are many competing interests that have to be considered when thinking about how to apply that $860 million.” 
Snyder told lawmakers most of the state revenue loss would come from a handful of changes to the federal tax code. Top Democrats did not rule out legislative changes that would decouple the state tax code, essentially putting in place a Massachusetts-specific approach to some tax measures that diverge from the national standard, as a way of minimizing the impact.  
“We’re going to have to take all those options and consider them all at this point in time,” Michlewitz said. 
Healey’s office said in July that the administration would delay paying about $125 million in local earmarks that lawmakers wove into the state budget until the fall. Gorzkowicz said he still has not decided whether to release that money, and will weigh input from Tuesday’s hearing and the forthcoming September revenue report. 
The secretary has another choice to make in the next two weeks: by October 15, Gorzkowicz must certify that the state’s revenues are sufficient to cover its expenses for the fiscal year that runs through June 30, 2026. That might prompt the administration to downgrade Beacon Hill’s official tax collection forecast, which was developed before enactment of the federal megalaw. 
“That’s what today’s hearing was all about,” Gorzkowicz said when a reporter asked about the prospect of adjusting the so-called consensus revenue benchmark.  
Massachusetts has a sizable reserve on hand. The balance of the state’s “rainy day” savings account stood at about $8.6 billion in early September, according to the state comptroller’s office, more than six times as much as a decade ago. 
But policymakers, still smarting from a 2017 bond rating downgrade that chided the state’s approach to savings, are hesitant to pull from that source. 
“I would be hard-pressed at this time to suggest that we’re going to dip into the stabilization fund,” Rodrigues said. “We have other tools that are available to us, so I think we’d look at the other tools first.” 
Another idea Healey proposed would give her temporary expanded authority to slash state spending unilaterally, often known as 9C cuts, from more areas of the budget. 
Legislative leaders have shown little interest in ceding that power in the nearly three months since Healey included it in legislation. Michlewitz and Rodrigues on Tuesday said only that they continue to review the idea.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09-30_economic_panel_1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-30 19:58:05.491807

Free.,Midnight federal shutdown edges closer as US Senate fails to agree on spending bills,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/midnight-federal-shutdown-edges-closer-us-senate-fails-agree-spending-bills,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate failed to advance two short-term government funding bills Tuesday when Democrats and Republicans deadlocked for the second time this month, with just hours to go before a shutdown that appeared nearly certain to begin at midnight. Senators voted 55-45 on Republicans’ bill that would fund the government for seven weeks and 47-53 on a Democratic stopgap proposal that would keep the lights on for a month and included several health care provisions. Neither had the 60 votes needed to advance. Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman and Maine independent Sen. Angus King voted with GOP senators on their stopgap bill. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul voted against it.The consequences of a shutdown will be sweeping in the nation’s capital and across the country, where states are bracing for the impact. About 750,000 federal workers could be furloughed, leading to a $400 million impact a day, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported. All federal employees would go unpaid until the shutdown is over.Additionally, the Trump administration plans to lay off federal employees en masse, which would reshape the federal workforce. President Donald Trump again vowed Tuesday to undertake layoffs and a major government employee union filed suit in federal court in advance of such a move.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said hours before the votes there wouldn’t be any talks with Democrats during a shutdown. “The negotiation happens when the government is open. So let’s keep the government open and then we will have the negotiations,” Thune said. “We’re happy to sit down and talk about these issues that they’re interested in,” he said. “But it should not have anything to do with whether or not for a seven-week period we keep the government open, so that this government can continue to do its work and that we can do our work through the regular appropriations process to fund the government.” Health care tax credits at center of standoffThe disagreement isn’t entirely about GOP lawmakers writing their short-term funding bill behind closed doors and then expecting Democrats to help advance it in the Senate, where bipartisanship is required for major legislation.Democratic leaders have raised concerns for weeks about the end-of-year sunset of enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, arguing a solution is needed now ahead of the open enrollment period starting on Nov. 1. Democrats have also grown increasingly frustrated with the White House budget office’s unilateral actions on spending, arguing Director Russ Vought is significantly eroding Congress’ constitutional power of the purse. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the Republican chairwoman of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, said Tuesday the Government Accountability Office should sue the Trump administration over its efforts to freeze or unilaterally cancel spending approved by Congress. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats need an agreement with Republicans to extend the enhanced tax credits. Schumer said people will begin getting notices in October telling them how much the cost of their ACA plans will increase during the next year, which he expects will ratchet up pressure on Republican leaders to broker a bipartisan agreement. “We’re going to be right there explaining to them it’s because the Republicans wouldn’t negotiate with us,” Schumer said, referring to consumers. “We’re ready to do it anytime. And there will be huge heat on (Republicans) on this issue.”People who buy health insurance on the ACA marketplace and receive subsidies through enhanced ACA tax credits could expect to pay on average more than double for annual premiums in 2026 if the credits expire as scheduled at the end of this year, according to an analysis released Tuesday by the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF. The analysis found premiums could increase from an average of $888 this year to $1,904 in 2026.Claims about immigrants Schumer also rebuffed GOP leaders saying that Democrats want to include people without legal immigration status in federal health care programs. “They say that undocumented people are going to get these credits. That is absolutely false. That is one of the big lies they tell, so they don’t have to discuss the issues,” Schumer said. “The federal government by law that we passed does not fund health insurance for undocumented immigrants in Medicaid, nor the ACA nor Medicare. Undocumented immigrants do not get federal health insurance premiums.” Immigrants in the country without legal authorization are not eligible for Medicaid, and neither are most immigrants with legal status, such as those with student visas or enrollment in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. Only immigrants with a “qualified status,” such as legal permanent residents, asylees and refugees, are able to get Medicaid benefits, and they usually have to wait five years before their coverage can even begin. White House mass firings in a shutdown Collins said she is worried about the broad authority the White House holds during a shutdown and how the Office of Management and Budget has indicated it will use that power. “I'm much more concerned about OMB sending signals that there should be mass firings of federal employees who have the misfortune to be designated as non-essential, when in fact they're performing very essential work, they're just not being paid,” Collins said.  North Dakota Republican Sen. John Hoeven, chairman of the Agriculture spending subcommittee, said lawmakers will have to sort through how various departments implement their contingency plans as well as the possibility of mass layoffs during a shutdown. “We'll have to work through those things and figure out how we do keep things going as best we can during this Democrat shutdown,” Hoeven said.West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said Republicans are “unified in the belief that this is an easy choice” to fund the government with a stopgap bill that doesn't include any contentious or political provisions. Capito — who chairs the Appropriations subcommittee that funds the departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Labor — said there are several programs that will be “missed” during a shutdown. “And that's concerning. So I think the option is to keep the government open so we can avoid this pain,” Capito said. ‘I’m not optimistic that we’re going to get a path forward’Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he is worried about the possible impacts of a shutdown on his home state and that keeping the government open is the only way to avoid that.  “I'm sure the administration will do everything they can,” Hawley said. “But the solution is to not shut the government down. I mean, why would you punish working people because you're not getting what you want on any issue, whatever it is.”South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds said he doesn’t expect a shutdown will end until after Democrats have sent a message to their voters. “I'm not optimistic that we're going to get a path forward until they've had a shutdown,” he said. Rounds, who negotiated a handshake agreement with the White House budget director this summer to preserve some funding for rural tribal radio stations after Congress eliminated funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, said that deal could be affected by a shutdown. “They're putting the administration in a position where they can pick and choose what they're going to do, and a shutdown is not going to be beneficial to these Native American radio stations,” Rounds said. Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said she wants Democrats and Republicans to negotiate on health care provisions.“I’ve been making the case constantly, that (it) is literally my obligation to try and fight for health care, and I’m willing to talk to anyone,” she said. “I’m willing to accept that I certainly will not get everything I want.”Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois said that while Democrats agreed to help advance what’s known as a continuing resolution in March, they can’t now because of “what President Trump is doing to this country, particularly when it comes to health care costs for families.”  The shutdown will significantly affect the operations of the federal government as lawmakers have not passed any of the dozen full-year appropriations bills that finance agency operations. Oct. 1 is the beginning of the new fiscal year for the federal government.Union files suitIn anticipation of layoffs by the Trump administration, labor unions representing more than 1 million federal workers filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California on Tuesday to block the Trump administration from carrying out mass firings. The suit argues that there is no statutory authority to fire federal employees during a government shutdown.“These actions are contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious, and the cynical use of federal employees as a pawn in Congressional deliberations should be declared unlawful and enjoined by this Court,” according to the suit filed by the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.Ashley Murray and Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.",,,,2025-09-30 19:58:05.491807

Free.,"Federal government shutdown begins, with no easy exit in sight","Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-government-shutdown-begins-no-easy-exit-sight,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — The federal government started shutting down early Wednesday after Congress failed to approve a funding bill before the beginning of the new fiscal year — resulting in widespread ramifications for hundreds of programs and giving the Trump administration an avenue to fire federal workers en masse.The U.S. Senate was unable to advance two short-term government funding bills Tuesday when Democrats and Republicans deadlocked for the second time this month, with just hours to go before the midnight Tuesday shutdown deadline.Senators voted 55-45 on Republicans’ bill that would fund the government for seven weeks and 47-53 on a Democratic stopgap proposal that would keep the lights on for a month and included several health care provisions that they said were needed for their support. Neither had the 60 votes needed to advance. Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman and Maine independent Sen. Angus King voted with GOP senators on their stopgap bill. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul voted against it.White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said in a memo to departments and agencies Tuesday night after the Senate vote that “affected agencies should now execute their plans for an orderly shutdown.” Vought said federal employees should report for their next regularly scheduled tour of duty to undertake shutdown activities.The consequences of a shutdown will be sweeping in the nation’s capital and across the country, where states are bracing for the impact. About 750,000 federal workers could be furloughed, leading to a $400 million impact a day, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported. All federal employees would go unpaid until the shutdown is over.Additionally, the Trump administration plans to lay off thousands of federal employees, which would reshape the federal workforce. President Donald Trump again vowed Tuesday to undertake layoffs and a major government employee union filed suit in federal court in advance of such a move.More votes on GOP bill plannedSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said hours before the votes there wouldn’t be any talks with Democrats during a shutdown. “The negotiation happens when the government is open.

He said as soon as Wednesday the federal government can be funded if five Democrats voted with Republicans. “Democrats may have chosen to shut down the government, but we can reopen it tomorrow,” Thune said. Republican Whip John Barrasso of Wyoming said the “cracks in the Democrats are already showing,” noting that three Democrats voted with Republicans Tuesday night. “There is bipartisan support for keeping the government open,” Barrasso said. “We’re happy to see that the Democrats are already starting to break from (Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer) and we’re going to continue to offer a clean (continuing resolution) on the floor of the Senate to open the government for the next seven weeks.”Health care tax credits at center of standoffThe disagreement isn’t entirely about GOP lawmakers writing their short-term funding bill behind closed doors and then expecting Democrats to help advance it in the Senate, where bipartisanship is required for major legislation.Democratic leaders have raised concerns for weeks about the end-of-year sunset of enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, arguing a solution is needed now ahead of the open enrollment period starting on Nov. 1.

Greg Dolezal has become the latest member of the Georgia Senate to launch a bid for lieutenant governor. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderSen. Greg Dolezal of Cumming has become the latest member of the Georgia Senate to launch a bid for lieutenant governor, joining several other Republican candidates in a race that includes some of the most powerful figures in the chamber. Dolezal, a businessman, was first elected to the state Senate in 2018 and represents a district based in Forsyth County.
In an ad announcing his campaign Tuesday, Dolezal touted his hard-line conservative credentials, including his role as the lead sponsor of the Riley Gaines Act during the 2025 legislative session. The bill — which was named after a college swimmer who tied for fifth place with a transgender swimmer in a tournament at Georgia Tech — bans transgender athletes from playing on most sports teams that align with their gender identity at both K-12 and college levels, and requires separate restrooms, locker rooms and sleeping facilities for men and women at athletic events. 
Dolezal also promised to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs from “every government agency” in the state, “stop transgender indoctrination” in schools and universities, and oust prosecutors who are “soft on crime” in his campaign announcement.
Like many other GOP candidates, Dolezal has highlighted his loyalty to President Donald Trump in his pitch to voters, arguing that he “stood with President Trump when it mattered most.”
At a September rally for Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a Butts County Republican who is running for governor, Dolezal criticized Republicans who he characterized as fair-weather MAGA fans in his speech.
“In 2020, when President Trump needed allies, these politicians were silent,” he said.
He was also among the four Republican state senators in 2020 who called, unsuccessfully, for a special session to consider officially overturning the results of the presidential election in Georgia. 
On the Republican side of the lieutenant governor’s race, Dolezal will be competing against candidates including Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch of Dahlonega, President Pro Tem John F. Kennedy of Macon, Sen. Blake Tillery of Vidalia, House lawmaker David Clark of Buford and Georgia Department of Veterans Services board member Takosha Swan of Conyers. Sen. Josh McLaurin of Sandy Springs is the most high-profile Democrat in the race.

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado lawmakers on Tuesday approved $7.5 million in funding to pay for a nutritional assistance program in October if the federal government shuts down. 
The government was barreling towards that shutdown on Tuesday afternoon as Congress failed to reach a deal to pass a short-term funding agreement. The federal government will begin shutting down Wednesday, the start of a news federal fiscal year, if a bill isn’t passed. 
That will affect an array of government programs, including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC. The program is a federal grant program appropriated annually by Congress. Since Wednesday is the start of a new fiscal year, WIC will not have received any federal funds in the case of a shutdown.

“WIC serves more than 100,000 Coloradans each month, and is a vital lifeline for women, infants, and young children. A lapse in service could have severe consequences,” Gov. Jared Polis wrote in a letter to Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Democrat who is chair of the Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee.
A federal government shutdown is nearing. Here’s a guide for what to expect.

The JBC will allow $7.5 million in general fund money to backfill WIC benefits in the state, with the expectation that the state  will then eventually seek reimbursement from the federal government. 
The JBC delayed a vote on the funding request from last week due to questions over whether it met interim supplemental requirements. The “unforeseen circumstance” that would allow such a request when the Legislature isn’t in session — in this case, a government shutdown — had not happened yet. 
“Given the frequency of averting a government shutdown at the last minute, the Office of Legislative Legal Services does not believe that a federal government shutdown is objectively certain to occur on October 1 of this year,” a JBC staff document about the request reads. 
Nonpartisan staff also raised concerns about the absence of clear statutory authority for the state to use its own money for WIC benefits. They noted, however, that there also isn’t a prohibition on it. 
The money will only be used if there is a shutdown. 
The JBC also gave permission for bill drafters to write legislation that would clarify spending authority and processes for funding during future government shutdowns.

(NC Newsline file photo)Members of the N.C. State Board of Elections argued Tuesday over state Auditor Dave Boliek’s hiring of a former GOP state director to work with local elections officials.  
Boliek told county board chairs last week that former state GOP executive director Dallas Woodhouse would be his “eyes and ears on the ground,” with duties to include shaping early voting plans, election policy, and election integrity.
Democrats on the state board argued that Boliek is giving Woodhouse responsibilities in the newly-created role that, under law, belong to state Board of Elections Director Sam Hayes. Democrats also questioned Woodhouse’s suitability as a former state GOP spokesman whose job it was to help elect Republicans. 
Boliek’s office did not respond to an email Tuesday evening, and Woodhouse did not return a phone message. 
Board member Siobhan Millen, a Democrat, described Woodhouse as a “highly-partisan figure who resigned his role” with the GOP as a bribery scandal was unfolding. Woodhouse was not implicated in the bribery case. 
Board Chairman Francis De Luca began to shout over Millen as she criticized Woodhouse’s hiring.

Before the meeting, De Luca said Woodhouse was a close friend whom he once hired to work at the conservative Civitas Institute. 
Woodhouse resigned his job as executive director of the state GOP in 2019 after chairman Robin Hayes was indicted in connection with a bribery case. Hayes pleaded guilty to lying to federal prosecutors and was sentenced to probation and ordered to pay a fine. President Donald Trump pardoned him in 2021. 
“It’s difficult to imagine a person who would be less suited to bringing election integrity…,” Millen said of Woodhouse before De Luca cut her off. 
“I don’t think it enhances public confidence,” she added, before De Luca pronounced the discussion a waste of time. 
A new state law gave Boliek the power to appoint the chairs of local boards of elections and members of the State Board of Elections. Until this year, the governor appointed state board members, but the law took that power away from Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, and gave it to Boliek, a Republican. 
The law does not give Boliek the power to run elections or set election policy, and having Woodhouse as a liaison creates confusion over who local boards should turn to for guidance, said board member Jeff Carmon, a Democrat. 
What appears to be a contentious midterm election is coming, Carmon said, and local elections officials need to know where to direct their questions and complaints, and whose policies they should follow.
“If anyone is calling the auditor’s office, it needs to stop,” Carmon said. 
Board member Stacy “Four” Eggers IV, a Republican, said it’s clear that the board retains “legal, technical, and supervisory oversight” over elections, but Woodhouse may be helpful in securing funding from the legislature.
“Our county board members should take direction from this board,” Eggers said.

On Tuesday, the USDA approved more than $500 million in assistance for Georgia farmers affected by the storm. Grant Blankenship/GPB NewsIt’s been just over a year since Hurricane Helene ripped across the Southeast, killing 250 people and causing billions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses.
In Georgia, the storm claimed 37 lives while its devastating winds and floodwaters led to at least $5.5 billion in damage to the state’s farmers and foresters, according to assessments from University of Georgia researchers.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the state will receive just over $531 million in federal funds for the Hurricane Helene Block Grant Program intended to cover future economic losses, infrastructure losses and timber losses caused by the hurricane.

In a statement, Georgia Agriculture Secretary Tyler Harper celebrated the funding, stressing that it was the most the state could get.
“This funding is absolutely essential to help our farm families bounce back from Hurricane Helene, and our team invested hundreds of hours into the negotiation process to secure the maximum possible amount of federal funding for our state and our producers,” Harper said.
According to the USDA, the money will come from a $30 billion disaster assistance relief effort set aside in the American Relief Act of 2025, signed late last year by former President Joe Biden. Under that program, USDA worked with Georgia and 13 other states to develop individual grants.
Administrative details including how to apply for funding have not yet been released but will be forthcoming, the USDA said in a release.

In a statement, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins touted other federal disaster assistance programs targeting farmers.
“The Trump Administration has our farmers’ backs and will ensure they have the resources they need to continue to produce the safest, most reliable, and most abundant food supply in the world,” she said.
As of last week, Georgia farmers affected by Helene have received more than $503 million from the USDA’s main disaster relief programs, according to the Georgia Department of Agriculture, with the block grants bringing the total to over $1 billion. That number could grow as the USDA disburses more money. The state has also pitched in for the relief effort, including by offering more than $300 million in emergency loans and grants.
Hard times
Agriculture groups welcomed the relief, though some stressed it comes as farmers and foresters are dealing with an especially tough economy beyond storm damage.
Cotton farmers, for example, are also dealing with new insects like the two-spot cotton leafhopper and competition from an uptick in cheap, low-quality synthetic fabrics worldwide.
Georgia’s cotton industry represents more than $1.3 billion in revenue for Georgia farmers, making it one of the state’s top crops, and it was one of the crops hit hardest by Helene. The storm caused significant damage to the state’s cotton fields last year, with UGA scientists projecting a loss of 500,000 to 600,000 bales of cotton, just under a third of the entire crop.
“We’re in a situation where we have remarkably low prices,” said Taylor Sills, executive director of the Georgia Cotton Commission. “We’re facing new insects, which is adding cost to producers in a time of low to negative return in the first place. But any assistance to support Georgia’s cotton industry is welcome news at the end of the day.”
Sills added that the response to Helene was quicker than those following previous storms.
“When you compare it to the aftermath of Hurricane Michael in 2018, it was a year and a half before Congress had even passed assistance in the wake of that storm, and here we are a year later, and all of these things have been not only passed through Congress, but been implemented,” he said. “So even though we’re in a bad situation as an industry, this assistance has come to people quicker than then.”
When Helene crossed Georgia, it blew through more than 8.9 million acres of forestland, causing an economic impact of $1.28 billion in the state, according to the UGA assessment.
Tree farmers report a tough economy, including rising costs, labor difficulties and weak markets. Since the storm, International Paper has closed mills in Savannah and Riceboro, dropping pulpwood prices further and making life more difficult for many tree farmers.
In an email alert to members Tuesday, the Georgia Forestry Association touted the latest block grants as a “significant opportunity to provide support to Georgia’s forest landowners who were devastated by this storm,” but were also pragmatic about the situation facing many members.
“Georgia’s forestry and farming families have endured one of the most challenging years in memory. Hurricane Helene left a path of devastation across our state, damaging fields, forests, and the livelihoods that depend on them. For many, the storm struck on top of already difficult conditions — high input costs, rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions, and weakened markets — making recovery even more daunting.”

(Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Pennsylvania enters its fourth month of budget gridlock as the only state in the country without some kind of spending plan in place for the coming year. And now, the commonwealth faces the unprecedented collision of a budget impasse with the delay or suspension of billions in federal dollars as a U.S. government shutdown looms.
“We are in uncharted waters,” said Annie Strite, mental health director for Cumberland and Perry counties. “It’s scary because we don’t know what we will need to cut. We don’t know how much revenue we’re going to have to work with.” 
Pennsylvania reported spending nearly $45 billion in federal funding in the most recent state audit for the 2024 fiscal year. 
That included about $3.6 billion in COVID-19 pandemic relief – the expiration of which already had provoked warnings from public finance experts well before lawmakers deadlocked this summer over finances in Harrisburg or Washington.

The commonwealth’s other federal funding totaled about $41 billion for the fiscal year that ended in June 2024, a Pennsylvania Capital-Star analysis shows. 
Of that, about $5.2 billion was federal pass-through money  – meaning it’s already marked for counties, school districts and other recipients. The funding isn’t subject to state discretion; however, the commonwealth must appropriate at least some of it via the state budget. 
Does that mean federal funding also stops flowing through the state during a budget stalemate? Not necessarily – at least, not all of it. 
Federal funding flow 
It’s  complicated to precisely track how much federal funding some recipients (including local government units like counties and schools) might’ve been losing out on in recent months due to the state budget impasse. 
There are a few reasons for that.  
First, the commonwealth must continue to make certain payments during a state budget impasse. 
And federal funds comprise a large share– between 30 and 42 percent annually during the last decade – of state general fund revenue, according to a Capital-Star analysis of state budget data. 
But the breakdown of state vs federal funds often isn’t clear to recipients because federal appropriations often “cannot be analyzed in isolation from state funds necessary to support a program or project,” according to state budgeting guidelines.
And there are inconsistencies in how the commonwealth handles federal funds during a state budget standoff, according to Snyder County Commissioner Joe Krantz.
“I’ve gotten a lot of mixed signals,” Krantz said. “Some people are telling us they can release federal funds. Some say they can’t. Some say they can choose what funds they can release. It’s frustrating, at best, because we just don’t know. I’ve been a commissioner long enough to remember [budget impasses] during Gov. (Ed) Rendell and Gov. (Tom) Wolf’s administrations. And there were different scenarios in each of those impasses that went on and on and on. In some of those years, federal funds were released – and in other years, they weren’t.” 
A federal government shutdown is nearing. Here’s a guide for what to expect.

The commonwealth’s Office of the Budget outlines certain funding (such as commonwealth worker salaries and Medicare) that should continue to flow – yet the categories include some that would-be recipients say aren’t being paid as usual. Domestic violence prevention and survivor support funding, for example, is listed; however, organizations have received only one of multiple funding streams accounting for just 13 percent of revenues, according to Michael Waterloo, communications director for the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence (PCADV).
Urgent needs
Federal pass-through payments tend to make up a relatively small percentage of funding for recipients (i.e., municipalities, counties and school districts rely much more on property taxes and state funding). 
As the state budget impasse wears on, smaller and smaller amounts matter more and more – especially for smaller entities or those with thin operating margins.
Nonprofit domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers are examples. They’re not counted among the “essential” services protected by rules to continue payment during a state budget impasse, according to the PCADV.
“The federal money has been allowing centers to stay open. If we didn’t have a combination (of state and federal funds) … they’d be closed already,” said Jenna Mehnert Baker, public policy director at PCADV. “We are desperate for both budgets to pass, or at least one of them.”
Federal funding pays for  specific needs, with some of them being urgent. 
For example, domestic violence survivors who need to leave home quickly rely on rapid rehousing money from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development funneled through the PCADV’s statewide network. That was $24 million last year for hundreds of households, according to Jennifer Beittel, the organization’s chief philanthropic and communications officer.

The scenario is particularly fraught in rural areas, where stretched law enforcement and health care deserts already leave programs without as much money to support survivors as might be available to agencies in more densely populated areas. 
Similarly, rural programs typically lack funding alternatives (such as larger local governments or philanthropic foundations) to assist during an impasse or federal government shutdown, Mehnert Baker said.
Pennsylvania also isn’t among the 20 states where lawmakers can use a continuing resolution to keep spending according to the past fiscal year’s budget until they agree on a new one. The federal government can do that, too. 
“It would be great if we could have that continuing resolution,” Mehnert Baker said. “We wouldn’t be in this situation.” 
Senate Republicans say their proposal from August was an attempt to do so. 
“That would have allowed state and federal funding to flow while all parties continue to discuss how to resolve our differences. The House could pass that bill at any time to prevent many of the negative consequences of the current impasse, if they so choose,” said Sen. Scott Martin (R-Lancaster) in a statement. 
Martin and his colleagues have since advanced a proposal to forgive the 4.5 percent interest on loans the state Treasury announced last week for Head Start providers and counties.

How counties compensate
Some counties  (Montgomery and Allegheny) say their federal pass-through money has been coming in as usual since the state budget impasse started. The lack of commonwealth funding is driving county leaders to act. They cut payments to contractors (Chester), furloughed workers (Northampton and Westmoreland), took on debt and missed would-be interest revenue earned on savings they’re dipping into. They’re also struggling to plan as they approach the end of their fiscal year Dec. 31. 
York County has been going without about $3 million per month in federal pass-through money (in addition to another $5.3 million of state funds) during the impasse, according to President Commissioner Julie Wheeler. 
The federal dollars cover services including lead abatement, emergency food assistance and programming for older adults. The county’s been using savings to keep them going so far – but that can’t continue indefinitely, Wheeler said.
“We’ll have to make a tough decision at some point,” Wheeler said. “Either raising taxes to cover the gap or shutting down programs. Which is something, personally, I don’t want to do.”
Cumberland County’s community mental health services block grant hasn’t been paid since the impasse began. That’s a $600,000 annual award, or about $150,000 during the past quarter of state lawmakers’ gridlock, according to Mental Health Director Annie Strite.
“So far, we can continue services,” Strite said. “But it won’t be long before we need to make some difficult decisions. Other counties are already making those cuts.” 
That first quarterly allocation should’ve happened around mid-August, but reimbursements are on hold for the 2025-26 fiscal year without a budget in place, noted Kyle Kopko, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania (CCAP). 
With no end to budget impasse in sight, Pa. school districts and counties warn of program cuts

In Berks County, leaders noted the impasse’s effect on pass-through funding – which accounts for about 5% of its revenues versus about 26.5% from the state – might not be apparent yet. 
There’s a lag of weeks, even months after funding is spent as reimbursements are processed and accounts reconciled, Berks interim Chief Financial Officer Laura Jones explained. 
Berks has been using savings to make up for funding shortages, losing an estimated $75,000 per month so far in anticipated interest revenue, according to Jones. 
Montgomery County’s in a similar situation: hanging on for now, but not without costs – which Commissioner Neil Makhija says they’re tracking closely. 
“I haven’t heard of any indication that a budget is going to be passed,” Makhija said. “This is also the most frank [communication] that I’m now starting to hear from legislators in saying that. Whereas earlier in the budget season, it was thought that there was a deal on the horizon. I think we’re all surprised and disappointed that it’s come this far.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/state-capitol-2-august-2025-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-30 19:58:05.491807

Louisiana has issued an arrest warrant for a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to a Louisiana woman  (Photo illustration by Natalie Behring/Getty Images)Louisiana has issued an arrest warrant for a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to a Louisiana woman  — the latest legal volley in an ongoing fight between states with abortion bans and those that have enacted protections for abortion providers who use telemedicine to send abortion medication over state lines.
The existence of the arrest warrant, first reported by the Associated Press, was revealed in court documents filed earlier this month in a lawsuit that aims to push federal regulators to reinstate in-person dispensing requirements for mifepristone, rather than allowing it to be prescribed via telehealth. Mifepristone is used in combination with another drug, misoprostol, for medication abortions.
The woman, Rosalie Markezich, and Louisiana Republican Attorney General Liz Murrill are seeking to join that lawsuit. Markezich says in court filings that her boyfriend at the time ordered the drugs in October 2023 from Dr. Remy Coeytaux, a California physician, using her email address.
Markezich claims her boyfriend pressured her to take the pills, and that she regrets doing so. She said she intended to throw up the pills, but was unable to. The abortion wouldn’t have happened if telehealth prescriptions were outlawed, she contends.
Murrill posted a statement on X on Monday evening calling it “dangerous, irresponsible, unethical, and illegal to distribute these pills to strangers in violation of the criminal laws of our State, without any relationship whatsoever to the individual who may ultimately be consuming them.”
“I’ll continue to pursue anyone and use any legal means available to us to hold them accountable,” Murrill wrote. “I will enforce and defend the laws of our State, including suing the governors whose shield laws purport to protect these individuals from criminal conduct in Louisiana.”
Coeytaux also is facing legal action in Texas. In July, a Texas man sued him for allegedly mailing his girlfriend abortion medication.
This year, Texas enacted a law that allows individuals to sue out-of-state providers who prescribe abortion medication to Texas residents. Louisiana also this year passed a law allowing abortion patients to sue providers.
Roughly a quarter of abortions nationwide by the end of last year were via telehealth prescriptions, according to the #WeCount report by the Society of Family Planning.
Twenty-two states, including California, have shield law protections related to reproductive health care that protect providers from out-of-state investigations and prosecution, according to the University of California, Los Angeles Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy.
Eight states, including California, have shield law provisions that extend protections to telehealth abortion prescribers who write prescriptions for patients in abortion-ban states, according to reproductive policy research organization Guttmacher.

Department of Corrections  is closing two prisons over critics’ objections,Ian Karbal,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/pa-department-of-corrections-is-closing-two-prisons-over-critics-objections/,"The process is expected to be carried out over four months, and estimates say it could save taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. The plan, however, drew mixed reactions from state lawmakers, unions and the communities surrounding the chosen facilities.","The Pennsylvania correctional institution at Rockview in Centre County is among four facilities recommended for closure. (Pa. Department of Corrections photo)The closing of two Pennsylvania correctional facilities, SCI-Rockview in Centre County and the Quehanna Boot Camp in Clearfield County, is moving forward despite opposition from local officials and prison staff.
The move to shutter the two prisons was proposed in February in Gov. Josh Shapiro’s 2025-2026 budget proposal, and was pitched as a cost-saving move amid declining incarceration. Now, following a final report from the state Department of Corrections, the process is expected to be carried out over four months, and estimates say it could save taxpayers tens of millions of dollars.
The plan, however, drew mixed reactions from state lawmakers, unions and the communities surrounding the chosen facilities.
“As the budget continues to be negotiated the timing of this decision makes no sense,” said Michael Ohler, president of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association (PSCOA). “The department is more interested in playing budget games than focusing on the safety and quality of life of our brave corrections officers and staff.”
The Department of Corrections (DOC) said the facilities were chosen based on a number of factors, including projected maintenance costs, the potential impacts to local economies and their proximity to other facilities where staff can be transferred.
All staff at the prisons will be given the opportunity to transfer to another facility within 67 miles at their same employment classification and pay rate, according to the agency.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Both Democrat and Republican lawmakers representing the surrounding areas issued statements opposing the plan following the final DOC report’s release.
“I am thoroughly disappointed, frustrated and angry,” Rep. Paul Takac (D-Centre), wrote. “The negative impacts of this misguided and harmful decision to close SCI Rockview and Quehanna will hit immediately, and, for many, the ripples will continue to resonate for a lifetime.”
“This decision is shortsighted and destructive, with real-world consequences for our community,” Sen. Wayne Langerholc (R-Clearfield) wrote in his own statement. “At the center of this decision are our corrections officers, men and women who put their lives on the line every day to keep violent offenders off our streets and maintain order inside our correctional facilities. By moving forward with this closure, the Shapiro Administration has abandoned these dedicated professionals, stripping them of their livelihoods and undermining the very system that relies on their courage and discipline.”
Fears over potential economic impact
The final report, put together by a steering committee convened by the DOC, outlined complaints received during a public comment period.
One common criticism was that the closures could ultimately cost taxpayers money, with the facilities still requiring maintenance and upkeep unless they can be sold to a third party.
But the Department of Corrections said closing the facilities will ultimately bring down a ballooning budget. And, with a declining incarcerated population, the move shouldn’t lead to overcrowding.
“The proposals to close SCI Rockview and Quehanna Boot Camp will provide the greatest opportunities for our staff, enable the continued care, custody and control of inmates and mitigate the worst of the economic consequences for communities that host our facilities,” the department said.

The department estimated the annual costs of running SCI-Rockview and Quehanna Boot Camp at roughly $112 million and $34 million, respectively, including personnel costs, which made up the bulk of spending.
The report also said SCI-Rockview would require around $74.3 million for maintenance over the next five years, while Quehanna could require $6.9 million over the same period if they were to stay open.
Alternatively, it placed the estimated annual costs of mothballing the facilities at nearly $1.6 million for SCI-Rockview, and $633,600 for the boot camp until the plots could be sold.
Ultimately, the report noted the closures could save nearly $100 million that could be “more expediently delivered to other facilities.”
Another issue raised was the impact the closures could have on local economies around the facilities.
The DOC’s report included an estimated economic impact from the state Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED). They found the local economy around SCI-Rockview may face losses of up to $5.8 million in annual payments to local vendors, and another $167,000 annually per employee that moves from the area. Around Quehanna, the impact may be  up to $1.1 million in losses from annual payments to vendors and around $190,000 annually per employee who moves from the area.
A letter from three Clearfield County commissioners was included in the report, warning that the closure of Quehanna Boot Camp could result in the loss of 200 to 300 jobs in the rural area.
“Urban areas have the potential to absorb the numbers because of having numerically more employers,” the letter said. “One has to apply the economics of scale to approaching situations such as this.”
Similarly, the Centre County Board of Commissioners warned of adverse impacts due to the closure of SCI-Rockview. 
“We estimate over $50.2 million in lost wages annually from the corrections industry alone,” the letter said. “These losses are also felt in the spinoff jobs created from the corrections industry.”
The DCED said SCI-Rockview employs around 658 staff, and supports around 295 additional jobs in Centre County.

Area vendors who supply the prison, its staff and their families could collectively lose around $5.8 million annually when the facility shutters.
Quehanna Bootcamp has around 234 employees and supports another 99 jobs in Clearfield County. Local vendors there could lose up to $1.1 million annually.
The facility provides low security programming for inmates with the goal of rehabilitation before reentry to society. It utilizes a unique six-month, military-style boot camp program, and is the primary facility for the State Drug Treatment Program. According to DOC, it provides inmates with physical training, work and education, as well as therapy and rehabilitative programs.
Numerous parties, including former inmates, wrote the DOC to recommend against closing it because of the opportunities it provides.
“Without hesitation, I can say that SCI Quehanna Boot Camp is an effective and essential facility,” said a respondent who claimed to be a former Quehanna Boot Camp teacher. Names and contact information were redacted from the report.
The department, however, said there is a small number of inmates who meet the requirements to enter the program. The boot camp is the lowest-security facility in Pennsylvania, and with an aging inmate population, fewer who would be allowed to transfer there meet the physical requirements for the boot camp-style training.
They said the program will also continue in another form at other facilities following Quehanna Boot Camp’s closure.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rockview-2-1024x605.jpeg,,,2025-09-30 18:58:33.661892

(Photo by Anna Padilla for Source NM)While the main focus of the special New Mexico legislative session starting at noon on Oct. 1 remains the state impact from the federal budget bill, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued a proclamation Tuesday for the session that includes additional topics, such as interstate medical compacts and criminal competency.
Regarding the state impact from the so-called “big beautiful bill,” a news release from the governor’s office said the session will include bills to address funding cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as well as public broadcasting. A few bills had been pre-filed as of late afternoon Tuesday.
“We’re not going to stand by while Washington abandons New Mexico families,” the governor said in a statement. “This special session is about protecting the people who need help most.”
Among the states, New Mexico has the highest Medicaid enrollment per capita at 42% of the state’s population, according to the state Health Care Authority’s fact sheet released in September. The HCA estimates that the state’s Medicaid program could see losses exceeding $8.5 billion over the next decade from lowering how much they pay providers.
Five things to know about Medicaid heading into New Mexico’s special session

“The cuts coming from Washington are not theoretical, they are happening now and will directly harm New Mexican families who are struggling to put food on the table or cannot afford healthcare,” Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth said in a statement.“This special session allows us to respond immediately to Washington’s dysfunction and take the first critical steps to protect our state’s progress.”
To that end, a news release listed several bills to address funding cuts and health care, including:
• amending the Rural Health Care Delivery Fund to allow for grants to health care providers and facilities in high-needs geographic health professional shortage areas and stabilize the provision of existing health care services.
• adjusting eligibility requirements for participating in the state health insurance exchange
• allowing the state health department to set vaccination standards for adults and children

“While the new federal law brings significant changes, our focus is clear: protecting benefits and services for the 40 percent of New Mexicans who rely on our programs for health care and food assistance,” Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo said in a statement. “We’re committed to maintaining a strong safety net through these challenges.”
The federal budget will also cut into the state’s food assistance programs. As of August 2025, 459,535 New Mexicans use SNAP — about 21% of the state’s population, which is the highest rate in the country.
“Deep federal budget cuts and continued chaos in Washington, D. C. are making life harder and more expensive for New Mexicans now. But New Mexico’s leaders are ready for this fight, so we’re stepping up to address the most pressing issues facing families: skyrocketing healthcare premiums, seniors losing food benefits, and rural healthcare providers on the brink,” House Speaker Javier Martínez said in a statement. “This special session is about making sure families across our state have access to the things they cannot live without.”
Five things to know about federal food assistance cuts before the special session

The governor had said previously the session would not include legislation to increase the state’s participation in interstate medical compacts, which Republican lawmakers and advocacy group Think New Mexico have said would help address the shortage of health care workers in the state. State Democratic leaders, however, have resisted tackling the topic in advance of next year’s special session. A compromise, however, appears to have been reached, as the “studying and preparing for the implementation of any interstate medical licensing compact” will be on the agenda.
“We’re serious about compacts,” Chris Nordstrum, a spokesman for Senate Democrats, told Source NM Tuesday. “The full intention is to get them tackled in January, and this just gets us one step closer to being able to move quickly once we do.”
Similarly, while criminal justice topics were not expected for the session, the agenda will include a bill to amend competency laws to allow metropolitan courts to determine competency.
Other additions to the agenda, include: confirming Western New Mexico University regents; appropriating funds to the Administrative Office of the Courts for a competency pilot program and behavioral health support for parties in legal proceedings; transferring funds into the Appropriation Contingency Fund to ensure New Mexico has money set aside for emergency response; and appropriating funds to supplement the New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department’s budget.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0521-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 18:58:33.661892

The 104-99 vote was one of three held Tuesday to try to toughen the commonwealth’s gun laws. They highlighted the complexity of passing firearms reforms in the narrowly split House, where the divide between rural and urban interests doesn’t always follow party lines. 
Five Republicans joined the majority of Democrats in support of the background check bill, which now goes to the Republican-controlled state Senate for consideration. It is one of four gun bills quickly passed out of the House Judiciary Committee last week in the wake of high profile shootings in September. They included the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah and an ambush that killed three law enforcement officers during a shootout in York County.
A bill to create a red flag law allowing courts to temporarily ban people deemed a risk to themselves or others from possessing firearms failed by one vote – 101-102. A third measure banning undetectable ghost guns also came up short by the same margin. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Democratic leaders did not call a vote for the fourth bill, which would ban devices intended to make semi-automatic weapons fire at the same rate as automatic ones. 
As in past gun safety votes, Democratic Rep. Frank Burns, whose largely rural district covers part of Cambria County, broke ranks by voting “no” on all three gun bills. 
Democratic Reps. Jim Haddock, of Luzerne County, and Anita Kulik, who is chairperson of the House Game and Fisheries Committee, joined Burns in opposition to the background check legislation.
Republican Reps. Joe Hogan, Kathleen Tomlinson, Kristin Marcell and Craig Williams, who each represent districts in the Philadelphia suburbs, voted in favor of the bill as did Rep. Martina White, the only House Republican who represents part of Philadelphia.
House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) said during debate on the House floor that more gun laws would not prevent “those who are most dangerous” gaining access to firearms.
“We’ve seen it nationally and through various states … the only thing that these restrictions have led to is an infringement on the constitutional rights of Americans who own and use guns legally,” Topper said.
Rep. Aaron Bernstine (R-Lawrence) raised a question on the constitutionality of House Bill 1859, the red flag law measure, claiming it violates the state constitution’s provision that the right to bear arms “shall not be questioned.” The motion failed in a 101-102 party-line vote.
House Bill 1099 would ban firearms made entirely of non-metal materials, or not containing at least one major component made entirely of metal that can pass through metal detectors unnoticed.  “Ghost guns” are often built by amateur gunsmiths using plastic parts that skirt federal serial number regulations or are produced using 3D printers.

Rep. Tim Bonner (R-Mercer) said “ghost gun” is a sinister name for something that has been common throughout the nation’s history, noting that the U.S. Supreme Court recently held that gun laws must be considered in a historical context to determine whether they are constitutional.
“We call them ghost guns today. Our Founding Fathers and our true patriots called them homemade guns,” Bonner said.
He  added there are already federal and state laws that require all firearms to be detectable by metal detectors.
“We all want to see this violence stopped,” he said. “But recycling the same gun laws that have either been declared unconstitutional or where we already have legislation on the books to deal with it is not a solution to the problem of violence in this country.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gun-rack-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-09-30 18:58:33.661892

Fidelis Malembeka, a former Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba appointee, said after heading up Jackson’s finances for the last four years, Tuesday was his last day with the city but that he would still be around to answer questions. 
Jackson plans to announce a permanent chief financial officer appointment “very soon,” Horhn told Mississippi Today. In the meantime, to aid in the development of next year’s budget, the city has contracted with Michael Thomas of Systems Consultants Associates to create performance indicators for city departments.
“He is evaluating the financial department to see where there are greater efficiencies that can be had, and he is also looking at any possibility that a deeper dive may need to take place on a forensic audit,” Horhn said.

Thomas’s contract, which the city opted to issue without a bid, is not to exceed $50,000. The shift in financial leadership comes just after the city adopted a flat budget earlier this month — a precautionary move resulting in part from the city’s failure to maintain annual audits. 
The city is still working to complete its 2023 audit, which it was supposed to finalize last year but faced challenges in doing so due to the privatization of the city’s water system in 2022. The financial statements from the city and the water utility must be combined, but JXN Water, the third party manager, produced an audit by calendar year instead of municipal fiscal year, making the reports difficult to reconcile, Thomas said.
Thomas said the city’s goal is to finish both the 2023 and 2024 audits by next September. 
As an example of a performance indicator Systems Consultants Associates might recommend, Thomas mentioned the city’s Public Works Department. The department might be given a timeframe to complete a task — say, 24 hours from the time a pothole is identified to the time it is paved — that the department could be measured against. 
Thomas said it’s too early in his assessment to tell which departments are already effectively measured versus ones that need new benchmarks.
It’s also up to the administration to take the consultant’s recommendations. Thomas said the last time he helped the city in this capacity was during the Tony Yarber administration. He was tasked with finding efficiencies, such as with the in-house print shop — an enterprise fund that generates revenue for the city. Instead of using outside companies for the Jackson’s printing needs, Thomas said he suggests the city use its own shop. 
Public Works, a crucial yet challenged city department, has lacked a permanent leader for nearly two years now. The city council filled the vacancy Tuesday, confirming Lorenzo Anderson as the next director.
WLBT reported that Anderson most recently served as Washington County’s engineer while working for IMS Engineers – a familiar contractor to the city of Jackson – but was removed in 2024. 
This work history was not raised by council members during the confirmation, but Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes noted that he’d recently had an opportunity to check out  Anderson’s former jurisdiction.

“I had a chance to go to Washington County, to the Delta Blues festival. I presented Bobby Rush a plaque, and the roads are great,” Stokes said. 
Just after confirming Anderson, Horhn announced the city had signed on a $40 million bond issue for ditches, drainage, street and bridge repair that “might have just made Mr. Anderson’s job a little easier.”
The city is still working to fill two other major positions: the Jackson Police Department Chief after Joseph Wade stepped down in August, and director of planning and development, a position Von Anderson has held since July on an interim basis.
The city is holding listening sessions to engage the public on the search for a new police chief. As for Planning and Development, Horhn said the city is still working through applications.
“We think we need a planning and development director with more breadth and depth of experience,” he said. 
Shortly after his inauguration, Horhn announced that Grace Fisher, communications director at the Mississippi Department of Corrections, would serve as the city’s new communications director, but after the announcement, she remained at MDOC. 
The council on Tuesday confirmed Nic Lott, a government affairs consultant and former Republican gubernatorial staffer, as the director of communications and constituent services. In addition to spearheading the city’s social media, Lott will work on a committee alongside Information Technology Director Nathan Slater, also confirmed Tuesday, on rebuilding the website. 
Ward 5 Councilmember Vernon Hartley asked Lott if he would work with council members who he said have not had the opportunity to coordinate with the city’s communications department in the past. 
“I believe we should go about telling the story of what we’re doing in the city better,” Lott said.  
A staple in city and county government, Pieter Teeuwissen, was also confirmed as chief administrative officer. Stokes, the most tenured member of the council, recounted that when he left the city in 2012 for a stint on the Hinds County Board of Supervisors, he asked Teeuwissen, then city attorney, to follow him there.
“I asked him would he consider coming to Hinds County to keep us out of jail and he came to Hinds County, did a wonderful job, kept us out of jail,” Stokes said.
Speaking before her confirmation, Municipal Clerk Angela Harris said she was continuing efforts she began in 2022 to digitize the city’s files. 
While confirming Harris, two council members urged the mayor to look at bringing the city clerk’s office back under the council, where it resided before the Lumumba administration moved it under the mayor.
“We have that under review. We have just been dealing with crisis management since we started here 12 weeks ago and as things settle down, we’ll get into the reorganization that we’ve been talking about,” Horhn responded.
During the confirmation of City Attorney Drew Martin, Hartley recommended taking more frequent legal action to hold parties accountable for the poor conditions, such as blight, that Jacksonians are experiencing. He implored the legal staff to find more ways “to make sure that we have our knife sharpened when it comes to these issues affecting our quality of life,” Hartley said.

“We hear the complaints, we hear the issues, and a lot of times there is a legal remedy, and I’d like for us to be a little bit more nimble, a little but more flexible in applying it so we can get some results so we can’t tell the folks that there’s nothing we can do,” Hartley said.
When it came time to confirm Director of Human Resources Toya Martin, a Lumumba holdover, Ward 4 Councilman Brian Grizzell said he was “completely against” the nomination and said he had drafted a resolution for a vote of no confidence in the director he may introduce later. Martin was confirmed by a 5-2 vote.
The council also confirmed six municipal court judges, Taurean Buchanan, Kevin Bass, Lilli Bass, June Hardwick, Jeffrey Reynolds and Virginia Watkins.
The following cabinet appointments by Horhn were confirmed Tuesday:

Chief Administrative Officer Pieter Teeuwissen
Fire Chief RaSean Thomas
Director of Human and Cultural Services Pamela Junior
Information Technology Director Nathan Slater
Director of Communications and Constituent Services Nic Lott
Municipal Clerk Angela Harris
Director of Human Resources Toya Martin
City Attorney Drew Martin

It will rise 2.8% to $17.13 per hour, starting Jan. 1, the state Department of Labor and Industries announced Tuesday. The current $16.66 per-hour wage already leads the nation, though California and parts of New York are close at $16.50. The federal minimum wage is set at $7.25. 
The cities of Seattle, Bellingham, Burien, Everett, Renton, SeaTac and Tukwila all set minimum wages higher than the state. As does unincorporated King County. Advocates in Lynnwood are looking to join that list, as they gather support for a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage to $20.24 per hour there.
The annual statewide minimum wage increase is calculated based on inflation. California’s minimum wage, by comparison, will jump slightly to $16.90 in 2026. 
The state is also upping the threshold for exempting salaried workers from overtime pay. 
In 2026, Washington employers will need to pay overtime exempt workers at least 2.25 times the minimum wage, totaling $80,168 per year. It’s a big jump from this year, as the tipping point for small employers is $69,305 and $77,969 for bigger employers. In 2028, the figure is set to rise to $93,392 and 2.5 times the minimum wage for all businesses.
Workers aged 14- and 15-years-old are allowed to make 85% of minimum wage, so their rate will be $14.56 per hour in 2026. 
Minimum wage for ride-booking drivers, for services like Lyft and Uber, is also increasing. For trips in Seattle next year, drivers with passengers will earn 70 cents per minute and $1.63 per mile, or $6.12, whichever is greater. Trips outside Seattle will earn drivers 40 cents per minute and $1.38 per mile, with a minimum of $3.55.
This year, state lawmakers considered accelerating increases to Washington’s minimum wage, to $25 in 2031. The legislation didn’t advance in the Legislature, but could return in the 2026 session that begins in January.

Circuit Judge Daniel Green, in his second ruling on the ballot description of the measure proposed by lawmakers, said that Hoskins got most of the language right.
But Hoskins’ language on the portion that will be the issue the question turns on — repealing the abortion rights protections approved by voters last year —  is “insufficient and unfair” and must be revised, Green ruled.
Hoskins rewrote the ballot language prepared by Republican lawmakers after Green ruled it, also, did not alert voters that it would repeal the voter-approved amendment.
The measure would repeal the citizen-led initiative passed in 2024 that made Missouri the first state to overturn an abortion ban by guaranteeing the constitutional right to abortion up to the point of fetal viability. 
On Wednesday, Green ruled that Hoskins also missed the mark by failing to inform voters of the repeal, taking issue with just one bullet point in Hoskins’ summary that reads: 
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:  

Amend Article I, section 36, approved in 2024; allowing abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest;”

This summary “fails to adequately alert voters that the proposed constitutional amendment would abrogate Article 1, Section 36 of the Missouri Constitution, which voters recently approved,” Green wrote. 
Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway’s Office in briefings submitted Monday said Hoskins’ latest language was sufficient because it stated the new amendment would cause a “modification” of state statute and that repeal language would be inaccurate because the new amendment “does not abolish all the constitutional rights first enshrined in Article I, section 36,” including the right to miscarriage care.
For example, the attorney general wrote, the new amendment “recognizes a right to abortion in some cases, and such a right was unprecedented in the Missouri Constitution before the voters enacted Article I, section 36 in 2024.” 
Prior to the passage of the abortion rights amendment, nearly all abortions were illegal in Missouri, with limited exceptions for medical emergencies.
Attorneys with The ACLU of Missouri and Stinson Law in briefings Monday said Hoskins’ new language “at best, pays lip service” to Green’s order but “does not describe the probable effects of the measure.”
Hoskins is obligated, they argued, “to tell voters that they are being asked to repeal, not merely amend, the right to reproductive freedom.”
Jefferson City attorney Chuck Hatfield, in his filing, also took issue with the use of a semi-colon in the statement, saying it contributes to the “grammatical nonsense” of the language sure to leave voters confused.
Green on Tuesday ruled that the remaining bullet points are now acceptable. They read: 
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:

Guarantee women’s medical care for emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
and Prohibit sex-change procedures for children?”

Under a law passed this year and upheld in a separate case by Green, Hoskins has five days to submit revised ballot language to the court. If after that, Green decides the language still doesn’t follow the law, Hoskins has one more opportunity to rewrite it. If Green still doesn’t find the language satisfactory, the judge will rewrite it himself. 
Hoskins was also responsible for writing the fair ballot statement that appears in polling places and on the office’s website that summarize what both a “yes” and “no” vote mean.
Campaign gears up to defeat Missouri abortion ban amendment

Green previously told Hoskins to rewrite the “fair ballot language” summary posted to the secretary of state’s website, calling the old language misleading for also failing to state abortion would be banned in most cases.  
In his ruling Tuesday, Green deemed the new summary was sufficient. 
This approved summary states that a “yes” vote would guarantee women’s medical care under specific scenarios, including ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages and allow abortions in the first 12 weeks festation in cases of rape or incest. It would also ban gender-affirming health care for minors.   
A “no” vote, Hoskins wrote, would “limit abortion” to specific scenarios.
As the one-year anniversary of the abortion rights amendment approaches, access to the procedure in Missouri remains limited as legal battles challenging a series of abortion regulations play out in the courts.
Medication abortions remain halted. Procedural abortions are available on a limited basis at Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis.

Since the August decision, more than 215 households have appealed their emergency housing cases to the Human Services Board, according to the board’s chief hearing officer.

A citizen panel’s decision, which challenged the state’s view of the motel program’s 80-day limit and caused a rush of appeals, will stand for now after a Vermont Supreme Court order last week. 
The order is part of an ongoing case examining how the limit is enforced, and will likely allow many vulnerable households to remain sheltered, or regain access to housing for the time being, advocates said.
The state’s motel voucher program, which has constricted throughout the last two years despite increases in unsheltered homelessness, provides temporary housing for people without other financial resources who are in particularly vulnerable situations.

The Human Services Board concluded last month that the state’s Department for Children and Families had incorrectly enforced the motel program’s 80-day limit for a petitioner referred to as “H.D.” The central point of contention was whether the department could consider a participant’s use of the program in the previous fiscal year — before July 1, 2025 — when reviewing their application. 
The department, which believes that a “rolling,” or retrospective, calendar is the correct approach by law, appealed the decision to the Vermont Supreme Court in a case that is still pending. 
Since the August decision, more than 215 households have appealed their emergency housing cases to the Human Services Board, in addition to “numerous” cases which were already pending, according to the board’s chief hearing officer Joe Reinert. While the Department for Children and Families claimed the board’s decision would result in an unlawful use of taxpayer money, advocates said the state budget supports the board’s interpretation, which would provide important respite to people in need.
In last week’s order, the Supreme Court declined to suspend the Human Services Board’s decision as these hearings move forward. Both sides of the argument are “rooted in conceivable analyses,” read the court’s decision, and therefore the state “has not met its burden” for its motion to be granted.
This allows the board to continue using its previous decision as an informal precedent, according to Vermont Legal Aid staff attorney Maryellen Griffin. So far, her organization’s clients under similar circumstances to “H.D.” have had positive initial rulings. Many have been granted “benefits pending appeal,” allowing medically vulnerable people and children back indoors while their case is decided, Griffin said.
“We are definitely having trouble keeping up with demand,” Griffin said, adding that eligible people can also appeal their denial themselves when possible.
DCF officials declined to comment, but the state’s Sept. 9 motion, filed by the Attorney General’s office, said that the board’s decision would allow taxpayer dollars to be “misspent,” and cause confusion in the administration of the program.
“The Hearing Officers overseeing HSB cases have continued to overturn DCF decisions related to the interpretation of the 80-day cap,” read the motion, adding that the board’s decision last month “fundamentally contravenes law.”
In addition to incurring added costs of up to $2.1 million, the department estimated, the decision would likely cause the motel program to become full too quickly. Advocates have countered that the program appears to be well below its 1,100-room maximum as of Sept. 29.
“They have the resources,” said End Homelessness Vermont Executive Director Brenda Siegel, adding that the department’s motion “would have caused a lot of harm.”
Siegel said her organization was representing roughly 60 people who had been denied benefits, with “more coming every day.” In some cases, given their age or medical circumstances, Siegel said she would fear for the lives of her clients were they forced to remain outside.
The end of Gov. Phil Scott’s executive order extending motel stays for certain medically vulnerable people and households with children forced hundreds to leave shelter on July 1. 
“These were all highly medically vulnerable people, or children or people who were pregnant,” Siegel said.
Griffin said she had recently been representing a family of six in their appeal to the Human Services Board. Both parents work, she said, and are raising four children while trying to locate more stable housing.
“I just don’t know how they could do that without having a safe place to stay,” Griffin said. The ability to access benefits, even during the period where the family’s case is being processed, could be crucial, she said.
“It seems that we’ve lost sight of what the purpose of this (program) is,” Siegel said, “which is to help human beings to be safe and be sheltered.”

Mississippi is one of the poorest and most federally dependent states, and President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” includes the largest spending reductions to Medicaid and food assistance in history. Even sectors that don’t face direct cuts from the law, such as child care, will be heavily impacted by shifts in state budgets, experts say. 
Women stand to lose the most from these changes, with effects on children, families, communities and businesses.

Changes to Medicaid disproportionately impact women, not only because women participate more often in the program – due to the wage gap and life events such as childbirth – but also because they are more often caregivers to those on Medicaid. Women are also the bulk of rural health care workers who could be impacted by hospital closures. 
Those trends are even clearer in Mississippi, where nearly two-thirds of births are funded by Medicaid. That’s the second highest in the country. 
While the law doesn’t change eligibility criteria for pregnant women, the spending cuts will trigger downsizing of many rural hospitals – and labor and delivery units are often the first to go when hospital budgets shrink. 
Women in rural areas already have too few options for giving birth. Half of Mississippi’s counties are maternity care deserts, and the state Health Department recently declared a public health emergency for the state’s infant mortality rate – the highest in the nation.

Many of the law’s provisions will disproportionately harm women, including pregnant patients, and children – even though it was touted as “family friendly,” said Megan Cole Brahim, a health policy researcher at Boston University. 
“It makes it more difficult for eligible people to remain enrolled through more administrative burdens,” Cole Brahim said. “And secondly, it ultimately cuts funding available to states and forces states to make difficult decisions about who it will cover and what it will cover. It impacts the entire health care ecosystem.”
Fewer Mississippians will lose coverage than people in other states, but experts say that’s not a win. The main group losing coverage in other states are those Mississippi already doesn’t insure because it is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid to the working poor.

“The coverage losses will primarily be felt by those adults covered by Medicaid expansion – folks who are already shut out of coverage in a state like Mississippi that has not picked up expansion,” said Joan Alker, a Medicaid expert at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families. 
Despite having among the strictest income requirements for Medicaid in the nation, Mississippi has one of the highest rates of Medicaid enrollees – a fact that reflects the number of poor people in the state. 
To qualify for Medicaid, able-bodied adults in Mississippi must make less than 28% of the federal poverty level, a mere $7,000 annually for a family of three. 
More than a quarter of child care workers nationwide are on Medicaid, and losing coverage or access to services may weaken the already tenuous child care workforce, speakers said Tuesday at the Capitol during a hearing hosted by the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus.

“The law’s cuts to Medicaid will hit the child care workforce particularly hard, and that is going to have major ripple effects,” said Ruth Friedman, who was director of the Office of Child Care in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services during the Biden administration.
“Its unprecedented cuts to health insurance and food assistance and the mandates it places on states is going to make the child care crisis much worse for millions of families,” she said.
Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will be one of the most significant impacts to Mississippi’s budget, said Theresa Lau, senior policy counsel at the Southern Poverty Law Center.
“This law forces states for the first time to pay for SNAP benefits, which will shift billions of dollars in costs to states,” Lau said.
It will also expand work reporting requirements for the food assistance program, which Lau said kicks many eligible families off the program, especially in states like Mississippi, where many people live in rural areas without consistent internet access.

Caregiving responsibilities in the home fall primarily to women – not to mention 95% of child care workers nationwide are women. 
Women also make up more than 80% of people working in rural hospitals who would be laid off as the facilities close under budget cuts. 
The cuts to Medicaid will also affect nursing homes and residents. In a national survey this year, more than half of nursing homes said they would have to reduce staff under Medicaid cuts. 
Cutting staff in an industry where 99% of facilities already don’t meet staffing requirements will have drastic repercussions on those served by and employed in nursing homes – both predominantly female.

Conversation around the federal spending law signed by Trump highlights a major partisan rift. Both parties centralize their arguments around the concept of family, with Republicans capitalizing on rhetoric about “tax breaks for working families” and Democrats capitalizing on rhetoric about protecting the most vulnerable. 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, who voted against the federal spending cuts, spoke to the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus over video conference Tuesday and quoted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

(Photo by Lora Wobbema/For the North Dakota Monitor)The Bank of North Dakota is working on a new loan assistance program for farmers in response to tough financial conditions facing the industry.
Don Morgan, president of the state-owned Bank of North Dakota, said the state’s agricultural industry has been hit hard by a combination of low commodity prices, a sustained period of high interest rates and inflation. 
“We believe we have an extreme stress situation coming up in our agricultural sector for 2026,” Morgan told the North Dakota Industrial Commission on Tuesday. 
The Bank of North Dakota is preparing a new relief program for farmers and ranchers modeled after a 2019 program that worked very well, Morgan said. 
“It allowed our banks and credit unions to restructure some agricultural debt at some below-market rates,” Morgan said. 
Federal trade, health policies add to concerns for North Dakota farmers, state ag commissioner says

The details of the program have yet to be determined. Morgan will return to the Industrial Commission in November or December, he said, with a finished product for the board’s approval “so that we could roll out for the 2026 ag renewal season,” he said. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the Industrial Commission, urged bank officials to keep in mind that there is discussion in Washington, D.C., about a federal relief program for farmers this year, though he noted the exact timing may change. 
“My concern is not knowing what the federal government is going to do,” Armstrong said. 
The other factor to keep in mind, Armstrong said, is there will likely be a special session of the North Dakota Legislature at the start of 2026. If the Bank of North Dakota is rolling out a loan assistance program at the same time, the governor said it will likely be a topic of discussion for lawmakers. 
Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring, Armstrong’s colleague on the Industrial Commission, suggested the Legislature could consider additional aid for farmers if the state-owned bank’s program is insufficient. 
Morgan said it’s important to get the relief program rolled out with time to spare before banks begin working with farmers to renew agricultural loans this winter, even if the Legislature decides to provide additional assistance after the program is implemented.
“The banks do need some time to prepare because most of the ag renewals come in February, March, April, May,” Morgan said.

A Manchester woman arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents was granted a request to be released on bond at a Detroit Immigration Court hearing Tuesday morning.
Davona Williams, 42, was held at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility after her arrest on Aug. 25. Williams was transferred to North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan, a week later, where she is currently detained. Originally from the island nation of Jamaica, Williams had been living with her three children and partner in Manchester, Vermont. Williams had resided in the U.S. for nearly two decades, and was engaged in a yearslong process to gain legal status. 
Detroit Immigration Court Judge Mark J. Jebson ruled that Williams was not a flight risk and posed no danger to the community, according to Williams’ attorney Christopher Worth, a Vermont Law and Graduate School visiting professor who is representing her pro bono through the school’s Center for Justice Reform. At the Tuesday hearing, Jebson awarded the request to release Williams from ICE custody on $7,500 bond, Worth said. 
Rutland Area NAACP President Mia Schultz organized a group to show support for Williams by appearing at the virtual hearing, but said they could not join in because the mass attendance bogged down the online systems. 
Despite the technical difficulties, Schultz said the show of support proved positive for the outcome of the hearing. The immigration judge noted the number of people attempting to join Tuesday’s hearing as evidence of Williams’ strong community ties before granting the release request, Worth said.
Once Williams returns to Vermont, Worth said the Center for Justice Reform will file a motion to move the case to Chelmsford Immigration Court in Massachusetts and continue seeking legal relief to prevent deportation. 
Schultz said the next step is to fundraise through GoFundMe and pool community resources to post bond and pay for Williams’ transportation back to Vermont.
“There’s still things to address, but the biggest hurdle was getting her home to be back with her children,” Schultz said. “She gets to come home.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — State Superintendent Ryan Walters formally tendered his resignation late Tuesday afternoon, but Gov. Kevin Sitt still has yet to announce who he will appoint as a replacement.
“While I am leaving this office today, I am not leaving the fight,” Walters wrote in his resignation letter, which Oklahoma Voice obtained. “The challenges before us remain significant, but the opportunities are even greater. My commitment to serve this state and its people is as strong as ever, and I will continue to seek ways to advance the principles of freedom, accountability, and excellence in the days ahead.”
Walters announced last week his intentions to resign to become the CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, an anti-teacher-union nonprofit. His resignation letter states his final day in office is Tuesday. He is expected to step into his new role Wednesday.
Walters, a Republican, has not disclosed whether he intends to run for elected office in the future. He would have been eligible for another four-year term as state superintendent had he won reelection.
All eyes now turn to Stitt to decide who will finish the remaining 15 months of Walters’ four-year term. The appointee will lead the Oklahoma State Department of Education and chair the Oklahoma State Board of Education until January 2027.

Stitt said last week he will seek a “leader who is fully focused on the job Oklahomans expect: delivering real outcomes and driving a turnaround in our education system.” 
After Walters delivered his resignation letter, a spokesperson for the Governor’s Office said there would be no announcement of an appointee on Tuesday.
Walters addressed his resignation letter to Stitt, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton. 
He credited his administration at the Education Department as having “advanced reforms many believed could never be achieved,” including empowering parents, demanding transparency in public schools and expanding school choice options.
He closed his letter by thanking his family, the people of Oklahoma, and public school educators and families.
“I leave this position with gratitude, optimism, and confidence that Oklahoma’s best days are still to come,” he wrote.

(Photo by Barbra Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma’s Public Safety Commissioner vowed Tuesday to continue the crackdown on commercial truck drivers passing through the state without legal status.
“Moving forward, we’ll continue with these types of operations because our desire is to make sure that every Oklahoman is safe,” said Public Safety Commissioner Tim Tipton. 
During a three-day operation last week conducted in conjunction with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 120 people were arrested for immigration violations, Tipton said.
Troopers made 520 contacts at the port of entry along eastbound Interstate 40 in Beckham County during the enforcement blitz, dubbed Operation Guardian, Tipton said.
About 25% of the people were not in the country legally, Tipton said.
“Approximately 90% of those illegal aliens were commercial motor vehicle drivers,” Tipton said.
Those arrested came from several countries, and all had crossed the southern U.S. border, Tipton said.
Some had reentered illegally after being deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he said.
Several had final deportation orders in place and had not responded, he said.
Others had made an undetected border crossing, he said. The list of those arrested also included people who had overstayed their visas, Tipton said.
Some had prior criminal histories that included charges for money laundering, assault, driving under the influence, assault, human smuggling and drug trafficking, he said.
“Everybody was taken into custody without any resistance,” Tipton said.
Those arrested were taken to ICE offices in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, before being moved to holding facilities in Oklahoma and or Texas, Tipton said.
The vehicles the individuals were driving were impounded, he said.
“The owner of the trucking company can go to that yard and recover the truck,” Tipton said.
On Monday, Gov. Kevin Stitt said one driver had been issued a New York commercial driver’s license  that listed “No Name Given” as the name.
The New York Department of Motor Vehicles said in a statement Tuesday that the license was issued in accordance with all proper procedures, including verification of the individual’s identity through federally issued documentation.
“The individual has lawful status in the United States through a federal employment authorization and was issued a license consistent with federal guidelines,” according to the statement.
“It is not uncommon for individuals from other countries to have only one name.”
Tipton said under new federal guidelines, he doesn’t believe New York will be able to continue that licensing practice.
The blitz involved 20 troopers, employees from ICE, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections and the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma lawmakers Tuesday probed why Oklahoma consumers face the highest insurance rates in the nation and what steps they can take to mitigate those soaring costs.
The bipartisan legislative interim study is expected to be the first of two interim studies, digging into why Oklahomans have seen their homeowner’s insurance premiums top $6,100 annually, more than double the national average. Lawmakers often use interim studies to help craft legislation on issues. 
The high insurance costs hurt everyone, said Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, who led the study. Homeowners lose protection, insurance agents lose business and home ownership is harder to attain, he said. 
Fugate said he wants to find a way to keep homeowner’s insurance affordable, fair and reliable for Oklahoma families without cutting coverage. 
“I’m a big believer in trying to identify a problem in a way that helps other people get on board,” he said. “And it’s great that we have a number of experts who are going to be here today, not the least of which is our (Insurance) Commissioner, to help us kind of dig in and navigate what’s driving the cost and what we might do to mitigate.” 
Glen Mulready, Oklahoma’s insurance commissioner, told lawmakers Tuesday that rising homeowner’s insurance costs are not just an Oklahoma problem but a national one. 
“When we come together as insurance commissioners from around the country, that is what we are talking about,” Mulready said. “The property insurance problem, specifically homeowners, because it touches so many people, and everybody is dealing with it.”
Severe weather, like Oklahoma’s March wildfires and over 100 tornadoes this year, are part of the reason insurance costs have increased, he said. Every state has different “perils,” like hurricanes or other severe weather events, it has to attempt to mitigate with insurance costs, Mulready said. 
But Oklahoma Watch reported that data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration did not show significant differences in severe weather events between Oklahoma and neighboring states, which have lower insurance costs. 
On average, Americans spend 2.4% of their annual income on homeowner’s insurance, but Oklahomans spend over 6.8%, according to Oklahoma Watch. Residents in Arkansas and Texas spend over 4% while Kansans spend 5.5%. 
Mulready said Oklahoma’s insurance industry is a competitive marketplace. 
Oklahoma’s insurance marketplace has maintained an Herfindahl-Hirschman Index score below 1,200 since at least 2020. A score under 1,500 on the index, which measures competitiveness and compares the size of companies relative to the size of the industry, is indicative of a competitive market, he said. 
Oklahoma’s insurance market is a “use and file” state, meaning insurers can immediately use new rates but must file them with the Oklahoma Insurance Department within 30 days.  
Other states require prior approval when new rates are filed and must be approved by the state before they’re used or “file and use,” meaning new rates can be immediately implemented while the state reviews them. 
For Oklahoma to change the way its homeowner’s insurance rates are regulated, lawmakers would have to approve statutory changes, Mulready said. 
He said neighboring states like Texas, which is a “file and use state,” does not have a less competitive market because of its process. 
Heather Morton of the National Conference of State Legislatures said other states have begun proposing policies to mitigate rising costs, like state-run insurance plans, disaster relief savings accounts or programs and tax credits to help homeowners fortify their homes. 
Oklahoma has already launched a program, Strengthen Oklahoma Homes, to provide grants to some Oklahoma residents for wind and hail mitigation on their homes. 
Ward Tisdale, a regional vice president of the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, said pressures on the insurance industry, like severe weather from climate change, inflation, regulatory challenges and “legal system abuse,” have contributed to rising costs. The association works to continue education for insurance industry professionals and advocate on their behalf. 
The U.S. has experienced over $123 billion in “severe convective storm losses” in 2023-24, Tisdale said. In comparison, the two most costly hurricane seasons in U.S. history were in 2004-05 at $182 billion. 
Rep. Preston Stinson, R-Edmond, led the study along with Fugate, but was not present Tuesday. He said in a statement that he believes the Oklahoma Insurance Department is doing the best it can within statute, he wants to explore changes that can bring Oklahoma’s rates closer to neighboring states. 
“While the immediate impact of these increases is on home ownership affordability, the ripple effects extend much further,” he said. “Higher insurance costs make it harder to recruit and retain merchant businesses. They add financial pressures that can lead to food insecurity, divert health care and even contribute to domestic violence.”

(Kansas Reflector screen capture)TOPEKA — Dawn Wheeler, a small business owner in Edwardsville, receives treatment for her metastatic breast cancer almost weekly.
One shot, which she gets every other week to treat cancer in her liver, costs around $10,000, she said.
“That doesn’t include all the doctor visits, all the regular testing I have to have, two other chemo pills I have to have, all of which I would not be able to afford if I did not have the ACA,” Wheeler said Tuesday during a virtual press call organized by U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Kansas Democrat.
Wheeler is one of more than 187,000 Kansans who rely on Affordable Care Act premium tax credits to subsidize health care costs, but those credits are set to expire at the end of the year, and advocates are warning of lost coverage and a more than 75% spike in premium costs as they wait for lawmakers to decide the credits’ fate.
Unless Congress extends the tax credits, health care costs for the more than 22 million Americans who have health insurance through the ACA Marketplace are expected to increase, and community hospitals could bear the burden of uncompensated care. In Kansas, the vast majority of the more than 200,000 people enrolled in the marketplace receive premium tax credits, according to data from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research and news organization.
Cindy Samuelson, senior vice president of member and public relations for the Kansas Hospital Association, said on the call that hospitals have made it clear that premium tax credits have played a key role in reducing the number of uninsured patients in Kansas and across the country.
On average, enrollees’ annual premium costs could increase by an estimated $700, or 77%, if the tax credits are not extended. Samuelson said. Projections from KFF estimate that between 48,000 and 61,000 Kansans could lose coverage because of higher premium costs over the next decade. An estimate from the Hutchinson-based United Methodist Health Ministry Fund projects 108,000 Kansans losing coverage over the same time frame.
“The reality is, when someone doesn’t have health insurance, we know that they are more likely to stop taking care of themselves,” Samuelson said.
People are more likely to halt preventative health care services, and people with chronic conditions are more likely to delay health care, waiting until their health worsens and they end up in an emergency room, which is often the most expensive kind of care, Samuelson said.
Wheeler, who owns a health screening business with her husband, said she doesn’t know what they would do without ACA coverage.
“I honestly don’t think I’d be alive,” she said. “I know we wouldn’t have a house anymore. That’s the reality of it.”
Davids said she supports a permanent extension to the tax credits. In her district, which represents 4½ counties in and around the Kansas City area, she said a family of four could see a $7,000 increase in their premiums. A 60-year-old couple could see a nearly $17,000 increase, she said.
“If we don’t act, the ripple effect of this increase will be devastating,” Davids said.
She said she is willing to work with either party to pass a feasible extension.
“We are also staring down another challenge that, unfortunately, we’ve become too familiar with, which is a potential government shutdown,” Davids said.
Congress has until midnight Tuesday to avoid a government shutdown, which could impact Kansas’ nearly 20,000 federal employees and active-duty service members, as well as access to federal services.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250930_wheeler.png,,,2025-09-30 18:58:33.661892

(Photo: AdobeStock)Anti-hunger advocates highlighted a new report Tuesday showing how rising food costs are straining families in North Carolina and across the country. Non-profit group No Kid Hungry said its research shows how vital free and reduced-price school meals are as students settle into the fall semester. 
The 2025 Back to School Report, released earlier this month, surveyed more than 1,200 parents and caregivers whose children rely on school meals. It found that 41% of parents said their financial situation is worse than a year ago, while nearly 70% said inflation has made it harder to buy the groceries they need.
“We wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the hopes and concerns of parents and caregivers about the upcoming school year, and to better understand the vital role that school meals play for kids and families, both inside and outside of the classroom,” said Corey Filiault, who oversaw the research.
In North Carolina, close to 60% of students in traditional public schools qualify for free or reduced-price school meals. With many households juggling rent, utilities and transportation costs alongside food, advocates say federal nutrition programs provide critical stability.
A mother of five from North Carolina told researchers that soaring grocery and gas prices forced her to cut back on essentials. “It’s just certain things that we really cut back on doing. You just gotta know what you can actually go without and still be okay,” she said in the report. 
Nationally, more than one in three parents said they worried about running out of food over the summer, when school cafeterias are closed. Two out of three parents expect food prices to rise further this year.
The report also found that 83% of parents said their children struggle to concentrate when hungry, and 88% said school meals help them do better in school. Beyond the classroom, two out of three parents said school meals reduce family stress, easing household finances and improving overall well-being.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AdobeStock_hunger-school-lunch.jpg,,,2025-09-30 18:58:33.661892

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Two former lawyers within the state’s Office of Attorney General are officially vying to replace Peter Neronha as Rhode Island’s next top prosecutor when his term ends next year, with at least one more Democrat eyeing a 2026 run. 
And the state’s current Democratic AG already has made his choice for a successor.
Stopping near the Providence pedestrian bridge Tuesday for the campaign kickoff of one of those candidates Tuesday afternoon, Neronha outlined the stakes of being an AG in today’s political climate. To serve Rhode Islanders, he said the office needs to be “active and aggressive” in areas like health care and the environment in addition to enforcing public safety.
“There is one person who I believe that is suited to become our next attorney general and he is right behind me,” he said. “There is no doubt in my mind that Keith Hoffmann is that person.”
Hoffmann, 38, a resident of Providence’s East Side, most recently served as the chief of policy and senior counsel for Neronha’s office after working as the head of the AG’s civil rights unit. He left his job in August when he filed papers to make his first run for elected office.
“I stood up for children who were being lead poisoned in their homes, I worked with police chiefs and police departments on civil rights and hate crime initiatives, I enforced fair housing laws, and I helped to pass important public health and and public safety and anti-corruption laws,” Hoffmann told the crowd of over two dozen supporters.
Hoffmann’s campaign kickoff came a day after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, announced his bid for the office in a two-minute video. 
Craven, now in private practice, served as an assistant attorney general from 1983 to 1992 under three attorneys general, including a stint as chief of the office’s Public Corruption Unit.
“I’ve spent my life in front of juries as a lawmaker and state prosecutor fighting for what’s right to protect Rhode Islanders,” Craven said in his announcement video. “Now I want to put that experience to work for you as Rhode Island’s next attorney general.”
Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat who served as a special assistant attorney general from 2006 to 2010, is also said to be weighing a run for AG. He told Rhode Island Current Monday he has “a campaign event” scheduled in Warren on Monday, Oct. 6.
Knight said he was also aware of his potential opponents’ announcements.
“We’ll have something to say on that point next week,” he said in an interview with Rhode Island Current Monday afternoon.
Article IV of the Rhode Island Constitution limits all five state general office holders to two four-year terms. Neronha was first elected in 2018 with the support of 79.8% of voters; he was reelected in 2022 with 61.5% of the vote.
Hoffmann may be entering the race with the attorney general’s support, but his opponents already have established campaign accounts. 
Craven reported a balance of $320,617 and expects to have more than $360,000 on hand when the next filings are due Oct. 30. Knight had $90,419 as of Sept. 30. 
Hoffmann does not yet have a balance listed with the Board of Elections, but told Rhode Island Current his campaign will likely make an announcement within the next week.
In introducing himself at his 20-minute campaign event, Hoffmann said he was born at Newport Hospital in the same birthing center Brown University Health nearly closed this year “because of budget cuts.” He said he grew up in Portsmouth and now resides in Providence
His mother Robin Hoffmann was a professor of criminal justice and criminology at Salve Regina University for more than 30 years. His late father, Bill, a Vietnam War veteran and doctor, who died of cancer linked to Agent Orange exposure when Hoffman was 13.
“I learned from my parents not only the importance of perseverance and the value of public service, but the strength of our community when it comes together,” he said.
Hoffmann said being a public servant has always been his goal since attending college at the University of Pennsylvania and Fordham University Law School in New York.
“That’s all I wanted to do,” he said. “This is my home, and I want to fight for it, and I want to stand up for you.”
‘Point person’
Craven in his kickoff video has vowed to take on the Trump administration and protect Rhode Islanders during what he described as “unprecedented times.”
“As the Trump administration escalates its attacks on Rhode Island — gutting health care, slashing school funding, ending clean energy programs, killing jobs, seizing people on our streets, defying the law — we need an attorney general who is tested, with the guts to fight and the experience to win,” Craven said in a statement on his campaign website.
But Neronha believes his most recent right-hand man is best suited for the task. He described Hoffman as his “point person” on everything he thought was important.
“He’s been there when we’ve made decisions — sometimes hard decisions — to take on the powerful interests that hurt Rhode Islanders, including Donald Trump,” Neronha said.
As Hoffman tells it, he and Neronha were strategizing on how to tackle a second Trump term as early as last summer.
“The impact could be devastating for Rhode Islanders — to our budgets, to our green energy projects, to our rights  and our public institutions — and we would have to be prepared to fight,” he said.
And not long after Trump took office, the federal government announced its first funding freeze and Hoffman said he was up late to draft the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island in Providence
“Within about a day, we had an injunction from the court preventing that illegal, unconstitutional policy from taking effect,” Hoffmann said.

(Photo courtesy of Des Moines Public Schools)Des Moines Public Schools superintendent Ian Roberts has resigned from his position effective immediately, lawyers representing him said Tuesday.
Roberts, who was detained by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement Friday, had been placed on unpaid administrative leave by the Des Moines School Board Monday after the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked his license. ICE agents had arrested the superintendent, who was born in Guyana, during a “targeted enforcement operation” Friday, and he allegedly evaded arrest. According to an ICE news release, Roberts’ vehicle contained a handgun, hunting knife and $3,000 in cash.
ICE stated Roberts had been given a “final order of removal by an immigration judge” in May 2024. The federal agency stated Roberts was in the country unlawfully, having first come to the U.S. in 1999 on a student visa.

Attorney Alfredo Parrish, representing Roberts, confirmed that Roberts was a citizen of Guyana and served in the country’s military, but said his office was trying to work on getting more information on the immigration case proceedings that led to his arrest by ICE. In April 2025, a Texas immigration judge had decided not to reopen Roberts’ case in absentia.
Parrish said Roberts had received a letter from the prior attorney for his immigration case in Texas which said “his case had been closed successfully, and he was under the impression that it had been.” Parrish said his firm is in the process of filing a motion to reopen Roberts’ immigration case.
The attorney said it was a “complex case.”
“There are several jurisdictions that are involved, there are several law enforcement entities that are involved,” Parrish said. “… There (are) so many entities involved that we have touched bases with to try to work through this, through the consulate in New York for Guyana, through all the many other entities we’ve been trying to work through this case with. We want you to know that Dr. Roberts’ greatest concern is about his students who he actually loves, and the students who love him back, and his staff.”
While Roberts is resigning from the superintendent position, Parrish said his law firm has filed a request for stay on behalf of Roberts in the Omaha, Nebraska, federal immigration court. Roberts is currently being held at the Woodbury County Jail in Sioux City. Parrish said two of his staff drove to Omaha to file the motion Monday, and that earlier Tuesday, the law firm was in communication with Roberts.
“He understands that he has the support (of the community), and it really gives him inspiration,” Parrish said. “His spirits are high. He was very well-engaged in all our discussions this morning, for about the last two hours.”
District’s hiring procedures questioned
Some of the questions surrounding the case are focused on the Des Moines school district’s vetting process for hiring Roberts. DMPS officials have said Roberts completed the I-9 employment eligibility verification form and submitted the required documentation showing his employment eligibility when hired.
The National School Board Coalition, a conservative K-12 advocacy organization, claimed in a news release the consultant Baker-Eubanks, one of the entities hired by DMPS to perform third-party background checks during Roberts’ hiring process, “admitted that it did not perform a basic I-9 verification.”
This claim is referring to a statement made by Baker-Eubanks CEO Kim Cockerham to the Des Moines Register. Cockerham said the criminal background check performed does not confirm a person’s ability to legally work in the U.S., saying “that’s not even a service that we offer.” Cockerham said, according to the Register.
Laura Zorc, chair of the National School Board Coalition, said Roberts’ hiring process “reveals a critical oversight” in schools boards hiring search firms to fill school administration positions.
“If advising the Des Moines school board, NSBC would recommend working with their board attorney to review their contract agreement with consultants JQ Consultants and Baker-Eubanks for potential recourse, including seeking a full refund, legal, staff time, and covering the costs of rehiring a new superintendent if the contract was breached,” Zorc said in the release.
Board President Jackie Norris said Monday that the board asked Roberts’ attorney to provide documentation and verification of his citizenship status by 12 p.m. Tuesday, with plans to meet at 7:30 p.m. that day to discuss ending Roberts’ employment contract. Parrish said the letter of resignation was being sent to school officials Tuesday.
U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn said late Monday the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed with the U.S. Department of Justice through a Freedom of Information Act and formal inquiry that Roberts was subject to a final removal order under the Immigration and Nationality Act. He also said in a statement it was “unacceptable that someone under a final order of deportation and without legal work authorization was allowed to lead Iowa’s largest public school system.”
“Every parent should be able to trust that school leaders are fully vetted, legally employed, and held to the highest standards of accountability,” Nunn said. “I want to thank our federal agencies for their timely response and commitment to transparency as we work to protect our communities.”

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)A new report is sounding the alarm over the presence of harmful chemicals and heavy metals in Southeast Louisiana’s drinking water. 
The Southeast Louisiana Residential Water Quality Study, conducted by the Water Collaborative of Greater New Orleans, tested for contaminants in home tap water from seven parishes. Nearly every home among the 105 total tested in St. James, St. John the Baptist, St. Charles, Jefferson, Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes had at least trace amounts per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS for short. 
The consumption of PFAS – also known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally degrade – has been linked to high cholesterol, liver damage, increased risk of thyroid disease and reduced vaccine response in children. 
PFAS have widespread uses in consumer and industrial products, including nonstick cookware, cleaning products, carpets, waterproof clothing and firefighting foam. As contaminants, they have been found in air, water, soil and fish. 
The study was conducted to inform residents about the long-term health risk of low-level exposures to lead, arsenic and PFAS “even when most detections fall below enforceable limits,” according to the study. 
Out of 105 homes tested in the study, 101 had at least one detectable PFAS. The study did not report any differences between parishes that get their drinking water from aquifers – St. James and St. John – and those that draw their supply from the Mississippi River.
The study also tested for other contaminants, including excessive heavy metals and salt levels. 
Varying amounts of arsenic were found in 70% of samples, and lead was present in 67%. Salt levels exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency’s recommended thresholds for drinking water quality in 100% of the samples taken during low water levels for the Mississippi River.  
Taya Fournette, who led the study as policy coordinator for the Water Collaborative, said that while the testing provides just a snapshot of what people can be exposed to in drinking water, “these small amounts of exposures can add up, which is why ongoing monitoring and mitigation is important.” 
The amounts of PFAS and heavy metals detected were below levels federal health officials deem harmful, but there is consensus among physicians that no amount is safe. 
PFAS concentrations measured in the study ranged from trace amounts to one instance in Plaquemines Parish where the sample measured 43% above the pending federal limit. 
Regulations limiting the amount of PFAS allowed in drinking water, first introduced during the Biden administration in May 2024, were partially rolled back under the Trump administration this past May. The effective date for the new limits was also pushed forward from 2029 to 2031, with some PFAS maximums removed entirely.
“Something that makes PFAS unusual, compared to the vast majority of chemicals that we toxicologists study, is that PFAS dissolve in water. Now PFAS also contaminate the drinking water of millions of Americans,” said Jennifer Schlezinger, an environmental health professor and toxicologist at Boston University School of Public Health who assisted in the study.
Researchers tested for 18 different PFAS compounds, seven of which were detected at least once across the study. Perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid were, by far, the most frequently encountered, appearing in 97.2% and 72.9% of tap water tested, respectively.
Homes were chosen for testing to reflect the makeup of Louisiana’s population, Fournette said. The results revealed “sharp disparities” in terms of who was exposed to contaminants. While white households had more frequent detections, Black and lower-income households recorded the highest concentrations when it came to heavy metals. 
This same trend in heavy metal exposure appeared across income and educational differences. 
Study subjects with a high school education or less, as well as those earning under $25,000 a year, recorded the highest peaks in heavy metal exposure, while more educated, higher-income groups recorded generally lower levels of exposure. 
PFAS appeared to contaminate more uniformly across race, education and income, with widespread detection in smaller amounts. 
“That variation shows how different the challenges can be depending on where you live, how your water is treated and how your water is delivered to you, either through public or private plumbing,” Fournette said. “Our results show that stronger safeguards are needed to protect Louisiana residents.” 
“Clearly there is a need to regulate PFAS. We know that they’re found in drinking water, and we know that they are dangerous to human health,” Schlezinger said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_0861-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 17:57:54.163610

Jones during the panel's Sept. 30, 2025, meeting in Providence. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Ethics Commission on Tuesday approved two proposed rule changes regarding gifts given to public officials: one which is likely to please some state lawmakers, and the other to satisfy the wishes of government watchdogs.
The first rule change increases the gift cap for public officials, who will soon be able to receive $50 single gifts, or $150 worth of gifts in aggregate in one year, from the same person. The previous limits were $25 and $75, respectively.
The proposal to increase the gift cap had virtually no public support and was related to failed legislation in the Rhode Island Senate earlier this year that would have increased the individual gift limit to $50. The dead bill was sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone III, a Providence Democrat, and nine other senators.
The second measure widens the state’s ethics code’s definition of an “interested person” to include all lobbyists, including ones working on behalf of nonprofits. A loose stitch in ethics regulations allowed for a hypothetically limitless amount of gifts from nonprofit lobbyists, who were technically absent in the code’s definition of an “interested person.” 
The Ethics Commission affirmed both rule changes, each consisting of several line-by-line refinements to existing ethics code, via unanimous roll call votes. Commissioner Matthew D. Strauss was not present at Tuesday’s meeting.
The newly modified rules are scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, as the panel agreed to adopt a single effective date for all the changes to take effect. Ethics Commission Executive Director Jason Gramitt said his office will need time to compile the documents and revise the regulations.
No time like the present to change lobbyist gift rules, open government advocates tell ethics panel

“I’m not going to file immediately after today’s meeting,” Gramitt told the commission. “There’s some drafting I need to do, I need to make sure I’ve got certain forms filled out properly. I have some narratives I’m going to have to write and upload.”
Gramitt said his office will also have to tweak the state’s annual disclosure forms, which had removed a once-included section asking officials whether they received over $100 in gifts. Since the previous limit was $75, that section was removed, but now it will need to return, Gramitt said. The question will make its return to 2027 disclosure filings in 2027, which will cover 2026.
Tuesday’s decision concludes a nine-month decisionmaking process which began at the behest of Common Cause Rhode Island in December. The open government advocacy group pushed for the “interested person” regulations to include all lobbyists.
“It’s disappointing they chose to raise the gift limits, even though they didn’t receive any testimony asking them to raise the gift limits,” John Marion, the executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, said after the commission’s vote.
Commissioner Scott Rabideau spoke in favor of the bigger gift limit from a municipal perspective, and he noted the $25 “applies to all municipal employees, to all of the people who serve on these little boards.”
“The guy who delivers oil, who knows the members of the town council, but he also delivers all over the school — you know, those things happen in small towns,” Rabideau said. “I think that going to $50 is not going to hurt.”
Commissioner Frank Cenerini, a retired Rhode Island District Court judge, has previously voiced his support for raising the gift limit and did so again Tuesday, arguing from the premise that “people who enter public service do so for good reasons.” He said the increased gift limit was simply a means of adjusting for inflation.
Marion was more pleased with the commission’s adoption of the new rule language his group suggested, and called it “an important loophole that needed to be closed by the commission.”
The rule is one which will affect Marion, too, since he is a registered lobbyist for his nonprofit good government group. Grammit told the commission that the state’s approximately 650 registered lobbyists will eventually be sent an email informing them of the rule change. 
“John Marion, for instance, will receive an email,” Grammit said, motioning with his thumb backward to Marion, who was sitting in the audience.
“You can just hand deliver to him when he’s here,” added Commission Chair Lauren E. Jones.
The rule change bundles in a carveout for “food or beverage for immediate consumption at a reception or fundraiser to which all members of the General Assembly or statewide officers are invited and is hosted not more than once in any year by a not for profit entity that is not an interested person.”
Another exception allows gift giving to public officials or employees from interested parties if the official “is not a member or employee of the state or municipal agency that the interested person is lobbying.”
This is the first time the ethics commission has “voted to strengthen the state’s ethics laws” since 2012, according to a Common Cause news release.
Jones noted this was the first time he completed a rulemaking procedure since joining the commission four years ago. 
The remainder of the work now falls on Gramitt’s shoulders. Before the vote, the executive director had laughed while explaining to commissioners what comes next.
“Quite a lot of paperwork,” Gramitt said.

Jason Knight from rejoining the state supreme court's pools of attorneys for indigent clients during an ethics meeting on Tuesday, Sept. 30, 2025. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Ethics Commission on Tuesday approved a petition from Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat and criminal defense attorney, to apply to rejoin the state judiciary’s roster of court-appointed lawyers available to represent indigent defendants. 
Commissioners voted 6–2 to adopt a staff recommendation concluding that the state Code of Ethics does not disallow Knight from returning to the Rhode Island Supreme Court’s attorney list. Normally, as an elected official, Knight would be barred while in office and for one year after leaving his elected position. 
Knight was on the list in 2016 when he was first elected to the state’s House of Representatives, which is not in violation of the Code of Ethics. Knight voluntarily asked to be removed from the list in 2019, citing low pay.
State general revenue covers the cost of providing legal services for indigent defendants by private attorneys who take on clients when the public defender cannot. The judiciary considers list appointees “not state employees but…independent contractors,” according to the ethics office, which interviewed the judiciary’s finance director.
This spring, the Rhode Island Supreme Court increased pay from $90 to roughly $112 per hour for most cases, and from $100 to $142 per hour for murder cases — a bump in pay motivating Knight’s bid to rejoin.
The Ethics Commission’s executive office crafted a new opinion of Knight’s case after an Aug. 19 meeting sent the office’s staff back to the drawing board. Staff had originally concluded that, per the state Code of Ethics, Knight could not rejoin the court-appointee list because of the “revolving door” rule, which blocks a sitting legislator from returning to a panel if they previously stepped off it.

Now the new opinion says Knight can pursue re-certification for the court-appointed defense lawyer roster.
“The Executive Order creating the court-appointed panels states that the goal is to create ‘as large a list of qualified and willing attorneys as is feasible,” the new opinion reads. “Finally, the court-appointed attorneys are not supervised or directed in their work by any state employee or official but owe their fiduciary duty and loyalty only to the indigent client being represented.”
Vice Chair Holly Susi said Knight’s desired return to the court list serves a “higher purpose” and that the lawmaker is “willing to do work that so many others are not.”

Tuesday’s decision follows the commission’s earlier debate over whether Knight’s case fell under the “revolving door” rule that blocks a sitting legislator from returning to a panel if they previously stepped off it.
“I don’t accept that he’s either an employee or a true independent contractor of the state of Rhode Island,” said Commission Chair Lauren E. Jones. “He’s only being paid to perform the service that he’s providing.”
Commissioner Frank Cenerini cited part of the new opinion which noted a U.S. Supreme Court decision, Polk County v. Dodson, that determined state-appointed counsel, even if paid by the state, are “free of state control.”
“If they’re free of any state control, then I don’t see how even the historical fact that he was on or off makes any difference,” Cenerini said. “And if I were to choose between the United States Supreme Court and the interpretation going around in the Mayberry court, I’m going with the Supreme Court.”
Commissioner Scott Rabideau, one of the two nay votes, disagreed. The biologist and wetland scientist said that, in his profession, people who give up their grandfathered perks don’t usually get them back.
“I look at it again in my profession: If you were grandfathered and you gave it up, shame on you, because you’re not going to get grandfathered again,” Rabideau said.
“Unfortunately for your analysis, the United States Supreme Court doesn’t agree with it,” Cenerini retorted.
Hugo L. Ricci, Jr., who also voted no, argued that Knight’s maneuver to reenter the attorney pool exemplified a revolving door case. 
“The fact that he did come off and come back on, he’s now fallen under the purview of the statue,” Ricci said. “And to deconstruct that statute is something I’m not comfortable with.”
John Marion, the executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, said in an interview after the commission made its decision that the public body had contorted itself into a certain result.
“Oftentimes the commission seems uneasy with where the law leads them, but they accept it,” Marion said. “This is a rare instance where they were uneasy with where the law led them, and they chose to read the law in a way that got them their preferred outcome.”
Knight did not attend Tuesday’s meeting and did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Two public school teachers are suing the New Jersey Education Association, alleging the teachers’ union violated the law when it funneled $40 million to former union president Sean Spiller’s gubernatorial campaign this spring.
The suit, filed Tuesday in state Superior Court by Roselle teacher Marie Dupont and Hamilton teacher Ann Marie Pocklembo, alleges the union improperly used dues it said would not fund its political committees to fuel the independent expenditure groups that backed Spiller’s failed bid for the Democratic nod for governor.
“We are here today because the Fairness Center’s clients, two New Jersey public school teachers and a New Jersey policy nonprofit, believe the New Jersey Education Association should play by the rules and follow the law when it comes to its political spending,” Nathan McGrath, president of the Fairness Center, a nonprofit law firm that opposes public-sector unions, told reporters Tuesday.
New poll finds dead heat in NJ governor’s race

The plaintiffs allege the union breached its contract by sending union funds to Garden State Forward, the union’s super PAC, which then sent the funds to Working New Jersey, the independent expenditure group that put $40 million behind Spiller’s Democratic primary bid. The only reported donations on Working New Jersey’s campaign filings came from the union super PAC.
Spiller finished in fifth place out of six candidates, nabbing 11% of the vote. His term as the union’s president ended after June’s primary.
The plaintiffs also charge the union misrepresented how it would use member dues and, by doing so, breached its fiduciary duty to its members.
“When I signed my union membership card, I did not check the back saying I wanted to contribute to the union political action committee,” DuPont said during Tuesday’s press conference. “That was a contract stating my dues wouldn’t go to the union political apparatus, but a handful of insiders ignored that choice and broke that trust.”
The union’s membership cards include sections for voluntary contributions to the NJEA Political Action Fund and the National Education Association Fund for Children and Public Education. They do not mention Garden State Forward.
A spokesperson for the union did not return calls and a text message seeking comment.
Spiller’s campaign for governor was unusual. Despite a statewide profile, he was the only Democratic gubernatorial hopeful to fail to qualify for the state’s public fund matching program.
His fundraising and campaign infrastructure were both limited, but Working New Jersey ensured ads, mailers, and other campaign materials boosting his candidacy blanketed airwaves and inundated mailboxes starting in the fall of 2024.
The suit alleges the union improperly reported its contributions to Garden State Forward on annual IRS filings, marking them as cash grants rather than political or lobbying contributions. The union reported giving Garden State Forward $8.5 million in grants in 2023 on its most recent IRS filing.
And they argue Spiller controlled Protecting Our Democracy, a separate issues advocacy nonprofit that ran ads boosting and featuring Spiller before he launched his campaign. The group faces limited disclosure requirements as a 501(c)4 nonprofit.
Filings show Garden State Forward gave Protecting Our Democracy $5 million between April 2022 and January 2024, though it remains unclear how much of that money the group spent boosting Spiller. Quarterly reports filed by the candidate show Protecting Our Democracy gave his campaign $5,800 last September.
Spiller, a former Montclair mayor, was the Protecting Our Democracy chair before the organization dissolved in March.
“Union officials must put employees’ interests ahead of their own and cannot use their position for self-dealing or personal gain, but the union put its own president’s interests ahead of 200,00 teachers across the state by bankrolling his political interests with members’ money,” McGrath said.
Separate complaints filed with the IRS and the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission by the New Jersey Policy Institute, which is backing the teachers’ suit, allege other violations of law.
The group asked the state election law commission to investigate whether the teachers’ union violated state campaign finance law by giving Spiller maxed-out contributions through its PAC and Protecting Our Democracy.
The New Jersey Policy Institute’s complaint to the IRS requested the agency launch an investigation into whether it violated federal law by disclosing its contributions to Garden State Forward outside the section of the 990 form devoted to political giving.
“Every taxpayer deserves transparency about the role powerful special interests play in our elections, and every candidate, no matter how well connected, must be bound by the same laws as everyone else,” said Rosemary Becchi, the institute’s president and a former Republican congressional candidate.

Lawmakers will address cuts to federal food assistance at the upcoming Oct. 1 special session. (Source NM file photo)Ensuring New Mexicans don’t go hungry will be at the top of lawmakers’ agenda when they convene for the Oct. 1 special session to address impacts from federal legislation, in addition to public health care, health insurance rates and vaccine policy. 
State officials said recent federal changes to the federal food assistance program approved in the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” such as work requirements and program cuts, may worsen hunger for New Mexicans, and require the state to pay significantly more for the program to continue.
Here’s a closer look at the potential impacts from cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Access Program (SNAP).
What is SNAP and how many New Mexicans use it?
SNAP is a federal program that sends monthly benefits to low-income households to purchase food.
As of August 2025, 459,535 New Mexicans use SNAP — about 21% of the state’s population, which is the highest rate in the country.
According to the Legislative Finance Committee, one in seven New Mexicans and nearly one in four children lived in households without consistent access to adequate food.
New Mexico consistently ranks toward the bottom of the nation’s food security ranking and was 4th worst this past year.

How will changes to the federal law impact New Mexicans’ SNAP program?
Previously, the federal government paid for 100% of the SNAP program and funded half of the state’s administration for giving out the benefits.
The budget bill reduces how much federal funding states will receive, requiring states to pick up 75% of administration costs for a federal match of 25%.
Under the new law, New Mexico will need to contribute an estimated $203 million annually to keep the program running, according to the state Health Care Authority.
Then, between two and four years from now, the state may have to pay up to 15% of the actual program, depending on its error rate for administering the program.
In addition, as of Oct. 1, the federal government will reduce maximum SNAP benefits for households, and narrow SNAP eligibility for non-citizens here legally, which will affect an estimated 16,220 New Mexicans, according to the Health Care Authority.
 
How do SNAP cuts affect New Mexico’s food security?
New Mexico’s grocery stores, farmers’ markets and convenience stores rely on customers’ SNAP funds, putting nearly $1.2B in SNAP revenue at stake, according to the HCA.



	
Food bank officials said earlier this year that they will not have enough food to replace what SNAP delivers for families.
“There’s no way we can just suddenly multiply everything we do times nine to make that happen. We couldn’t do that in 10 years,” Jason Riggs, director of advocacy and public policy at the Roadrunner Food Bank, said in August. “No business can grow nine times. So any thoughts that, ‘Well, charity will take care of this,’ are very misguided.”
 
When do the cuts go into effect?
Starting in January of 2026, the upper age requirement for exemption from SNAP’s work requirements will be raised to 64.
New Mexico will have to pay additional money to administer the program starting in October 2027.
The state match program could be implemented in October 2027 or as late as 2030, depending on the state’s error rate — which occurs from either administering too much or too little in SNAP benefits.
New Mexico’s error rate is currently about 14.6%. Higher error rates result in higher cost shares, but New Mexico and other states with high error rates are allowed more time to bring them down.
 
What do New Mexico lawmakers intend to do?
In presentations to lawmakers, legislative analysts said the state would need to pay $18.9 million every year for what the federal government pays now in administration. In order to pay for newly ineligible SNAP recipients, the Health Care Authority said it would cost $109 million in fiscal year 2027.
Lawmakers in committee meetings leading up to the special session also floated allocating funding for food banks and farms, which also received cuts via the “Big Beautiful Bill.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Dueling press releases and news conferences from Minnesota Democrats and Republicans Tuesday can only mean one thing: Negotiations for a special legislative session on gun violence and school safety have reached an impasse and are unlikely to be resolved. 
Gov. Tim Walz and legislative leaders have been meeting for weeks behind closed doors, negotiating the terms of a special legislative session after the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in August. 
Walz and Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislative leaders released a proposal for a special session that includes a ban on so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. They’re also pushing for a special legislative session on Monday. The proposal also included expanded “school safety funding” and increased “funding for mental health treatment,” which are Republican priorities. None of the proposed bills included details. 
Republicans are not on board, however, and because the two parties share power in the Legislature, bipartisan agreement is necessary. The House is tied 67-67 between Republicans and Democrats. The Senate is currently short two members until a Nov. 4 special election, after which Democrats are expected to maintain their slim majority, but until then, they are a vote shy of the necessary 34 to pass any bills. 
Democrats say Republicans are unwilling to even consider any new restrictions on guns. Which wouldn’t be surprising: Republican voters are against new gun regulations, recent polling shows. 
In a statement Tuesday, Walz said the DFL proposal “meets the expectations that Minnesotans have for their elected leaders — that we respond to threats to public safety and take direct action on guns.”
 “Our offer addresses mental health, school safety, support for law enforcement and most importantly, common sense gun laws,” Walz said.
Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, said that negotiations between Walz and leaders broke down Tuesday morning after Democrats “indicated they would no longer work with Republicans to find agreement for a special session.” 
“If Gov. Walz wants a special session, which only he can do, Senate Republicans will be there to do the important work to keep our kids and communities safe. Minnesotans deserve better than slogans and press conferences, they need solutions,” Johnson said in a statement.
House Republicans in their latest offer outlined that during a special session, lawmakers would would take up bills related to school safety, mental health funding and “improving public safety.” In recent years, House Republicans have sought to increase criminal penalties, especially on violent crime. 
The House GOP offer doesn’t mention guns, and it states that lawmakers can also propose other legislation.
Republicans, who are aligned with the gun rights movement, have said that school safety is a priority but have been reluctant to discuss guns at all, whereas Walz and Democrats have been firm that considering gun control measures would be a requirement of any special session agreement.
Walz, who first floated a special session weeks ago, has the sole ability to call lawmakers into session, but only lawmakers can gavel themselves out, which is typically why the governor and lawmakers come to an agreement beforehand, including what bills will be passed, as well the duration of the session.

Blaise Ingoglia talks about property taxes in Jacksonville on May 9, 2025. (Screenshot via governor's X livestream)Assailing whom he deemed as “big government apologists,” Florida Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Blaise Ingoglia brought his statewide tour spotlighting what he alleges is excessive local spending to Broward County on Tuesday.
Speaking from Pembroke Pines, the CFO said his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team of auditors had scrubbed spending by the (Democratic-controlled) Broward County Commission from the fiscal years of 2019-20 to 2024-25 and determined that they have expended more than $189 million in wasteful, excessive spending.
He added that Broward County’s budget had increased by $617 million in that time, a 48% increase.
As has been the case in his similar visits to Hillsborough, Alachua, and Orange counties as well as the city of Jacksonville, Ingoglia offered no specific instances of alleged wasteful spending. That information, he said, will be included in follow-up DOGE reports due in the coming weeks. But he added that it wasn’t really his responsibility to detail examples.
“The government expansion itself is waste, fraud, and abuse,” he said. “The government expanding is the excessive spending itself.”
Neither is it his job to go in and cut a local government’s budget, he continued. That’s the job of city managers and county administrators who he made sure to note get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to do so (in the case of Broward County Administrator Monica Cepero, it’s $461,232, according to OpenPayrolls).
The affordability crisis in the state
The CFO’s press conferences highlighting local government’s (allegedly excessive) spending practices are part of his (and Gov. Ron DeSantis’) campaign to eliminate or substantially reduce property taxes on homesteaded properties that will likely appear as a proposed constitutional amendment on the November 2026 statewide ballot.
While it’s leading Republicans in the state like Ingoglia and DeSantis who say that the public is demanding property tax relief, Democrats like gubernatorial candidate David Jolly are criticizing what they say is an affordability crisis in the state, referencing high costs of property and auto insurance, among other issues.
The CFO on Tuesday linked the two arguments, saying a major reason why Floridians are suffering through an affordability crisis is because of the big-spending ways of local governments.
“Almost every elected official in local government starts complaining about affordable housing — to the point where they give a lot of money to nonprofits and they try to subsidize affordable housing. The easiest way to make housing more affordable is to give them property tax relief,” he said.
“Let’s stop spending money on programs that don’t work and subsidize, and let’s start giving people a reduced cost in the form of government. That is a surefire way to give property tax relief and affordability at the same time.”
‘Big government apologists’
As Ingoglia continues to make his case around the state, he’s received pushback in the form of biting newspaper editorials criticizing his efforts. It’s criticism he says he expected.
“Just like we saw in the mid-2000s, we are seeing it right now: Big government apologists are coming out of the woodwork trying to make excuses for a lot of the spending that you will see,” he said. “They’re going to be saying things like, ‘Well, if we cut, we’re going to have to cut fire and police, right?’ That is just nonsense.”
The Broward County Commission voted earlier this month to lower its millage rate for the first time since 2018, although property owners will still see their property taxes increase as property values continue to rise. Representatives for the county government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ingoglia’s appearance came a day after a poll commissioned by the James Madison Institute showed that 65% of Floridians would support a constitutional amendment

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A battle is brewing over ownership of a storied Omaha site — a downtown property that, while largely grass and dirt now, is known for six decades of high school graduations, circus acts and concerts from Elvis Presley to Kiss.
One of the more notable moments in the history of the now-demolished City Auditorium was the 1988 vice presidential debate when Lloyd Bentsen delivered his famous zinger to Dan Quayle: “Senator, you’re no Jack Kennedy.”

Today, a different controversy envelops the four city blocks cleared in 2016-17, as the city said it will try to reclaim ownership from a private developer it says has defaulted on the terms of a redevelopment agreement.
White Lotus Group, which has owned the tract for two years, disagrees. CEO Arun Agarwal told the Nebraska Examiner he is confused at the city’s pivot and that his team was “full speed ahead” on a $200 million-plus plan to create Civic Square: a campus of housing, offices, a grocery store and fitness, dining and nightlife venues. 
Road and utility installation started
Agarwal said his team has done what is contractually required. Road and utility installation started recently, following a springtime groundbreaking and initial grading work. He said crews have faced unexpected barriers, including buried arena parts that obstructed utility work, but the group is working to transform the city property it bought for about $1.4 million.
Assistant City Attorney Jennifer Taylor said Omaha officials, however, believe the developer has failed to meet certain deadlines laid out in the contract regarding the site bounded by 17th, 19th and Chicago Streets and Capitol Avenue. 
“The city is disappointed we have not seen the progress we requested, anticipated and expected,” she said. “It is the city’s opinion he is in default.”

In a first step to claw back the property, Taylor said the city sent Agarwal written notice on Sept. 8, giving 60 days to correct what city officials see as unmet terms. She said she can’t imagine it could be accomplished in the time frame.
At the crux is language in the right to repurchase provision, which says the developer will make “best efforts” to complete installation of at least 50% of the public infrastructure within 18 months of closing (the sale closed in September 2023). It said that within two years of closing, the developer shall “commence construction” of footings, foundations and/or road work for at least half the infrastructure and building structures.
Agarwal said his crews “commenced” road and installation work after the city issued an applicable permit last month. White Lotus has made “more than best efforts,” he said, asking: “What am I missing?” 
Taylor said White Lotus has “paved half a street” and said the developer has not done what was mandated. “There is a point where you have to fish or cut bait.”
Mayoral debate offered clue 
A hint of the battle over the nine-acre area surfaced earlier this year in an April mayoral debate. 
Then-Mayor Jean Stothert said White Lotus had not met certain benchmarks and announced that a different developer, which she didn’t identify, was in the wings wanting to do something “really incredible” on the property.
Opponent John Ewing Jr., in turn, criticized Stothert’s handling of the deal and lamented what he believed was the project’s sluggish pace. 
Now with Ewing at the helm, the Mayor’s Office reiterated in a statement concerns about “insufficient progress” and questioned White Lotus’ ability to complete the transformation.
Asked about the developer mentioned by Stothert, Taylor said she did not know if that was a viable option. She said what mattered was execution of the contract.

“At this point we want to see that property developed.” 
Agarwal said the city process became “murky” after the mystery developer came to light. He said his group has committed and spent “millions” and has acted in “good faith.” He said he was told the interested developer is a tax-exempt nonprofit.
“If there is a better use, anything that is going to progress the city, I’m in,” he said. “But this is not about us going slow.”
He pointed to White Lotus’ multimillion dollar mixed-use redevelopment project at Lincoln’s old Pershing Auditorium site as a similar effort and said the company’s portion there is on track to wrap up later this year.
TIF application stalled
Agarwal said White Lotus months ago submitted an application for about $35 million in tax-increment financing for Civic Square, but had not heard back from the Omaha city committee that reviews such projects.
To that, Taylor said an applicant must have control of the property and currently “control and ownership is up in the air.”

“We have a duty to the taxpayers,” she said. “Taxpayers have a right to have their assets be productive.”
By the time White Lotus acquired the property from the city in 2023, it had been cleared for seven years at a cost then of $3.1 million. Tetrad Property Group had been selected early on to redevelop the site but backed out in 2018, partly over a dispute about city incentives and without having announced a major tenant.
White Lotus stepped in, and revealed renderings and key components in May 2023.
As envisioned, Civic Square is to include up to 400 housing units. Other components anticipated include a hotel, health and wellness services, office and retail space.  A local and a national firm is working with the developer to secure commercial tenants.
At least a few hundred new surface parking spaces and an existing 454-stall city-owned parking structure are to be available onsite. 
Of the much discussed demand for a downtown grocer, Agarwal said: “We fully expect a grocery to be at the site.”
Agarwal sees access to Interstate 480, and walkability to major employers such as Union Pacific and First National Bank of Omaha, as a key benefit in attracting housing and commercial tenants.
The ‘Nest’ allure
White Lotus is counting on nearby Creighton University students to fuel activity, and has nicknamed the project the “Nest” — a nod to its mission to draw Bluejays and other talent deciding where to hatch careers.

“Every great university has a collegiate extension to it,” Agarwal said, citing the Haymarket District and University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Aggieville and Kansas State University, Wrigleyville and DePaul University.
White Lotus sees the Nest helping to stem “brain drain” while enhancing the urban core. About 80% of Creighton  undergraduates come from outside Nebraska, and the private developer wants to help build an environment where students feel so at home that they’ll plant roots.
“This generation has a choice whether to stay or leave,” said Agarwal, noting recent studies that show Omaha lagging behind peer cities in job growth. “What are we doing to foster that integration? Increasing population growth has to be topic No. 1.”’ 
Agarwal would like to replicate a Blue Jay Bar aura, for example. The longtime near-campus Creighton hangout shuttered in 2017. He envisions proposed health and fitness services to be alluring to students of the university’s popular exercise science program.
Competition in urban core
The Nest would compete with other nearby developments for business, including the mixed-use Builder’s District, whose representatives shared the stage with Creighton officials Sept 18 when they announced a $300 million donor-funded plan to reshape a 12-block corridor on the university’s east side.
Creighton leaders described then how the school’s planned upgrades to athletic and recreational facilities will link to the Builder’s District — and its developing office, housing and entertainment offerings — via a new pedestrian passageway called the Jaywalk.
$300M Creighton donor-funded plan aims to reshape part of downtown Omaha

The Rev. Daniel Hendrickson, Creighton president, said the university’s connection with the Kiewit Corp.-anchored Builder’s District was intended to strengthen its eastern border. But he said Creighton is “excited about all developments near us and around us,” including the Nest.
The revamped riverfront parks, the Old Market, Millwork Commons and other attractions are good for Creighton and growing its 8,000-plus student enrollment, Hendrickson said.
“Anything we can do to keep revitalizing and activating downtown is just the best possible outcome for Creighton,” he said.
Agarwal said he welcomes competing development in the urban core, including the Builder’s District, adding that “a rising tide lifts all boats.”
He is on the urban core development committee for the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, and sees the Nest as a part of the chamber’s 20-year strategy announced in 2022 to create 30,000 new jobs and 30,000 new residents in the downtown and midtown area.
White Lotus planned to start “going vertical” with Civic Square-Nest buildings by mid-2026, Agarwal said.
“We believe this is the best project for the city,” he said.

And the state could see additional furloughs depending on how long the shutdown lasts, leaving those workers on leave without pay until Congress comes to a budget agreement.
A news release from the state’s Human Resources office called the furloughs “a decision of last resort.”
“The decision to implement furloughs is not one that has been taken lightly, and I deeply regret the hardship it will cause,” Gov. Josh Stein said. “I am upset with this federal dysfunction, and my administration is committed to doing everything in our power to advocate for a swift resolution.”
Furloughed employees will retain health care coverage through the month of October. If the shutdown extends past October, employees “should contact their agency HR office” for information about costs and premiums, according to the state HR office.
State officials could not immediately say how the initial round of 200 furloughs breaks down by department and job title.
Congressional leaders are meeting in Washington on Tuesday ahead of a shutdown set to begin at midnight. The White House has outlined plans to furlough hundreds of thousands of federal workers, while others are set to continue work without pay.

Sept. 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThe proposed new wholesale tax on marijuana products to fund road repairs in the next state budget and years down the road is much too high and would result in job losses for a booming Michigan cannabis industry, advocates and lawmakers said Tuesday as they rallied for a lower tax rate.
At least two Democratic lawmakers who attended the rally – state Reps. Donavan McKinney of Detroit and Mike McFall of Hazel Park – also signaled that they were working behind the scenes to get that rate much lower before a final vote is taken. 
At present, both McFall and McKinney said they would vote no on the final budget if the rate remained.
Michigan lawmakers reached a loose framework to fund the government last week, but it included a new 24% wholesale tax on products sold at dispensaries across the state. That sent the cannabis industry and their allies into a frenzy as they warned that such a tax would hamstring the industry’s growth and result in fewer jobs.

On Tuesday, lawmakers were still in the throes of hammering out a final budget plan, with no clear end in sight despite signals that the government would stay open and not shut down on Wednesday when the new fiscal year begins.
Still, the money for the Legislature’s road funding plan had to come from somewhere, whether that was from schools – which advocates rallied against Tuesday – or from the new proposed tax on pot for potholes.
Those working for or on behalf of the cannabis industry gathered for a rally on the Capitol steps in Lansing to send lawmakers and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who had earlier in the year proposed a more than 30% tax, a clear message: Keep off their grass.
“Our industry is not their piggy bank. Our wallets are not their budget overruns,” said Mike DiLaura, CCO and general counsel for House of Dank, one of many cannabis companies operating in Michigan. “It is our time, not just as an industry, but as citizens of this great state, to put our feet down and say, ‘enough is enough.’”

DiLaura continued by saying that the industry has, since recreational cannabis was legalized in 2020, raised nearly $2 billion in taxes for Michigan over the last five years.
“But they say it’s not enough,” DiLaura said. “When will it ever be enough?”
Several other advocates and industry leaders spoke at the rally, all mentioning that even if they lost the battle to either stop the tax hike or reduce it, they would continue the fight in court or seek a full repeal of the law down the pike.
The rally also featured two allies in McKinney and McFall.
Both said they voted against the proposal in House Bill 4951 when it passed the House last week, noting that their communities have greatly benefited from recreational cannabis shops and associated businesses like grow operations.
“Hazel Park was all in on marijuana from the very beginning. As some of you might know, we even gave Tommy Chong the key to the city at one point,” McFall said. “But what a lot of people don’t realize is how this is going to impact local municipalities. They’re talking about cutting revenue sharing, which is the money that goes back from the state. This is also going to impact that.”

McFall said Hazel Park got half a million in tax dollars last year, and that money helped pay for emergency services and other amenities.
McKinney said that the Eight Mile corridor is filled with marijuana shops that have transformed vacant, abandoned buildings while also delivering what he called the best marijuana in the nation.
“I think Snoop Dogg said something like that,” McKinney quipped.
But in all seriousness, he said that the proposal was “BS,” and the new tax rate was too high. McKinney added that he and McFall were just two of a few legislators who were willing to stand firm against the proposal, and that there was work going on behind closed doors to lower the rate if it was absolutely necessary to fund roads.
“We don’t know what that number will be, but we for sure know it’s not going to be 24%,” McKinney said.

MONTPELIER — Vendor payment delays caused by the rollout of VTBuys, the state’s new digital procurement system, are a result of “human side” problems, not the technology itself, Vermont’s IT chief told lawmakers on Tuesday. 
Denise Reilly-Hughes, secretary of the Agency of Digital Services, told the Joint Information Technology Oversight Committee that state departments and agencies have developed their own disparate processes for dealing with vendors and invoices over decades, and not all of these offices have completely switched to VTBuys.
That includes her own digital services agency, which Reilly-Hughes said had decided it would be “better for internal operations to hold off” on completely adopting VTBuys while the agency helped other state offices do so.

VTBuys, the new e-procurement platform, is intended to modernize the way the state government works with vendors, creating a single streamlined interface for bids, contracts and payments. Previously, the state relied on manual, sometimes tedious, processes. The new platform is set to create efficiency and unity across state governments, according to state administrative leaders. 
Coding quirks delayed VTBuy’s launch in July, leading state business offices to resort to contingency workflows. 
But in late August, Reilly-Hughes and Wanda Minoli, commissioner of the Department of Buildings and General Services, which encompasses the state’s primary contracting office, told lawmakers in the IT oversight committee that the state had gotten through VTBuys rocky debut. 
Yet after that assessment, three vendors with the state told VTDigger about tens of thousands of dollars in delayed and missing payments — problems they blamed on VTBuys.
At Tuesday’s meeting, state officials addressed the complaints. If the media had identified three businesses decrying late payments out of thousands working with the state, “those are positive metrics,” Reilly-Hughes said. 
Minoli, for her part, acknowledged a limited ongoing “backlog” of invoices, and said questions about delayed payments were among the top three VTBuys topics her department hears about from businesses.
As for parts of the state government still using old workflows rather than VTBuys, the department and agency heads said it’s happening more than they’d want but did not provide specifics. 
The change to VTBuys has caused frustration for state government business offices, Minoli said. But there’s something those involved agree on, she said: “the state needed a procurement system.”

The state has earned a reputation as the furniture manufacturing capital of the world. (Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)President Donald Trump announced “substantial” tariffs on imported furniture on Monday, a move that he said would help manufacturers in North Carolina.
“In order to make North Carolina, which has completely lost its furniture business to China, and other Countries, GREAT again, I will be imposing substantial Tariffs on any Country that does not make its furniture in the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Details to follow!!!”
Trump announced last week a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities and a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture. Those will take effect Wednesday, Oct. 1.
The Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina refers to the Tar Heel state as the furniture capital of the world. There are more than 850 furniture manufacturers in the state, employing about 32,000 workers, according to its website. Major furniture manufacturers in North Carolina include Ashley Furniture, Lexington Home Brands and Ethan Allen.
According to the EDPNC, North Carolina is home to a furniture manufacturing workforce nearly four times larger than the national average, as well as more than 550 wood product manufacturing establishments and more than 650 textile and textile product mills.
The state also exports $296 million worth of furniture annually, which could be affected if countries retaliate with their own tariffs. Neighboring Mexico and Canada are some of the biggest importers of these goods.
Mike Hubbard, director of international trade at the EDPNC, said it’s uncertain for now whether other countries will retaliate.
“As we’re negotiating these trade agreements, it may be somewhat more of a moot point,” Hubbard said. “The only question outstanding would be, ‘What is the rate going to be?'”
China, Vietnam and Mexico are the biggest furniture exporters to the U.S., according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. Canada comes in fourth, and Italy, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand and India round out the top 10.
In particular, North Carolina is known for its customizable upholstered furniture, which is more affordable and quicker for U.S. consumers to purchase domestically than overseas.
“Aside from just the fact that we’re good at it, and companies have reinvested so much,” Hubbard said, “you buy a sofa and your next-door neighbor wants the exact same one, and you don’t want your house to look the same, you can get whatever upholstery you want,” Hubbard said.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said he doesn’t understand how this tariff fits into Trump’s overall policy.
Stein said he thinks the economy is best served when there’s consistency, so that businesses have an expectation of policies and how to invest around them.
“When there’s wild fluctuations in policies, a great deal of uncertainty, you’ll see the business investments freeze, and there has been a diminishment in business investment across the country,” Stein said. “I would like to get off this roller coaster and have a lot more stability.”
Swedish company Ikea, which has 52 locations in the U.S. and is known for its affordable flat-pack pieces with self-assembly, has a store in Charlotte.
The company is anticipating higher prices for customers as a result of the tariffs, Newsweek reported.
“Our goal is to offer affordable, good-quality home furnishings to everyone,” an Ikea spokesperson told Newsweek. “In our experience across the markets we operate in, tariffs make these ambitions more difficult.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NC-Furniture_Capitol-1024x544.jpg,,,2025-09-30 16:58:08.570424

Essential services would continue even as other government operations grind to a halt, and certain federal employees keep working, albeit unpaid, until it’s over.
But the prospects of a prolonged and indefinite shutdown could mean trouble for certain government programs, especially those supporting many working and low-income families who have come to rely on nutrition aid and child care services.
The uncertainty around this particular shutdown has made it harder to predict exactly how things could play out, especially as President Donald Trump said Tuesday that his administration could wield its executive power in ways he called “irreversible.”
Gov. Ned Lamont said he sees the funding impasse in Congress as only the most recent example of Washington becoming an unreliable partner to the states. That’s on top of the administration’s other changes and reversals that have directly affected Connecticut, including the attempt to halt work on Revolution Wind.
“We’re really worried about the shutdown — not in the near term. We can mitigate things in the near term. We’ve got reserves. Nothing’s going to happen tonight or tomorrow,” Lamont told reporters in Hartford on Tuesday hours before the funding deadline and end of the federal fiscal year. “But if this goes on for a couple of months, there could be some people that are really hit.”
States like Connecticut have inevitably felt the strain when Congress failed to meet its funding deadline in past years. But the stakes are even higher with a shutdown that could begin early Wednesday with no immediate indications of how long it could last or how it’ll get resolved.
Consequences for Connecticut
In remarks opening the second annual “Insuring the Future” conference on Tuesday in downtown Hartford, Lamont said Connecticut needs the support of the federal government. He said he supports the push by congressional Democrats regarding their health care demands but doesn’t see a shutdown as tenable either.
“Make a deal. This is bully-boy brinksmanship,” Lamont said, “Look, I’m with the Democrats. You don’t want everybody’s health insurance to spike up and all of a sudden you can’t afford to provide health care for your kid. And you also can’t have a shutdown. There’s got to be a compromise you guys can make.”
In a shutdown, essential functions and services continue, including the intelligence community and other national security agencies. The most immediate consequences are furloughs of federal employees who work for various government agencies.
Some workers, however, are exempt, such as the active duty military, some federal civilian employees and most air traffic controllers. But they won’t get paid during a shutdown and will receive back pay only after government operations resume.
Connecticut has about 7,300 people in its federal civilian workforce, according to a recent report from the Congressional Research Service. It used data from September 2024, months before the Trump administration started slashing federal jobs.
“There’s no question we need to be mindful of the pain that will be caused,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said. “Federal workers are going without paychecks. It’s an outcome that we’d like to avoid.”
The longer a shutdown lasts, the more it could interrupt other key services. Connecticut’s senators warned of risks to veterans’ affairs facilities, as well as Head Start child care centers, that might not be deemed essential, as they had not been in the past. During the 2013 shutdown, Connecticut was one of half a dozen states that saw closures of Head Start centers, including one in Bridgeport.
But given an already-diminished federal workforce, a shutdown this time around brings new risks, including the slowdown of important grants to some programs and services..
Nutrition assistance is also one of those areas that could see disruptions more quickly. That includes federal programs like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children — better known as WIC — and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP benefits.
WIC appears to be particularly under threat in a shutdown. An administration official told the publication RealClearPolitics  that the program’s funding will dry up in October, which will likely affect new enrollment and benefits for current recipients. 
But DeLauro said there’s a $150 million in a WIC contingency fund that would keep things running but would be unlikely to last throughout a protracted shutdown. She also noted there are ways to “repurpose” funds and redirect to some of these programs running low, though SNAP appears to have a longer runway.
“My hope is that … the contingency fund can help us through. In other areas, there are programs that can go through SNAP and others that can go through November. We will hopefully see that Republicans will come to the table and deal with a negotiation to move forward,” DeLauro said on a Tuesday press call. “States are going to have to take a look at what a Plan B might be. But there’s $150 million in a WIC contingency fund.”
There are nearly 7 million pregnant and postpartum individuals, infants and young kids who rely on WIC, which also includes about 40% of infants born in the country, according to the Food Research & Action Center.
Lamont said funding would continue for major entitlement programs like Medicaid. But he echoed that federal money for WIC, the supplemental nutrition program for about 50,000 people in Connecticut, would disappear quickly.
“I think we have reserves in place that can keep us going for the near term, but just the very near term,” Lamont said.
Ongoing debates
The likelihood of a shutdown — the first in more than six years — comes at a time when there’s an ongoing debate over expiring health care subsidies, further reductions in the federal workforce and economic strains like tariffs.
The “deferred resignation program,” which was offered to federal employees months ago to voluntarily resign from their roles, will go into effect starting Oct. 1, just as a shutdown begins. Government agencies will now feel the full weight of a hollowed-out workforce, leading to some uncertainty over future operations.
On top of that, Trump and the Office of Management and Budget instructed agencies to move forward with reduction-in-force plans for nonessential employees. This could lead to permanent firings instead of just furloughs during a shutdown, but critics push back that this effort wouldn’t hold up in court.
The funding standoff also comes when Congress has ceded much of its constitutional authority of the “power of the purse” to the executive branch. 
Connecticut’s lawmakers and the rest of the Democratic Party are holding firm to their health care demands. But so are Republicans, who are pushing Democrats to accept the short-term bill in front of them. That passed the House with GOP support but stalled in the Senate without the votes from Democrats needed to pass the 60-vote threshold.
The parties couldn’t agree to a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, that would keep government agencies running at current levels for a specific amount of time. A short-term deal buys them more time to negotiate a full-year spending package for fiscal year 2026.
Republicans and Democrats had different versions. The GOP pushed for legislation to keep things running through Nov. 21. Democrats countered with a version that would fund the government until Oct. 31 but would also include some health care provisions and prevent Trump from rescinding funding Congress already approved. Both included additional funding for lawmaker security.
It would be the first shutdown since one that started in late December 2018 and lasted into January 2019, during Trump’s first term.
As the government inched closer to a shutdown on Tuesday, Democrats tried a last-minute procedural maneuver that Republicans shut down.
A group of House Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, wanted to force a vote on their funding bill during the pro forma session. But the limited opportunity quickly flamed out, with Tuesday’s session wrapping up in a matter of minutes.
DeLauro, who is the top Democrat of the House Appropriations Committee, which helps craft spending bills, sought to be recognized so she could offer a motion for unanimous consent, but the GOP lawmaker presiding over the floor quickly adjourned the House until the next pro forma session on Friday. Democrats yelled in objection as the chair banged the gavel.
The House was initially supposed to be in Washington the first two days of the week, but GOP leaders cancelled votes for Monday and Tuesday and will not be back in full session until next week — days after the funding deadline passed.
Politics of a shutdown
A last-minute meeting at the White House on Monday ended when neither side would back off their approach. It was the first time leaders in both parties plus the president were all in a room to negotiate before the Wednesday deadline.
Democratic leaders said big differences remain. Vice President JD Vance declared that the country is heading toward a shutdown and blamed Democrats.
But the fruitless meeting drove home a larger point: how will Congress get out of a shutdown if neither side will budge?
Meanwhile, the finger-pointing has intensified in recent days over who would get the blame. 
“Until they’re serious about a negotiation, it’s pretty clear what their desire is. We’re in this position today because Republicans boycotted negotiations,” U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Monday shortly after congressional leaders went to the White House to talk about the funding impasse. “But they’ve got to start getting serious about what’s about to happen to our health care system, what’s happening to our democracy.”
Frustrated by Democrats’ demands, Trump threatened cuts to programs that the Democrats support.
“We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump told reporters Tuesday from the Oval Office. “And you know all you all know [OMB Director] Russell Vought. He’s become very popular recently, because he can trim the budget to a level that you couldn’t do any other way. So they’re taking a risk by having a shutdown.”
Back in Connecticut, most Republican state representatives wrote a letter to Senate leaders in both parties, urging them to approve the House-passed version of a short-term bill. They argued a shutdown would cause needless hardship for Connecticut residents and families.
“Allowing a shutdown would needlessly disrupt our local, state and national economies, threaten public safety, and undermine public confidence in our institutions,” they wrote in the letter sent to the Senate last week. “Connecticut families and communities would feel the pain with immediate effect and confusion. Put simply, a government shutdown should not be used as political leverage to pass partisan reforms — our constituents are not chips Congress should be bargaining with.”
Other looming crises
While a shutdown is at the forefront of conversations in Washington, Congress will still need to eventually deal with expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies and whether it’s part of any funding negotiations. Those enhanced premium subsidies will expire at the end of the year, and if they’re not extended in some way, premiums will spike in 2026.
Republicans have resisted including the expiring subsidies in a funding bill and believe they can be addressed later in separate legislation. Democrats argue there’s an urgency to get it done now, particularly with open enrollment in the state-based exchanges beginning on Nov. 1.
If the subsidies expire at the end of the year, states would have to pick up the costs. For Connecticut, officials could spend more than $295 million a year, according to a spokesperson with Access Health CT.
Nationally, if the subsidies expire at the end of the year, the Congressional Budget Office projects that more than 4 million people would lose health care coverage over the next decade, citing increases in out-of-pocket expenses because of more costly premiums. Connecticut residents who get insurance through the state health care exchange could pay an average of $1,700 more a year.
The expiration of enhanced tax credits will lead to out-of-pocket premiums for ACA marketplace enrollees increasing by an average of more than 75%. Insurers expect healthier enrollees would drop their coverage and cause premiums to then go up, according to a Peterson-KFF analysis.
“The people I talked to this morning in Connecticut before I came down here are asking me, ‘How do I know whether I can afford this insurance?’ Blumenthal said in an interview Monday after he came down to D.C. for votes. “There are real lives and real people who are going to be really hurt if we don’t extend this insurance now.”

Laura Kelly's administration to turn over food program data to the federal government. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas district court judge on Tuesday dismissed a case filed by Attorney General Kris Kobach that challenged the right of Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration to withhold Kansans’ personal data from the federal government.
In a 21-page order, Judge Teresa Watson sided with Department for Children and Families secretary Laura Howard, citing multiple issues with Kobach’s request to force the release of data related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
The federal government’s Food and Nutrition Services program in May began demanding the release of personal information of people who have applied for or used the SNAP program. Howard repeatedly denied the release, pointing to regulations guiding how data should be shared between agencies.
Kobach took Howard and the state to court to force the release of the data, indicating in court filings that he believes compliance is required by state and federal law. He also expressed concern that $10.4 million related to SNAP administrative funding would be withheld from Kansas by the federal government because of the failure to turn over the data.
“We disagree with the judge’s interpretation of ripeness and are considering an appeal. Regardless, the governor continues to defy Kansas law,” Kobach said in a statement to Kansas Reflector. “Needy Kansans have now lost $10.4 million in food assistance because of her political theatrics. That money is not coming back.”
Ripeness refers to part of Watson’s reasoning for choosing to dismiss the case and refers to whether a case is developed and appropriate to be heard.
Watson said the ripeness requirement prevents courts from becoming entangled in abstract disagreements. In this case, she found that because the state has filed an appeal and the full administrative review process has not been completed, the case is not “ripe.”
Kelly, in a news release, accused Kobach of engaging in “low-rent political theater, wasting taxpayer dollars, and spreading misinformation.” She emphasized that no money has been lost from federal funding for SNAP administrative costs.
“I appreciate the court granting my administration’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that the Attorney General’s actions were premature as we continue through the USDA’s administrative review process and that my administration does not have a legal duty to turn over Kansans’ personal information at this time,” Kelly said.
Watson stated in her decision that considering the duties of Howard and the Kansas administration to work with the federal program doesn’t mean that they must “perform in a prescribed manner without regard to the exercise of judgment.”
The Food and Nutrition Services department offers a multi-step administrative process to appeal the decisions to withhold any dollars from Kansas, and the state has filed an appeal, Watson said.
“The comprehensive administrative review available for the disallowance itself (suggests) that the state agency has some discretion in deciding how to respond to the request for SNAP participant data — or at least gives rise to the possibility of a ‘substantial dispute’ about how to respond,” Watson wrote.
Kelly’s news release said Kobach has made false claims multiple times that the state has lost $10.4 million in administrative funding.
“After the (U.S. Department of Agriculture) rejected the Kansas Department for Children and Families (DCF) Corrective Action Proposal, DCF filed an appeal with the USDA,” the news release said. “The filing of that appeal immediately prevented the USDA from withholding the $10.4 million.”
Kobach disagreed. 
“It is laughable to suggest that she will be able to persuade the USDA to change its decision,” he said. “And now, because of the governor’s desire to thumb her nose at the Trump administration, needy Kansans will lose another $10.4 million of food assistance in December.”
The $10.4 million funding loss, if upheld after the appeal, will occur quarterly until the state turns over the data, according to a USDA letter sent to the state. The dollars are designated for administrative cost and do not affect SNAP recipients.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7090263-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-30 16:58:08.570424

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Some of Iowa’s private universities are touting increasingly large and diverse student bodies as enrollment numbers for the 2025 fall semester are confirmed, statistics college officials attribute to their efforts to subdue sticker shock and ensure all students feel welcome.
Universities from Orange City to Des Moines and Sioux Center to Sioux City saw growth in enrollment this fall, including Drake University, Northwestern College, Dordt University, Buena Vista University and Morningside University.
Morningside University beat last year’s numbers and its own expectations for enrollment this fall, breaking 400 when the goal was to top 350. This was a surprise to Interim Vice President for Enrollment Management Steph Peters, who said the university wasn’t alone in seeing dips in interest the previous year due to problems with the rollout of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA.

After hearing from families who were leaving Morningside off their college decision lists due to uncertainty around how much they’d be expected to pay, Peters said the Sioux City university worked to expand Access to MSide, a program which provides financial aid to students based on their residency and Pell Grant eligibility.
“It puts a lot of concerns at ease if you know out the gate that your tuition is going to be covered, and you really just kind of have those auxiliary fees then to come up with,” Peters said. “If nothing else, it helped us have a conversation with those families.”
Tuition aid, access draw student interest
Other colleges and universities across the U.S. have implemented programs aimed at covering some or all of tuition for certain groups, Peters said, having seen them pop up more frequently over the past two years.
Drake University last November launched two initiatives that cover 100% of tuition after other financial aid is factored in. One is for students hoping to earn a bachelor’s degree and the other is for its two-year programs housed in the John Dee Bright College.
Joel Johnson, Drake University dean of admission, said these efforts have helped to grow interest in the university from both in and outside of the state. According to a news release from the university, Drake’s first-year students for four-year degrees increased by nearly 11% this fall to 653 students and enrollment in the John Dee Bright College saw its enrollment increase by close to one-third.
The Des Moines institution’s incoming class also reached a “33.2% level of diversity,” the release stated, which Johnson said relates to ethnic diversity and mirrors levels of diversity in the U.S. Johnson holds an educational doctorate in higher education leadership and organizational studies from Bay Path University.
When asked whether comments made by Drake University President Marty Martin in the spring reaffirming the college’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in the face of state actions to limit such activity had any impact on enrollment this fall, Johnson said he didn’t believe so and pointed to the tuition programs as having generated interest in the college.
“We’ve been very intentional about making sure that we can be accessible to all people across, you know, not just the state of Iowa, but obviously across the nation as well,” Johnson said.
Some families did have questions about potential impacts on the institution from state and federal shifts relating to higher education, including directives for universities to shut down diversity, equity and inclusion programs and offices.
Dealing with “the current federal rhetoric” and quick, but sometimes uncertain, changes made at the national level has been a challenge, Johnson said, as it adds more noise to an already difficult time for students trying to figure out which college would be best to attend and how to make that happen.
Drake is an adaptable university that will be able to handle shifts coming its way, Johnson said.
“It’s just … an environmental factor that is frustrating because it’s out of our control, like we could do everything right, they can see that Drake as a great fit for them, but something in the political ether could just change the narrative, and they’ll say, ‘Maybe not,’” Johnson said.
Preparing for further competition
Only a month or so into the 2025-2026 school year, Peters said Morningside is already offering prospective students tools to predict whether they’ll qualify for the university’s tuition saving programs. The Sioux City university has partnered with an Student Aid Index, or SAI, estimator to allow families to input their information and learn how much aid they could potentially receive.
Peters said this was a helpful tool in allowing families to get an early jump on their college decision process before the FAFSA was released. The U.S. Department of Education announced the launch of the FAFSA Sept. 24, its earliest release date in the form’s history.
Over her nearly 25 years working at Morningside, Peters said she’s seen how the competition between colleges has changed from private universities only having to worry about other private institutions to all colleges competing against each other. It’s not an unhealthy competition, she said, there are just more options now for students to choose from and have more reasons to compare different kinds of higher education.
It’s not just other schools that Iowa universities are competing against, Johnson said, but all of the other distractions in young people’s lives as well. Marketing has become more important than ever as social media and other technology keep students’ attention, but once that attention has been drawn toward Drake, Johnson said it’s not so hard to generate interest.
“I’m happy with the things that we’re doing and putting in place so that families … don’t have to initially eliminate right away (based on) the sticker shock,” Peters said. “That’s what we have combated for years and years, and I think that we’re making some good inroads as far as that goes in showing families that we are a possibility.”

Ned Lamont said Tuesday that he has been rejected by potential nominees for vacancies on the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, whose chair is resigning after months of conflict and a threatened impeachment effort.
“We’re working as hard as we can to get those five nominees there, and we’ve interviewed an awful lot of people,” Lamont said. “To be blunt, I’ve been turned down more than a few times, too.”
There are currently two open seats at PURA, with a third soon to be created by the departure of the authority’s chair, Marissa Gillett, on Oct. 10. 
Lamont has long expressed a desire to fill those vacancies with applicants that share a similar background to Gillett — an attorney and engineer who previously worked as a staffer to utility regulators in Maryland — as opposed to more political appointees. 
The two remaining members of PURA, Vice Chair David Arconti and Commissioner Michael Caron, both served several terms in the state legislature before being appointed as regulators. (Caron, the board’s only Republican, is serving out a term that formally expired in 2022, potentially creating a fourth opening if Lamont chooses not to reappoint him.) 
“I can get five generalists on there pretty quickly, if that’s good enough for you,” Lamont said Tuesday. “I’d also like a couple of people who really can match wits with Eversource and [United Illuminating], who will hit the ground running, because we have some big dockets in front of us.”
Asked what reasons he had been given for the lack of interest in the job, Lamont pointed to “negative publicity, lawsuits,” and threats of impeachment swirling around the agency in recent months. In her resignation letter to the governor earlier this month, Gillett said the “emotional toll” on her and her family from those controversies had influenced her decision to step down.
“I did not make this decision lightly, but there is only so much that one individual can reasonably endure, or ask of their family, while doing their best to serve our state,” she wrote. 
Another factor that Lamont said was hampering his recruitment efforts is the pay scale at PURA. Salaries for commissioners range from $151,950 to $207,198, making it difficult to compete for candidates from the private sector, he said. 
“I’ve got lots of retired people would love to sit on this board, and we’ll have some of those on there, which is often our norm,” he said. “But I also need some folks who really can match wits” with the utilities, he said.
“Maybe it’s somebody who’s had a pretty good career, lot of experience, wants to give back for five years,” he added. “Maybe it’s somebody who’s really smart who started their career and thinks this is really a chance to build up their resume and make a difference for us in the meantime.”
The governor did not share the names of any of the candidates who he said had turned him down. Asked about their backgrounds, he said said they were people “who know a lot about regulation” and had “sense” about business and finance. 
Lamont will have to make at least one appointment to PURA before Oct. 10 in order to guarantee the authority a quorum of three members to issue final decisions in pending cases, his office has said. Appointees are able to serve in an interim capacity until they are confirmed by the lawmakers during the next legislative session. 
One person who is widely viewed as being under consideration by Lamont is former state Rep. Holly Cheeseman. In February, Lamont announced plans to appoint Cheeseman, a Republican, to one of the two vacancies at PURA as part of a deal to secure Gillett’s then-pending confirmation to a second four-year term.
That plan fell apart, however, due to complications involving the other planned appointee, state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford. Fonfara faced criticism over his business dealings before PURA as well as legal prohibition against joining an executive-branch agency before his Senate term expires in 2027. 
Cheeseman said this week she has not spoken recently to the governor about the position.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LAMONT-WIND-0825-CANNON-113-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 16:58:08.570424

ST. ALBANS CITY —- On Tuesday, Dairy Farmers of America workers showed up to strike for the sixth day on Federal Street and stood with picket signs, their backs facing the towering silos and white warehouses where they usually work. 
The workers, part of the Vermont Teamsters Local 597 union, went on strike Thursday in a push for higher pay and what they consider to be a more fair overtime work policy. Employees are asking for an 8% increase in hourly wages. And after Lt. Governor John Rodgers visited the picket line Sunday, he said in an interview that he could be getting personally involved in negotiations. 
Union members have been bargaining with the Kansas based dairy company since June, said Curtis Clough, the union’s organizer. 
Then, earlier this month, the company hired a number of temporary employees in non-union roles, which the teamsters considered to be an act of bad faith, said Dustin Reed, a teamster on strike. 
“We’re in a struggle against corporate America,” Reed said. And he feels like the little guy. 
Dairy Farmers of America reported making over $108 million in net income in 2022, with $24.5 billion in net sales that year.
The dairy company did not respond to requests for an interview and instead emailed a statement that stated they’ve been actively negotiating with the union. “We are disappointed that the Teamsters walked away from that process and have initiated a strike at the St. Albans plant,” the company wrote.

The St. Albans facility receives milk shipments and processes that milk into cream, condensed skim milk and powdered skim milk. In addition to Ben and Jerry’s, the facility sells to Kate’s Butter and others. 
Since the strike began, Clough said he estimates the facility is operating at about 10% capacity, with the temporary non-union employees filling some gaps in staffing while the strike continues. 
Clough said that transport trucks have had to dump out thousands of gallons of milk because the facility doesn’t have the capacity to process the perishable product without the union employees. 
‘They’re not asking for a lot’
Over the weekend, the strike drew the attention of Lt. Governor John Rodgers, who visited the picket line Sunday and posted a video on Facebook voicing support for their cause. 
“If we’re going to maintain healthy agriculture, we’ve got to pay the workers good, we’ve got to pay the farmers good. Everybody needs to make a living,” Rodgers said in the video. He asked “everyone” to support the teamsters’ strike and to push the dairy company to show up to the bargaining table. 
Teamsters also visited the Ben and Jerry’s Factory in Waterbury on Sunday. Union members handed out flyers to customers and visitors to make them aware of the ice cream company’s ties to their employer, Clough said. 
Reed, who lives in Enosburg and grew up on a dairy farm, has worked at the facility for 22 years. He said that, recently, managers have been forcing senior employees to work significant overtime, which violates the company’s contract with the union. Clough said some company employees rejected those claims during meetings with the union. 
Another worker on strike, Alan Boutin, doesn’t trust management. He believes he was wrongfully terminated last fall, but wasn’t re-hired until last week after the union negotiated with management for months. Throughout the process, managers made many promises they didn’t keep, he said. 
“There’s a lot of bullshit going on here. It shouldn’t be that way,” he said. 
Many workers on the picket line also said that dairy workers are notoriously underpaid. And Rodgers, who grew up on a dairy farm in the Kingdom, said he knows that to be true as well. 
Conversations with management on Monday moved things in the right direction, but still aren’t meeting workers’ needs, Clough said. They hope to include Rodgers in the process to put more pressure on the company, he said. 
In an interview, Rodgers said he offered to support the teamsters however they saw fit. 
“They’re not asking for a lot,” Rodgers said. He said that a company as large and profitable as DFA should be able to pay their workers more. Rodgers is happy to sit down at the table with them. 
“I want to see them back to work,” Rodgers said.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The Centurion Foundation, the Atlanta-based nonprofit trying to buy a pair of safety net Rhode Island hospitals, still can’t lure investors, prompting a fourth revision to the deal conditionally approved by state regulators. 
In a letter to Centurion Foundation CEO Ben Mingle on Tuesday, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha agreed to ease up on the terms his office imposed on the pending sale of Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in North Providence. A copy of the letter was shared with Rhode Island Current.
The revisions come as Centurion continues to struggle to sell the $165 million in taxable and tax-exempt bonds needed to finalize its purchase of the hospitals. Credit ratings agencies highlighted “significant uncertainty” in the financial and operational performance of Centurion’s pending bonds in ratings assessments earlier this year.
The bond amount reflects the $80 million purchase price plus an $80 million cash injection into the struggling hospitals’ balance sheets — one of 85 conditions state regulators imposed in granting conditional approval of the sale in June 2024. The proposed change in ownership, and corresponding switch from for profit to nonprofit status, requires the sign off of state regulators under the state’s Hospital Conversion Act.
Neronha has already pulled back on certain regulatory and financial conditions three times in an effort to help Centurion sell the bonds and close the deal and keep the safety net hospitals open.
Their existing owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal court in Dallas in January. If the sale to Centurion falls through, the Rhode Island hospitals risk shuttering or being sold as assets in an out-of-state federal bankruptcy proceeding. 
“If you want to ask why I keep betting against myself in the Centurion transaction, that’s why,” Neronha said at an unrelated press conference Tuesday. “The alternative is worse than that.”
He continued, “Prospect, you know, wants to close these hospitals. They want to close them right now. That’s what I am trying to avoid.”
The two hospitals, with 500 beds between them, account for more than 50,000 emergency room visits per year. Together they have 104 beds for behavioral health patients, representing more than 20% of behavioral health beds available statewide.
The long-delayed deal is now expected to close Oct. 31, assuming Centurion can sell the bonds under the revised terms. 
“I suspect if they didn’t close by the end of October, that will be the death knell for the transaction,” Neronha said.
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, Centurion’s local subsidiary, did not return inquiries for comment on Tuesday. 










I suspect if they didn’t close by the end of October, that will be the death knell for the transaction 


– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha 


In July, Neronha agreed to cut the upfront cash requirement from $80 million to $45 million, giving Centurion 90 days after the deal closed to come up with the remaining $35 million. But that was still not enough.
Centurion told Neronha that even the more lenient financial conditions “have frustrated its ability to obtain sufficient bond financing,” the letter states.
Now, Neronha will shave off another $9 million from the upfront cash requirement, reducing the initial injection to $36 million. He also granted Centurion’s request to waive the condition that it invest another $35 million in the first 90 days. 
However, like prior revisions, there are strings attached.
“Stop interrupting my vacation,” Neronha said Tuesday when asked what new protections he imposed.
His letter proved more illustrative, outlining two new conditions tied to the waiver. 
One cuts $10 million from the sale profits that will be transferred to federal bankruptcy court in Dallas to fulfill Prospect’s obligations to creditors. The other specifies that Centurion has to spend its own money – versus bond sale proceeds – to cover $1.5 million of the closing costs. They must wait at least six months before tapping $2 million of bond sale proceeds for additional administrative costs. If Centurion meets the previous requirement of a $45 million cash injection for hospital operations, the cost deferral is not required. 
Neronha said Tuesday he denied a request from Centurion seeking the state’s help to cover the sale. Details, including the amount requested, were not immediately available. 
In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey put up $700 million in state incentives and taxpayer money to lure buyers for a string of hospitals at risk of closing under the bankrupt Steward Health Care. That included St. Anne’s Hospital in Fall River and Morton Hospital in Taunton, which Brown University Health bought for $175 million last year.
John Fernandez, CEO of Brown University Health, reiterated Tuesday that the health system had no interest in buying Roger Williams and Fatima because of their financial struggles.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)TWIN BRIDGES – Brian Wheeler has spent a fair bit of the last six years wearing waders in the middle of the Big Hole River documenting river conditions and collecting samples of macroinvertebrates.
Put simply, the river guide and conservationist has spent a lot of time scrubbing rocks and collecting bugs in small sections of the Big Hole River. Their relative abundance helps show river health, he said in late September while crouched over his sampling gear at a site near Twin Bridges.
Fish populations have been declining in some of Montana’s most famous rivers, and Wheeler is part of a growing number of people trying to figure out why. The undammed Big Hole River is one of Montana’s precious gems, known for its renowned fishing and breathtaking beauty.
“If we’ve learned anything across the nation with resource destruction, it’s these places aren’t just automatically gonna stay that way forever,” Wheeler said. “They take active work to preserve.”

Wheeler is Save Wild Trout’s program director, an organization that merged with the Big Hole River Foundation earlier this year. His organization also works with Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, and Wheeler got into the work with Trout Unlimited in Dillon, where he lives.
Save Wild Trout and its partner organizations have a fairly straightforward goal: Find out what is behind declining trout populations in southwestern Montana. Their method is to try and collect data state agencies aren’t and then give that data to those agencies.
More importantly, they want to give the state data it can accept as scientifically valid.
“We researched like, ‘OK, what are their protocols? What lab do they use? What are the scientific metrics that we have thresholds for, like nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved oxygen?’” Wheeler said.
He added: “You can’t manage what you don’t measure, and there’s some serious measurement gaps.”
Wheeler said their organization — which includes scientist Kyle Flynn — works with the Department of Environmental Quality on standards for their data. Flynn formerly worked for DEQ and has more than a decade of water quality experience.
This summer, Save Wild Trout released a report showing warm temperatures and low oxygen levels in the Jefferson River Basin. Water temperatures at 77 degrees can kill fish within hours and the river reached 80 degrees in the summer of 2024, the report noted. Low oxygen levels at night, which can be caused by algae blooms, are also a concern – most plants don’t photosynthesize at night.

They observed four rivers (The Big Hole, Beaverhead, Ruby and Madison rivers) during 2023 and 2024 for the study, efforts that included hundreds of miles of overhead flights with thermal imaging equipment mounted on a helicopter.
The data collection is not always glamorous. Wheeler did a quick estimate with his phone calculator, saying he’s done about 200 bug samples since the project began in 2019. 
At sites along the Big Hole, he goes out to a spot in the water, trying to keep it as random as possible. Once he’s picked a site, he puts down his sampling contraption. There’s multiple types of macroinvertebrate sampling, and he does his work with a Hess stream bottom sampler. 
The sampler is about as large as a chili pot and is connected to a net that funnels into a sample cup. He puts the device in the water, crouches down and holds it in place.
He then uses a brush and begins to scrub rocks, and the current of the river pushes anything that comes off into the net. Tiny creatures, including midges and salmon flies, live on, around and under those rocks. They all play a part in the food web, Wheeler said, and their abundance is information that might help explain problems with larger aquatic organisms.
And it’s not just fish impacted by warmer temperatures and less oxygen in the water; other creatures are too.

“A healthy river for aquatic life is a healthy river for the rest of us,” Wheeler said. “Like, it’s why we collect bugs. This is, like the foundational health indicator of a river.”
Once the large rocks in the area he’s sampling are cleaned off he makes sure anything crawling inside the net is knocked into the sample cup. He likes to joke the clean rocks are creating spawn habitat for trout, which brush off rocks in efforts to create better areas to lay their eggs.
“I also like to think that if I scrub rocks, I did half the work for them creating their spawning reds,” Wheeler said.
With the contraption over his arm, he trudges back to shore and prepares the samples in several meticulous steps.
“Man, it’s not sexy, dude,” Wheeler said of the work.
An alcohol solution is used to preserve the samples, which are later sent to entomologists at River Continuum Concepts in Manhattan. Wheeler, who does not trust shipping companies to deliver the samples, drives them over to Gallatin County himself. 
The research has already netted a 178-page report on macroinvertebrates in the Big Hole River, covering 2019 to 2022, authored by Brett Marshall with River Continuum Concepts. The hope is to put out a 10-year report in a couple years, Wheeler said.
The sampling process at any one site can take multiple hours, especially when driving time is included. Wheeler puts hundreds of miles on his Tundra truck every year, often along Montana’s many backroads.
In September, Wheeler was also picking up what they called “data loggers,” which record several river conditions and were one of the main data collection tools for the report Save Wild Trout released in the summer.
They aren’t cheap, and Wheeler has resorted to camouflaging the loggers, which have been vandalized and in one case stolen. 
“If you’ve got a resource that’s struggling because people make their living on it, people appreciate it beyond the economic value or the ecological value,” Wheeler said. “So I mean, it’s kind of hard to avoid getting a bit emotional.”
There is very real tension and frustration over the river.
Ranchers have water rights and need water for their cattle. Extended drought has caused agricultural producers across the country trouble rebuilding their herds. Some ranchers have voluntarily put water back in the river, Wheeler said, but others don’t and that’s their legal right.

Guides and outfitters, who rely on the world-renowned trout fishing in the area to support their livelihoods, have a major stake in the river, too.
Some communities, like Butte, also pull water out of rivers in the area, Wheeler said. Irrigators — there are some crops near the river — are also part of the puzzle.
The fish population issue caught the attention of the Governor’s Office in 2023, which resulted in Gov. Greg Gianforte holding a summer meeting in Wise River with various river stakeholders.
A lot of ranchers and irrigators showed up to that, Wheeler said, and not as many anglers. He kept his comments short on the whole thing.
“I thought it was a lost opportunity for some broad representation,” Wheeler said.
That meeting did result in a yet-to-be-released study into fish mortality on the river.
This is an effort through Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, which is coordinating with researchers at Montana State University. Researchers at the school are expected to submit annual fish mortality reports until 2028, when three doctoral students at MSU are expected to finish their dissertations, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks spokesperson Morgan Jacobsen wrote in an email on Tuesday.

“In addition to the dissertations, MSU is expected to provide a final report including the raw data and analysis code as well as submit three manuscripts for peer-reviewed publication,” Jacobsen wrote.
It is an ongoing project and Save Wild Trout, which meets several times per year with FWP, is coordinating their work with that state agency, too. Those meetings, along with the organization’s work with DEQ, allow conversations to take place on the issue between the state and organizations like Save Wild Trout.
As part of the fish mortality effort, FWP is also tagging fish. Similar efforts have been undertaken in Idaho to study effects of hatchery-reared sturgeon on the Snake River.
“Ultimately, tagging allows biologists to track individual fish, which provides insight into movement, survival, and growth throughout the life of a fish,” Jacobsen wrote.
That is often done by electrocuting and stunning fish, which can kill fish on occasion. Recently, a tagging effort by FWP apparently killed some fish in the Big Hole River.
“While we didn’t see any immediate mortality during this fish sampling effort, clearly there was some impact,” Jacobsen wrote. “Moving forward, conditions and population abundances will need to be significantly better in the next year or two for us to consider a fall sampling event on the Big Hole.”
FWP is also actively working with irrigators to improve efficiency, work with power companies on things like the Madison River Drought Plan and identify areas ripe for restoration. FWP is also closely working with Montana State researchers on the trout issue.
“Although those efforts are not considered research, they address some of the issues associated with the MSU research,” Jacobsen wrote. “Other FWP staff and partners are working with existing data and past environmental conditions to better understand exactly how water temperatures and flows influence recruitment of juvenile trout and adult survival, which will complement the ongoing MSU studies.”

The Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, along with DEQ, is part of what Wheeler called a “three legged stool” of government oversight of Montana watersheds. There’s also only so much money and manpower, with Wheeler saying resources can only extend so far.
That’s where organizations like Save Wild Trout can help fill in gaps, he said. The organization receives some state grants, but most of its work is funded through donations. Reports, even with some volunteer hours working on them, are still expensive, Wheeler said.
The sampling device Wheeler uses is not cheap either, which is why the organization only has one. Gas is pricey too, and between running people down the river as a guide and collecting data, he does not have a ton of free time in the summer.
But this work is important, he said, and he sees a lot of value in the data they’re gathering. Even if it comes at cost to his knees and back.
“We started this program, we didn’t know if the river was better, worse or the same as it has been 20 years ago, because there was no data to show that,” Wheeler said. “And so I think about the next person, you know, the next iteration of me in this role, at least that person will have a historic record to compare against.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BigHole1-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-09-30 16:58:08.570424

On Tuesday, Correction Ombuds DeVaughn Ward and acting Child Advocate Christina Ghio sent a letter to Department of Correction Commissioner Angel Quiros, Gov. Ned Lamont’s office and lawmakers from both parties saying that there were still unanswered questions about the protection of personal health data, the use of the scanners in certain situations and overall protocols. 
The body scanners, similar to those used by TSA at airports, are part of a pilot program at Manson Youth Institution and York Correctional Institution, the state women’s prison. They were scheduled to go into effect on Oct. 1. 
But Quiros agreed to pause the implementation of the scanners until he was able to meet with Ghio and Ward to address their concerns, according to an email to CT Mirror from Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction. 
“In light of this upcoming meeting, the DOC will continue to review and refine its policies as they relate to the use of the body scanners,” Banevicius wrote. 
Criminal Justice reform advocates have long been advocating for body scanners as a less invasive solution to strip searches. In February, advocates reiterated their call at a press conference memorializing the 2018 death of J’Allen Jones, who died after being pepper sprayed, restrained, struck and forcibly moved by as many as nine correction workers. Jones had refused to submit to a strip search. 
Data showed that the department conducted about 355,000 strip searches on incarcerated people in 2024.
The state Bonding Commission put aside funding for four body scanners in August.
In the letter, Ward and Ghio underscored that it needs to be clear that the purpose of the body scanners is to use them to reduce the number of strip searches. Ward told CT Mirror that he’d seen a social media post by the union representing correction officers that made him question whether everyone understood the purpose of the scanners in the same way. He said the post seemed to indicate that correction officers viewed the scanners as a way to enhance surveillance of incarcerated people, with a particular focus on detecting drugs. Advocates, on the other hand, viewed the scanners as a means to reduce strip searches. 
“I think the bridge between those two interpretations leaves a world of potential misunderstanding and misuse by staff,” Ward said. 
In the post, the union lists the body scanners as one of several “practical and effective solutions” that would “address the growing crisis of drugs entering our state correctional facilities.”
A spokesperson for AFSCME local 391, which represents correction officers, did not respond to a request for comment from CT Mirror. 
Ghio told CT Mirror that the Office of the Child Advocate supported the use of body scanners but said that policies needed to be “well thought through and clarified” before the department started to use the machines. She said it needed to be “crystal clear” how often the scanners are allowed to be used on an individual person. 
In meetings with the legislature’s budget committee in February and March, Quiros said he believed the body scanners were “100% better” than strip searches at identifying contraband. He said he supported the use of body scanners for department staff as well as the incarcerated population. Union representatives, however, have cast doubt on the efficacy of the scanners and said they don’t support requiring corrections staff to pass through them. 
Ward and Ghio’s letter also raised concerns around how the scanners would be used on pregnant women or people who have insulin pumps or pacemakers. The advocates said it was unclear how often the scanners would be used, and what kind of radiation incarcerated individuals — particularly children and teens — would be exposed to. And if contraband was found through a scanner, it’s not clear what would happen after.
“Transparent and consistent procedures must also be established for circumstances in which contraband is suspected, so that both residents and staff understand what steps will follow a scan,” the letter read. 
They also questioned how the data and images collected by the scanners would be stored, and who would be able to access them. Ward told CT Mirror that the scans will allow corrections officers to view protected health information about incarcerated individuals, since the scans reveal images of someone’s body. 
Barbara Fair, executive director of Stop Solitary CT and a strong advocate for the scanners, told CT Mirror that she shared many of the concerns that Ward and Ghio outlined in the letter. She said she agreed that there needed to be a meeting with the Department of Correction to discuss those points. 
State Rep. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, co-chair of the legislature’s Judiciary Committee, told CT Mirror that if people want to create a policy for the use of the body scanners, they should be able to do so “relatively quickly.” 
Ghio and Ward asked the Department of Correction to convene a meeting no later than Oct. 15 to discuss the body scanners.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/York-CI-sign02.jpg,,,2025-09-30 16:58:08.570424

University of Missouri System President Mun Choi’s call for a campaign to address crime in Columbia earned support Monday but few details emerged on how it would play out.


Support ranged from Gov. Mike Kehoe to several members of the Columbia City Council and Mayor Barbara Buffaloe, who has agreed to form a community task force to address crime following the early morning incident on Saturday that left a woman dead and two wounded.


Stephens College student Aiyanna Williams died Sunday at University Hospital. Williams was on East Broadway at 1:40 a.m. when a shooter fired into the crowd that she was in.
The criminal process began Monday for Misael Covarrubias when he made his first court appearance in connection to the shooting. He is charged with three counts of first-degree assault, three counts of armed criminal action and unlawful use of a weapon causing death or injury.


Covarrubias is being held in Boone County Jail. He has a hearing scheduled for Oct. 7 and a preliminary hearing on Nov. 6.


In a Facebook post Monday evening, Williams’ family thanked the community for support, but called for space to grieve.


“I have already asked, at my daughter’s memorial, that her death not be turned into a political statement,” the post said. “That request has not been respected. We are grieving our daughter. We’re not furthering anyone’s agenda.”


“There is a crime crisis in Columbia,” Choi said during a news conference at Jesse Hall. “And that’s why I called on the mayor, the city manager and the prosecuting attorney to take immediate and long-term actions.”


 City leaders respond to Saturday’s shooting



While the mayor and other top city officials were in meetings throughout the day and declined interview requests, some council members expressed support for a renewed focus on crime in response to the fatal shooting on Saturday.


Third Ward councilperson Jacque Sample said she agrees with Choi’s encouragement of collaboration between the Columbia and MU Police departments to jointly patrol the city.


“I support his support of the Police Department,” said Sample. “We have increased our police numbers, and I believe the chief is doing a good job of making sure that her team is where they need to be.”
In regard to the police response on Saturday, “police can’t predict the future or the behaviors of people who choose to do bad things. Their response time was there, and they were able to immediately detain and arrest the person,” Sample said.


Fourth Ward Councilperson Nick Foster said increased police presence alone won’t solve the issue.


“I believe that presence of law enforcement does deter some crime, but it doesn’t deter all of it,” Foster said. “We are not going to police our way to eliminating violent crime or crime of any kind.”


The Columbia Police Department brought in additional officers on overtime pay to try and prevent shootings like the one that took place on Saturday. However, Fifth Ward Councilperson Don Waterman said that an increased police presence is helpful but won’t stop every incident.


“You could have a cop on every corner, I don’t know that it’s absolutely going to prevent it,” Waterman said. “It’s tragic.”


Still, he said the increase in size the police force has seen over the past few years is positive.


“(Columbia Police) Chief (Jill) Schlude said in her budget request that she’d like to see 50 new officers over the next few years,” Waterman said. “It’s not gonna stop it completely, but I believe it would maybe give some individuals pause.”


Sample said the city is making strides toward increasing police presence downtown.
“I do think that there’s certain times that we do need additional police officers in certain spaces such as downtown, and they’re working on tracking those trends and putting people in places where they need to be,” Sample said.
Choi, Schlude, University of Missouri Police Department Chief Brian Weimer and other university officials met with Buffaloe on Monday afternoon to discuss next steps.
In a Monday night Facebook post, Buffaloe said there have been 58 confirmed incidents of gun shots fired in Columbia during the first nine months of this year. This is compared to 105 during the first nine months of last year.



Buffaloe attributed this to the city’s “proactive policing efforts,” but acknowledged that police presence is not the only action needed to prevent violence. She added that the shooting this weekend occurred despite police officers being “directly in the area.”


In the post, Buffaloe also referred to the incident as “senseless gun violence” and pledged her commitment to “reduce violence (and) address homelessness.”


In an emailed statement, Kehoe’s office confirmed that he had been in contact with Choi and local leaders “regarding the crime crisis plaguing Columbia.”


“As public safety and cracking down on crime remains his top priority, Governor Kehoe will continue to consider options to assist Columbia and communities across the state to address crime,” the statement said.


In an emailed statement, Columbia College Senior Vice President and Provost Sandra Hamar said college students “deserve to feel safe both on campus and throughout our city.”


She expressed the college’s support for Choi “who, along with many community leaders, is seeking meaningful change to ensure the safety of our city.”


 Choi makes demands of city



In an email to Mizzou faculty, staff and students on Saturday, Choi called for a variety of steps ranging from more policing downtown to the elimination of policies and practices that “attract criminals.” He also suggested calling on state support to fight crime in Columbia.


Sample expressed some need for caution when it comes to state involvement.


“I think we need to find what getting involved is,” she said. “I do not think they should be directive in how our city addresses it, but I would very much welcome a partnership and collaboration.”


While Choi had called for changing some policies, he had no specifics when asked about those on Monday.


“If there’s a particular policy that he is concerned about drawing crime, then I think that needs to be said out loud so that it can be appropriately investigated and addressed by the city,” Sample said. “As we move forward, we do have a lot of work to do and we need community.”


Foster also questioned Choi’s comment about city policies.


“I think the suggestion that there are policies that attract a criminal element to our city, and that city leadership is responsible for that, is disappointing,” he said.


Foster emphasized the need to address underlying factors that can lead to an increase in crime, such as poverty, generational trauma and a lack of access to adequate mental health services. He added that supporting the Office of Violence Prevention and other similar work that is being done in neighborhoods throughout the community is imperative.


During the news conference, Choi referenced crime numbers, which he said were provided by Schlude, showing crime against property is up 40%. According to the Columbia Police Department, crimes against property includes robbery, larceny, burglary and motor vehicle theft. The Police Department confirmed that crimes against property are up in the area. However, the city’s crime trends dashboard shows crimes against property are down compared to last year.


Foster noted that the latest report the council received from the Police Department included year-to-date data that showed a 6% increase in violent crime and an overall 29% decrease in firearm-related incidents.


First Ward Councilperson Valorie Carroll urged that “we take time to acknowledge the victims and the families.”


“It feels rather sudden to me,” she said about Choi’s call for emergency action.


“I’m afraid that we have moved past this too quickly into a politically charged narrative in a way that does a disservice to the communities involved,” she added.


Sample and Foster emphasized the community’s need to support Williams’ family in their loss.


”The focus needs to really be on the family that lost their loved one. This is not over for them, and the community needs to show love and comfort to that family,” Sample said.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated Tuesday that some 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed if the government shuts down. The 35-second video appears to be AI-generated and uses the setting of Schumer and Jeffries, both New York Democrats, speaking to reporters outside the White House after their meeting with Trump. The fake video shows Jeffries with a sombrero and mustache and Schumer ranting that “if we give all these illegal aliens free health care, we might be able to get them on our side so they can vote for us.” Espaillat of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus described the video as “insulting,” saying it shows Trump is “out of touch with the health care challenges of the American people.” The New York Democrat said “with your health care on the line, all he could do is put out this deepfake racist meme — not funny at all, not for any of us here, particularly for people that are ill and fighting for their lives that need health care.” Democratic Women’s Caucus Chair Teresa Leger Fernández also blasted the video, saying “that’s not how you get to a deal.” Instead, the New Mexico Democrat said Trump’s decision to post it “looks like a little 6-year-old having a temper tantrum.” 'Bigotry will get you nowhere'Congressional Black Caucus Chair Yvette Clarke, a New York Democrat, said “the juvenile behavior coming out of the White House should not be dignified by any American.”   Clarke noted that her caucus “will not support a partisan spending bill that slashes health care, guts federal jobs and raises costs, all while targeting the very communities that keep this country running.” In a social media post Monday responding to the fabricated video, Schumer said “if you think your shutdown is a joke, it just proves what we all know: You can’t negotiate. You can only throw tantrums.” Jeffries also responded to Trump on social media Monday, saying “bigotry will get you nowhere” and “we are NOT backing down.”",,,,2025-09-30 16:58:08.570424

An E. coli bacterial impairment in Lander Creek, which passes through livestock lobbyist Jim Magagna’s grazing allotment and ranch, would swing back toward compliance with the Clean Water Act under a state proposal.
The post Wyoming tries again to delist remote Wind River Range stream for fecal contamination appeared first on WyoFile .","A decade-plus-long fight over potentially hazardous levels of fecal bacteria in a scenic Sweetwater River tributary may be closer to ending — at least on paper — if a Wyoming proposal to reclassify the stream and change regulatory thresholds goes through.
At issue is Lander Creek, a small stream along the southwest tip of the Wind River Range that has seen on-again, off-again environmental impairment listings for a strain of intestinal bacteria that can cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and stomach pains when ingested. The waterway’s noncompliance with the Clean Water Act directly traces to Cora-based environmental activist Jonathan Ratner, who in 2010 submitted water quality samples that led to its initial impairment. 
Reached Monday in India while convalescing from a bike wreck, Ratner said he’s not surprised by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality’s current proposal, which reasons that an impaired stretch of Lander Creek ought to be held to less-stringent E. coli standards because it’s seldom-used and too small for immersive recreation. 
“They will do anything to avoid admitting that there is tons of cow shit in our water,” Ratner said. “I’ve collected E. coli data across multiple states over multiple decades, and basically there is no place where cows have access to a waterbody and it does not violate Clean Water Act standards.”
Ratner’s involvement in the Lander Creek saga has directly caused its yo-yo-like impairment status. 
After the Wyoming DEQ first recognized its waters to be unfit for recreation back in 2012, Lander Creek’s and two other streams’ impairments were undone when the Wyoming Department of Agriculture, Wyoming Stock Growers Association and Wyoming Association of Conservation Districts voiced concern that the samples came from Ratner, who then worked for the Western Watersheds Project, a livestock-focused and combative environmental advocacy group. Explaining the reversal, state regulators reasoned that Ratner’s incubating machine was “self-made” and “wasn’t certified” and produced questionable results.

At the time, the Wyoming Stock Growers Association’s executive vice president, Jim Magagna, specifically took issue with Lander Creek, asking that its listing be scrapped. The stream flows through his state land grazing allotment, where Ratner took his sample.  
“Of utmost importance to us, this sample was taken while trespassing on state lands,” Magagna wrote to the DEQ in 2013. “The only authorized public access to state lands off of a public right of way is … for the exclusive purposes of hunting, fishing, and ‘casual recreational uses.’” 
That dispute precipitated a change to state trespass laws criminalizing data collection, including photography, on private and “open” land. That law, however, was challenged in court and ultimately found to be unconstitutional and repealed. 
Other regulatory changes related to Ratner’s grazing-focused water quality sampling followed. 
The Wyoming DEQ updated its sampling requirements, making it more difficult for individuals and non-governmental organizations to assist in water quality monitoring.  
Then, in 2015, the DEQ categorically relaxed E. coli standards for streams with modeled average flows of less than six cubic feet of water per second. For the last decade, those waters statewide have had a regulatory threshold for fecal coliform bacteria that’s five times higher than it used to be. The state agency’s rationale is that immersive, full-body recreation wasn’t possible in the smaller streams, and so higher concentrations of fecal constituents should be allowed. 
Environmental regulators took samples from Lander Creek in June, July and August 2016 to verify findings that came out of Ratner’s samples. The water was noncompliant, registering an average of 318 bacterial organisms per 100 milligrams — about 2.5 times the safety criteria. The stream reappeared as having E. coli issues in Wyoming DEQ’s 2020 impaired water report.
The crystal-clear water coursing through Lander Creek may suggest it’s a pristine and healthy stream, but tests have consistently found that the water contains levels of E. coli bacteria that make it unsafe for recreation. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)
Two other streams that Ratner had previously sampled were tested again, but both were found to be compliant with the new, less-stringent E. coli threshold for low-flow waters. Pacific Creek, another Wind River Range drainage, was assessed and cleared and so was Clarks Draw, a diminutive Hoback River tributary. Data from the assessments show that both would have been listed as E. coli-impaired using the DEQ’s earlier, more stringent regulatory threshold. 
Lander Creek was listed as impaired because modeling suggested it carried too much water and should be subject to E. coli standards more protective of human health. 
That’s a judgment that the Sublette County Conservation District disagreed with. The county-funded organization conducted the sampling and analysis on Lander Creek, using a Wyoming Department of Agriculture water quality grant.
Responding in writing to Lander Creek’s proposed listing in 2020, the conservation district successfully convinced the state to trim the length of impaired waters from 6.3 miles to 2.5 miles, arguing that low volumes above a tributary named Ord Creek should subject that section of stream to the less stringent E. coli standard.

A 2.5-mile-long stretch of Lander Creek is considered unfit for “primary contact recreation” because of E. coli contamination. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality originally sought to classify 6.3 miles of the stream as impaired, but reduced the length of polluted stream after a request from the Sublette County Conservation District. Now the state agency is proposing to remove the impairment entirely. (Wyoming DEQ)
The conservation district also asked Wyoming DEQ to reevaluate the lower stream for its recreational potential, a request that led to the state’s current proposal. Mike Henn, who manages the district, said that his intent is not to circumvent the Clean Water Act. 
“It’s not like we were pinpointing Lander Creek and trying to get it off [the list] by trying to find a loophole,” Henn told WyoFile. “The model was not accurate.”
Henn disagreed with Ratner that the situation was a clear-cut case of livestock polluting Lander Creek. 
“Grazing is not the only source of E. coli,” Henn said. He listed other sources: “Wildlife, recreation, humans, canines.” 
Not far away in the region, breathtaking Lonesome Lake — where few livestock tread, but people swarm — is being investigated for a potential E. coli impairment.

Environmental regulators’ proposal for Lander Creek is outlined in a “use attainability analysis,” which is a “relatively uncommon” maneuver for the state agency, according to Eric Hargett, DEQ’s assistant supervisor for surface water monitoring. The DEQ last prepared one in 2011 covering 11 waterbodies. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agreed to it, redesignating those streams and subjecting them to the less-stringent E. coli standards. 
Wyoming DEQ’s analysis argues that “full body contact water recreation is not attainable” in Lander Creek. 
“Field observations and surveys indicated that fishing, camping, wading, and picnicking were minimal along the 2.5-mile segment, and with no reports of full body contact water recreation such as swimming or child’s play,” the document states.
Magagna, whose land and grazing allotment are bisected by Lander Creek, agrees. 
“I’ve not seen primary recreation taking place there — swimming or getting in the stream,” Magagna told WyoFile. “It’s rare to see anybody even camping near that part of the stream.”

The small stream has suffered from E. coli bacteria problems tied to livestock grazing, but the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality is proposing to reclassify the creek so that it no longer is labeled with an impairment. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)
Not everybody in the neighborhood is on the same page. A landowner survey appended to Wyoming DEQ’s analysis includes a statement from an unnamed person — their identity was redacted — who stated that fishing and camping take place there. 
“I see a lot of camping and picnicking and wading,” the landowner wrote. 
Wyoming DEQ is accepting feedback on its proposal until Oct. 22. Comments can be submitted through the agency’s electronic portal.  
Ratner, for one, won’t be weighing in. It’s not because he’s out of the country, dealing with broken ribs and nerve damage. After years of tussling with state authorities over livestock grazing’s impacts on water quality, he gave up the fight. 
“It was such a torrential downpour of effort to avoid complying with the Clean Water Act that I just gave up on Wyoming,” he said. “I just couldn’t take it.”

(Photo illustration by Clark Kauffman, Iowa Capital Dispatch, with receipt and signage from U.S. District Court filings)The Casey’s convenience-store chain is facing a potential class-action lawsuit alleging it overcharges consumers by advertising in-store discounts that aren’t applied to purchases at the cash register.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, names Casey’s Retail Co., Casey’s General Stores Inc., and Casey’s Marketing Co. as defendants. The companies operate more than 2,500 convenience stores in Iowa and 15 other states.
In court filings, Casey’s has yet to respond to the basic allegations in the lawsuit, but has asserted that if each of the chain’s 2,500 stores “failed to give just one $2.76 discount per day” from August 2023 to the present, the compensatory damages in the case would total $5,043,900.

In a written statement, a spokesperson for Casey’s said, “We are aware of the allegations and intend to vigorously defend against them. We will respond formally through the legal process.”
Attorneys for the plaintiff, Kit Mason of Allerton, are seeking class-action status for the lawsuit, alleging Casey’s uses in-store signage at store locations to promote product discounts that the stores then fail to apply to customers’ purchases.
Among the alleged examples cited in the lawsuit:
— On July 10, 2025, Mason visited a Casey’s store in Humeston, where the store promoted a “2 for $4” special on 24-ounce cans of Four Loko flavored alcoholic beverages. At the cash register, the lawsuit claims, Mason was charged $7 rather than $4.
— On July 20, 2025, Mason visited a Casey’s store in Corydon, where the store promoted a “2 for $6” special on 24-ounce cans of Smirnoff Ice alcoholic beverages. At checkout, Mason was allegedly charged $7 rather than $6.
— On Aug. 19, 2025, Mason visited a Casey’s store in Urbandale, where Blue Moon beverages that were normally priced at $3.50 and $4.29 were promoted through a discount that offered $3 off the combined purchase of any three 19-ounce cans. At the cash register, the $3 discount was not applied, the lawsuit claims.
Each of the in-store signs promoting the discounts allegedly state the “instant rebates” are “automatically given at register,” with no indication that membership in the Casey’s Reward Program is required.
While most of the alleged examples cited in the lawsuit pertain to alcoholic beverages, some are specific to food items, such as a “2 for $5” special on bagged candy. The lawsuit claims that at the cash register, the bags rang up at $5.99 each.
“Similar misleading in-store advertisements were present across the defendants’ network of stores …,” the lawsuit alleges, including but not limited to those in Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin.
According to the lawsuit, Casey’s competitors, such as Kum & Go, Kwik Trip and Kwik Star, have similar in-store promotions but their advertised sale prices are reflected in the customers’ final bill.
The lawsuit seeks damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, negligent misrepresentation, and unfair or deceptive acts.
The lawsuit also seeks an injunction barring Casey’s from “not applying the advertised discounts at the register as promised,” and prohibiting Casey’s from collecting taxes on the amounts that should have been discounted.
The lawsuit was originally filed in Polk County District Court before being moved this week to federal court.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Izaak Walton League of America’s Iowa division has started a grassroots campaign to raise funds for a water quality monitoring program, formerly funded by the state, at the University of Iowa.
The Iowa Water Quality Information System, or IWQIS, gives real-time measures of pH, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, discharge rates and temperature in streams across the state. But funding for the program was diverted by the state Legislature in 2023 and the system is poised to shut down if funding doesn’t come through by July 2026. 
Dale Braun, president of the Iowa Division of the Izaak Walton League of America, said the monitoring network plays a “vital role” in protecting public health and “environmental resilience” for rural and municipal water systems.

“Without it, Iowans lose transparency and accountability during a worsening water quality crisis,” Braun said in a news release. 
Larry Weber, director of hydroscience and engineering in the College of Engineering at UI, said the IWQIS program received about $500,000 from Iowa State University’s Nutrient Research Center, until the 2023 state budget for agriculture and natural resources diverted the funds. 
Weber said IWQS, which put out its own sensors and collected data from water quality sensors managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey, was the best collection of real-time water quality data in the state. 
“Not only in this state, but in any state,” Weber said. “What we’ve built here is really best in class in terms of water quality monitoring and information sharing.” 
Weber said IWQIS is often looked at as “telling the bad side of the story” because it highlights spots along Iowa streams that have high concentrations of nitrate, or other nutrients. But, he said, the monitoring also shows where water quality initiatives are making a difference and reducing the concentration of nutrients in Iowa waterways. 
Weber said the system was able to secure part-time funding through the Walton Family Foundation, which will keep it running until the beginning of July 2026. 
“If we’re not able to find replacement funding … the water quality information system will be shut down,” Weber said. 
The Izaak Walton League initiative aims to raise $500,000, which it said would keep the network running at its “most basic capacity.” Funding at $600,000, the news release noted, would allow the program to fully fund its operations while renewing equipment and supporting professional data work. 
“We’re very appreciative of what they’re doing,” Weber said of the Izaak Walton League campaign, noting it was independent of the UI department. “We would happily accept those funds to help our program.” 
At its peak, Weber said, the system put out about 60 sensors, which were complemented by the nearly 30 sensors USDA and USGS have on Iowa rivers. 
Right now, Weber said IWQIS has reduced the number of sensors it puts out to about 50 — if funding doesn’t come through, all of those sensors will be pulled, leaving just around 30 in place from the federal agencies. 
As part of the Gulf of Mexico hypoxia task force, Midwestern states, including Iowa, are meant to reduce the concentrations of nutrients entering the Mississippi River. 
Weber said as nitrate levels in Iowa streams continue to be high, as noted by the IWQIS data, the state is headed “in the wrong direction.” 
The fundraising efforts will be highlighted at the upcoming Iowa Nature Summit at Drake University. 
Neil Hamilton, the summit’s organizer, said the fundraising project is “critical.” 
“One of our core goals is to identify concrete actions Iowans can take to protect our natural resources,” Hamilton said in the news release with Izaak Walton League. “Funding the water monitors gives us the information needed to make smarter decisions about improving Iowa’s water quality.”

(Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Gov. Gretchen Whitmer reportedly told state employees in an email that their jobs would be unaffected by the ongoing state budget negotiations considering the Michigan Legislature has not yet passed a consensus budget into the mid-afternoon on Tuesday – the final day of the current fiscal year.
While the email, which was shared with Michigan Advance, projected confidence in a budget being completed soon, there were still rumors swirling that a continuation budget might be in order to keep the government open as plans are finalized in the coming days.
Gongwer News Service, a Lansing political newsletter and intelligence service, was first to report the existence of the email.
“As you woke up this morning, got ready, dropped your kids off at school, and went to work, I know you might be feeling a lot of uncertainty about the state budget,” Whitmer wrote. “You’re wondering what the daily churn of news means for you, your family, and your finances. I wanted to tell you directly about the work we’re doing to keep government up and running and pass a state budget as soon as possible.”
Whitmer said that the House and the Senate have an agreement to pass a full fiscal year budget, and that all state government operations would continue as normal on Wednesday, Oct. 1.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The governor, however, said that the government would stay open as the budget was finalized throughout the week, which signaled that lawmakers might not be done with negotiations or produce a final budget this evening.
No one in the state government has plainly said that the government planned to shut down tomorrow. 
The last time the government shut down was in 2007 and 2009, but only for a few hours because the respective chambers of the Legislature and then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm approved a continuation resolution of current year spending to keep dollars and operations flowing.
A message seeking comment from the Michigan State Employees Association was not returned at the time of publication. The president of UAW Local 6000, one of the largest state employee unions, told Michigan Public Radio that they received word from Whitmer that there will be either a budget deal or some short-term extension of the current budget to tide the state over.
Whitmer in the late afternoon on Tuesday was seen meeting with state Rep. Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton), the House minority floor leader, and state Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn), who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, as negotiations continue.

Susan Collins said. “The GAO has found seven instances in which the rescissions violate the act and it has standing to sue.”Collins, R-Maine, also told reporters that she doesn’t agree with the Supreme Court’s decision last week on its emergency docket that allows the Trump administration to cancel $4 billion in foreign aid. “I disagree with the Supreme Court's temporary decision, but it was not a decision that delved into the merits of the case,” Collins said. “That's yet to come.”Collins, one of the more vocal members of her party over preserving Congress’ constitutional power of the purse, said “Well, let’s see,” when asked if she expects the GAO, a government watchdog agency, would win a lawsuit over the Trump administration impounding funds. The GAO and White House budget office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Funds frozen for libraries, medical research, FEMARepublicans in Congress have been either supportive or relatively quiet about the Trump administration’s efforts to freeze or cancel funding approved by Congress. The GAO has cited the Trump administration for illegally impounding funding for electric vehicle charging, museums and libraries, Head Start, energy efficiency upgrades in K-12 schools, funding for medical research at the National Institutes of Health and funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., released a statement earlier this week rebuking the Trump administration’s actions after the GAO released its seventh impoundment decision. “Today, we have another stark reminder of how President Trump’s lawless assault on our spending laws is hurting real people in every part of the country—as funding is held up to address homelessness, prepare for disasters, and much more,” Murray wrote. “It is time for Republicans to join us in insisting that every last penny that is owed to the American people gets out to the American people.”",,,,2025-09-30 15:58:40.304926

U.S. District Judge William Young in Boston agreed with several university associations that the policy they described as ideological deportation violates the First Amendment as well as the Administrative Procedure Act, a law governing how federal agencies develop and issue regulations. Young also found the policy was “arbitrary or capricious because it reverses prior policy without reasoned explanation.”
“This case — perhaps the most important ever to fall within the jurisdiction of this district court — squarely presents the issue whether non-citizens lawfully present here in United States actually have the same free speech rights as the rest of us. The Court answers this Constitutional question unequivocally ‘yes, they do,’” Young, a nominee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, wrote.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Plaintiffs in the case welcomed the ruling.
“The Trump administration’s attempt to deport students for their political views is an assault on the Constitution and a betrayal of American values,” said Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors union. “This trial exposed their true aim: to intimidate and silence anyone who dares oppose them. If we fail to fight back, Trump’s thought police won’t stop at pro-Palestinian voices—they will come for anyone who speaks out.”
The ruling came after a trial during which lawyers for the associations presented witnesses who testified that the Trump administration had launched a coordinated effort to target students and scholars who had criticized Israel or showed sympathy for Palestinians.
“Not since the McCarthy era have immigrants been the target of such intense repression for lawful political speech,” Ramya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, told the court. “The policy creates a cloud of fear over university communities, and it is at war with the First Amendment.”
Lawyers for the Trump administration put up witnesses who testified there was no ideological deportation policy as the plaintiffs contended.
“There is no policy to revoke visas on the basis of protected speech,” Victoria Santora told the court. “The evidence presented at this trial will show that plaintiffs are challenging nothing more than government enforcement of immigration laws.”
John Armstrong, the senior bureau official in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, testified that visa revocations were based on longstanding immigration law. Armstrong acknowledged he played a role in the visa revocation of several high-profile activists, including Rumeysa Ozturk and Mahmoud Khalil, and was shown memos endorsing their removal.
Armstrong also insisted that visa revocations were not based on protected speech and rejected accusations that there was a policy of targeting someone for their ideology.
One witness testified that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Out of the 5,000 names reviewed, investigators wrote reports on about 200 who had potentially violated U.S. law, Peter Hatch of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations Unit testified. Until this year, Hatch said, he could not recall a student protester being referred for a visa revocation.

Among the report subjects was Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate Khalil, who was released last month after 104 days in federal immigration detention. Khalil has become a symbol of Trump’s clampdown on the protests.
Another was the Tufts University student Ozturk, who was released in May from six weeks in detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to the war in Gaza.
Young accused Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents of misusing their powers to target noncitizens who were pro-Palestinian in order to silence them and, in doing so, “intentionally denying such individuals (including the plaintiffs here) the freedom of speech that is their right.”
“Moreover, the effect of these targeted deportation proceedings continues unconstitutionally to chill freedom of speech to this day,” he added.
Young also criticized Trump in his 161-page ruling, suggesting he supported the policy, even though he may not have authorized its operation. “The facts prove that the President himself approves truly scandalous and unconstitutional suppression of free speech” on the part of two of his senior Cabinet secretaries, he wrote.
He went further, saying the policy targeting pro-Palestinian activists was part if a pattern in recent months in which Trump has “unapologetically increased his attack on First Amendment values.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Unknown.jpeg,,,2025-09-30 16:58:08.570424

The Delaware Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (DUHCDA)
is Effective Sept. 30, making significant changes!
 By George D. Rotsch, Publisher of Delaware LIVE
WILMINGTON — A sweeping overhaul of Delaware’s medical decision-making law takes effect Tuesday, September 30th, changing how families, health-care providers and patients handle treatment choices when someone lacks capacity to make their own decisions.
At the heart of the law is the advance directive  — a legal document that allows people to outline their wishes for medical care and designate someone to make health decisions if they cannot. An advance directive typically includes a living will describing what treatments a patient does or does not want, and a health-care power of attorney naming a trusted “Health Care Agent” to carry out those instructions.
“An advance directive is your voice when you can’t speak for yourself,” said Catherine B. Read, Esquire, a Certified Elder Law Attorney with Estate & Elder Law Services in Greenville, Delaware and member of the Special Needs Alliance®. “It helps families avoid conflict in a crisis and gives doctors clear guidance about what you want. Without one, decisions can be left to people who may not know your wishes or to a system that defaults to who the law provides. The new law is intended to enable more people to prepare an advance directive, and to express priorities and wishes for quality of life that guide decision-making when unforeseen medical circumstances arise or expressed instructions don’t fit the situation”
The Delaware Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (DUHCDA), effective Sept. 30, replaces the state’s previous Health-Care Decisions Act and makes the most significant changes to health-care directives and surrogate authority in decades. Lawmakers and advocates say the new rules are designed to give health-care providers more meaningful guidance, patients more autonomy, and families more clarity, and importantly, consider that family structures are much different today.  However, legal experts caution that uncertainty remains over how the very new law will be applied.
Major Changes in the Law

Capacity Presumed, With Exceptions
An individual is presumed to have the capacity to make health-care decisions unless a court rules otherwise or they are found to lack capacity by a physician, psychologist, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or licensed social worker.  This expands the number of people who can make this determination, as under past law a physician was required to determine incapacity. The new law also allows these determinations to be challenged in the Court of Chancery under newly established rules.
Optional Advance Directive Form
Delaware adopted a new optional form that allows a person to specify priorities and wishes for care in addition to treatment instructions. An important change in the new law is certain powers must  be expressly stated in the advance directive. These powers include the ability of the agent to arrange for admission to a nursing home or for mental health treatment, have access to medical records, and have flexibility in making health-care decisions. Without this language, health-care agents may struggle to carry out a patient’s wishes for admission to a nursing home, mental health treatment, or specific medical procedures.
The optional advanced directive form is required to protect the patient from abuse by ensuring that important decisions such as  nursing home placement or psychiatric care are clearly defined in writing.
Streamlined Execution
The law eliminates the state Ombudsman’s office as a required witness for directives executed in nursing homes, a step intended to reduce formalities and make planning easier.
Expanded List of Health-Care Agents
The surrogate list has been broadened beyond those named in a power of attorney or a spouse to include adult children, parents, cohabitants, siblings and adult grandchildren. Supporters argue that this change better reflects modern families, which often do not conform to traditional forms.
Advance Mental Health-Care Directives
For the first time, Delawareans are expressly authorized to create directives specifically addressing mental health treatment. These allow individuals to authorize or exclude experimental treatments and even specify that a care plan created while healthy cannot later be revoked during a period of crisis.

First-in-the-Nation Law
The DUHCDA is the first State in the nation to adopt the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act of 2023, meaning there is no precedent to guide attorneys, health-care workers or courts. The Delaware Court of Chancery only finalized its rules on the new law weeks ago, leaving uncertainty about how disputes will be handled in practice.
“This law is intended to encourage people to plan ahead and make it easier for them to do so,” said William W. Erhart, Esquire, another Certified Elder Law Attorney at Estate & Elder Law Services. . “But the law is new, and lawyers, health-care professionals, social workers, and those who serve vulnerable individuals in long-term care settings are still learning the details.”
Read advises seniors and families to take three immediate steps:

The first priority is to select a loving, trusted person as your health-care agent, clearly communicate your intentions, and maintain relationship with that agent so the agent will know how to advocate for you when you need it.
Ask your estate planning attorney whether your current advance health-care planning documents comply with the new law.
Make any adjustments needed to ensure your plan matches your wishes under the new law.

Concerns and Issues Raised
While the law passed without significant opposition, questions remain.
Authority and Oversight: Some medical professionals worry that capacity determinations by non-medical professionals, such as social workers, could create inconsistent outcomes.
Expanded Surrogate List: Elder Law attorneys note that including domestic partners, cohabitants and extended family may lead to disputes in high-stakes cases, potentially delaying urgent medical decisions.
Advance Directive Safeguards: Simplified witnessing requirements could make directives easier to complete, but may also increase the risk of confusion or misuse.
Mental Health Directives: Hospitals and psychiatric providers are awaiting detailed guidance on how to implement the new Advance Mental Health-Care Directive requirements, raising concerns about uneven adoption across facilities.
Patient Protections: Disability rights advocates warn that the law’s definition of decision-making capacity could be misapplied, particularly for patients with dementia or psychiatric conditions, leaving some vulnerable to unwanted decisions.
Implementation Gaps: Health-care facilities are required to update policies and staff training, but administrators say the lack of finalized state regulations creates uncertainty.
 
Related Legislation
Two companion bills also worth noting:

Senate Bill 83 expands the long-term care resident’s bill of rights to include domestic partners in visitation and room-sharing rights and prohibits discrimination based on protected class status.
Senate Bill 85 establishes a new Class A misdemeanor for endangering the welfare of a vulnerable adult is pending approval in the House of Representatives.

Preparing for Change
Certified Elder Law Attorneys urge Delawareans to review their existing directives now. DUHCDA’s combination of broader surrogate recognition, expanded mental health protections and streamlined execution requirements is expected to reshape how end-of-life and long-term care decisions are made across the state.
“This is the biggest change in decades to how Delawareans designate their healthcare wishes in advance and how those wishes are carried out,” Read said. “The sooner people understand that health-care institutions and long-term care settings may have new processes to implement the new Health-Care Decisions Act, the better families will be prepared to advocate for their loved ones. Individuals should review their advance health-care documents with their attorneys and make updates to ensure their health-care agents have the powers they need under the new law.”

(NCGA screenshot0A federal district judge ruled for the General Assembly in a redistricting lawsuit, saying Republicans did not create Senate districts in northeastern North Carolina that improperly dilute Black voting power. 
Two Black residents, Moses Matthews and Rodney Pierce, sued the legislature in 2023, arguing that the Republican-drawn state Senate map split eastern Black Belt counties in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. The plan deprives Black voters from electing a candidate of their choice, the lawsuit said. 
Republicans said they did not use racial data in drawing the election districts. 
“Today, the court confirmed the #NCGA was right not to use race in its redistricting process,” Senate leader Phil Berger said in a statement on X.  “The VRA can’t be weaponized to make up for the shortcomings of the Democratic Party. I am glad this latest attempt by partisan interests to undo our fair and legal Senate districts was rejected by the court.”
District Judge James Dever III pointed to the election of Sen. Dan Blue of Raleigh and US Rep Valerie Foushee to argue that successful Black politicians do not need to run in districts where a majority of voters are Black.
“The evidence demonstrates that legally significant racially polarized voting does not exist in North Carolina generally,” in northeast North Carolina, or in Senate districts that were the subject of the lawsuit, wrote Dever, a President George W. Bush appointee.
This is the second time Dever has ruled against Matthews and Pierce, who is now a state Representative. 
When they filed their lawsuit in 2023, their lawyers failed to convince Dever that the districts should be redrawn before the 2024 election. Tuesday’s order can be appealed. 
Voting in the state demonstrates polarization based on party rather than race, Dever wrote, with white voters choosing Republicans and Black voters choosing Democrats.

The 58th Sanderson Farms Championship, the 13th and apparently final with America’s third largest poultry producer as a sponsor, tees off Thursday at 7 a.m at Country Club of Jackson.
Mississippi’s only PGA TOUR Tournament, which faces a cloudy future, will feature a strong field of players, including an impressive list of golfers with Magnolia State ties.
With the golf world still buzzing over last weekend’s Ryder Cup matches, the Mississippi tournament will feature several players with Ryder Cup notoriety, including Denmark’s Rasmus Hojgaard, a member of this years victorious European team, and his twin brother Nicolai, who played on the victorious European team in 2023. The twins are the first brothers to ever win back-to-back on the DP World Tour and the first identical twins ever to play in the Masters together. They will be joined by Italian Francisco Molinari, vice captain of the European team and  a three-time Ryder Cup standout, who in 2018 became the first European player in history to win all five of his matches.
Otherwise, six-time PGA TOUR winner Max Homa, the top U.S. points winner in the 2023 Ryder Cup with a 3-1-1 record, will play at CCJ, along with Brandt Snedeker, a U.S. assistant coach, and a nine-time winner on the PGA TOUR.
The field will include five of the top 50 players in the world golf rankings, including No. 34 Akshay Bhatia, the top ranked player in the field. Bhatia made his professional debut at CCJ in 2019 at the age of 17.
Defending champion Kevin Wu, who set a scoring record last year, returns, along with a strong contingent of Missisippians, including:

Hattiesburg native Davis Riley, a two time PGA TOUR champion and winner of nearly $11 million in career earnings.
Tupelo’s Hayden Buckley, who has won on both the Korn Ferry Tour and PGA TOUR Canada.
Fulton native and former Mississippi State golfer Chad Ramey, a winner on both the Korn Ferry and PGA tours.
Former Ole Miss golfer Braden Thornberry, who won the 2017 NCAA Championship, and is a rookie on the PGA TOUR.
Former Ole Miss golfer Jackson Suber, a tour rookie already with over $1 million in earnings and three top 10 finishes.
Walnut native Kye Meeks, another former Ole Miss golfer and PGA TOUR rookie.
Ole Miss golfer Michael LaSasso, the reigning NCAA Champion, who is making his sixth PGA TOUR start while still an amateur.

The Sanderson Farms Championship field includes 28 players who have won PGA TOUR tournaments over the past two years.
The Sanderson Farms/Lyle Machinery Pro Am will be played Wednesday beginning at 7 a.m.
Since 2013 when then-Sanderson Farms CEO Joe Sanderson saved the tournament, the event has raised nearly $19 million for Children’s of Mississippi and additional $2.75 million for various Mississippi charities.
Players will be competing for $6 million in prize money and a first prize of $1.08 million.

Peach State residents can register to vote ahead of the Oct. 6 registration deadline by going online to the secretary of state’s website or by mailing a voter registration application to the secretary of state’s office. Residents can also fill out voter registration paperwork as part of the application for a Georgia driver’s license, and the state Department of Driver Services will transfer the application to the secretary of state’s office. 
Georgia voters who need to change or update their existing voter registration can do so online through the secretary of state’s My Voter Page tool.
The Nov. 4 election is set to include candidates for two seats on the state’s five-member Public Service Commission, the body that regulates utilities like Georgia Power and plays an important role in deciding how much Georgians pay for services like electricity and gas. 
In District 2, which spans a plethora of east Georgia counties, Democrat Alicia M. Johnson is aiming to unseat Republican incumbent Commissioner Tim Echols, who has been a member of the commission since 2011. In District 3, which encompasses Clayton, DeKalb and Fulton counties, Democrat Peter Hubbard will face off against incumbent Commissioner Fitz Johnson, a Republican who was appointed to the seat in 2021. The candidates are required to live in their districts, but the seats are elected statewide.
Notably, the November election will be the first time commissioners have faced voters since 2020. Regularly scheduled PSC elections were delayed after a 2020 lawsuit challenged the statewide electoral process and its impact on Black voters. The lawsuit is currently pending with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to attorney Bryan Sells, who represents the plaintiffs. 
The Public Service Commission election will be the only statewide office on the ballot this fall, but some cities and towns are also scheduled to hold municipal elections for offices like mayor, city council, and school board representatives.
But at least one notable election will not be on the Nov. 4 ballot: Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat who is running for governor of Georgia, recently announced that he is resigning from the state Senate to focus on his gubernatorial bid. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has set the special election to replace him for Nov. 18, meaning that voters in parts of Fulton and Cobb counties may have to go to the polls at least twice this election season.

Republican-led legislatures in Texas and Missouri have already approved new maps that could add six new GOP seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. Growing the historically slim party margin in Congress has been a priority for President Donald Trump, whose agenda could be stymied by a Democratic majority in the U.S. House.
California will put a new map before voters in November that could counter Texas’ maps, adding five new seats for Democrats. The fight over redistricting, which traditionally occurs once every ten years, has rippled into other states, including Utah, Maryland and Kansas.
Two of Indiana’s nine congressional seats are held by Democrats — one in northwestern Indiana and one in deep blue Marion County. Boundaries for Indiana’s congressional districts were last drawn in 2021.
The public records request from Count Us IN, filed under Indiana’s Access to Public Records Act, specifically mentions references to “federally funded programs, initiatives, projects or pending waivers that the White House has threatened to stall, delay, or cease if Indiana policymakers do not agree to redraw the state’s congressional maps.”

Previously, Republican leaders haven’t said if there have been threats to state funding.
“Hoosiers deserve to know what kind of pressure is being applied to state leaders and what’s at stake for our communities,” said Count Us IN founder Jalyn Radziminski. “Full transparency is the foundation of accountability, and we hope the Governor’s Office will be forthcoming about what Hoosier priorities may be held up or canceled if Indiana doesn’t cave to Washington’s whims.”
Braun on Sept. 23 told reporters he doesn’t think the state will lose federal funding if it doesn’t move forward.
“I really wouldn’t expect that that would probably occur. It’s just something that, why would you mess with a relationship where Indiana has been accruing a lot of benefits from it?”


Indiana law doesn’t require a speedy response to public records requests — only an acknowledgement within seven days, which was shared in the release.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A professor who Southeastern Louisiana University administrators pulled from a project looking into water pollution was removed for not completing her work on time, according to internal documents and interviews with university personnel. 
The researcher, Fereshteh Emami, an associate professor of chemistry, was removed from the Air Products Lake Maurepas Monitoring Project this summer. The decision sparked backlash against the university because Southeastern didn’t immediately explain her removal, creating speculation she was removed because of her findings or outside influences. Air Products is pursuing a carbon sequestration project that would store the gas under the lakebed. 
Fereshteh Emami (Photo: SELU)
But Emami’s research never implicated Air Products in pollution of the lake, and the university stands by her findings, which were published in two open-source academic journals, Environments and ACS Omega. Rather, documents and emails indicate  she was removed because she and researchers she supervised had fallen behind on sample analysis and stopped regularly visiting monitoring sites. Additionally, her boss claims she did not hire employees needed to complete the work and refused help from an administrator. 
Other documents show Emami made complaints against her bosses stemming from a late revision to her research budget and an administrator’s payment request that she felt crossed an ethical line.    
A little over a week after she learned of her removal, Emami received a letter from project director Kyle Piller, explaining his decision with a list of objectives and deadlines he said she failed to meet as a principal investigator on the project. At the time of her removal, Piller didn’t provide Emami with a reason for the decision. 
“Southeastern Louisiana University’s decision to remove you from the Air Products Contract–Grant are strictly related to project management and execution of the project in a timely manner,” the letter stated. 
The university denied the Illuminator’s public records request to see Piller’s letter, but Emami’s attorney William Most provided a copy of it and rebutted several of its claims.

“Almost a week after the university removed Dr. Emami from the project, she was told that the removal was for issues such as delays in data collection,” Most said. “It is implausible that this is the university’s true motivation: abruptly removing a project’s leader with no replacement does nothing to speed things up. We are working to determine the real reason for Dr. Emami’s removal and whether it is consistent with the university’s academic freedom principles and the law.” 
Over the past three years, Emami led a team of researchers who analyzed 400 water and sediment samples collected throughout Lake Maurepas. The results set off alarm bells in communities around the lake because they showed high levels of pollution and heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium and lead, among others. 
Emami hasn’t yet taken legal action over her removal. She remains employed as a tenured professor at Southeastern.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In an interview, Piller said he wanted to give her an explanation but believed it was against university policy. When public outcry intensified over news of Emami’s removal, Piller got permission to provide her the information, he said.
Southeastern has monitored Lake Maurepas since early 2023. Air Products plans to use carbon capture technology to trap emissions from its hydrogen plant in Ascension Parish and inject them about a mile underneath Lake Maurepas. Many community residents, advocacy organizations and political leaders have voiced strong opposition to the plan from the start. 
When the university refused to explain Emami’s removal, social media users began speculating without evidence that Piller and the university conspired with Air Products to suppress Emami’s research. Southeastern President William Wainwright called out the misinformation in a public message, and Piller criticized the Illuminator’s story on Emami’s dismissal for perpetrating a false narrative, which he described as impugning his reputation. 
At the time of publication, the Illuminator was aware of some of Emami’s disputes with coworkers and possible reasons for her removal but did not explore these reasons in its initial story. 
Factors for removal
Piller’s Aug. 4 letter to Emami detailed five factors that led to his decision to remove her. 
The first was that in meetings the previous year in which administrators expressed concern over her lack of progress and staffing, Emami told them she didn’t have enough time to manage the project, Piller wrote. One of the administrators offered to help manage her team, but she declined, Piller wrote. 
That administrator, Daniel McCarthy, then Southeastern’s dean of research, had offered to help Emami on a volunteer basis, emails show. Emami said she never refused his help and pointed to subsequent emails showing they collaborated for about two months until she noticed someone changed her research budget by adding a pay stipend for McCarthy.
In a recent interview, McCarthy said the added expense was the idea of Pat Moyer, then dean of the College of Science and Technology. Moyer insisted the research dean be paid a stipend from the project budget, McCarthy said. 
It’s not unusual for grants to include supplemental pay for researchers affiliated with the project, though Emami said she never approved this expenditure. The dispute continued through March when McCarthy submitted a pay request for dates and times Emami claimed he never worked. She returned the request with a note asking him for clarity but got no reply, so she met with the university provost to try to resolve the matter, records show.   
McCarthy said he wasn’t in that meeting and never saw Emami’s note, but he withdrew his pay request and his offer to help. 
“We had gone out of our way to help her,” McCarthy said. “We agreed I would take a fairly modest payment … Then she rejected it, and I backed off.”
McCarthy is now the college dean, having replaced Moyer, who left Southeastern over the summer. Moyer didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
‘Missed opportunity’
For the second point in his letter, Piller cited what he called a “severe delay” in Emami’s sampling and chemical analysis. 
He said her last completed water and sediment analysis was in December, noting Southeastern’s grant contract with Air Products requires the researchers to demonstrate adequate progress on data collection. 
Third, he cited three vacancies on Emami’s research team — one post-doctoral researcher and two full-time technicians. Funds were pulled from other budgets to help pay for the extra personnel, he wrote. 
“Dr. Emami did advertise the positions and had many applicants, but ultimately Dr. Emami never hired anyone,” Piller wrote.
When the Illuminator first interviewed Emami for a June 19 article about her research, she mentioned concerns about a statewide hiring freeze Gov. Jeff Landry ordered. Emami said she didn’t seek a waiver to the freeze because she believed it would take too long. Documents the Illuminator obtained from the Division of Administration showed it quickly approved waivers submitted by universities. Southeastern did eventually get a waiver, but the freeze still slowed down the hiring process, Emami’s attorney said .
Fourth, Piller referenced Emami’s absence from a May 22 meeting to discuss the project and Air Products’ funding modification. The company wanted Emami to perform more monitoring of the rivers that flow into Lake Maurepas. 
“All of the other principal investigators were in attendance, and Dr. Emami’s lack of a response or participation in the meeting is further evidence of her noncompliance on this project,” Piller wrote.

For his final point, Piller cited boat and vehicle logs from Southeastern’s Turtle Cove Research Station, located on Lake Maurepas, that showed little activity in the late spring and summer months. Most of the sampling locations are accessible only by boat. The logs, obtained through a public records request, show her team last checked out a boat on April 22 and last used a truck on July 16. 
Piller also said Emami was behind on analyzing animal tissue samples he and other researchers had collected. This analysis would’ve allowed them to determine if crabs and fish in Lake Maurepas were suffering from heavy metal poisoning as physiological signs on crab shells were indicating, he said in a phone interview. 
Emami said the student on her team trained to pilot the boat left Southeastern. She said bad weather derailed some of her site visits but said her sampling and analysis never stopped.
Chris Murray, a biologist and another principal investigator on the project, described his relationship with Emami as a “missed opportunity” to collaborate.
“It was not the same as with the other [principal investigators],” Murray said. “She was kinda removed. We called meetings and tried to share information, and I wasn’t getting much back.”
Piller offered a similar take. 
“She was sort of isolated, but I just want to be clear — we didn’t isolate her,” he said.
Emami said she was under stress during the spring semester from the situation with McCarthy. 
During that period, she exchanged several messages with a colleague at LSU for advice on how to handle the situation, telling him she felt pressured by the “power dynamics” of being asked to approve pay for a superior, emails show.  
“I am very uncomfortable with this situation,” she wrote to her friend.
Piller said he never addressed Emami’s work delays directly with her through any type of performance review or warning, and he acknowledged her removal may cause further delays but said it was in the long-term interests of the project. 
Grievance unrelated to removal
Emami was involved in a separate workplace dispute this year in which someone filed a grievance against her, though administrators said it wasn’t a factor that led to her removal from the Lake Maurepas project.
The grievance arose after Emami sent a curt email to another professor’s employee because the employee refused to hand over a fuel card to Emami’s research assistant.
Moyer found the employee’s refusal to hand over the fuel card in line with state policy. Although the employee requested the grievance be escalated, the provost closed it on July 3 without disciplinary action, according to emails shared by Emami’s attorney.
Emami was also scolded by an administrator for purchasing a vial of diluted uranium standard without proper approval. Uranium standards are used for calibrating lab equipment and do not emit harmful radiation.
Piller and McCarthy said Emami’s removal from the Lake Maurepas project had nothing to do with either incident. They said they had no direct knowledge of the grievance. 
Kelly Benjamin, spokesman for the Association of American University Professors, said Emami could use the grievance process to protest her removal and suggested she contact a local AAUP chapter to explore the option. 
She could also bring the matter to Southeastern’s Faculty Senate to which Emami was recently elected, though Alan Cannon, a math professor who chairs the senate, said the body can only make recommendations and has no authority to reverse her removal. 
Most, Emami’s attorney, said they plan to look into their options.
Another removal
Gary Shaffer, a biologist at Southeastern, was one of the original four principal investigators on the Lake Maurepas monitoring project until Piller removed him last year with“absolutely no warning,” he said. Piller told him his team’s annual report was too short and two weeks past his deadline, Shaffer said. 
“When our in-house report was late, Piller got annoyed because he had to edit it over Christmas break,” Shaffer said. 
Piller said he removed Shaffer for the same reason he removed Emami. 
“The work wasn’t coming in on time,” he said.
Matt Ginder-Vogel, a biogeochemist and director of the University of Wisconsin’s Sustainability Research Hub, said removing a principal investigator is typically only done in cases of research misconduct. He is not affiliated with Southeastern or its researchers, and he questioned whether any unstated reasons could be at play in Emami’s removal. 
“I’ve been in academics a long enough time to understand how petty the people can be,” Ginder-Vogel said.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Federal cuts to Medicaid and food stamps prompted New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to call a special session beginning Wednesday, but expiring health insurance tax credits are also on the agenda. 
The Affordable Care Act tax credits, created in 2021 for those who buy insurance on state-run healthcare marketplaces, will expire at the end of the year without congressional intervention. 
Democrats in the U.S. Senate, backed by Democratic governors, have been unable to persuade their Republican counterparts to extend them. The issue has become a sticking point in negotiations over the federal budget. 
As of Tuesday afternoon, the federal government appeared to be heading toward an Oct. 1 shutdown.
Read more below about what New Mexicans need to know about Enhanced Premium Tax Credits, the federal healthcare subsidy that could shut down the government.
What is the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit? 
The Enhanced Premium Tax Credit is an expanded version of a tax credit first created in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare legislation. 
Graphic designed by Patrick Lohmann for Source NM. Data provided by BeWellNM, NM HCA, OSI and KFF
The original Premium Tax Credit reduces premiums for certain healthcare customers who rely on state-run healthcare marketplaces, known as exchanges. The expanded version created in 2021 reduced premium costs further and also expanded the credit to customers who make more than 400% of the federal poverty level. 
New Mexico’s marketplace is called BeWellNM. Seventy-five thousand New Mexicans use it. 
Who is receiving the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit? 
According to BeWellNM, more than 65,000 New Mexicans receive the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit. Of them, about 6,300 recipients report income at 400% or more of the federal poverty level ($128,600 for a family of four.)
The EPTC recipients are among roughly 88% of 75,000 New Mexicans on the exchange who receive some form of federal or state subsidy. According to the New Mexico Office of the Superintendent of Insurance, 50% of customers pay less than $10 a month for coverage, thanks to the subsidies.
Who will be most affected if the credits expire?
Those making less than 400% of the federal poverty level will be unaffected by the expiration, a BeWellNM official told Source New Mexico in a statement Tuesday, because the state’s Health Care Affordability Fund will cover the loss of those tax credits. 
But  the 6,300 recipients who make above the income threshold will see the full brunt of the credits expiring, according to BeWell NM. Alex Sanchez, chief experience officer at BeWellNM, said at a roundtable last month with U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM) the majority of all New Mexico EPTC recipients are aged 50 to 70 and are therefore likely “medically fragile,” she said. 
The state insurance superintendent said last month that the HCA will provide up to $68 million to help BeWellNM enrollees afford increasing premiums. 
Those above the income threshold won’t be able to afford the full price of health insurance and will lose coverage, she predicts. 
As a result, those people will stop scheduling primary care appointments or other preventive care, leading to an even greater burden on a “strained” statewide hospital system, she said. 
How much will health insurance costs increase? 
The average premium for enrollees will greatly increase in 2026. The OSI, which approves proposed rate increases, announced last month that BeWellNM enrollees should expect an average premium increase of 35.7%.
Viara Ianakieva, the Life and Health Division director at the OSI, told Source New Mexico on Tuesday that rising healthcare premiums are an “issue nationwide.” She cited an increase in claims nationwide in 2024, along with rising health care costs and “uncertainty.”
How much do the tax credits provide?
That varies based on a lot of factors, but they are significant. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a calculator here. 
According to the calculator, a non-smoking couple aged 50 in Bernalillo County making 200% of the federal poverty level would receive $1,151 a month, or $13,809 a year, with enhanced premium tax credits. That covers 91% of the monthly cost for a “silver” health insurance plan, which offers a moderate level of coverage on the exchange. 
What can the Legislature do? 
The Legislature’s role in addressing the health insurance credits remains to be seen. Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) previously told Source NM lawmakers plan to appropriate about $177 million in order to try to prevent rising health insurance costs from a tax credit under the Affordable Care Act.

Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, speaks on the state House floor on Jan. 16, 2024. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Less than 24 hours before South Dakota lawmakers met last week to consider building a prison, one of them disseminated “shocking new revelations” in a press release.
“I have confirmed,” the press release said, “that the South Dakota Department of Corrections has been using your tax dollars to provide transgender cross-sex hormones to convicted criminals in prison.”
The release went on to accuse the department of “hiding” a policy that includes a treatment committee and payments to an “East Coast college professor” for gender dysphoria services.
The last-minute sabotage attempt didn’t come from a rogue lawmaker on the fringes of the 105-member Legislature. It came from Dell Rapids Republican Jon Hansen, the speaker of the state House of Representatives.
South Dakota lawmakers approve $650 million prison construction project in Sioux Falls

The late onset of Hansen’s sudden interest in prison health care was peculiar, to say the least. He could’ve dug up his information and shared his claims at any time during the last several years while he was participating in prison debates.
Hansen has been a state representative since before the planning to replace the 144-year-old penitentiary started gaining momentum in 2021, and he was a member of Gov. Larry Rhoden’s Project Prison Reset task force that met four times this year from April to July.
Hansen voted “no” during the past couple of years on bills to authorize planning, site preparation and funding for a men’s prison at a controversial site in rural Lincoln County. But when the prison task force came up with a new plan and voted in July to recommend a 1,500-bed prison at a maximum cost of $650 million in Sioux Falls, Hansen voted yes with all other task force members in attendance.
Earlier, between the task force’s first and second meetings in April, Hansen announced his 2026 campaign for governor with his running mate, House Speaker Pro Tempore Karla Lems, R-Canton.
Gov. Rhoden, who’s made a penitentiary replacement one of his top priorities, hasn’t declared himself a candidate to keep his job yet. He’s expected to run, which would pit him against Hansen and at least two other declared candidates for the Republican nomination: U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson and Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden. That’s why the political stakes were high last week when legislators traveled, at Rhoden’s invitation, to the Capitol in Pierre for a special session to consider the prison plan.
The bill’s legislative journey began in a committee that approved it by a vote of 13-2. Nobody was surprised when Hansen and Lems cast the two “no” votes, after Hansen’s “shocking new revelations” of the prior day. The bill then passed the Senate and House with little mention of those revelations, and Rhoden immediately signed the legislation into law.
Although Hansen’s surprise attack failed, some of his claims were true. The state does in fact pay an expert from Baltimore to consult with a committee and evaluate incarcerated people who seek gender dysphoria treatment. The expert’s last three annual contracts are viewable in the state’s online financial portal, OpenSD, including the current one for up to $48,353.76 worth of services this year. The state is required to offer those services, because courts have upheld inmates’ rights to gender-affirming care.
Those aren’t shocking revelations.
The shock is in the revelation that a legislative leader seeking the state’s top elected office tried, at the 11th hour, to derail an important public policy debate by drumming up fear about transgender people.
The hope is in the realization that it didn’t work.

However, if last year’s statistics repeat themselves this new cycle, it is likely that few Utahns are aware of that date.
With 38.25% of Utah 12th graders filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid form — widely known as FAFSA — the state had the second-lowest completion rate in the country, according to a survey by Sallie Mae, a financial institution that provides private student loans, and the market research consultant Ipsos.

“Filing early matters,” according to a news release from Sallie Mae. That’s because some aid is first come, first served. 
New data from the same survey shows that only 21% of families in the country know about the Oct. 1 applications start date, which could come at a cost since aid packages can include competitive grants, scholarships, work-study programs, federal loans, and state or school funding to pay for tuition, housing, meals, books, or other expenses. 
According to the survey, during the 2024-2025 academic year, undergraduate students nationwide spent an average of $30,837 on higher education, a 9% increase from last year, when they reported spending $28,409 on average. 
The typical family covered about 38% of those expenses with parents’ incomes and savings. But, 27% of college funding came from scholarships and grants, 11% from parent borrowing, and 12% from student borrowing.
According to the study, “40% of undergraduate families did not use scholarships in (academic year) 2024–25. Among them, a striking 70% did not even apply. The leading reasons families didn’t pursue scholarships include lack of awareness (34%) and a belief that the student won’t win (28%).”
The new FAFSA is easier to complete, the release says, but still 58% of families have reported needing help with it. Resources about the process are available online on the Utah System of Higher Education website.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)A selection committee has settled on seven finalists for three open Ethics Commission seats, narrowing down the pool from 39 applicants.
The finalists are:

Nicole Bredahl, a Fargo attorney
Patrick Frise, a University of North Dakota law student and former Ethics Commission intern
Jared Huibregtse, a Mandan resident and project manager for an engineering firm
Jenna Mueller, a Fargo nonprofit leader
Murray Sagsveen, a Bismarck attorney and current Ethics Commission member
Pamela Sharp, a Bismarck consultant and former director of the North Dakota Office of Management and Budget
Mark Western, a Fargo attorney

The new commissioners will be selected based on a consensus vote of Gov. Kelly Armstrong, Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, and Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo.
Interviews will start Friday afternoon from 12:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. at the North Dakota Capitol in Bismarck. They will be open to the public, according to the North Dakota Governor’s Office. 
The seven names were selected based on lists of favorite candidates that selection committee members provided to the Governor’s Office at a Sept. 23 meeting, Hogan said. Names that appeared on at least two committee members’ lists were picked as finalists. The finalists were not discussed or announced during the meeting.
After the application window closed, the committee asked applicants to answer eight questions about their qualifications, how they perceive the role of the commission in state government and what kinds of policies they think the board should implement.
Ethics candidates to face questions on agency’s role in North Dakota government

Twenty-five advanced for consideration after two applicants withdrew their names and 11 did not submit responses to the committees’ questions. Another applicant was determined to be ineligible.
The seven finalists have varied backgrounds, though many work in the legal field. They also have different perspectives on the Ethics Commission’s purpose, according to their responses to the selection committee’s questions obtained by the North Dakota Monitor. 
Some applicants expressed that they don’t believe the commission has the authority to hand down punishments to people found to have violated ethics rules. Applicants disagreed on whether the commission has a responsibility to educate the public about government ethics.
Multiple finalists also said that the commission needs to do more to clearly define its role in state government.
Some applicants acknowledged the friction between the Ethics Commission and the executive and legislative branches of the state government. The governor and Ethics Commission have been openly at odds over the role of the regulatory agency.
There are three open commission seats. One applicant will be selected to fill the term of former chair Dave Anderson, who died in May. 
Ethics Commission highlights time management in annual report

Two other seats are open after the terms of Sagsveen and Commissioner Ward Koeser ended at the end of August. Both will stay on the commission until the search committee announces their successors. Sagsveen is seeking to be reappointed to a four-year term.
The Ethics Commission was created through a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2018. It’s tasked with enforcing ethical behavior in the areas of elections, lobbying, corruption and transparency. It is not part of the executive, legislative or judicial branches of the North Dakota government.
Commissioners’ duties include adopting ethics rules, investigating alleged violations and issuing advisory opinions to help public officials navigate ethical issues. They are paid a stipend for every day they meet, plus reimbursement for travel.

A $625 million coal spending package, along with more deregulation, will cost ratepayers and result in more deadly emissions, critics say.
The post Gordon cheers Trump’s coal revival plan while environmentalists warn of disaster appeared first on WyoFile .","Citing the power demands of a global artificial intelligence race, the Trump administration on Monday underscored its mission to revive and expand the U.S. coal industry to help meet the data industry’s enormous forecast for electricity. 
Federal agencies will slash more regulations, open 13.1 million federal acres to coal leasing and spend $625 million on various coal initiatives, including one to “retrofit” old coal plants that might otherwise be retired, according to the administration.
“Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a prepared statement. “These funds will help keep our nation’s coal plants operating and will be vital to keeping electricity prices low and the lights on without interruption.”
Wyoming, its coal communities and electric ratepayers are among the primary benefactors of the administration’s suite of actions to “unshackle” the industry from the “anti-coal” policies of the Biden administration, said Gov. Mark Gordon, who joined top administration officials in D.C. on Monday to celebrate Trump’s coal revival package.

Seated next to him are Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and Under Secretary of Energy Preston Griffin III. Behind Gordon is Sen. John Barrasso. (Gov. Mark Gordon’s office)
“Instead of talking about restricting, limiting, regulating our energy, we want to make sure it’s appropriately managed,” Gordon told reporters Tuesday morning during a virtual press conference. “But at the same time, we’re not going to use regulation to try to curtail or stymie any particular type of production.”
The coal industry’s dramatic 15-year slide has cut Wyoming production by nearly half, coinciding with the retirement of aging power plants, a shift to natural gas-fired electric generation and increasingly price-competitive wind and solar energy. 
Those market shifts, however, were unduly influenced — at least in part — by punishing regulations on coal and tax incentives that obscured the actual competitiveness of renewables, Gordon said.
President Donald Trump’s coal initiatives will help level the playing field, he said, and provide the coal industry an opportunity to “upgrade” technologies such as coal-carbon capture while bringing down the cost. To date, the technology remains too costly and, if installed on an existing coal plant, would sap electrical output by up to 30%, according to Wyoming utilities.

“Some of the [federal coal] grants will go to those technologies, so we’ll continue to work on that,” Gordon said, responding to a WyoFile question. “You’re right, some of these plants are decades old, and there’s been a view that we’re going to [phase out coal], so [there’s not been enough investment] in that. This is an opportunity to reinvest and be able to equalize those costs over time.”
Conservation groups, however, say the Trump administration is waging a war on renewable energy while placing a risky bet on coal that threatens public health and environmental safety.
“There’s no such thing as clean coal,” Center for Western Priorities Policy Director Rachael Hamby said in a prepared statement. “This announcement is just a plan to pollute more and rip off taxpayers while insisting that power companies use a more expensive fuel that they don’t even want.”
Earthjustice vowed to “continue to take the administration to court to oppose unlawful actions to prop up coal at the expense of the American people,” according to a statement by the group.
“Clean energy and other climate solutions are driving significant growth in our economy, but this administration is choosing to throw its weight behind fossil fuel industries and stymie progress,” Earthjustice Vice President of Litigation for Climate and Energy Jill Tauber said in a prepared statement.
Asked about the near-term carbon-emission implications of extending the use of coal-burning power plants, Gordon said, “I think, probably, the answer is fairly clear: There’ll be more CO2 production.
“It’s also pretty clear,” Gordon continued, “that just doing renewables did not stop that, and I think that’s the reason why this [carbon capture technology] is so exciting to continue … to be able to develop the technology to do a better job of being able to manage our carbon emissions.”Click this U.S. Department of Energy link to learn more about the Trump administration’s coal funding package.

(Photo by Brian Venua/KMXT)In an executive order, President Donald Trump announced he would hike the price of H-1B work visas, which used to cost about $5,000. Those visas will now cost $100,00 per person, per year, according to the new executive order.
H-1B visas are generally used to fill high-skill jobs, like nurses, and allow for longer careers in the U.S. by providing a path to permanent residency, like a green card. In recent years, H1B visas have become increasingly popular for Alaska schools to hire teachers from abroad.
But there’s concern that many Alaska school districts can’t afford the price hike.
“With a pen stroke, we possibly have ruined the future of education for Alaska students,” said Cyndy Mika, the Kodiak Island Borough School District’s superintendent. She said she texted that to another superintendent in Alaska after she heard the news this weekend.
“I can’t imagine what our classes would look like without our classes would look like without those international teachers filling the need.”
There are over 30 teachers in Kodiak’s school district who were hired abroad, many of whom currently hold H-1B visas. And earlier this year, Mika organized a recruiting trip to the Philippines for administrators representing the Nome, Bering Strait, and Kenai Peninsula school districts.
Districts across the state have faced shortages for teaching staff and struggled to fill positions with domestic hires, including from the Lower 48. For some, international hiring efforts are a sort of stopgap measure to ensure classrooms and kids’ needs are met.
Much of the justification outlined in Trump’s executive order, however, targets large information technology firms. But immigration lawyers, like Anchorage attorney Margaret Stock, say multiple industries – like Alaska’s public education system – are collateral damage.
“It’s been complete chaos since last Friday,” Stock said.
She said Alaska’s university system, healthcare, accounting, and financial service, and tourism sectors all use H-1B visas, too. And Trump and his team haven’t had consistent messaging about how they might be affected.
“It’s hard to figure out what to do when the president issues a proclamation that is then contradicted by everybody who works for the president,” said Stock. “It’s just hard to advise clients.”
She’s seen the White House and various federal agencies issue conflicting statements surrounding the new H-1B fees. A staffer with Sen. Dan Sullivan’s office said via email on Tuesday that previously approved visa applications won’t be subject to the new fees. Mika’s heard something similar from the school district’s legal team.
But it’s unclear what final decisions will be made.
“They seem to be motivated mainly by collecting a lot of money from people, but they didn’t even roll out a way to pay this $100,000 per person fee,” Stock said.
Mika said she’s already working with Alaska’s congressional delegation to find some kind of solution for Kodiak and other school districts.
U.S. Rep. Nick Begich III, who was in Bethel last week, said he’s already brought up how important internationally hired teachers are with the Trump administration.
“I do support the ability to bring in J-1 and H-1Bs to support as a supplement to local Alaskans and Americans generally,” Begich said on a visit to KYUK in Bethel on Tuesday. “The education workforce in rural Alaska – we know it’s a hard job to fill and when you’ve got positions that go unfilled, it means kids are going uneducated.”
Staffers for U.S. Senators Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski both also said via text and email on Sept. 23 that there’s a lack of clarity and want schools to have the resources they need.
For now, the consensus is that everyone’s waiting for more details from the White House.

One attendee of the rally, Katie DaCruz, is a former school psychologist at Godfrey-Lee Public Schools who was laid off weeks into this school year along with other administrators and staff. One of the main reasons cited, she said, was the budget uncertainty. 
“They tried to keep cuts away from the classroom as much as possible. But ultimately, when teachers are less supported, they’re less able to support their students as well,” she told the Advance. “It’s going to have an impact on students.”

Another demand of the groups was maintaining funding for programs designed to support mental health, especially for at-risk students. Emily Busch, a mother of a survivor of the school shooting in Oxford, Mich. in 2021, called it a “moral responsibility” to keep that funding in the state’s budget.
“We saw last year the state step in and invest $300 million for mental health in our schools. That was a step in the right direction, and today I implore you: keep those funds in the budget,” Busch said. “Because make no mistake, cutting at-risk and mental health funding does more than just shrink line items. It makes us less able to intervene early, to see a student struggling, to connect a child in crisis to help, exactly when it matters most.”

No budget has yet been signed, though the Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced last Thursday that they had reached a deal. State Rep. Regina Weiss (D-Oak Park) and state Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) both told the crowd that they had not seen any final text of the budget as of the start of the noon event. 
“We are now in the last few hours of passing a massive budget, and our representatives don’t know what’s in it or what they’re going to be asked to agree to, is unacceptable and undemocratic,” said Rachelle Crow-Hercher, director of the Michigan Education Justice Coalition after the event. 
Dr. Tonya Whitehead, president of the Michigan PTA, though, said she was “cautiously optimistic” about a budget deal.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s largest health care system, Brown University Health, is poised to grow even larger by acquiring a 500-physician practice and taking on 40,000 new primary care patients over the next four years.
The latter is not just a promise but a requirement, set by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha in exchange for allowing the merger of Brown University Health and Brown Physicians Inc. to proceed. The terms of the new, seven-page agreement were unveiled at a press conference at Neronha’s office Tuesday.
State regulators began reviewing the plan last fall to ensure compliance with state and federal laws meant to protect trade and ensure competition in the marketplace. Would the joining of the state’s largest hospital operator and the 500-physician practice — which despite similar names are unrelated and independent from each other  — violate  antitrust protections? Neronha decided it didn’t matter.
“If you’re asking everyday Rhode Islanders what they care about, they want to see a doctor,” Neronha said Tuesday. “They don’t care about Brown Health being too big.”
That’s why Neronha suspended the state investigation and granted the two health care entities the green light to merge in exchange for a series of conditions meant to soothe the state’s primary care crisis. Chief among them: taking on 40,000 new primary care patients by the end of 2029, and making “best efforts” to see new patients within 14 days of calling for an appointment. 
“If you’ve called around trying to get a new patient appointment over the last several years, you know how difficult it is to get an appointment within 14 days,” Neronha said. “If you’ve been able to accomplish that, you should go play the Powerball.”
Analysis by Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School suggested 343,000 people in Rhode Island don’t have a primary care provider. That was before the June closure of Anchor Medical Associates, which left another 25,000 people without primary care physicians or pediatricians. 
The Federal Trade Commission already granted its own approval for the acquisition, issuing a decision on Sept. 26 to not challenge the transaction. The deal is expected to close Oct. 1.

27 more primary care providers
The additional 40,000 patients will bring the health system’s patient roster to 231,7000, a little less than one-fifth of the state population. The bulk of them,152,000, are Brown University Health patients, while Brown Physicians serves 39,000 patients.  
To treat them all, Brown University Health will hire at least 27 more primary care providers over the next four years. The health care system has already determined a pay scale for its new health care workers as part of negotiations, which is referenced in the agreement with the AG but not available for public view.
The hiring commitment comes with an estimated $4 million annual cost along with a one-time $20 million capital investment to bring the electronic medical records for Brown Physicians Inc. in sync with those of the health care giant’s existing 1,000-physician network. 
The doctors at Brown Physicians, a nonprofit specialty practice founded eight years ago by faculty at Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School, already work side-by-side with their Brown University Health counterparts in primary care and hospital settings, and on academic and research endeavors. 
Making the two halves a whole will make it easier for doctors to work together and care for their patients, said Dr. Angela Caliendo, president of Brown Physicians Inc. Caliendo is also the Warren Alpert Foundation Professor of Medicine and Executive Vice Chair of Medicine at Alpert Medical School of Brown University.
“Really, the merger is all about driving better patient experiences and better patient outcomes,” Caliendo said. “The more fragmented we are, the more difficult this is for us to accomplish.”
And, the more difficult it is to compete with health care systems in neighboring states like Massachusetts, which have already successfully lured away many Rhode Island’s medical providers due to higher reimbursement rates.










If you’re asking everyday Rhode Islanders what they care about, they want to see a doctor. They don’t care about Brown Health being too big.


– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha


John Fernandez, president and CEO of Brown University Health, lamented the problems with Rhode Island’s low reimbursement rates in finding and keeping health care workers.
“People are coming after the doctors in our state every day, twice on Sundays,” Fernandez said. “You can’t have a disorganized health care system if you want to compete.”
Nor can you compete on slim or negative profits, a recurring problem for Brown University Health during and after the pandemic saw rising expenses for labor, supplies and drugs. A 2024 partnership between Lifespan Corp. and Brown University that coincided with the rebrand as Brown University Health brought temporary relief to its bottom line.
But the system returned to the red after its $175 million purchase of a pair of Massachusetts hospitals last year, which have not performed as well as initially expected. Brown University Health lost $32.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, ending June 30, according to its most recent earnings release, dragged down by too few patients at St. Anne’s Hospital in Fall River, Morton Hospital in Taunton, and associated physician groups. Its Rhode Island business ended the three-month period with a $28.4 million profit — up 68% over a year ago.
Yet it was Rhode Island health care facilities and services — including the acclaimed Newport Hospital birthing center — that were put on the chopping block by the health care system earlier this summer. Amid strong public backlash, company executives agreed to keep the award-winning labor and delivery unit open and funded through the upcoming fiscal 2026 year which starts Oct. 1. The health system committed to creating a birthing center task force, now expected to be formed by late October or early November, Sharon Torgerson, a spokesperson, said in an email Tuesday.
However, other cuts remain on the table, including inpatient psychiatry at Rhode Island Hospital.
The new agreement with the AG’s office, and associated costs, will not change the one-year funding pledge for the birthing center, along with similar commitments to maintain behavioral health services through Gateway Healthcare and Samuel Sinclair Dental Care, Fernandez said Tuesday.
But the promise has an expiration.
“If we continue to have economic problems, we will be forced into tough decisions about which programs we have,” Fernandez said. He specifically called out the federal budget cuts for hospitals and health care providers, and the federal administration’s rescission of public health research grants, as “not helpful.”
A ‘real transformative moment’
Neronha acknowledged mandated hiring and patient intake was no panacea for the health care crisis facing Rhode Island. There’s no guarantee the new doctors hired by Brown University Health won’t come from other health care practices in Rhode Island, for example. And patients clamoring for a doctor won’t get in tomorrow. A system that can take 40,000 more people will take a full four years to develop, said Dr. Babar Khokhar, president of Brown Health Medical Group and chief physician officer for Brown University Health.
Nonetheless, Khokhar praised the marriage of the two physician groups as a “real transformative moment” for health care in Rhode Island.
Brown University Health will be required to meet incremental benchmarks in hiring and adding patients over the four-year period, with twice-yearly reporting of its progress to the AG’s office, along with other metrics on payroll spending, recruitment efforts and wait times for new patients.
“We want to know how it’s going,” Neronha said. “If we have to push them, we will.”










People are coming after the doctors in our state every day, twice on Sundays. You can’t have a disorganized health care system if you want to compete.


– John Fernandez, CEO of Brown University Health


And if the health care system fails to meet the terms by the 2029 deadline, there will be consequences — restarting the state review of antitrust violations, or even legal action to undo the merger, Neronha said.
While Neronha and Fernandez exchanged multiple handshakes and warm smiles over the course of the hourlong press conference, the negotiations that got them to this moment were not so collegiate.
“We didn’t sit down over coffee to work this out, did we John?” Neronha asked Fernandez.
“I wish we had,” Fernandez replied.
“It was pretty intense,” Neronha concluded.

Phil Murphy signed a bill Tuesday adding Latino and Hispanic history as a requirement in the state's learning standards. (Courtesy of the New Jersey Governor's Office)New Jersey students will learn Latino and Hispanic history under a bill Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law Tuesday.
The law requires the State Board of Education to adopt new social studies learning standards that include sections on Latino and Hispanic history and calls on local school boards to insert lessons on the same in their curriculums.
“Through today’s bill signing, we are cementing the legacy of New Jersey’s Latino and Hispanic communities,” Murphy said in a statement. “By teaching students about their neighbors, we are raising a more informed next generation of future leaders in the Garden State.”
The law, which cleared the Senate in a unanimous vote and saw a single no vote in the lower chamber from Assemblyman Sean Kean (R-Monmouth), requires the Department of Education to provide sample learning activities that could be used to implement the requirement, which applies from kindergarten to 12th grade.
The lessons could appear as early as the 2026-2027 school year.
“By integrating Latino and Hispanic American history into the core curriculum, we acknowledge the ever-evolving diversity of America and affirm the need for an education system that is not only equitable in knowledge but also instills pride in all of its students,” said bill sponsor Assemblyman Julio Marenco (D-Hudson).
The instruction requirement is the latest in a series enacted by New Jersey lawmakers. Other statutes require education on the contributions of LGBT people, the history and contributions of Black Americans, and instruction on the Holocaust.
The state’s student learning standards also require instruction on civics and diversity and inclusion.
“Representation matters, and as New Jersey’s Latino population continues to grow, it’s important that our students learn a history that reflects the diverse voices and contributions that make up our state and nation,” said Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), who represents Newark. “In my district, this growth is part of our daily life.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/32914797248_5f455889b5_c.jpg,,,2025-09-30 14:58:04.211018

You can read more about the section here.

As a parent with two children in public schools, I attended the recent public hearing of the Select Legislative Committee on School Choice held at the state Capitol.
The meeting was standing room only as the committee heard testimony from researchers who were school choice advocates. I wanted to ask a rather simple question, how is “school choice” a real answer to what the proponents of school choice are saying is the problem they are trying to solve – too many (black and brown) students “trapped” in failing schools?
The presenters posited school choice, such as allowing parents to choose from a variety of educational options by making public tax dollars available to parents to fund their children’s education in any format or context the parents deem is best for their children, as a solution. In this perspective, where is the real solution for children and families in so-called “failing” schools?

I am disheartened by the rhetoric around school choice in our state. The support for “school choice” has proven to be little more than an ages-old scheme from some political leaders in our state to funnel public money into private, segregated schools. I wonder if supporters really think that creating educational vouchers and tax credit schemes will really solve the challenge of children being taught in “failing” schools? What are the real choices parents have if their children are “trapped” in a “failing” school?
The presenters suggested that they could take the proposed voucher, which would be worth about $8,000.00, and hire a tutor or enroll their children in “micro-schools” where a small group of families contract with a teacher to teach children in small classes of five to 10 students
The presenters also suggested private tutors, homeschooling, or even using the voucher to pay full tuition and cost of attendance to a yet to be opened private school that would cater to the needs of these children and only charge about $8,000.00 per year. I cringe at thinking about the quality of education that could be offered by such a school.
Ultimately, the funding schemes proposed would siphon much needed tax dollars from our already underfunded public schools and into a variety of educational contexts (including private schools that have origins in our dark, segregationist past) with little to no accountability for how those dollars would be spent. 
Why would any citizen see this school funding system as a better way forward for our state? None of the alternatives suggested would make much practical sense for the families that are said to be targeted by these “reforms.”
Nor does there seem to be a real citizen demand for a “school choice” reform law that calls for tax dollars to be given directly to parents rather than schools that are proven to be making great gains in educating our children.
Are the public schools perfect? Of course not.
Reforms are needed to help families who are in communities where the schools are rated as “failing.” The most important reform being fully funding the schools in those communities, not subjecting them to less resources for the neediest children. 
One glaring reality that was not mentioned one time in the hearing was the impact that poverty has on schooling. What is seen mainly as a failing school cannot be divorced from the concentrated poverty that is evidenced in most of the communities in which failing schools are located.
Poverty’s impact of academic skill development in children is well documented but often overlooked in school policy debates. The assumption is that all children can learn if the schools “just did a better job” with the resources already given to them.
While teaching and learning can always improve, the biggest factor in the academic skill development of children is the social economic class of their family and community.
It is no coincidence that the highest rated schools in Mississippi are in the most affluent communities.This isn’t because they all have better teachers and leaders in schools, or innately “smarter” children, but because the children in these communities are advantaged by access to more resources such as healthcare, more community support, better educated parents and networks, and safe, more stable homes and communities. These social economic factors weigh heavily in the academic skill development of all children.
If a school is over-concentrated with children living in poverty, due mainly to residential segregation, it is much harder to provide children with the educational experiences and support they need to actualize their full potential. 
Yes, we all want every child to have access to the best education that works for them and helps them fulfill their dreams and potential. We can disagree on the ways to make this happen, but we cannot step backward as a state and allow for the most advantaged to gain even more resources at the expense of the least advantaged in our communities.
Public schools are a part of the commitment we make to provide all citizens with the tools they need to live the best life they can, with the responsibilities of freedom, as they pursue the happiness that makes life enjoyable. When we do this, we enhance the quality of life and affirm the humanity of everyone.
A “school choice” scheme that further divests in the humanity of some of our children is a pathway to an even more segmented society that history has taught us doesn’t help us grow as a state.

Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet heartily voted Tuesday to give a pricey parcel owned by Miami Dade College to a Trump family foundation for a future library honoring President Donald Trump.
The unanimous vote by DeSantis and the Cabinet, augmented by their crowing praise of the 47th president, officially approved the transfer of the $66 million real estate from the state-run college to the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Foundation, led by Trump’s son, son-in-law, and lawyer.
“President Trump has a great story to tell as a Florida resident, and I think it’s quite fitting that we house it … as Miami becomes kind of the capital of the world in many respects,” said James Uthmeier, the state’s Attorney General. DeSantis and Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia echoed the acclaim, lauding Miami Dade as the first state college to potentially house a presidential library.
These officials are elected statewide independent of Florida’s governors and help shape policy in a range of areas, including public lands.
Although the White House had stayed largely quiet about the library’s location after the Miami Dade College Board of Trustees unanimously approved the property transfer last week, Eric Trump, executive vice president of Trump’s library foundation, took to social media to thank the Florida officials for their resounding support.
“Consistent with our families [sic] DNA, this will be one of the most beautiful buildings ever built, an icon on the Miami skyline — rest assured it will not look like President Obama[‘s] ‘prison like structure,'” the younger Trump wrote. He heads the foundation alongside Tiffany Trump’s husband, Michael Boulos, and James Kiley, a Trump attorney.
The 2.63 acre parcel belonged to Miami Dade College as an employee parking lot for its Wolfson Campus.
It neighbors the Freedom Tower, declared an historical landmark for its role in sheltering Cuban refugees in the 1960s, and the Miami Heat’s basketball arena, located on Miami’s expensively iconic Biscayne Boulevard.

If Minnesota doesn’t take steps to voluntarily rectify the alleged Title IX violations within 10 days, the state will face “imminent enforcement” that could jeopardize federal funding.  
The civil rights offices for the federal education and health and human services departments issued the joint noncompliance finding Wednesday, which states the Minnesota Department of Education and the Minnesota State High School League are violating Title IX by allowing males to compete in girls’ sports and occupy female locker rooms.
Previously, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison issued a formal legal opinion that states barring trans athlete participation would violate the Minnesota Human Rights Act. 
Ellison also sued the Trump administration over its anti-trans executive orders, arguing in his suit that the administration can’t rescind federal funding under Title IX because doing so violates state sovereignty. 
The Minnesota State High School League earlier this year announced that it would not comply with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump barring trans athletes from competing, because Minnesota’s anti-discrimination laws prohibit discrimination based on gender identity. 
U.S. Department of Education’s Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor issued a scathing statement Wednesday: “For too many years, Minnesota’s political leadership has found itself on the wrong side of justice, common sense and the American people. Now the Minnesota Department of Education and the Minnesota State High School League find themselves on the wrong side of Title IX by allowing males to compete in women’s sports,” he said.
Minnesota must now take steps as part of a “resolution agreement” or risk losing funding: changing policies “permitting males to compete in girls’ sports”; restoring “female athletes all records and titles misappropriated by male athletes competing in female categories”’ and requiring all federally funded entities that participate in Minnesota athletic programs “to adopt biology-based definitions of ‘male’ and ‘female.’”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lindamcmahon_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 14:58:04.211018

A Coast Guard plane carrying several dozen people in immigration custody landed in Alaska in early June.
Several of the men said that they didn’t have bathroom access on the plane — or even seats. They flew shackled in the cargo area of the plane.
They’d been transferred from the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington, to the Anchorage Correctional Complex, a facility run by the state Department of Corrections.“From that moment on, I personally felt dehumanized,” said one man who kept a journal from the experience.
Capital & Main is not identifying him or several other people in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement due to retaliation concerns.
Transfers of people in ICE custody between facilities are becoming more and more common under the Trump administration. According to an ICE Flight Monitor report from Human Rights First, transfer flights from January through August increased 43% compared with the same time period last year.
“These frequent transfers not only disorient individuals but also make it significantly harder for them to access legal counsel and maintain contact with family,” the report says.
ICE and the Alaska Department of Corrections did not respond to requests for comment. GEO Group, the private prison company that runs the Tacoma facility, deferred to ICE.
Luis Peralta, who was transferred from Miami to Tacoma, told Capital & Main that officers did not allow him to bring his personal documents with him when they moved him. That meant that he didn’t have access to any phone numbers for family members — his mother’s had been written on a piece of paper in his belongings at the Miami facility.
That also meant he hadn’t been able to reach the attorney that his family found for him, he said. Peralta, who has been in the U.S. since he was a child and was arrested by ICE outside his home in Miami, said he hoped to fight to stay in the U.S. because he has several children here and provides for them.
“Hopefully we don’t get transferred again,” Peralta said. “Being transferred is like the worst experience that anybody could go through.”
He said that during the transfer, officials didn’t tell the group where the plane was headed until they had been flying for several hours. Each man received a piece of bread and cheese and a bottle of water as the only sustenance for the entire day, he said.
Their wrists, ankles and waists were shackled together, he said.
“If something malfunctions in the air, there’s nothing you can do about it,” he said. “It’s very, very, very scary.”
Another man transferred from Miami said that ICE transferred him after a judge approved his request for bond so that he could get out of custody.
“It was like a strategic move,” the man said. “I went to court. The judge approved me for a bond, and literally two days later I was here.”
He said a judge in Tacoma later denied him bond.
“I don’t see like it’s fair to us as human beings to just be shipping us around the country like this,” the man said. “I’m on the other side of the country away from my family. My family can’t come visit me.”
When guards informed men in one of the housing units at Northwest ICE Processing Center that they were being transferred to Alaska, some at first refused to go, according to accounts from several men in the unit. 
One man who was waiting to be deported said an ICE officer saw his name on the list and took it off, along with several others, so he stayed in Tacoma. He said other people who were sent to Alaska were also waiting for deportation.
“If I’m waiting to get deported, why would I go to Alaska?” he said. “It makes zero sense.”
After several of the men refused to leave the Tacoma facility, officials threatened them with federal criminal charges, according to multiple accounts. Then officials arrived in riot gear, according to the detainees. Some people used sheets to hold their doors closed, according to the detainees, while others watched, worried that they would be swept up in whatever violence might come, even though they weren’t participating.
Before the officials in riot gear entered the unit, those on the list negotiated with ICE, according to the detainees.
“They’d rather go rather than be hurt and then go,” one man recalled other detainees saying.
The men sent to Alaska said their transfer there meant they spent several weeks in conditions even worse than those they had previously complained about at the Tacoma facility run by GEO Group — conditions that contradict ICE’s own policies and standards.
“I felt frustrated,” José Alvarez recalled in Spanish of his transfer to Alaska. “I felt powerless.”
Several of the men told Capital & Main that they were not allowed to make phone calls for days, so they were unable to inform their families or their attorneys what had happened to them or where they were. Under the ICE detention standards, facilities are required to provide phone access to detainees during waking hours.
When, after several days, one man asked for access to his belongings so he could get a phone number to make a call, a guard at the facility left and returned with other guards who launched pepper spray, according to several of the men.
“You are completely unable to breathe for two days, and you’re coughing every 10 seconds because all the residue is stuck to the walls and the floor,” one man recalled.
The men were held in overcrowded cells, with one sleeping on a mattress on the floor, they said. In another violation of ICE detention standards, they weren’t given daily access to the yard, they said.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska wrote a letter to the Alaska Department of Corrections and ICE about the conditions that the men were held in, including the incident involving pepper spray, which the letter calls a “particularly egregious and excessive use of force.”
The letter says that the facility staff did not follow ICE guidance which would require a consultation with medical staff prior to using pepper spray.
“If they had, they would have been made aware that one of the individuals whom they pepper sprayed was diagnosed with borderline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and that exposure to such an irritant could be deadly,” the ACLU of Alaska wrote in the letter.
In the letter, the ACLU noted that it had already sued over conditions in the facility in the state criminal system before ICE moved people in its custody there, and it said that multiple people have died in the facility this year.
“In other words, ACC currently does not safely house those charged with or convicted of crimes,” the ACLU wrote in the letter (emphasis in original). “And immigrant detainees are entitled to even greater protections.”
That’s because people in ICE custody are in civil detention rather than criminal custody, meaning that they cannot be held as punishment and the standards for what custody looks like for them are supposed to be different.
“On June 4, 2025, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) agent asked how many immigrant detainees the Anchorage Correctional Complex (“ACC”) could safely house for longer than 72 hours,” the letter says. “Given the inability of ACC to meet federal standards of care, the answer should have been zero.”
A few of the men were deported while in Alaska. The rest returned to Northwest ICE Processing Center after a few weeks at the Alaska facility.
But as ICE transfers continue to increase, the detainees do not know how long they might remain there.
“We’re not animals,” Peralta said. “Animals are treated better than the way we are being treated in here.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders at a campaign stop in Flint, Michigan in September 2024. (Kyle Davidson/Michigan Advance)As a midnight deadline to avert a federal government shutdown looms, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders directed Arkansas state agencies to prepare to furlough employees fully or partially funded by federal money.
In a memo sent to her cabinet and shared with the media Tuesday, Sanders put the onus of funding the government on Democrats, stating she hoped they would not “obstruct” the clean stopgap spending bill extending funding to November that GOP leadership in D.C. and President Donald Trump want.
Federal funding expires at midnight Tuesday, the end of the federal fiscal year, unless Congress passes appropriations bills or a continuing resolution to fund the government before then.
‘We’re headed to a shutdown’: White House meeting ends with no deal as deadline nears

“As a state, we must be prepared to ensure the continuation of those services vital to the protection of public health, safety, and welfare, while temporarily suspending government services that rely on federal funding” if the government shuts down, Sanders wrote.
In the event of a shutdown, cabinet secretaries are to work with the Department of Finance and Administration and the Department of Shared Services to determine which programs will be suspended and which employees will be furloughed, according to the memo.
Employees in federally-funded programs that have been identified as “being necessary to protect public health, safety, or welfare” may continue if federal funding is guaranteed during the shutdown, Sanders wrote. Programs that have “sufficient federal funding and authorization from current or previous federal grants to fund a program or position” may also continue as long as that money remains available.
But starting Wednesday, programs and positions that do not fall under those two categories and rely fully or partially on federal funding will be suspended until the shutdown concludes, Sanders wrote.

Read States Newsroom’s explainer on what to expect if the government shuts down here.

“The federal government will not allow us to make any exceptions unless the protection of public health, safety, and welfare would be compromised,” Sanders wrote.
House Republicans have already passed a continuing resolution extending government funding until November, but the measure requires Democratic support to reach 60 votes in the Senate. Democrats have not provided it so far, accusing the GOP of refusing to negotiate with them on the extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Republicans have accused Democrats of “hostage-taking” for not supporting the funding extension. Both parties insist the other will be blamed by voters for the first shutdown since 2019 if a deal doesn’t materialize.
The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported Tuesday that Arkansas legislative leaders wrote to top Senate Democrats and Republicans last week urging them to adopt a continuing resolution before the deadline.
Arkansas Senate Majority Leader Blake Johnson of Corning and Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester of Cave Springs, both Republicans, wrote that a government shutdown would “needlessly disrupt our economies, threaten public safety, and undermine public confidence in our institutions. … Put simply, a government shutdown should not be used as political leverage to pass partisan reforms — these are not chips Congress should be bargaining with.”

Rick Scott at Jaguar CrossFit in Tampa on July 26, 2024. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A week after President Donald Trump signed an executive order designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, Florida Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott has introduced federal legislation to codify that order.
Antifa is a decentralized leftist movement that stands for “anti-fascist.” It has no hierarchical organization structure, bank accounts, or revenue streams. Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, said last week that the president had incorrectly labeled the group.
“Never in our history has the U.S. government named a domestic terrorist organization,” he said.
In 2020, former FBI Director Christopher Wray told a congressional committee that Antifa was a movement or an ideology, not an organization.
The Department of Homeland Security issued a press release Friday entitled, “DHS is fighting back against Antifa violence.”
It went on to say that the agency had arrested “dozens of Antifa-aligned left-wing violent extremists who have attacked law enforcement, murdered innocent civilians, and launched a wave of violent riots throughout the United States.”
Scott’s Stop ANTIFA Act directs the National Joint Terrorism Task Force to coordinate and supervise a comprehensive national strategy to “investigate, prosecute, and disrupt entities and individuals engaged in acts of political violence and intimidation designed to suppress lawful political activity or obstruct the rule of law.”
The legislation also calls upon the U.S. attorney general to issue specific guidance that “ensures domestic terrorism priorities include politically motivated terrorist acts such as organized doxxing campaigns, swatting, rioting, looting, trespass, assault, destruction of property, threats of violence, and civil disorder.”
“Antifa has gotten away with its evils and terrorized cities across our country for far too long,” Scott said in a written statement.
“Violence against our brave law enforcement officers and ICE agents will not be tolerated — especially when it’s domestic terrorists like Antifa wreaking havoc on our communities. These people actively work to destroy the American way of life and call for the overthrow of American government and society.”

,DC,2025-09-30 18:00:29+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"About 750,000 federal workers will be furloughed in shutdown, nonpartisan CBO projects",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/about-750000-federal-workers-will-be-furloughed-shutdown-nonpartisan-cbo-projects,,"WASHINGTON — A government shutdown could have significant economic consequences, though an analysis released Tuesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said it’s difficult to pinpoint ramifications without knowing the length of a funding lapse or how exactly the Trump administration will try to reshape the federal workforce. Director Phillip L. Swagel wrote in a four-page letter the agency projects about 750,000 federal workers would be furloughed, leading to a $400 million impact per day. “The number of furloughed employees could vary by the day because some agencies might furlough more employees the longer a shutdown persists and others might recall some initially furloughed employees,” Swagel wrote. New plans from the Trump administration to lay off federal employees en masse, he wrote, could significantly change those calculations. The economic impacts and ramifications for business activity are hard to predict, he wrote, because it’s not yet clear how exactly the Trump administration will handle a shutdown or how long it will take congressional leaders to broker a stopgap funding agreement. The partial government shutdown that began in December 2018 and lasted through January 2019 led to a loss of about $3 billion in gross domestic product that couldn’t be recovered, according to a prior CBO analysis that was referenced in the letter. That represented about 0.02% of annual GDP in 2019. Swagel wrote the “effects of a government shutdown on business activity are uncertain, and their magnitude would depend on the duration of a shutdown and on decisions made by the Administration. “CBO expects that if a government shutdown persisted for several weeks, some private-sector entities would never recover all of the income they lost as a result of the suspension of federal activity.”CBO conducted the analysis after receiving a request from Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst. Thune, Schumer debate shutdown on Senate floorA government shutdown will begin Wednesday unless congressional leaders broker a stopgap funding agreement before the new fiscal year starts. That seemed like a long shot early Tuesday afternoon as Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., engaged in a brief debate on the floor, a rarity. Thune said Democrats would have the same leverage on health care issues they have now in mid-November, when the stopgap spending bill that passed the House but stalled in the Senate would expire. “They will have another funding cliff they can take advantage of come November the 21st,” Thune said. “This funds the government and protects federal workers and the American people from the hostage-taking that has become, evidently, now the Democratic norm. Even though it’s something they decried not that many years ago.”Thune told reporters afterward the chamber would likely be out of session for Yom Kippur, which begins shortly before sunset on Wednesday and continues until Thursday night, but would otherwise hold votes during a shutdown.“We will observe the Jewish holiday, but I would expect additional votes throughout the week,” Thune said. “I mean, we filed last night on a whole new bunch of (nominees) and I would expect additional votes on funding the government.”Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., canceled the House’s schedule for this week and doesn’t plan for that chamber to go back into session until Oct. 6 at the earliest.Meeting breaks up with no dealCongressional leaders, including Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, met with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, but were unable to make progress toward a stopgap funding agreement.Schumer said on the Senate floor Tuesday that Democrats need a deal with GOP leaders to extend the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, which are set to expire at the end of the year. “In a day or two, millions of Americans — millions — are going to get notices that their insurance premiums will rise an average of $400 a month, $5,000 a year,” Schumer said. “A middle-class family can’t afford that. We want to renew those credits, among other things in health care. But renew those credits so that people won’t pay that horrible increase.”Schumer called Republican assertions that Democrats want immigrants without legal status to have access to federal health care programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, “utter bull.”“There is no money, not a penny of federal dollars that are going there. So why do they bring this up? Because they’re afraid to talk about the real issue, which is health care for American citizens, health care for people who need the health care and can’t afford these premiums,” Schumer said.Without a new funding law before the start of the fiscal year at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, the government will begin shutting down.The ramifications will be significantly broader than the 35-day shutdown that took place during Trump’s first term, when five of the dozen full-year government spending bills had become law.That isn’t the case this time around and a shutdown is expected to affect every department and agency to varying degrees.'They're taking a risk'White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought has also called on Trump administration officials to implement mass layoffs during a prolonged funding lapse.Trump said during a press conference in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he didn’t want a shutdown but that his administration might take sweeping action to restructure the federal government if one does begin. “We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump said, referring to Democrats. “So they're taking a risk by having a shutdown, because because of the shutdown, we can do things medically and other ways, including benefits.”",,,,2025-09-30 14:58:04.211018

(Stock photo by Paul Souders/Getty Images)A federal judge ruled this week that Maine’s lawsuit against major fossil fuel companies can move forward in state court after some defendants tried to elevate it to federal. 
Last year, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey sued Exxon, Shell, Chevron, BP, Sunoco and the American Petroleum Institute for failing to warn consumers and concealing their knowledge of the consequences increased use of fossil fuels can have, such as extreme weather, sea-level rise, warmer temperatures, property damage and negative impacts on public health.
At that time, the state demanded a jury trial and relief through damages, penalties and more. The suit also asked the defendants to pay for both past and future climate-related harms caused by the fossil fuel industry and stop their alleged deception in Maine. 
However, two of the defendants used the “federal officer removal statute” to have the case moved from state to federal court, according to legal documents. The defendants cited various activities they carried out under direction from the federal government as to why the case should be relocated. 
AG Frey sues fossil fuel companies for deceiving Mainers about climate change

Frey’s office filed a motion to bring the case back to state court and recover the costs and fees associated with the initial removal, arguing that moving the case was “objectively unreasonable.”
On Monday, U.S. Judge Nancy Torresen ordered the case be sent back to state court and that the fossil fuel companies pay for the expenses incurred by the state. She said the defendants’ arguments in support of the move were “slightly— and cleverly—revised versions of the same removal arguments to at least a dozen federal courts across the country” that have all rejected them.
Frey told Maine Morning Star he appreciates the court’s “thorough analysis” and decision to send the case back to state court, where it was originally filed. 
“Enough with the delays, Mainers deserve their day in court to hold the defendants accountable for the high costs of surviving the impacts of their deception,” he added. 
Maine is one of 10 states, along with Washington D.C. and dozens of city, county and tribal governments, that have filed lawsuits intended to hold major oil and gas companies accountable for deceiving the public about their products’ role in climate change. 
Frey filed Maine’s lawsuit two weeks after documents published by the international investigative outlet DeSmog showed that scientists were warning fossil fuel companies as early as 1955 about the long term consequences of their work, which they in turn sought to conceal. 
With these lawsuits moving closer to trial, there have been efforts to create legal protections for fossil fuel companies. In June, more than a dozen attorneys general proposed creating a “liability shield” for oil and gas companies similar to a 2005 law that protected gun manufacturers from lawsuits.

(Photos by West Virginia Department of Health and Kristian Thacker)Newly-released documents from the governor’s office verify that the company buying the state’s four long-term care hospitals won’t be required to build new facilities in the current hospital locations.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey is selling hospitals in Beckley, Fairmont, Terra Alta and West Columbia to a subsidiary of Marx Development Group, a New York-based company. The hospitals, which need extensive repairs, are operating at a $6 million yearly loss to the state.
The facilities currently serve mostly elderly patients who are reliant on Medicaid and can’t afford private care. 
On top of the purchase amount, the buyer has committed $80 million to build at least three new hospitals, according to sale documents obtained by West Virginia Watch through a public records request. 
It’s still not known what nursing homes might close or where the new locations will be — a point of concern for communities that rely on the facilities for family members’ care and jobs. The contract doesn’t include any location requirements. 
House of Delegates member Jonathan Pinson’s district includes Lakin Hospital, a 114-bed long-term care facility in Mason County.
“I believe it is vital that any future hospital improvements prioritize the communities where existing facilities already serve patients,” said Pinson, R-Mason, on Tuesday. “While I welcome investment and modernization, I would like to see the long term investments of new facilities being made in our communities.”
He added, “New hospitals should be built in the same communities to ensure continuity of care and stability for families and workers.”
The buyer can continue operating the hospitals that don’t require new construction. 
Company required to meet milestones in hospital construction 
The sales agreement includes construction deadlines for Majestic Care, a subsidiary that will operate the nursing homes in West Virginia. 
The company must acquire at least three new long-term care facility sites within six months or pay $5 million to the state. Majestic Care would have to pay a separate $5 million in damages if substantial completion of the new long-term care facilities isn’t completed in roughly 14 months of when the sale is expected to close Oct. 1.
Paul Pruitt, CEO of Majestic Care, has told news outlets that the goal is to build new facilities close to the current ones. The company aims to use labor and materials from West Virginia. 
“I think one of the major concerns is that these facilities would be moved to metropolitan areas and especially away from rural locations,” said Sen. Joey Garcia, whose district includes the John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont. “That will affect patient care, families’ ability to visit and employees’ ability to work at these facilities.”
Garcia, an attorney, has said he intends to sue the Morrisey administration over the sale of John Manchin hospital. He argues that the governor didn’t have statutory authority to sell the hospital without the Legislature’s approval.
The concern is that the patients who are being cared for and those who need this type of care in the future will be able to retire in the state of West Virginia.
Morrisey has promised current patients won’t lose care and many staff will retain their jobs. The state has been heavily reliant on contract nurses to staff state-owned hospitals. 
The sales agreement said Majestic Care must evaluate the performance of current employees and and make “good faith efforts to offer employment to substantially all existing employees at the facilities on or before the closing date.” The company has to prioritize the hiring of current employees over third-party applicants. 
Letters have been sent out to state hospital employees asking them to indicate if they will apply for a position with MDG, explore retirement options or resign from their position with the state.

Lawmakers plan to take up DOH’s authority to address vaccination policy amidst federal tumult during a special legislative session. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)During the special legislation session starting Wednesday and focused on federal health insurance and food assistance programs, New Mexico lawmakers also plan to address state laws on vaccine policy.
Current federal tumult over vaccine availability requires providing state officials the flexibility “to set their own standards,” Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth recently told Source NM.
New Mexico Department of Health Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham told Source NM she hopes the changes in the law will offer state officials more leeway as federal vaccine policy faces delays and uncertainty.
The hope is to “bulletproof” the state’s vaccination policy infrastructure and send clear public health messages, she noted.
“We are essentially hoping to just broaden the guidance that we can rely on in making vaccine decisions,” Durham said.
Durham pointed to the recent challenges the state faced in offering COVID-19 vaccines. State law requires pharmacies to follow guidelines set by the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. But under the current federal administration, those guidelines have not been finalized. Thus, the state “was left in limbo,” she said.
As such, DOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie issued a public health order on Aug. 29 that directed the state pharmacy board to update its protocols to ease access. Then Durham wrote a statewide prescription for all residents. The situation, Durham noted, illustrated that the state needs to “craft its own recommendations.”

Durham pointed to clinical guidance released by professional organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics or others as a means for the department to craft effective policy guidance for pharmacists and other medical professionals.
“[American Academy of Pediatrics] and others have reviewed vaccines independently and just usually come to the same conclusion as ACIP, so we haven’t had conflicting recommendations,” Durham said. “What’s happening with ACIP right now — it’s not meeting in a timely manner and not providing strong evidence-based recommendations.”
CDC vaccine officials resign while childhood vaccination rates decline

Recent uncertainty may be worsened by the federal shutdown expected on Oct. 1 if Congress doesn’t pass a budget to fund the government.
“I would hope the acting CDC director would be considered an essential worker, but there’s really no way to know,” Durham told Source NM.
Durham said having a state policy will also help “screen out the noise” of misinformation about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.
“We think the Department of Health is well positioned to be really clear about what’s best for New Mexico. And again, it doesn’t necessarily have to be different than what’s best for other states, but we really do want to focus on that,” Durham said.
Other states have also begun charting their own vaccine policies. California, Oregon and Washington announced a public health alliance, while New York declared a disaster, citing the Trump Administration’s limits on the use of COVID-19 vaccinations.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)A plan to allow cellphone jamming in prisons can move forward, the Federal Communications Commission decided Tuesday.
The three-person commission’s unanimous vote represented a major win for state officials who have long said jamming is the best way to deal with an inundation of contraband cellphones in the state prison system. The voted will open up the policy for public comment, to be followed by another vote at a to-be-determined date.
SC officials hopeful FCC will allow cellphone blocking in prison: ‘Jamming is the answer’

Current and former state Department of Corrections directors praised the commission for considering the change at all, after more than a decade of trying and failing to get any movement on the issue.
“Inmates with illegal cellphones commit serious crimes,” agency director Joel Anderson said in a Tuesday statement. “It’s that simple.”
Commission Chairman Brendan Carr told the story of Capt. Robert Johnson, an anti-contraband officer who in 2010 was shot six times at his Sumter home. Angry about the loss of a recent contraband package Johnson’s team had seized, inmates used an illegal cellphone to order the hit.
“Thankfully, Capt. Johnson survived, but in many ways, his story is not unique,” Carr told the commission Tuesday.
Cellphones have also allowed inmates to run extortion schemes and major drug rings, all from within prison walls, state officials have said. Similar crimes have taken place across the country, Carr said.

Officials have said the technology within prisons is extremely precise, blocking signals only within the walls.
But Commissioner Anna Gomez said she still worried about jamming devices interfering with nearby homes and businesses, as well as emergency calls. She asked for the commission to start with a smaller pilot program to see how the technology works.
Cellphone jamming is already used in federal prisons.
“While the problem we are trying to address is of critical importance, I worry about the potential unintended consequences of permitting jamming by non-federal actors and permitting jamming equipment to formally enter the American market,” Gomez said.
South Carolina will be ready as soon as a change takes effect, officials said earlier this month.
The state was the first in the nation to use a technology tracking cell signals within prisons, which allows officials to alert cellphone companies of unauthorized devices and get them turned off. Officials have compared to the process to a game of “Whac-A-Mole,” saying it’s time-consuming to identify and get phones turned off individually.
That technology, which legislators have spent $18.5 million over two years to install and maintain, can be adjusted to block all cellphone signals within a prison instead of just detecting them. All the state needs is the commission’s OK.
Tuesday’s vote follows turnover at the commission.

Sept. 20, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceThe current fiscal year ends in less than 12 hours, and the respective chambers of the Michigan Legislature were still waiting in limbo as progress toward a final spending plan remains slow and elusive.
Both the House and Senate worked last Friday, Sept. 26, spending nearly 19 hours in a joint conference committee to hash out the loose framework announced late last Thursday. Members left that meeting confident that the deal would hold with some aspects dropped in favor of others.
State Rep. John Roth (R-Interlochen), who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, said that all parties felt that the conference budget was balanced and that they were close to being comfortable with putting it forward. 
But that development was over the weekend, and there was little public action on Monday and negotiations continued into Tuesday. As of 1 p.m., neither chamber had passed a conference committee budget and top level negotiations were still taking place.

The governor’s office and the state budget team were meeting midday as the House and Senate were also still talking to each other.
Negotiations were not described as having stalled out or at an impasse, as the House had most of its pieces regarding new revenue in the face of cuts and policy changes to bolster its $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion road repair and rebuild spending plan. The Senate was taking a bit longer on its revenue pieces and roads policy bits.
Members of the House were confident that they had the votes on their side to pass the plan as brokered, but a question remained on whether the Senate had the votes to do the same. There was also some struggling going on in the Senate over the proposed 24% wholesale tax on marijuana products that would be an integral part of the road funding deal.
That bill is House Bill 4951, creating the new tax.
The Senate was planning on holding an appropriations committee meeting midday but after gaveling in at 1 p.m., they immediately recessed until further notice.
While the House and Senate floor sat quiet, the halls of the Capitol rang out with the voices of protestors opposing the House’s plan to raise revenue for roads by implementing a 24% wholesale tax on marijuana, expected to generate $420 million.

When asked whether the House’s marijuana plan had created a hold up in the upper chamber, Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township) said “everything’s rolling forward,” and that he did not have any further comment.
Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) pointed to larger concern as far as any issues holding up the Senate.
“I mean, it’s a rock in the shoe that I haven’t seen a budget yet, and it’s almost October 1,” Irwin said.
Either way, the respective chambers had a sense that the night would go long but an end goal was in sight to have a budget ready to present to the governor by at least the morning. 
Time will tell if the conference committee plan holds as the night wears on.

(Photo via Getty Images)New Mexico lawmakers will convene Wednesday to address upcoming federal impacts to the state’s Medicaid program, including funding cuts and new work requirements. 
Here’s a brief introduction to some of the important facts and figures around the federal-state health insurance program for low-income residents.
Why is Medicaid important to New Mexico?
Among the states, New Mexico has the highest Medicaid enrollment per capita at 42% of the state’s population, according to the state Health Care Authority’s fact sheet released in September.
Medicaid is the largest expenditure in the state’s health care budget. The state’s Medicaid program covers pregnant women, children; families; people with disabilities; people who are elderly and need long term care; people experiencing mental health crises; and more. The majority of people on Medicaid in New Mexico are employed.
Medicaid pays for more than half the births in New Mexico, and covers 294,566 children as of August 2025.
According to the HCA’s analysis in March, Medicaid patients make up nearly one-third of the state’s hospital volume and New Mexico receives approximately $3.9 billion in annual Medicaid payments per year.
New Mexico hospitals and patients face closure from ‘domino effect’ of potential Medicaid cuts

How does the federal budget bill impact New Mexico’s Medicaid?
The so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” passed by congressional Republicans earlier this year included cuts to the Medicaid program and limits on eligibility. Officials expect those changes will shift more costs to the state.
Currently, New Mexico pays about 30% for Medicaid while the federal share is about 70% (it can be up to 90%, depending on the patient’s income).The federal government wants to reduce that percentage, which could cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars to replace.
“No state can meet such an abrupt and costly funding need, which is the point — this proposal is intended to force states to stop covering working-age adults,” the Health Care Authority said in its memo, possibly leaving a large uninsured population.
The New Mexico Health Care Authority estimates that the state’s Medicaid program could see losses exceeding $8.5 billion over the next decade from lowering how much they pay providers.
New eligibility requirements will mean an estimated 88,530 New Mexicans will lose Medicaid coverage permanently, according to the Health Care Authority. That includes nearly 10,000 active Medicaid non-citizens.
At least 254,400 adults on Medicaid will be subject to Medicaid’s new work requirements.
Additionally, the federal mandates will require patients who make less money to pay for cost-sharing of up to $35 per service. While primary care, mental health, and substance use disorder services are exempted, advocates worry this will deter people from seeking care.

When do the Medicaid changes go into effect?
The bulk of the changes will take several years to go into effect. The permanent disenrollment of active Medicaid non-citizens will occur by October 2026. New work requirements go into place in January 2027, and the state’s rate cuts will begin in January 2028, along with cost-sharing.
What other concerns about Medicaid will lawmakers address?
Lawmakers will address additional funds for the state’s food assistance and Medicaid computer system, which will require $24 million to update and run.
The Health Care Authority said new eligibility requirements will impact the state’s marketplace for transitioning people off of Medicaid, but who do not have health insurance through their employers. Members who were brought to the U.S. as young children classified as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are no longer eligible for the state’s marketplace coverage starting on Oct. 1, 2025.
What opposition will shoring up the state’s Medicaid face?
Republican lawmakers have said in meetings and in interviews that concerns about cuts to federal health care and food assistance programs are overblown, and noted they will not go into effect for several years.
In a Sept. 19 interview with Source NM, Senate Minority Leader Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) said he opposed the governor’s call for a special session.
“But the question is: What is her big emergency? And as far as I can tell, there is no big emergency other than my belief, she just simply wants people to stand up and talk bad about President Trump,” Sharer said.

TRIO programs help students who are first in their families to go to college, have lower incomes or live with disabilities.
David James, TRIO director at Fort Peck Community College, said Monday his college has a “legacy program,” funded since the 1980s, and it has appealed its initial grant denial.
The status is pending.
However, the current grant runs only through Tuesday, and on Wednesday, James said the 230 students served through TRIO at the tribal college may not have the mentoring or tutoring or other support offered by the program.
“There will be nobody here to help them,” James said.
Chief Dull Knife College, on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, also was denied funding, according to TRIO leaders.
Chief Dull Knife College could not be reached Monday about its TRIO Student Support Services program, although James said he believes it likely appealed its initial grant denial as well.
The Trump administration has been making moves to significantly change education policy, including appointing Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who is charged with dismantling the federal Department of Education.
The changes have led to national uncertainty for TRIO programs, major cuts to the federal department, and other significant shifts to public education, including changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.







Critics allege the changes hurt students and middle-class families, but proponents say they will cut unnecessary bureaucracy, and states could design their own programs with less cost and hassle.







 TRIO in limbo

Although James had yet to hear a final decision Monday about TRIO funding for Fort Peck college students, staffing changes are underway.
He said one TRIO staff member took another job, and another job will end Tuesday. James said he is working on a transfer within the college, but he also could be furloughed.
Blackfeet Community College President Brad Hall said his school had a TRIO Student Support Services program in the past, and its application to reapply this year was denied.
Data, however, show significant student achievement for students who participate in TRIO programs.
Daniel Benge, program director for TRIO at the University of Montana, said 77% of students at UM “persist,” or continue college from one year to the next. By comparison, he said, 88.3% of those who are part of TRIO Student Support Services “persist.”
Montana State University also exceeds its goals for TRIO Student Support Services.
In the 2023-24 school year, MSU had a goal that 79% of all TRIO SSS students “persisted,” and it surpassed that goal, reaching 85%, according to data on its website.
James said he didn’t have data immediately available for TRIO students at Fort Peck, but they show similar high achievement.
“It’s really going to impact the students here,” James said.
 Historically, bipartisan support

In 2024, all TRIO programs in the state received $9.7 million in funding, including $4.6 million for TRIO Student Support Services, according to UM.
Other TRIO programs include Upward Bound, which provides tutoring, counseling and other services to high school students in preparation for college, and Veterans Upward Found, which focuses on helping military veterans enroll in and finish college.
At Montana State University, the TRIO Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement Program received full funding for the academic year, said MSU spokesperson Mike Becker.
The McNair program supports “exemplary undergraduate students” who have not traditionally participated in higher education to participate in graduate programs.
In 2024, TRIO served 9,976 students in Montana, according to data from UM.
Historically, Benge said TRIO programs have had strong bipartisan support in Congress, including from the Montana delegation, given participants’ achievement records.
Benge said TRIO outcomes reflect research results, and TRIO can show a return on investment to policymakers.
Research shows students stay motivated to complete college when they have a connection with somebody on campus — “TRIO is that connection,” said Benge, who has worked with TRIO programs for 30 years, earlier at MSU-Billings.
The students get frequent one-on-one support and mentoring at a rate an academic adviser doesn’t have capacity for, he said.
At UM, he said, students also connect with the campus through TRIO lunch-and-learns and in the TRIO computer and study lab, for instance.
The cost of TRIO at UM is about $1,382 a year per student, and one study found a TRIO graduate’s average contribution to the federal budget through taxes means that investment is paid back in 12 to 18 months.
“It’s a good return on investment,” Benge said.
The late U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns supported TRIO, he said, as did former U.S. Rep. Denny Rehberg, both Republicans, and former U.S. Sens. Jon Tester and Max Baucus, Democrats.
Members of Montana’s current all-Republican congressional delegation did not respond to requests for comment sent Monday afternoon about TRIO.
However, U.S. Sen. Steve Daines in 2017 was among the lawmakers who called for support for TRIO Upward Bound after the Department of Education found some programs ineligible for funding based on a grant formatting error.
 Always ‘topsy turvy,’ but funding uncertain in the future

President Donald Trump has been taking an aggressive stance on federal funding, one that has created unpredictability for education.
But Benge said only Congress has the authority to dismantle TRIO.
He said he’s been in TRIO long enough to have seen uncertainty before, and at least a couple of the previous attempts to gut TRIO have resulted in increased funding.
“There’s always topsy-turvy,” Benge said. “There’s always been significant bipartisan support.”
He said that support could continue, or Congress might shift its priorities under the Trump administration.
“They might bend to the will of the president and say, ‘We no longer want to have TRIO programs,’” he said. “Then the House and the Senate have to battle it out and decide whether they’re going to agree or disagree.”
 TRIO at Fort Peck

James said some students walk in the door at Fort Peck not knowing how to use a computer or write a resume, but TRIO helps them get degrees.
“(There’s) no greater thing in the world than watching one of my students graduate,” James said.
Especially as a Native American himself, James said he hopes that he might be able to support those students in the future, possibly in a transfer to a different job on campus.
“I’m a warrior, and that’s what warriors do. They help their people. They uplift them,” he said.
James said he doesn’t know when he might hear an answer from the Department of Education on the appeal, but he’s concerned about the possible effects on students if the answer is no.
“It’s going to be such a great loss. It really is,” James said.



MSU lauded McMahon for focus on economic opportunity, spokesperson says 
Although some federal changes in education have led to unpredictability, including for TRIO, some political leaders also have praised the Trump administration’s focus on jobs and the economy.
Earlier this month, Education Secretary Linda McMahon visited Montana State University, and MSU President Brock Tessman presented her a special pin for her “exemplary” support for the university.
MSU spokesperson Michael Becker said Tessman made the decision himself to present McMahon with the pin, which has an enamel MSU logo, because McMahon stressed the importance of aligning education with economic opportunity.
He said McMahon also has stressed the importance of “skills-based and job-focused learning.”
“Those are values shared by Montana State as we prepare our graduates to be successful in their careers after college when they take what they have learned and use it to the benefit of our local communities, state and nation,” Becker said in an email.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1383546236-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 13:56:58.293789

(Photo by Danielle Prokop / Source NM)A New Mexico Supreme Court order reorganizing the state’s water courts goes into effect Wednesday, Oct. 1, the Office of the Administrative Courts announced this week.
The order creates a “regional structure for water courts more closely aligned with the boundaries of New Mexico’s stream systems,” a news release announced, with designated water judges presiding over water law cases in a particular regions. Prior to the order, each of the state’s 13 judicial districts had one water law judge. water law judge in each of the state’s 13 judicial districts. Under the order, five district court judges are appointed to serve as water court judges in the three regions.
“This plan helps the judiciary address complex, technical water disputes that occur regularly because of conflicts between water users and appeals from administrative decisions,” state Supreme Court Chief Justice David K. Thomson said in a statement. “Having regional water courts will be particularly important during periods of sustained severe drought when water disputes likely will become more frequent and can impact agricultural users, communities and businesses across many counties.”
The water courts will cover cases that involve conflicts over water usage; special water districts such as irrigation districts; and appeals of decisions by the Office of the State Engineer, the news release said, but the new structure won’t impact water rights adjudication cases within specific stream systems or basins.
Justice C. Shannon Bacon, who led the reorganization, according to the news release, said the new structure “will help judges develop more specialized subject matter expertise in water issues covering large regions of the state. New Mexicans will benefit from having regional courts resolve disputes over water that can involve many interconnected technical issues.” The order requires the water judges to attend annual water law training and earn continuing educational credits in the topic.
Three water regions
Water Region 1 encompasses north-central and northwestern New Mexico and includes nine counties in the First, Second, Eleventh and Thirteenth Judicial Districts. Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Farmington are among the communities in the region, which includes the San Juan and Chama rivers and portions of the Rio Grande. First Judicial District Chief Judge Bryan Biedscheid is the region’s designated water judge.
Region 2 covers southwestern New Mexico, including Doña Ana County, and includes eight counties in the Third, Sixth and Seventh Judicial Districts. Las Cruces, Deming and Silver City are among the communities in the region, which includes portions of the Rio Grande and the Gila River systems. Sixth Judicial District Chief Judge Jarod Hofacket and Third Judicial District Judge Manuel Arrieta are the designated water judges in the district. Hofacket also will continue to preside over adjudication of the Animas Underground Basin.
Region 3 covers the eastern half of the state, and includes 16 counties in the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth and Twelfth Judicial Districts. Las Vegas, Tucumcari, Raton, Taos, Clovis, Portales, Roswell, Artesia, Carlsbad and Hobbs are in the region, which includes the Canadian and Pecos rivers and the northernmost portion of the Rio Grande. Fifth Judicial District Judge Dustin Hunter is the district’s designated water judge.
Second Judicial District Court Judge Erin O’Connell will serve as an alternate water judge for any of the regions, and retired Court of Appeals Judge James Wechsler will “continue to preside over general stream adjudications in state court to determine the legal scope of individual water rights in certain hydrogeologic areas of the state, such as the lower Rio Grande and the Pecos River,” the news release said.

Richardson will be stepping down as division director by the end of October. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).MO Healthnet Division Director Todd Richardson will step down from his position leading the state’s Medicaid program at the end of October, according to a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Social Services.
Richardson’s decision comes as his division prepares to implement a series of new directives from Congress on how states administer the federal healthcare program for low-income and disabled Americans, including work requirements and a cap on a key tax states use to pay for the program.
Baylee Watts, spokesperson for the department, said Director Jessica Bax will work with the governor’s office to select an interim director by mid-October, and that the department does not anticipate any interruptions to the healthcare of Missourians enrolled in the program. 
“I think they have a strong bench that is willing to step in and cover any gaps,” Watts said. “But no, we don’t foresee any changes or gaps in operations.”
At the end of August, roughly 1.3 million Missourians were enrolled in Medicaid, according to the Missouri Family Support Division.
Richardson, a Republican from Poplar Bluff, served in the Missouri House of Representatives from 2013 to 2018, when former Gov. Mike Parson tapped him to helm the state’s Medicaid program. 
Richardson helped coordinate the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and took a months-long leave of absence in 2021, as lawmakers debated whether to fund the voter-approved expansion of Medicaid in the state. Upon his return, the division began enrolling  Missourians who newly qualified for coverage, after a judge ordered the Department of Social Services to carry out the plan approved by 53.3% of voters in August 2020.
There are more than 350,000 people ages 19 to 64 enrolled under the expansion program. Under the budget act passed this year by Congress, Missouri has until December 2026 to require adults covered under expansion – those under 65 who earn up to 138% of the federal poverty level – to work, volunteer or study at least 80 hours per month to receive benefits. 
Georgia, one of the only states with current Medicaid work requirements, spent $54.2 million over five years to administer work requirements, according to Stateline. That is more than twice the amount spent on medical benefits for those in the work program.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Last year, Detroit pulled off something remarkable. The 2024 NFL Draft shattered attendance records. It drew visitors from all over the country and generated an estimated $200+ million in direct economic impact. That’s the kind of headline number that turns heads in Lansing. But here’s the catch: the draft lasted three days. By Monday morning, the cameras packed up, the fans drove home, and the city went back to business as usual. However, the positive economic impact is undeniable.
While Detroit’s sports legacy has instilled a sense of civic pride for decades, the city was built and continues to thrive thanks to its strong immigrant past, present and future.
Andrew Roth’s July 31, 2025, story, “Detroit wants to be a major sports city. But it needs state funding to help,” chronicles efforts to seek state funding to support pursuing similar major sporting events in the future.
Michigan generates significant economic impact in addition to the marquee sporting events, year-round. The playbook is already in our hands: investing in international students and global talent.
Every year, Michigan’s colleges and universities educate more than 38,000 international students. These students come from abroad, pay significant international student tuition and spend money on housing, food, entertainment, goods, and services. According to the Institute of International Education (IIE), the Open Doors report, international students in Michigan spend $1.45 billion each year in Michigan’s economy, supporting over 13,000 jobs. It’s important that we continue to benefit from these expenditures, which are the equivalent of hosting an NFL Draft every other month, year-in and year-out.
The problem is, we train them, then lose them. Too many take their skills, in engineering, AI, health care, and advanced manufacturing, to states like Illinois, Texas, California, or Washington, where employers are more open to using existing immigration pathways to hire them.
And according to the 2024 report, Contributions of New Americans in Michigan, released by the American Immigration Council—in partnership with the Michigan Global Talent Initiative (MGTI)—the data underscores the crucial role immigrants play in the state’s population growth, labor force, business creation, and consumer spending power. In fact, immigrants accounted for 57.7 percent of Michigan’s population growth over last decade and contributed $67.8 billion, or 9.9 percent, of the state’s total GDP in 2022.
Let’s do the math. If Michigan kept just 500 more international student STEM graduates here each year, their combined lifetime earnings would exceed $2 billion, generating tens of millions in state and local tax revenue. In addition to dedicating funds to attracting major sporting events, we need that same competitive mindset for attracting talent.
When Michigan invests in an event, we’re making a calculated bet on short-term tourism dollars. When Michigan invests in international students, they are locating here for years of study, and when Michigan invests in retaining those students after graduation, we’re betting on many more years of their spending and long-term innovation that will drive workforce growth, and the industries that will define the next 50 years.
University of Michigan students walking near the Diag on Oct. 3, 2022 | Ken Coleman
We’re in a race, not only for fans in stadium seats, but for engineers in our auto plants, researchers in our labs, and for entrepreneurs launching the next great Michigan startup. And it’s not just in high-tech industries—immigrant entrepreneurs already power much of our hospitality sector, from hotels to restaurants, making sure Michigan is ready for visitors and residents alike.
I’m an international student graduate. While I came to America to obtain a master’s degree in public service after a successful career in Albania, I have been working for MGTI post-graduation to help develop and implement strategies to ensure Michigan meets its workforce and talent goals. We’ve seen what’s possible when you give international graduates a reason to build their lives here. Since MGTI was developed in 2019, Michigan has added over 54,000 college-educated immigrants to its workforce. Graduates we’ve helped are now designing advanced robotics in Grand Rapids, leading AI projects in Ann Arbor, and expanding manufacturing in Saginaw. Each of them is a walking, working return on investment.
While Michigan invests millions into attracting sports tourists for a weekend, I urge State leaders to invest millions into keeping the innovators, scientists, and engineers who will power our economy for decades. MGTI was conceived of as a five-year investment, and its third year of funding is pending before the Michigan Legislature.
Sports can put Michigan into the spotlight. Global talent and international students help keep the lights on. It’s important to continue talent funding, just like we’re considering for sports, so we can win the long game. The roar of the crowd fades. The impact of investing in people doesn’t.

USF joins presidential hunt — incumbent Rhea Law to step down

USF started searching for a new president in February after Rhea Law announced she would step down at the conclusion of a presidential search. 
Law, an attorney and former chair of the school’s board of trustees, started as interim president in 2021 before officially becoming president in 2022. Former governors Jeb Bush and Charlie Crist appointed Law to the board from 2001 until 2013, overlapping with Limayem at USF at the beginning and end of his stint as dean. 
“We conducted a thorough process that included reviewing an outstanding group of highly qualified candidates from across the nation before deciding that Moez is the best choice for our USF community,” Mike Griffin, chair of the USF search committee, said in a news release. Griffin, a Tampa real estate figure, is vice chair of the trustees. 
“He brings a strong track record of presidential success in Florida in his current role, and we experienced the impact of his leadership firsthand when he led our Muma College of Business,” Griffin continued. “We are confident that Moez is the right person to accelerate our momentum and lead us to even greater heights in the next chapter of our university.”
Limayem became UNF’s president in August 2022. USF touted his presidency at UNF, marked by record enrollment this year. 
He received a master’s of business administration and doctorate degree in information systems from the University of Minnesota in 1988 and 1992, respectively. 
Before his first stint as USF, Limayem was an associate dean at the University of Arkansas College of Business. 
USF keeps with a trend of announcing sole finalists for a president’s position despite regulations requiring “an unranked list of final applicants.” Florida International University and the University of Florida, twice, did the same.
“The search committee is required to submit more than two qualified applicants, selected by a majority vote of the search committee, to the board of trustees for consideration, other than in exceptional circumstances making fulfillment of this requirement infeasible, in which case the committee must discuss why fewer than three applicants are being recommended and whether additional applications should be considered,” Board of Governors regulations state.
If Limayem is confirmed, USF will have swerved a trend of selecting presidents with histories of political service — unlike FIU, Florida Atlantic University, New College of Florida, Florida A&M University, and at the University of West Florida (an interim president). 
Now, UNF will become the latest state institution to begin a search for a new president.
Florida House Rep. Fentrice Driskell (D-Tampa) celebrated the announcement on social media.
“Great news from the USF Presidential Search Committee! I’m excited about this recent update and wish Moez all the best throughout the selection process,” she posted on X.

(AP) — A firearms industry trade and lobbying organization secretly built a database containing the personal information of millions of gun owners and used the data to reach gun rights supporters with political ads dating back to the 2000 elections, according to a new lawsuit.
The suit against the National Shooting Sports Foundation, based in Shelton, Connecticut, alleges the organization obtained the data from major gun manufacturers, whose customers never agreed to share their personal information for political purposes. The suit filed by two gun owners alleges “unjust enrichment” — that the NSSF benefited from using gun owners’ information without paying for it.
The NSSF, whose members include thousands of gun manufacturers, distributors and retail shops, did not respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment Monday. The organization has said that there was nothing illegal or improper about its data collection.
The lawsuit, filed in Connecticut on Sept. 22, seeks class-action status on behalf of gun owners nationwide. It seeks damages in excess of $5 million but does not provide a specific dollar amount.
The plaintiffs are gun owners Daniel Cocanour, of Oklahoma, and Dale Rimkus, of Illinois, who provided their personal information to gun makers when they filled out warranty cards after buying firearms, the lawsuit says. The cards are used by consumers to obtain rebates and repair or replace their firearms.
The lawsuit mirrors reporting by ProPublica on the NSSF’s use of gun owners’ information for political purposes.
The NSSF began compiling its database in 1999 using warranty card information from manufacturers in the wake of the shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado that killed 12 students and a teacher, as gun companies sought to defend their industry against legal action and protect their image, the lawsuit says.
The cards provided a wealth of information about firearms buyers, including contact information, gender, age, income, interests, what vehicles they own and why they bought a gun, according to the lawsuit.
“For decades, NSSF violated the right of firearms purchasers to know who receives their personal information and to control how that information is used,” said Ben Gould, a Seattle-based lawyer for the plaintiffs.
Lawsuit says Cabela’s provided customer data
Before the 2000 election, outdoor goods and gun seller Cabela’s shared information on 356,000 customers with a group created by the NSSF that put the data into the database, despite Cabela’s privacy policies telling its customers that their information would only be shared with “reputable companies” to keep them informed of “other outdoor products and manufactures,” the lawsuit says.
Using the Cabela’s information and data bought from a broker, the NSSF group mailed political ads to 2.5 million people, according to the lawsuit.
Bass Pro Shops, which acquired Cabela’s in 2017, said in a statement that it could find no records or anyone with knowledge about Cabela’s violating customers’ privacy.
“Safeguarding our customers’ privacy is something we take very seriously, and we can state unequivocally that Bass Pro Shops has never sold or made available our customers’ personal information to any organization for partisan political purposes,” the company said.
Database grew to include millions of records
By May 2001, the database contained 3.4 million records, including 523,000 from warranty cards and 2.9 million from voter and hunting license lists, the suit says.
Less than a year later, the database — called “Data Hunter” — had grown to 5.5 million records, with the NSSF revealing in an internal document that several firearms manufacturers including Glock, Smith & Wesson, Marlin Firearms and Savage Arms were contributing customer data, the lawsuit says. Those companies did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Monday.
The NSSF claimed in a public report that its advertising using the database was a “critical component” of Republican George W. Bush’s narrow presidential victory in 2000, the lawsuit says. The NSSF used the database in similar political advertising efforts in subsequent elections, the lawsuit claims. In 2016, the group hired the Cambridge Analytica consulting firm to use the database to mobilize gun rights supporters in swing states, according to the lawsuit.
Cambridge Analytica later folded amid revelations that it paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of 87 million Facebook users.
Justin Wagner, senior director of investigations for Everytown for Gun Safety, an anti-gun violence group, said the lawsuit makes it appear that the NSSF was amassing data on gun owners, while at the same time warning that such databases could be used by gun control supporters for mass firearm confiscation.
“We look forward to seeing the NSSF face accountability as the truth about this breach of trust comes to light in the courts,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25272605417765-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-30 12:58:39.963677

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)In remarks after the Council of State meeting Tuesday, Gov. Josh Stein condemned efforts to redraw North Carolina’s congressional map in the middle of the decade after comments by Republican leadership.
“It would be ridiculous to do so. We just redistricted for the second time last cycle. So every two years is the theory that we’re gonna redistrict, so we can maximize the political advantage to stick it to one party and enhance another party?” Stein said. “We cannot get into this maximalist political power worldview because it will destroy this country.”

Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger wrote in a social media post Thursday that he would be open to pursuing mid-decade redistricting in North Carolina after Republican-led states like Texas and Missouri have adopted new maps at President Donald Trump’s behest.
“We have drawn four Congressional maps in the last six years in redistricting fights with Democrats because of their sue-until-blue strategy,” Berger wrote on X. “If we have to draw one more map this year, we will.”
Currently, North Carolina’s congressional map consists of 10 Republican-held seats and four Democratic-held seats. Only the 1st Congressional District, held by Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.), was decided by a margin of less than 10% of the vote in 2024.
“That’s not how redistricting works,” Stein said. “You do it once a decade unless you’re ordered by the courts to redraw because your first effort violated the law. And then you wait till the next census, and then you redistrict again.”
He characterized the attempt as symptomatic of a larger win-at-all-costs mentality overtaking American politics.
“We have to be able to recognize, sometimes you win an election, sometimes you lose an election. When you lose, you gather your forces, you work hard, you try to convince the voters the next time,” he said.
The Republican redistricting campaign has driven Democratic efforts to redraw maps in states they control, most notably in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom is backing a referendum that would allow his party to draw out Republican seats after suspending a map created by an independent panel.
Stein said that Newsom’s approach is the right one despite his concerns over politicized congressional maps.
“Sadly, I think he is, because of what’s going on in Texas, what’s going on in Missouri,” Stein said. “Again, it’s this political maximalist position that is not good for our democracy, but you can’t have one side that’s willing to abuse the rules to gain power and then the other side say, oh, we will do the honest, true, and right thing.”
“I’m sympathetic to what California’s going through and I understand why he’s doing it,” he added.
 Stein still reviewing crime bill 
Stein declined to give further insight into his thinking on provisions of Iryna’s Law, a crime bill passed by the General Assembly in response to the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte. The legislation has remained on the governor’s desk since its passage last Tuesday.
State Auditor Dave Boliek said in a Sept. 30 Council of State meeting that “the prayers of everyone in North Carolina” go out to the people of Southport and Brunswick County in the wake of a deadly mass shooting. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
“It’s an immensely complicated law, and it’s an immensely complicated subject, how do we promote public safety?” Stein told reporters. “I want to make sure that the law is making us safer instead of making us less safe. And so I’m doing a thorough review as I hope people would expect me to do.”
Asked about provisions in the bill seeking to resume executions in the state, Stein said he is “studying the bill in its entirety to understand what its full impact is.”
He also reiterated a call he made in Southport days after a mass shooting in the city for greater mental health support.
“There are a lot of people out there who are struggling, the vast majority of whom are no threat to anybody else, but they deserve to be healthy,” Stein said. “But there are people out there who do live in a paranoid world of violent fantasies and we, a lot of times, know who they are, we just don’t have systems to address those concerns. We’ve got to figure out a way to do that and we can.”
The attack in Southport, which left three dead and five hospitalized, loomed large over Tuesday’s Council of State meeting, with Stein, Lieutenant Governor Rachel Hunt, and State Auditor Dave Boliek among those who acknowledged the victims. Attorney General Jeff Jackson said he has been “offering full support” to the Southport police and Brunswick County Sheriff’s Office.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_1282-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 12:58:39.963677

Hayden Kozak, who had fallen asleep on the couch with the family’s new pet cat Nacho, got to the kitchen the same time as her husband. Seeing the worsening storm outside, she rushed to wake the children, herding them downstairs and away from the windows.
It was not long after Kevin Kozak peeked out the french doors of their home in Greenville that a massive oak tree — more than 5 feet in diameter — came crashing through the roof less than 15 feet from where he stood.
Growing up in Pittsburgh, he’d never taken storms too seriously.
“I do now,” the 52-year-old Navy veteran and staffing agency executive told the SC Daily Gazette.
A high price
They lived through deadly Helene. Now families across western SC seek to rebuild, help others.

It’s been a year since Hurricane Helene swept across South Carolina and much of the Southeast, becoming one of the deadliest and costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.
Helene reached the Palmetto State as a tropical storm, with drenching rains and 75 mph winds that toppled trees and snapped power lines, leaving 49 people dead and 1.3 million homes and businesses in the dark. The storm spun off 21 tornadoes and caused significant destruction across 33 of South Carolina’s 46 counties, according to the state Emergency Management Division.
The storm damaged more than 5,000 homes, including that of the Kozaks.
A year later, their home remains under a tarp in disrepair. After much delay, their insurance company declared it a total loss and cleared it for demolition and rebuild. They’d been living there for less than a year when disaster struck.
“I just thank the Lord every day that we all made it out safe,” Kevin Kozak said. “You can rebuild a house, but you can’t bring back a life.”
In all, the storm killed at least 250 people along its entire path, according to the National Weather Service.
In South Carolina, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has since provided more than $323 million in assistance to individual uninsured and underinsured homeowners and renters in 28 counties and the Catawba Indian Nation.
The agency’s National Flood Insurance Program has paid policyholders over $9.72 million for flood losses, with more than 368 policyholders having filed claims.
Five of those claims remain open.
The U.S. Small Business Administration has approved more than $145 million in low-interest home and business damage loans.

And the state has mostly cleared an estimated 10 million cubic yards of storm debris. The state’s forestry agency estimates the total direct damage to the timber industry at $78.4 million, plus another $60 million worth of tree removal in the state’s more urban areas.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Tuesday announced $38.3 million in grant funding for South Carolina to help cover the timber losses.
“While the road to recovery is long, we have made measurable progress over the last year,” Kim Stenson, director of the South Carolina Emergency Management Division, said in a statement. “We know recovery doesn’t stop after the storm leaves. It’s a process, and we’ll continue working together until the job is done.”
A deluge of generosity
Luckily for the Kozaks, insurance paid to rent a home across town while they’ve waited for approvals, so they haven’t had to rely on federal aid to make ends meet.
Still, the back-and-forth with a litany of different insurance adjusters has been frustrating and the family of six is looking forward to the day they can return to a home with more space.
The kindness of their neighbors was unmatched, Kevin Kozak said. In the days without power following the storm, the neighborhood came together to cut trees off vehicles and hold cookouts to feed everyone.
“I think we’re closer now than ever before,” he said.
Along with the rain, the storm also brought in a deluge of generosity, marking the largest single activation of the state’s disaster charity fund.
A series of disasters taught SC how to work with FEMA. Leaders encourage reform, not ending it.

The nonprofit One SC Fund, founded in response to catastrophic flooding in 2015, has raised nearly $6.2 million to help South Carolinians recover from Helene, said Georgia Mjartan, president and CEO of the Central Carolina Community Foundation, which operates the fund.
So far, the fund has made $4.15 million worth of grants to 65 nonprofits that have helped meet survivors’ basic needs and clean-up efforts. The remaining $2 million will go to long-term rebuilding and recovery, Mjartan said, and the fund is still open for donations.
It was a $25,000 grant that helped Cherokee County Meals on Wheels respond to demands never seen before in the organization’s four decades of operation.
“Funding during that time was critical; there were so many needs,” said Executive Director Terry Dennis.
‘People get discouraged’
For many of the people served by Meals on Wheels, wells were their only source of water. And without power, they couldn’t pump the water into their homes, Dennis said. The food pantry had to call in shelf-stable meals, something it usually doesn’t need until late October or November.
A year later, Meals on Wheels remains at some of its highest numbers on record as people are still feeling the financial burden caused by the storm, Dennis said. The group provides 20 meals to 20 homes daily, as well as extra groceries, toiletries and pet food.
The 49 people in SC killed by the deadliest storm in state history

“Our community also found that a lot of families weren’t properly insured, especially our older generation, and those that were in rental properties couldn’t go back,” Dennis said.
With a shortage of rent-controlled and handicap accessible housing in the rural county, Meals on Wheels had to help one woman in her late 60s move to nearby Spartanburg County when she couldn’t find a place that would take her and her two dogs.
The Meals on Wheels volunteers also have provided emotional support to people who, in the immediate aftermath, were alone, scared, without food and didn’t know what they were going to do. That support has continued as those same people grew frustrated while waiting for home repairs.
“When you’ve never had to live like that before, people get discouraged,” Dennis said.
There’s still unfinished clean up from downed trees on properties, where the elderly residents can’t afford to hire someone for the work they can’t do themselves.
Even in her own neighborhood, Dennis said a family just now got to pull the tarp off and put a new roof on.
“I don’t know how much time will go by before everyone’s back to normal,” she said.
In Pacolet, Gary and Patricia Brinkley have had to abandon their home of 33 years after FEMA thrice-denied the elderly couple’s claims and the insurance payout fell short of covering repairs. Town ordinances also wouldn’t allow the couple to place a new mobile home on the lot.
With nowhere else to go, the Brinkley’s son took out a loan to buy his parents another home, located about a mile from where a 90-foot oak tree came crashing through the roof of their former bedroom and living room.
Insurers expect Helene’s damages to be historic. That’s not counting what they won’t pay.

The couple spent two months living with just a tarp and blankets for cover, sleeping in their car. Water seeped in and mold and mildew started to grow, making Patricia Brinkley sick.
The Brinkley’s homeowners’ insurance carrier declared their home in rural Spartanburg County a total loss.
The new home is nice. Built near the turn of the 20th century, it has hardwood floors and a big front porch.
Gary Brinkley wishes he would have received some form of aid. Living on Social Security, the couple has no way to pay their son back.
“Basically, we started over from scratch,” he said.
Years of work ahead
While many South Carolinians face rebuilding their homes, the cities, counties and utility companies also face their own challenges as they seek federal help paying for the massive cleanup efforts many have already undertaken.
The state has identified approximately 1,500 projects with a total cost of over $1.3 billion. So far, FEMA has doled out just $65 million.
SC lays plans to rebuild or repair an estimated 900 homes damaged by Hurricane Helene

It starts with a town, a county or a utility company proving their eligibility under a presidential disaster declaration, Emily Bentley, the state Emergency Management Division’s Chief of Recovery, told the SC Daily Gazette.
Then governments must separate the work into multiple projects — removing debris is separate from repairing a bridge.
And the entity has to be able to produce a mountain of paperwork for every step along the way. For small towns and utilities that don’t handle disasters on a regular basis, this creates a huge volume of work for a small number of people dragging out months and years. If FEMA rejects a town and it files an appeal, it can take even longer.
The city of Columbia, for example, waited nearly a decade after the 2015 floods for approval to repair the canal that is the source of the city’s drinking water.
That was a complex project that involved multiple environmental reviews and permits, Bentley said, but there are many other things that can snag up recovery work.
For debris, for example, governments have to show the volume of debris, where it picked up that debris, what type it was, where it stored the debris and where it disposed of it. Towns also must prove contractors did not overcharge for hauling it away.

If a town doesn’t apply for permits for a debris site or it takes debris to the wrong site, it’s enough to disqualify a project.
If debris is in a waterway, the town must prove it’s a risk to public health and safety to be reimbursed for removal.
For things like roads, towns have to prove that they’d been performing regular maintenance before the storm.
And if staff worked overtime, governments have to show the work they were doing and the equipment they used.
“So there’s a lot of a lot of little details like that that have to be reviewed and figured out,” Bentley said. “Those are the things that tend to slow stuff down.”
Large projects — anything that costs more than $1 million — must go through extra reviews at FEMA, which take 30 to 45 days. The federal disaster agency, this past spring, also added reviews for anything costing more $100,000, an additional step that is causing more delay, Bentley said.
“This is all taxpayer money, so you do want it to be spent appropriately,” she added. “But it does get a little frustrating sometimes for local entities that don’t have to deal with this on a regular basis.”
To help cover the cost, the state Legislature set aside $35 million in the budget for the state Department of Transportation to cover debris removal and road and bridge repairs not reimbursed by the federal government. The DOT has since reopened 99% of the more than 900 state roads closed due to Helene. The vast majority were reopened within weeks, according to the agency, which marked the progress last Friday with a ceremony at Jones Gap State Park.
The Legislature also provided nearly $200 million in state dollars to match federal funding for state agencies and local governments that couldn’t afford their share.
It also set aside $3 million for a new South Carolina Public Assistance program to help those cities and towns that don’t qualify for federal aid. The Emergency Management Division, which runs the program, says it will need more money for the fund in the next budget.

Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, is one of three plaintiffs challenging a legislative package that provides incentives for professional sports stadiums. Pictured here, Moon sits at his desk during the first day of the 2024 Legislative Session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Legislators upset that a bill they oppose becomes law don’t have a right to sue over it, attorneys defending the special session measure that provides state support to professional sports stadiums said in court on Tuesday.
“It’s not recognized in the state of Missouri that a legislator can come to the court simply because they don’t like a vote that was taken… the court system would be flooded,” Marc Ellinger, an attorney representing the Missouri General Assembly, argued in Cole County Circuit Court.
Ellinger was joined by assistant attorney general Sean McDowell in arguments seeking to dismiss the lawsuit filed in July by state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, and state Rep. Bryant Wolfin, a Republican from Ste. Genevieve and conservative activist Ron Calzone.
Moon and the other plaintiffs want to throw out the entire legislative package, which includes tax credits for home repairs after natural disasters this year and property-tax restrictions for some counties.
The law, they say, goes beyond the bill’s original subject and provides unconstitutional aid to private interests. But if the state’s motion to dismiss is approved, they won’t get to argue these points in court.
Ellinger and McDowell argued the case can’t move forward, saying plaintiffs lack taxpayer standing and dismissing the idea of “legislative standing.”
“I don’t think there’s any standing for specific legislators to bring a case as the plaintiffs have,” McDowell said.
Taxpayer standing requires a direct expenditure and because the bill operates through tax credits and is “subject to appropriation,” there is no direct cost to the taxpayer, he argued.
Attorney Bevis Schock, who is representing the law’s challengers, said there are up-front costs to the bill such as an estimated $10,000 expense to create the tax-credit application.
“If these plaintiffs have no standing and we throw this case in the trash, we might as well pitch the constitution in there with it,” he wrote in a pre-hearing filing.
The purpose of the lawsuit, Schock said in court on Tuesday, is to challenge bills with multiple subjects.
“The problem is.. the voter can’t tell what item the legislator is for or against,” he said. “That is why we are bringing the case.”
If they lose in circuit court, Schock said, he will appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court.

Gretchen Whitmer’s Black Leadership Council announced his intention on Tuesday to claim Michigan’s newly redrawn 1st Senate District.
The seat is currently held by state Sen. Erika Geiss (D-Troy), who cannot run in 2026 due to term limits. Onwenu, Detroit’s first director of entrepreneurship and economic opportunity and an adjunct professor at the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law, is the first Democratic candidate to declare in the race. 
The 1st Senate District is located in Wayne County and includes part of Detroit, Ecorse, Lincoln Park, River Rouge and Wyandotte. It is considered a strong Democratic seat, though Lincoln Park and Wyandotte were split between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.
“Michigan needs new and effective leaders ready to bring people together and deliver,” Onwenu said in a statement. “In the State Senate, I’ll work to unite Detroit and Downriver to help rebuild our economy, invest in our neighborhoods, and clean up our government to work for all of us.”
Onwenu pointed to the state’s rising costs and job loss rates, federal budget cuts, the need for neighborhood investment and state government transparency as challenges he hopes to address in the Senate. 
Onwenu’s campaign has also received several notable endorsements from local officials, including the Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus, former U.S. Rep. Andy Levin (D-Bloomfield Township), and state Reps. Joe Tate (D-Detroit), Helena Scott (D-Detroit) and Tyrone Carter (D-Detroit).

Taylor Royal, 35, a partner at Royal Wealth Partners serving clients in 47 states and managing more than $1.5 billion in assets, launched his campaign Tuesday and said he has always had an interest in government and pairing government and business with a mind toward efficiency. 
“I think Nebraska is almost like a blank canvas or an open slate,” Royal said. “There’s a lot of opportunity ahead of us to really propel our state forward.”

Legislative District 18 covers north-central Douglas County — northwest Omaha and Bennington. State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha has announced that she plans not to seek another four-year term.
Royal said that after graduating from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in accounting and finance, he earned a master’s degree in accounting from Southern Methodist University in Texas and became a certified public accountant. He went on to work at Deloitte in international tax in Texas before returning to Nebraska in 2015.
He said he returned having seen that Texas had proactive leaders traveling nationally to pitch the state as the place to be and contrasted that economic activity with ConAgra pulling out of Omaha.
“It was kind of eye-opening to see that contrast,” Royal said. “That really started the process of researching what we’re doing locally, what we’re doing in the community, what we’re doing at a statewide level, how we can be attractive for businesses, as well as to retain and attract the best talent and bring in new businesses.”
He added: “We would much rather be more foot on the gas or front forward, which is how do we bring in that next, new innovation and provide for entrepreneurship for Nebraska.”
Omaha State Sen. Christy Armendariz will not seek reelection in 2026

Among Royal’s priorities are making Nebraska more attractive to businesses and working families with an eye toward affordability and modernizing Nebraska’s tax code. He also hopes to enhance community safety, serve as a taxpayer advocate, foster workforce development for the next generation of Nebraskans and ensure access to quality schools.
Royal ran unsuccessfully for Omaha mayor in 2017 and made a 2018 bid for state treasurer. He said he has built his family and business since.
This summer, he said he connected with Armendariz. He said he “decided that if there was an opening, if there’s an opportunity to kind of carry the torch or carry the mantle, that I would, and [I’m] excited to put my name out there.”
Armendariz joined a laundry list of Republicans endorsing Royal’s campaign, as has former Gov. Dave Heineman; U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.; State Auditor Mike Foley; State Sens. Beau Ballard, Rob Clements, Ben Hansen and Tony Sorrentino; former Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert and former U.S. Rep. Hal Daub, a former Omaha mayor and former University of Nebraska regent.
Royal has also been endorsed by two opposing Republican candidates looking to succeed Bacon in 2026 — former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom, who represented Legislative District 18 before Armendariz, and Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding.

If elected, Royal said that, similar to Armendariz, he would not view taxpayers as a “credit card” and would first look internally at state and local operations to raise revenue and reduce spending, before looking externally.
“I feel like we’re just kind of getting nickeled and dimed and kind of pinched at every side,” Royal said.
Royal said he still wants to make Nebraska more attractive to businesses and working families and to modernize Nebraska’s tax code to help veterans and seniors stay in the state and young Nebraskans, including his own children, prosper, grow and remain in the Cornhusker State.
Legislative District 18 is one of the most competitive in the state. Also running in the race is Jess Goldoni, a businesswoman and AI strategist. Royal and Armendariz are registered Republicans. Goldoni is a registered Democrat. Armendariz won the 2022 race with 56% of the vote.
The officially nonpartisan Legislature is currently split 33-15 between Republicans and Democrats, plus one additional nonpartisan progressive. It takes 33 votes to end debate on often contentious bills.
Royal said he hopes to unite Nebraskans and approach politics with a “Nebraska first” orientation, a mindset he said requires cross-partisan collaboration.
“I do hope to represent all,” Royal said. “We’ll work hard to earn every vote.”
He hopes to capitalize on Nebraska’s position, support advancements in technology, including artificial intelligence and bring people together around integrity and common-sense values.
“There’s a sense of urgency,” Royal said, “which is why I’m running to bring that to bear and then working on efficiency and affordability in the meantime.”
The top two vote-getters in the May 2026 primary will advance to the November 2026 election.

(Candidate photo courtesy of Goldoni campaign | Capitol photo by Rebecca Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A businesswoman and AI strategist is running for a now-open Nebraska legislative seat in north-central Douglas County with a focus on state spending priorities and listening to voters.
Jess Goldoni, 42, said she has spent the past 20 years building businesses as a marketer who has dipped her toes in many industries, including legal, financial, health care, nonprofit, travel, international, agriculture, innovation, water and artificial intelligence. She is also the co-founder of Nebrask.ai, a firm that seeks to teach and empower businesses not to be afraid of AI.
Goldoni launched her campaign in August and said she sees the best in people and loves Nebraska, but she is tired of seeing “wasted potential” in people, communities and government. She said that includes young adults or businesses leaving the state.
“Too many people on the left and right are digging their heels in on principle, and no one is coming together to actually get anything done for hard-working Nebraskans,” Goldoni said.

Legislative District 18 covers north-central Douglas County — including northwest Omaha and Bennington. State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha has announced plans not to seek another four-year term.
Among Goldoni’s priorities are giving K-12 schools the resources needed for success and supporting veterans “without excuses.” She also hopes to highlight trades and apprenticeships, support dual-credit academic programs, find new ways to build revenue for the state, modernize government and support Nebraska-owned small businesses and startups.
Goldoni is an Omaha native who has lived in the district for 13 years. She is a journalism graduate of the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Goldoni said that similar to Gov. Jim Pillen, she is not happy with property taxes, with her bill increasing annually. But she added, “We have to be smart about this,” as all financial decisions trickle into other priorities.
“It all comes back to money, because if we don’t have the money for these things, we can’t make meaningful changes,” Goldoni said.
Omaha State Sen. Christy Armendariz will not seek reelection in 2026

While schools are essential to strong communities and a strong state, she said, there is a lot of “finger-pointing,” adding that a new state commission to review school finance is a good start.
She said her family includes veterans across multiple military branches, including a father who served as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam, a grandfather who taught jungle warfare in Panama and another grandfather who fought in World War II in Italy. She was disappointed this spring that the Legislature, citing financial pressures, delayed a bipartisan “veterans justice program” meant to give all veterans legal support, a funding decision Armendariz helped push for in the budgeting process.
“I think that we need to do more than just shout mottos and give bumper stickers,” Goldoni said.
Goldoni described Legislative District 18 as a “pink district,” calling it one of the state’s most competitive. Also running in the race is Taylor Royal of Bennington, a financial planner who has previously run for Omaha mayor and state treasurer. Goldoni is a registered Democrat. Royal and Armendariz are registered Republicans. Armendariz won the 2022 race with 56% of the vote.
The officially nonpartisan Legislature is currently split 33-15 between Republicans and Democrats, plus one additional nonpartisan progressive. It takes 33 votes to end debate on often contentious bills.

Goldoni describes herself as a moderate Democrat and said she feels the Legislature needs lawmakers willing to drop “party absolutes” and come together with an open mind to listen.
“You’re fighting over principles and identity politics, and we’re getting distracted and we’re not actually helping people take care of their families and take care of their households,” Goldoni said. “I think that pragmatism and problem-solving leadership is desperately needed.”
Goldoni said she has sat around tables with people she has disagreed with but found a path forward and hopes to engage people who are tuning out of politics at “alarming rates.”
“I was one of them. I was jaded,” Goldoni said. “But I’m not one to give up. I’m not one to back down. And I don’t think we always need to fight.”
The top two vote-getters in the May 2026 primary will advance to the November 2026 general election.

(Photo by  via Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)Days after the federal government approved millions for Florida law enforcement partnering with ICE, Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet approved the first $14 million of a $250 million state grant to fund immigration enforcement.
Fifty-six agencies’ applications for the costs of compensating officers, transporting undocumented immigrants, and buying new equipment like restraints was roundly approved by DeSantis and the three Cabinet members, who also serve as the new State Board of Immigration Enforcement.
“Today was just the State Board of Immigration grant[ing] the money that the Legislature allocated for the immigration enforcement activity,” said Mark Glass, commissioner of Florida Department of Law Enforcement, following the meeting. The board was created during a special session earlier this year within the FDLE, including a $250 million chest for the new immigration enforcement.
The money totals $14,073,042, including 14 grant awards for transportation adding up to $1,259,525. Some of the money will go to bonuses, detention beds, bullet-proof vests, AI-assisted translation software, and license-plate readers, the News Service of Florida reported.
The initial approval of state money came just days after Immigration and Customs Enforcement publicly touted more than $38 million federal dollars for Florida’s state and local law enforcement agencies working with ICE in partnerships called 287(g) agreements. That money will be used to federally reimburse officers for equipment and transportation costs associated with immigration enforcement.
Florida’s special session, which yielded both the State Board of Immigration Enforcement and its hefty tranche, also mandated that all counties and county sheriffs enter into these agreements. These partnerships allow lower-levels law enforcement to act as federal immigration officials, including arresting, detaining, and prosecuting noncitizens.
As money starts rolling in, Florida is still waiting for an at-minimum $245 million federal reimbursement for the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center located in the heart of the Everglades. Florida’s emergency management agency applied for the roughly $600 million in the Detention Support Grant Program housed under FEMA.
Although DeSantis has vowed that the federal reimbursement is en route, FEMA has said it would award the money by today — and no involved state or federal agencies have responded to the Florida Phoenix’s requests as to whether FEMA will approve Florida’s request.

Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)Journalists and other staff of the state’s largest network of independent news and media outlets have voted to join the News Guild of Maine, expanding the Maine Trust for Local News’ unionized workforce and extending labor protections to workers who said they had been subject to pay disparities and more vulnerable to layoffs.
According to a release from the Guild, the National Labor Relations Board tallied the results Monday and found workers voted 34-1 to join the union.
Guild President Megan Gray, an arts and culture reporter at the Portland Press Herald, said in a statement that the vote “confirms what we already knew: Our coworkers want to join the News Guild of Maine. They want to have the same voice and the same bargaining power as their peers across the company.”
The Guild, which is affiliated with the Communications Workers of America, already represented about 150 workers at the Trust’s papers and now includes the 50 or so remaining non-union jobs at the Sun Journal in Lewiston, The Times Record in Brunswick and the Trust’s other 17 weekly publications. Workers at the daily Kennebec Journal are represented by a separate branch of the CWA and are in the process of merging with the guild.
The Guild filed an election petition with the National Labor Relations Board in August after the nonprofit Trust, a subsidiary of the Colorado-based National Trust for Local News, declined to voluntarily recognize the expanded union. The Trust did not respond to a request for comment by publication.
Maine Trust for Local News workers rally to expand their union

At a rally last month launching the union drive, several Trust staff highlighted the pay gap between Guild members and those who remained unrepresented. 
Paul Bagnall, who has worked as a full time reporter in Maine since 2022 and now works at The Times Record, said he makes $18 per hour as a nonunion reporter while his unionized colleagues at the Press Herald start at a minimum of $28.75 per hour.
“With the cost of living going up, my paycheck has already stretched to a breaking point,” Bagnall said. “I am currently priced out of potential sources of information — going out to events, restaurants and cafes due to the cost of living — and it’s still rising.” 
Kendra Caruso, a staff writer at the Sun Journal covering health, said, “Those of us who are not represented have little influence over the environment in which we work. That changes today. Today we demand equal pay, equal respect and the same job securities that our represented colleagues have.”
Gray, the Guild president, said Tuesday that the expanded union looks forward to negotiating a contract “that isn’t rooted in old models but reflects who we are today.”
“Under nonprofit ownership, we are building a business model that could be a roadmap to sustainability for local news organizations across the country,” she added. “We are here because we are invested in that future. But we need the Maine Trust to invest in ours too.”
Maine Morning Star is a nonprofit outlet affiliated with the national organization States Newsroom. It is not a part of the Maine Trust for Local News.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Anyone looking for a COVID shot for themselves or their kids in Louisiana is facing a new maze of pharmacy restrictions after changing federal guidance on the vaccine.
Large chain pharmacies, including Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens, started requiring prescriptions for the vaccine this month for anyone under the age of 65 in Louisiana and 15 other states, including Alabama and Mississippi.
And each chain has its own rules for children — if they’re offering them at all. It’s a significant change from last year, when anyone could walk into a pharmacy and get a COVID shot on demand, one that’s causing confusion and delays in getting vaccinated.
“It’s as clear as mud,” said Dr. Matthew Morvant, owner of Downtown Drugs, a family-owned independent pharmacy in Covington, Louisiana. “No one knows the correct information.”
In Louisiana, Walmart said its pharmacies aren’t administering COVID vaccines to anyone under 17 — even with a prescription.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In a statement to the Gulf States Newsroom, Walmart said it is following “guidance outlined by the state,” but did not point to the specific guidance. The Louisiana Department of Health website says children as young as six months are eligible. LDH has not responded to a request for comment. At one New Orleans Walmart location, a pharmacist advised patients to travel to Mississippi to get the shot.
Children five and older can receive a COVID vaccine with a prescription at CVS, according to a statement from Kara Page, the manager for corporate communications. She said that was based on state pharmacy law, which states that pharmacists can administer vaccines without a prescription when they are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A Walgreens pharmacist confirmed children five and older can get a COVID immunization with a prescription, but Walgreens corporate office did not respond to a request for comment. The Louisiana Board of Pharmacy did not respond to multiple requests for clarification.
Children under five typically receive vaccinations from a physician’s office. But it’s unclear how many people have been unable to get themselves or their children vaccinated amid the confusion.
Jennifer Herricks, founder of Louisiana Families for Vaccines and advocacy director of American Families for Vaccines, said she’s heard of people having trouble getting the vaccine, describing it as a patchwork of policies for families across the state.
Dr. Jennifer Avegno, who heads the New Orleans Health Department, said she’s getting calls and texts from people saying they had a prescription, went to their local pharmacy — usually one of the big chain pharmacies — and were told they can’t receive the vaccine because of restrictions.
“I’m hearing nothing but confusion, and it’s not just for kids,” Avegno said. “Each store manager is interpreting it differently and maybe each pharmacist is interpreting it differently. In the absence of standard guidance, that’s what happens.”
That can leave vulnerable patients unprotected.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
An ‘enormous confusion’
Part of the confusion stems from overlapping layers of authority and shifting recommendations.
Last month, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Food and Drug Administration changed its COVID vaccine recommendation, approving it for anyone 65 and older, or those with underlying conditions with a prescription.
Then last week, Kennedy’s remade vaccine panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, kept existing recommendations for COVID shots for anyone 6 months and older, but with an emphasis on “individual decision-making.” That should mean insurance can cover immunizations for anyone six months and older, according to HHS.
“They have created this enormous confusion. [It’s a] failure at the national level to harmonize that recommendation in a way so that everybody knows what’s happening,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
COVID vaccines are safe and effective, Benjamin said, and getting one should be no more difficult than getting a flu shot. But conflicting messaging has left providers, insurers and patients uncertain — and pharmacies making their own rules.
“A lot of the pharmacies are simply saying, let’s take the safe route. Let’s authorize it for the people that we know we can do it for, that we can get paid for,” Benjamin said. “Everybody’s basically covering their — you pick the word — in doing this.”
Dr. Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician and chief medical officer with the Association of Immunization Managers, a national public health non-profit, said limiting access has real consequences. When faced with barriers and confusion, people may simply give up.
“If someone who wants to be protected against COVID-19 goes to one pharmacy and is told that they can’t get that vaccine, or goes to their medical provider and is [told] that they cannot get that vaccination there, there’s only just so many times they’re going to try,” Fiscus said. “Ultimately, it’s the patient who ends up suffering from a disease that they actually wanted to prevent with a vaccine.”
‘The plan is to deter’
Morvant, the Covington pharmacist, said he typically administers flu or COVID vaccines for 40 to 60 people a day during peak illness seasons.
For COVID vaccination, the process used to be simple. Patients would walk in, provide insurance and basic medical history and receive the vaccine within minutes.
Now, requiring a prescription adds hurdles even for adults. Morvant has proactively contacted local doctors to issue blanket prescriptions. If a patient arrives without one, he’ll call their provider directly. Larger chains, he said, aren’t likely to take those extra steps.
He believes the prescription requirement is a deliberate barrier.
“The plan is to deter,” he said. “Some people think the COVID vaccine is dangerous. And if they think that, I would say, then just don’t get it. If 1% doesn’t want it, that’s fine, then don’t take it. But don’t block the other 99% from getting it. That’s just stupid.”
Louisiana’s political climate adds another layer. State Surgeon General Ralph Abraham has been outspoken in his criticism of COVID vaccines, especially for children. In an official LDH statement earlier this year, Abraham called CDC guidance for vaccinating children “woefully out of touch with reality.”
In a September op-ed for The Center Square, Abraham went further, writing that “virtually every parent in the U.S. understands that COVID-19 shots for healthy children are a very bad idea,” and praised federal limits under Kennedy’s HHS.
That skepticism at the top of Louisiana’s health department stands in sharp contrast with the overwhelming consensus of medical research and national recommendations. Last Friday, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices reaffirmed that COVID vaccines should remain available to anyone six months and older.
For Morvant, who knows his patients personally, the stakes are even more stark.
“I’m gonna tell you what happens when people don’t get vaccinated for it,” he said. “People will die. And if they don’t, they’re going to end up in the ICU and they’re not going to be the same person when they come out.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The ACLU of Florida has sued Gov. Ron DeSantis on behalf of a Tampa voter, challenging his refusal to call a special election to fill a vacancy in the Florida Senate left when he appointed Jay Collins as lieutenant governor.
The lawsuit, filed in state Circuit Court in Leon County, alleges that the governor has violated his duty under the Florida Constitution and state law by failing to call a special election. Florida’s Senate District 14 seat in Hillsborough County has been without representation since DeSantis selected Collins to serve as lieutenant governor on Aug. 12, some 48 days ago.
The lawsuit notes that in more than 25 instances, the governor took fewer than five days to call for an election upon a vacancy in a congressional or legislative seat. When then-GOP state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia resigned from his Senate District 11 seat on July 18 after being appointed chief financial officer, the governor took just four days to call a special election for that seat (the primary election takes place today).
But more often of late, the lawsuit alleges, the governor has “often chosen to deviate from Florida’s longstanding practice of timely special elections, in violation of his mandatory statutory duty.”
The most egregious delay in calling for an election was in April 2021, after South Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings died, the complaint says. DeSantis waited a month before setting the congressional special election for Jan. 11, 2022, more than nine months after Hastings’s death.
The ACLU of Florida went to court on behalf of voters in Santa Rosa and Brevard counties voters earlier this year, alleging the governor was failing his constitutional obligation to call special elections for the vacant Florida House District 3 and Senate District 19 seats. Those two seats had become vacant following resignations of two state lawmakers to run in special congressional elections.
“I’m not sure why the governor proves himself repeatedly unwilling to call timely special elections,” said Nicholas Warren, staff attorney for the ACLU of Florida, in a press release. “His predecessors like Jeb Bush and Rick Scott always acted swiftly to ensure citizens retained their voice in government. Governor DeSantis’ refusal to follow their example is not just concerning, it’s also against the law.”
Tampa resident Cort Lippe is the petitioner in the case. In a press release, he said Tampa “deserves full representation in the Legislature. By refusing to call a special election, the governor is denying us that right and ignoring decades of established precedent. It’s illegal and wrong.”
The lawsuit notes that with committee hearings scheduled to begin next week in Tallahassee and the regular session on Jan. 13, “[u]nless the Governor sets a special election very soon, Petitioner and other district residents will go without representation for the entirely of the interim committee weeks and 2026 session.”
Senate District 14 was considered a swing seat when DeSantis recruited Collins to run against then-Democratic incumbent Janet Cruz in 2022. Collins ended up winning that race by 10 points.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Ty Theurer resigned Monday as superintendent of Comanche County schools amid public outrage over allegations he sexually harassed and inappropriately touched a student.
School board member Dean Yoder confirmed the board accepted Theurer’s resignation at a special meeting and named Michael Baldwin as the interim superintendent.
Baldwin previously served as superintendent and was given a two-year deal, Yoder said.
“Everyone’s familiar with him, and it just kind of a calming aspect to maybe put everyone at a little bit of ease now and move forward,” Yoder said.
Earlier this month, Kansas Reflector reported on Theurer’s behavior during the spring semester in his capacity as the South Central High School golf coach. Theurer admitted in a signed statement, obtained by Kansas Reflector, that he told a girl to grip a club like a penis and that he had held the back of her thigh, hips, waist and shoulder — purportedly to improve her golf posture.
Theurer, who faced additional allegations from other students, stepped down as golf coach but remained as district superintendent. School board president Kelly Herd and others tried to protect Theurer, despite law enforcement and Title IX investigations.
Kansas Reflector reported that Herd tried to quash community backlash by refusing to let a parent speak about the allegations at a school board meeting and by instructing other board members that they should stay quiet on the subject. Yoder was an outlier among board members in voicing his concerns.
On Sept. 3, a day after Kansas Reflector published its investigative report, more than 100 community members packed a school board meeting in the small, southwest Kansas town of Coldwater and loudly criticized the board’s handling of the students’ complaints. The board placed Theurer on paid administrative leave during that meeting.
Several weeks later, on Sept. 21, 10 bullets were fired into Herd’s unoccupied vehicle while it was parked in front of her home.
Yoder said 10-15 people attended the school board’s special meeting Monday night. He wouldn’t talk about the details of Theurer’s resignation, which the board discussed during a closed session.
What happens next?
“Healing,” Yoder said. “We try and earn the community’s trust back. I’m not sure we can do it, but we’re trying to get their trust back.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Comanche-County-school-board-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-30 11:59:38.023872
,Mississippi Today,2025-09-30 14:52:36+00:00,Mississippi Today,Capitol Police face federal lawsuit in fatal shooting,Jerry Mitchell,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/30/capitol-police-face-federal-lawsuit-in-fatal-shooting/,"The mother of a man killed by Capitol Police has filed a federal lawsuit, seeking damages and policy reform.","The mother of Jaylen Lewis, killed by Capitol Police officers in 2022, is now suing them and others in federal court.
In March, a Hinds County grand jury indicted the then-officers Michael Lamar Rhinewalt and Steven Frederick Jr. on a manslaughter charge in the Sept. 25, 2022, death of the 25-year-old. Both were part of the crime suppression Flex Unit.
“Jaylen Lewis should be alive today,” said Bobby DiCello, a partner in the law firm DiCello Levitt, which is representing the Lewis family. “The actions of these officers were not just reckless — they were unconscionable and indefensible. Jaylen was a devoted father with his whole life ahead of him, and his family deserves justice. We are committed to fighting for accountability, transparency and meaningful reform, so that no other family in Jackson has to endure this kind of heartbreak.”
The lawsuit, filed last week in U.S. District Court in Jackson, seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for “the willful, reckless and malicious conduct of defendants.” The lawsuit, which represents one side of a legal argument, also seeks reforms “to ensure the Capitol Police adopt and enforce policies that prevent future tragedies,” DiCello said.
According to the indictment, Frederick and Rhinewalt said one of them shot Lewis because it “was necessary to protect himself from great bodily harm or death at the hands of Lewis,” but the indictment concluded that was “not a reasonable belief under the circumstances.”
The lawsuit also accuses the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, which oversees the Capitol Police, of permitting “officers who have engaged in excessive force or unreasonable violence toward citizens to avoid the consequences of discipline.”
Spokesperson Bailey C. Martin responded, “We have not yet had the opportunity to review the claims, and the Mississippi Department of Public Safety does not comment on pending litigation.”
An investigation by Mississippi Today has uncovered that Col. Steven Maxwell, then-director of the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics, rejected hiring both officers, but Capitol Police, also part of the Department of Public Safety, hired them.
Rhinewalt and Frederick at the time of the fatal shooting were conducting a drug narcotics operation when they saw a white Jeep Cherokee turn north on West Street in Jackson driven by Lewis, who had a female passenger.

After the officers saw the Cherokee run a red light at Stonewall Street, they turned on their police lights and pulled Lewis over and blocked him from going forward with his car.
Lewis wound up reversing his car and bumping into the police cruiser behind his vehicle, according to the lawsuit. “Jaylen does not brandish a weapon, reach for a weapon, make any violent gestures, threaten anyone, or take any other actions that could be reasonably perceived as endangering officers or others.”
After this, Frederick and Rhinewalt opened fire into the Cherokee, shooting Lewis in the head and killing him, according to the lawsuit. 
As a result, his family has “endured pain, anguish, embarrassment, humiliation, feelings of powerlessness, harm to self-esteem, emotional distress, fear, anxiety, emotional agony, loss of support, loss of companionship, loss of sense of personal safety [and] dignity,” the lawsuit says.
The state Legislature expanded the jurisdiction of Capitol Police beyond the state Capitol in the city of Jackson. “The shift in jurisdiction drastically altered the role of Capitol Police from limited security to full-spectrum urban policing,” according to the lawsuit. “The expansion coincided with a surge in high-intensity encounters, including pursuits, officer-involved shootings, and use-of-force complaints.”
Within the first six months of the Capitol Police beginning to patrol the expanded area, officers shot at least four citizens. “In each case, there were questions about whether officers followed constitutional standards regarding lethal force and pursuit justification,” according to the lawsuit.
A month before Lewis was killed, Capitol Police officers opened fire on a car, striking a passenger in the head. That victim, Sherita Harris, was taken to the hospital where she had surgery to remove bullet fragments from her head. She survived but now has “permanent neurological and facial injuries,” according to the lawsuit.
A grand jury indicted Rhinewalt and another officer, Jeffrey Walker, for aggravated assault in that case. According to the lawsuit, no weapon was recovered from the car.
Walker also faces federal charges for allegedly violating the civil rights of a handcuffed man by slamming his head into the hood of a car and kicking him in the head and face in July 2022.
Frederick, the son-in-law of Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey, totaled his Capitol Police Ford F-150 on U.S. 49 South in Covington County on March 12, 2023. He flunked the DUI field test with a .15 score, nearly twice the legal limit of .08. He was handcuffed and arrested. He was released without bond into Bailey’s custody.
Five months later, Frederick dodged conviction when a state trooper failed to appear for the court hearing, and the judge dismissed the DUI charge.
State authorities have learned that a prosecutor, who wasn’t from Covington County, said Bailey called him and asked him what would happen if a trooper didn’t show up for a DUI hearing and the prosecutor replied that the case would be dismissed.
Bailey has denied these allegations. “Whoever said that I talked to a prosecutor is a liar,” he told WLBT. “That is a completely false lie.”
The sheriff admitted he spoke to the trooper, Clay Loftin, but denied trying to influence him. He said he spoke to Loftin a “handful” of times and told the trooper to “do his job.”
Authorities have also learned that after the wreck, Bailey reportedly telephoned Frederick’s supervisor at Capitol Police, Porfirio Grimaldo, telling him that he should keep Frederick on the force because “the DUI has been taken care of.” 
Contacted for comment, Grimaldo referred all questions to the lawyers for the Department of Public Safety. They wouldn’t comment on it, and neither would Bailey’s lawyer, Jason Dare.
The sheriff told WLBT, “I can swear on a stack of Bibles, I did not ask anyone for any help on that just because I knew the finger would be pointed at me because of that, and you know, let things take their course naturally. I hate that it happened to him (Frederick) because he is a good guy.”
Frederick resigned three days after the wreck “to prevent termination,” according to his certification records. He had worked for Capitol Police less than eight months and paid nothing toward the Ford F-150 he totaled.
A year and a half after Frederick demolished his Capitol Police truck, he wrecked another patrol vehicle, this time as a deputy for Scott County. The sheriff there has said Frederick no longer works there.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/15095510/AP23065838626676.jpg,,,2025-09-30 10:57:43.258640

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — State Sen. Christy Armendariz plans to not seek reelection to her northwest Omaha seat in 2026, a decision she confirmed and said is rooted in finances for a $12,000-a-year position.
Armendariz, 58, said she signed up knowing about the legislative pay before the 2022 election for an open Legislative District 18 seat. She thought she could juggle both her legislative duties and her full-time job as a strategic sourcing specialist at Nebraska Methodist Health System. She gave up her job at the beginning of this year.
“I just need to go make money,” Armendariz told the Nebraska Examiner on Monday. “I can’t afford to serve a second time.”

Legislative pay
Legislative pay is locked in the Nebraska Constitution, requiring a vote of the people to change. An effort to increase legislative pay to $22,500 failed resoundingly in 2012, and recent efforts stalled, too, often bringing political baggage for any lawmaker proposing the change. 
Legislative salaries last increased from $300 a month (or $4,800 annually) to $1,000 a month (or $12,000 annually) in 1988. Lawmakers receive mileage reimbursements and daily per diems but do not receive health insurance or other benefits.
During debate in March on the latest proposal seeking voter approval for creating a citizen commission to more frequently update legislative pay, Armendariz said she approached former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom, her predecessor, about the need to keep her full-time job. She said that during her first two years in office, she worked 6:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. during the week and often on weekends.
But Armendariz said continuing to juggle her duties wasn’t sustainable and it had put a strain on her family. She said she also wasn’t giving “100%” to her constituents or her full-time position.
“It just isn’t my nature to do anything partway,” Armendariz said at the time.

Armendariz had argued during that debate that she understood the post is essentially a “volunteer position.” She told her colleagues it would be better for the people to set a ceiling on legislative pay, any increase of which would require legislative funding to match. The proposed constitutional amendment stalled in 2025 but could resurface in 2026.
“I know how much serving pays, and I was OK with that,” Armendariz said this week. “When I got in, [it was] just a different situation, thinking that I could try to juggle a job with it, and that didn’t prove to be something I could do.”
Legislative record
Armendariz has served on the Appropriations Committee, where she became vice chair in January, and she currently serves as chair of the Legislature’s Committee on Committees, an internal group that at the start of each two-year legislative cycle sets committee assignments. The committee also gives assignments to appointees following legislative vacancies.
State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Other lawmakers and lobbyists told the Examiner in recent weeks that Armendariz had decided not to run. Of her record, some said that while she might be quiet on the legislative floor, they highlighted her committee work, particularly in asking thoughtful, sometimes probing questions during the budget-writing process.
Armendariz has introduced seven bills in her tenure, carrying the fewest of her colleagues each year. Four of those passed either as part of the state budget or with other proposals. One 2025 bill could return in 2026, on whether the state’s option enrollment program — for a family to apply to send a student to a different school district than they live in — could be used to expand school choice.
Her Legislative Bill 557 would give any family $2,500 for the educational support of a student whose option enrollment application is rejected. It set no funding cap. 
State Sens. Christy Armendariz of Omaha and Loren Lippincott of Central City. June 6, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Armendariz said she intended to narrow the bill to students who qualify for free and reduced-priced lunch (185% of the federal poverty level) or are in “failing schools,” defined by state test scores. Armendariz grew up in North Omaha, a neighboring legislative district that was one of five in the state to vote to keep the state’s most recent school voucher program.
“Really, it’s to give more kids in failing schools some sort of an out,” Armendariz said in January of her bill, adding it “might be a drop in the bucket” of what some people would need.
LB 557 did not advance from the Education Committee in 2025, but it could return next year.
Armendariz has also used her “priority” designation to help other legislation be scheduled, such as in 2023, for former State Sen. Tom Briese of Albion (now state treasurer) to fund an “efficiency review” of state government; in 2024, for State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte to advance a law to infuse an estimated $1 billion in federal funding for Nebraska hospitals; and in 2025, for State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont to increase State Fire Marshal fees that had lagged.
‘Blessing of information’
Reflecting on her service, Armendariz said she ideally would like more people to get the chance to serve as an elected official, gaining insights that she said aren’t available outside of service.
Armendariz said she initially ran because of political polarization, still retaining the belief that the country needs to minimize the impact of being so polarized. She said many belief systems overlap but that some people too often focus on the few issues that cause division.
“They’re elevated at an exponential level that I think is very detrimental to us as people that live in this country. Still believe that,” Armendariz said.
“Serving and serving all different kinds of people and learning the process has just been a blessing of information that I’m grateful that I got the opportunity to learn.”

(New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute screenshot)Drug-related deaths in New Hampshire fell 33.4% from 2023 to 2024, the sharpest decrease in over a decade, according to a new study from the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute.
In 2024, there were approximately 287 drug-related deaths, according to the study. There were 431 in 2023. The study suggests the downward trend in deaths could continue. Preliminary data from 2025 shows an estimated 77 drug-related deaths in the first six months of the year, which is down from 122 in the first six months of 2024.
2024 was the second consecutive year of drug fatality decreases in New Hampshire, following an 11.5% decrease from 2022 to 2023.
The data suggests something of a recovery from the height of the opioid crisis that has ravaged New Hampshire and other parts of the U.S. In 2017, drug deaths peaked at 490 deaths, according to NHFPI’s report. Of those deaths, 424 were opioid-related, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, putting New Hampshire in the top five most affected states per capita. The report also notes the current sharp decline contrasts with the spikes during the crisis. From 2013 to 2014, New Hampshire saw a 72.7% increase in drug-related deaths.
Opioids still remain the biggest driver of drug deaths; 86.3% of the deaths involved opioids. 
New Hampshire isn’t alone in the declining rate of opioid-related deaths. The entire U.S. saw a 25.9% decrease from 2023 to 2024 while neighboring Massachusetts, Vermont, and Maine saw 36.4%, 25.5%, and 20.7% decreases, respectively, during the same time period.
The study attributes continued investments in substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery services for the decrease in deaths. New Hampshire invested more than $834.7 million in such services. Of that money, 73% came from the federal government, 22.5% from the state, and 4.5% from an opioid settlement fund that pharmaceutical companies involved in fueling the crisis for financial gain were forced by courts to pay to states for remediation efforts.
Medicaid, which is the largest payer for substance use disorder treatment in the country, is a large driver of the federal funding. The program paid for 21% of all U.S. substance use disorder treatment and 7.2% of all non-senior adults on Medicaid have been diagnosed with a substance use disorder, according to analysis of recent years’ Medicaid claims data by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Medicaid was expanded in New Hampshire in 2014, but the program’s future remains uncertain after cuts in the budget reconciliation bill passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump. The federal government also provided financial assistance by way of a series of grants aimed at ending the crisis.
Behind Medicaid, the Governor’s Commission on Addiction, Treatment, and Prevention is the largest source of funding to reduce drug fatalities. The state commission provided $74.3 million over the past decade..
New Hampshire has thus far spent 49.7% of the $95.8 million it received via the settlement funds, with case management for those incarcerated, more recovery centers, and additional social workers for correctional departments and police stations among the investments.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — CoreCivic signed a new contract valued at $60 million a year with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house migrant detainees at its Leavenworth facility, but the agreement won’t take effect until legal issues are resolved.
The company announced the new contract, which began Sept. 7, in a news release Monday. It replaces a six-month ICE contract in effect since March 7. 
The new contract is for a fixed monthly amount and then additional payments based on the number of detainees held in the facility, which can house up to 1,033. It will not begin until the temporary injunction put in place by a Kansas district court is “no longer enforceable,” the release said. 
CoreCivic and the city of Leavenworth have been arguing in court whether the Nashville-based private prison company must follow the city’s development process and apply for a special use permit before reopening. 
As part of those court procedures, CoreCivic was stopped from taking ICE detainees until the legal disagreement was settled. CoreCivic is appealing that decision. 
The press release said the company cannot predict if or when legal issues will be resolved. 
The news release also announced a separate ICE contract for CoreCivic’s 2,560-bed California City Immigration Process Center, located in Kern County, California. Like Leavenworth’s Midwest Regional Reception Center, that facility has been vacant. 
“Once fully activated, these two facilities are expected to generate combined annual revenue of nearly $200 million,” CoreCivic president and COO Patrick Swindle said in the news release. “While the intake process has been delayed at the Midwest Regional Reception Center, we will offer newly hired employees opportunities to be redeployed at our other activations until the legal challenges are resolved.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CoreCivic-full-bldg-1024x533.jpg,,,2025-09-30 10:57:43.258640

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A top official for the U.S. Department of the Interior has revoked a legal opinion that formed part of the legal basis for two new casino-like tribal gaming halls in Alaska, putting their future in question.
On Thursday, Deputy Secretary Kate MacGregor declared that she had overruled the opinion, which was issued during the Biden administration and challenged in court by the state of Alaska. 
Writing in a memo to the head of the National Indian Gaming Commission and the top attorney at the Interior Department, MacGregor said that the Biden-era opinion “does not reflect the best interpretation of applicable law.”
The opinion overruled by MacGregor applied only to Alaska and declared that tribal authority applied under many circumstances to land allotments that were given to individual Alaska Natives by the federal government.
That’s a system similar to what’s in place in the Lower 48.
The state of Alaska opposed that view, holding to the position that the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 extinguished almost all “Indian Country” in Alaska and that the state holds primary jurisdiction over land owned by Alaska Natives, Alaska Native corporations and Alaska tribes, with the exception of the Metlakatla Indian Community.
Millions of acres potentially affected
The settlement act left almost all Alaska tribes with no federal trust land on which to exert sovereignty. There are, however, more than 17,000 parcels of up to 160 acres that have been granted to individual Alaska Natives since 1906 and are held in federal trust. Collectively, they represent as much as 5 million acres of land.
Until the Biden-era opinion, it was believed that most — if not all — of that land was outside tribal jurisdiction. After the opinion, the Native Village of Eklutna and the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska went ahead with plans to build casino-like facilities on allotments in their traditional territory. It was the first significant move to take advantage of the new interpretation of federal law.
The Native Village of Eklutna opened the Chin’an Gaming Hall in Birchwood, outside Anchorage, earlier this year. The Tlingit and Haida gaming hall, on Douglas Island, is under construction.
Now that the Biden-era opinion has been revoked, it isn’t clear whether the gaming halls are legal. 
It’s still possible — albeit much more difficult — for tribes to exert jurisdiction over an allotment. But before the Biden administration’s opinion, Eklutna and the Tlingit and Haida Central Council had tried for decades to open casino-like gaming halls on allotments and had their applications rejected.
Before the Biden administration changed things, only Klawock and Metlakatla could operate casinos, and because of state laws regulating gaming, they do not offer table games like poker and blackjack. Instead, rows of slot-machine-like electronic devices fill their gaming halls.
That’s what can be seen in Birchwood and what is expected at the casino in Juneau. 
MacGregor’s Sep. 25 memo says any action taken by the Interior Department or the National Indian Gaming Commission — which regulates gaming halls and casinos on tribal land — “should be reevaluated in accordance with this revocation.”
Birchwood gaming hall remains open
Aaron Leggett, President of the Native Village of Eklutna, said afterward in a written statement that its tribal gaming hall “remains open for our guests and continues to provide meaningful benefits to our Tribe, the surrounding community, and our state.”
Eklutna sought to build the gaming hall to provide jobs and an economic boost for tribal members and the local community, according to tribal leaders..
Leggett said the tribe is reviewing the new order.
A spokesperson for Tlingit and Haida declined to say whether construction will continue on its gaming hall, which is located on Douglas Island, on a road that leads to Juneau’s municipal ski area.
“Tlingit & Haida is aware of the U.S. Department of the Interior action to withdraw the solicitor’s decision. We also anticipated the action,” said Tlingit and Haida President Richard Peterson in a prepared statement. “We are reviewing internally and remain committed to exercising our Tribal sovereignty to preserve sovereignty, enhance economic and cultural resources and promote self-sufficiency and self-governance for Tribal citizens.”
State attorney general pleased by decision
The state of Alaska opposed the Biden-era opinion and has repeatedly fought the Native Village of Eklutna in court over its plans to open a tribally operated gaming hall.
Alaska Attorney General-designee Stephen Cox expressed support for the reversal in a written statement.
“We are encouraged that (the Department of the) Interior has returned to a position grounded in Alaska’s unique history. The Supreme Court has often said, ‘Alaska is the exception, not the rule.’ Today’s action respects that principle and restores the jurisdictional balance Congress intended and courts have repeatedly affirmed,” Cox said.
Asked to clarify whether the state believes that the Eklutna and Juneau casinos are now illegal, Department of Law spokeswoman Patty Sullivan said by email that MacGregor’s memo calls for a re-evaluation.
“Therefore,” she said, “it is for Interior to undertake the re-evaluation process and for the state to see the result of that re-evaluation process.”
It’s also not known how the new decision will affect two in-progress lawsuits that have challenged the Eklutna gaming hall. One suit, filed by neighboring landowners, is being considered by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals after a lower-court ruling went in favor of Eklutna.
A second lawsuit, filed by the state of Alaska against Eklutna, is on hold, pending the result of the Ninth Circuit case. 
Tlingit and Haida’s gaming hall has not yet been the subject of lawsuits, but attorneys and other observers familiar with the issue say they expect that hall will be the subject of litigation as well.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/240604-Celebration-copy-1024x607.jpg,,,2025-09-30 10:57:43.258640

And in the immediate echo of O.J Simpson’s “not guilty,” their subsequent murder convictions, decades of incarceration and new shot at freedom continue to bring intense media scrutiny — from CourtTV to YouTube to Netflix and Kim Kardashian.
So why would their recent parole hearings draw any less attention? 
Thousands of parole proceedings go largely unnoticed each year. But on Aug. 21 and 22, the Menendez hearings brought heightened focus to what is normally a standard procedure that, in theory, balances concerns for public safety against giving offenders a genuine second chance opportunity.
The outcome of each brother’s hearing was not surprising. Both received three-year denials, which are common.
But when the list of attendees includes Gov. Gavin Newsom’s spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo — as well as the Board of Parole Hearings Executive Officer Scott Wyckoff and a Los Angeles Times reporter to update dozens of other news outlets — a common event turns almost circus-like.
“Sometimes the story or the myth behind the case comes to dominate the conversation about the case,” said UC Law San Francisco professor Hadar Aviram, an expert in parole procedures. She added that those myths “Sometimes completely (eclipse) the actual people who were involved in the case.” an expert in parole procedures. Aviram is the author of “Yesterday’s Monsters“, which documents attempts by Manson Family members to gain parole.
“People who only knew this story (of the Menendez brothers) through the popular culture narrative around this murder experienced it through these very lurid hues portrayed in made-for TV movies and tabloid stories and things like that,” she said.
Last month’s drama peaked as more than a dozen victims – relatives of both the brothers and their parents – were set to testify in support of Lyle on Aug. 22. Then an audio recording of Erik’s hearing the day before was broadcast nationwide, throwing Lyle’s hearing into momentary chaos. 
Audio files are rarely, if ever, made public, and certainly not less than 24 hours after a hearing.
“We are sitting here expecting Mr. (Lyle) Menendez to follow every single rule in order to be released back into the community,” his attorney Heidi Rummel, said during his proceeding. “And in the middle of his hearing, we find out that CDCR’s (the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is) not even following their own rules. It’s outrageous.”
Presiding commissioner Julie Garland paused the hearing to confer privately with Wyckoff, but then conceded that releasing the audio via public records request from an L.A. television station was, indeed, part of the parole board’s plan all along. 
Unlike ordinary hearings, everyone involved in this one knew they would be playing to the media as well.
A governor’s decision
If either Menendez had been found suitable for parole, Newsom eventually would have had to decide whether to veto their release. It’s an executive power exclusive to governors in only two states, California and Oklahoma. Usually, Newsom’s office waits to review official transcripts. This time, Crofts-Pelayo observed both hearings for him from start to finish.
Newsom has chosen to revoke grants of parole to other high profile offenders throughout his time as governor, including Robert F. Kennedy assassin Sirhan Sirhan and Manson Family members Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Bruce Davis.
Parole board commissioners found each of them, all now in their 70s or older, suitable through the appropriate legal process. Newsom cited an “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” and overrode those decisions. Van Houten in 2023 needed the California 2nd District Court of Appeal to overrule the governor and allow her to be released.

Newsom’s intervention may stem more from public perception rather than issues of actual danger. In high profile cases that potentially cause public outcry and huge social media buzz, fairness and safety often become politicized.
“Any politician knows that there’s very little political advantage to be derived from being in favor of prisoners and from releasing people like that that have huge notoriety associated with them,” said Aviram, the legal scholar. “And of course, that’s going to impact the way that the messaging is going to come down from the governor’s mansion.”
Menendez attorney Mark Geragos does not believe the parole board offered the brothers a fair shake, or that the purpose of the lengthy all-day hearings was anything but performative. “It was obviously rigged,” he said. “They were just method actors in a pre-ordained script. This was nonsense.” 
In one important way, however, the brothers may have also benefited from the decades of attention they’ve endured. They were eligible for parole only because they’d recently been resentenced from life without parole through a review process that itself can be arbitrary and subjective.
Attorney and legal analyst Laura Sheppard has represented hundreds of lifers in parole and resentencing hearings. According to her, the Menendez notoriety and their success at resentencing underscores a great discrepancy in how some life without parole offenders get their cases reviewed.
“It also seems to have influenced the parole board and governor’s office to generate a new process to start to make similar relief available to other (life without parole) sentenced offenders who don’t have Erik and Lyle’s notoriety,” said Sheppard.
“That is a wonderful thing, because until then, it looked as though Erik and Lyle’s notoriety was going to gain them an advantage that other similarly situated prisoners without fame or money cannot access.”
The Board of Parole Hearings recently announced a proposed change in regulations that would help formalize how commutations and petitions for resentencing are granted. 
Will Erik and Lyle ever see daylight?
A month after the parole denials, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William C. Ryan dealt the brothers another blow. He ruled that newly reported evidence that corroborates the sexual abuse was not enough to warrant a new trial. 
Barring a Newsom commutation or clemency, a parole board hearing looks to be the only way out of prison for them right now.
Many parole hearings boil down to whether the board believes the individual is being authentic. Is their rehabilitation and personal transformation genuine and substantial? Or is their grasp of self-help mantras and buzzwords merely performative?
For their hearings, Erik and Lyle Menendez each sat alone before a computer screen in the R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, accompanied only  by two correctional officers. Everyone else — commissioners, attorneys and all other parties — participated virtually.
“The purpose of this hearing is not to retry your case, nor is the purpose of this hearing to put your parents on trial,” presiding commissioner Robert Barton told Erik. “The purpose of this hearing is to determine whether or not you currently pose an unreasonable risk to public safety.”
Commissioners questioned each Menendez about the underlying “nexus” of their crime. Successful parole suitability requires offenders to show insight into why they did what they did.
Without relitigating or making excuses, this line of reasoning is an essential component of rehabilitation. If a person doesn’t fully understand the flaws in their thinking that contributed to their criminal decisions, then they are considered far more prone to repeat them. 
“Two things can be true that seem opposite at the same time and yet be true,” Erik Menendez said in explaining his immense fear of his father while also addressing his need to act out and rebel in small ways.

Assessing risk of recidivism
Current legal standards now recognize the rash and impulsive cognitive functions of brains that have not yet fully developed. Most experts agree that age 26 is the threshold for maturity. Erik and Lyle were 18 and 21 at the time of the murders.
In addition to meeting parole eligibility requirements under youth offender statutes based on their age when they committed the murders, both brothers meet elderly parole eligibility criteria based on their age and time served.
“There’s robust evidence for this, that people age out of violent crime in their mid to late 20s, which is to say, folks that are already in their 50s and above, the risk that they personally pose to the public is very minimal,” said Aviram. 
“So we’re kind of pulled in two different directions, right? On one hand, we have the optics of releasing somebody who’s done a long sentence. And on the other hand, we have the reality that despite this person’s notoriety, the actual odds that this person is going to commit more crime are close to zero.”
During the hearings, commissioners spent hours parsing through each brother’s prison record — highlighting documented incidents from as far back as the 90s and asking for detailed explanations. 
Despite comprehensive documentation of their positive accomplishments throughout years of incarceration, each Menendez needed to address negative write-ups for a multitude of rules violations, such as substance abuse, contraband items and misuse of institutional computers. 
Most of the violations occurred before they had any chance at parole or any real incentive to follow correctional department rules.
Many of the violations took place inside some of the worst and most volatile prisons — environments where young men conform to the social norms of their peers or get dealt with violently by those peers. The realistic fear of prison gangs influences their decisions.
From the onset of their incarceration, Erik and Lyle were defined by their notoriety and supposed affluence — quite often becoming the targets of both the prison community and staff.
Hearing records detail how some peers tried to pressure, intimidate and extort them, even physically attack them just for fun. Being known as self-admitted victims of sexual abuse did not help.
Some correctional officers scrutinized their conduct to a higher degree. Others monitored their institutional calls and electronic messages for lucrative information.
Both brothers married women they met through prison correspondence. Their communications and expected visiting schedules were sometimes sold to paparazzi by staff.
‘Not the end’
Housed at separate facilities for two decades, they persevered independently without resorting to violence. They participated in positive programming, achieved college educations and established trauma support groups. Erik worked as a hospice caregiver for years and established programs to help the elderly.
They also purchased and used illegally distributed cell phones and were each written up for the violations as recently as November 2024. Those  violations would prove fateful for parole.
The commissioners had to try and reconcile the good work versus the bad conduct and also acknowledge the wide network of Menendez family victims — close relatives of the murdered parents — who support and endorse Erik and Lyle for parole. Multiple family members corroborate the brothers’ stories of trauma and abuse since birth.
“Two things can be true,” said Commissioner Barton in parroting some of Erik’s words. “They can love and forgive you, and you can still be found unsuitable for parole.
“You can have remorse but still show antisocial traits and criminal behavior.”
The average parole hearing might last two to three hours from start to finish. Each of the Menendez’s went almost 12 hours. At the end of all the questions and answers and testimonials, each brother’s chance at parole hinged mostly on their individual cell phone use. 
“You have been a model inmate in many ways, who has demonstrated the potential for change,” Commissioner Julie Garland said to Lyle. “But despite all those outward positives, we see in two main areas that you still struggle with antisocial personality traits of deception and rationalization, minimization and rule breaking, that continue to lie beneath that positive surface.”
Regardless of the surprise release of the audio files, and over the objections of attorneys and the victims’ family, Lyle’s parole hearing ended much the same as Erik’s.
Each brother received a three-year denial, which leaves open the possibility for a new hearing in 18 months. The parole board usually reviews the previous proceedings to see how the offender responds to assessment and recommendations.
The main priority is to demonstrate consistent disciplinary-free conduct — no write-ups, no rules violations.
“This denial is … not the end,” said Garland. “It is a way for you to spend some time to demonstrate and to practice what you preach about who you are… Don’t be somebody different behind closed doors.”

Charlie Wright
Charlie Wright is chairman of the Kletsel Dehe Wintun Nation.


A stacked deck doesn’t just tilt the odds, it erases fairness. When the powerful and wealthy dictate the terms, smaller voices are silenced and opportunity is denied.
Recently my tribe, the Kletsel Dehe Wintun Nation, received a devastating blow when the California Legislature passed Assembly Bill 831. The measure would ban companies — and tribes that don’t own casinos — from offering online sweepstakes games in California.
Wealthy, mega-casino tribes used their influence to push this legislation, which locks rural and less advantaged tribes out of digital revenue opportunities — the one arena where less economically advantaged tribal nations could compete with them on a more equal footing and begin meeting the basic needs of our people.
To understand why we oppose this bill you need to understand who we are.
Kletsel Dehe is a small Wintun tribe of 295 citizens in Colusa County, about 70 miles north of Sacramento. Like many rural tribes, we face persistent barriers to economic opportunity: Jobs are scarce, infrastructure is limited and isolation entrenches poverty.
More than two decades ago, California voters approved Propositions 5 and 1A, legalizing tribal gaming. Those efforts succeeded because all tribes stood together. Voters believed they were creating opportunity and self-sufficiency for every tribal community. Without that unity, there would be no mega-casinos in California.
But over time, that promise fractured. A handful of tribes with prime locations became ultra wealthy, with billion-dollar casinos, resorts and resources to solve infrastructure needs. These tribes renegotiated compacts, blew past the original 2,000-machine limit and some even expanded into Las Vegas.
Meanwhile, dozens of other tribes opened smaller casinos in less profitable locations, keeping their governments afloat but generating only modest revenue. 
And non-gaming tribes like mine, without prime casino locations, were locked into a flat $1.1 million annual stipend from the revenue sharing trust fund. The amount hasn’t changed in 25 years, though inflation has cut its real value in half. 
When wealthy tribes argue for laws like AB 831, they sometimes invoke “tribal struggles” — as if all tribes share the same reality. Many tribes resolved those challenges years ago, while rural and small-market tribes continue to face them every day.
We do not begrudge their success. But it’s unfair and hypocritical for these well-off tribes to now argue that our partnerships with social gaming companies threaten sovereignty. 
Their own casinos were built with outside vendors, Wall Street financing and non-tribal management contracts. To deny smaller tribes the same tools is not about sovereignty. It’s about monopoly.
Other states have found more equitable paths. In Washington, for example, tribes can lease unused gaming machine rights to each other. This ensures that every tribe, gaming or not, has a real stake in the industry. 
California took the opposite approach, a frozen stipend for the many, and unlimited expansion for the few. AB 831 extends that inequity into the digital era, cutting off innovation before it can begin.
To be clear, the wealthiest tribes are already preparing for digital gaming. They’re building social gaming platforms so when iGaming is legalized, they will dominate once again.
The rest of us will be left outside, still waiting for meaningful access to the opportunities voters thought they gave all tribes 25 years ago.
Politics often comes down to how deep your pockets are. But less wealthy tribes like mine are done being told to stay quiet while opportunity passes us by. 
The courage to challenge a stacked deck, even when the odds are against you, changes systems and forces fairness back into the rules. 
California gaming was built on unity. AB 831 betrays that legacy.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/092625-Casino-Slot-Machines-IS-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-30 08:57:29.250173

Even more funding is at stake going forward for UC campuses.,"In summary
A federal judge sided with UCLA in ordering the Trump administration to restore hundreds of health and science research grants. Even more funding is at stake going forward for UC campuses.


The Trump administration has restored almost all of the 500 National Institutes of Health grants it suspended at UCLA in July in response to a federal judge’s order last week.
Attorneys in the U.S. Department of Justice submitted a court-mandated update on the status of the grant restorations Monday evening. They report that the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, has restored all but nine grants to UCLA health science researchers, though that figure may be even smaller.
In response to a similar court order in August, the federal National Science Foundation restored 300 grants it had suspended in July.The restorations cap a remarkable turnaround for UCLA, which lost access to more than $500 million in research in July after the Trump administration froze 800 science grants to the esteemed public university. The National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health accused UCLA of tolerating antisemitism as part of their justification for the grant funding freezes.Those claims followed months of efforts at the university to implement the recommendations of a task force on antisemitism that campus administrators appointed to examine bias at the school.
The science grants pay for research into life-saving drugs, dementia, heart disease in rural areas, robotics education and a vast array of science inquiries across the country. They help propel the country’s research enterprise and are the top source of federal research grants at the University of California. The UC system has battled the Trump administration over various efforts to slash its funding since President Donald Trump’s second term began. Science funding is also a key source of income and training for graduate students, who are the next generation of publicly funded academics.  Still, UCLA and the rest of the UC remain in the hot seat as the system contends with settlement demands from Trump that amount to $1.2 billion. Trump sought that settlement over a litany of accusations, including that the campus tolerates antisemitism.More than 600 Jewish faculty, students, staff and alumni of the University of California wrote in a public letter that stripping funding in response to those claims is “misguided and punitive.”
“Cutting off hundreds of millions of research funds will do nothing to make UCLA safer for Jews nor diminish antisemitism in the world,” the public letter says.A coalition of UC faculty and staff have sued to halt Trump from pursuing his settlement demands. The California federal judge who ordered the grants returned to UCLA, Rita Lin, has issued a string of decisions since June that have restored hundreds of other research grants from multiple agencies across the UC system. Her injunction last week is preliminary and the trial is ongoing. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld some of her other preliminary injunctions that forced the Trump administration to restore scores of science, humanities and environmental research grants.
Lin last week also ordered the Department of Defense and Department of Transportation to restore grants to at least several dozen UC researchers, not just those at UCLA. Attorneys for the government say they need more time — until Oct. 10 — to bring back the defense grants, but said funding for all the terminated defense grants will be restored. Lin is also the judge in the Trump settlement lawsuit.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/040825_UCLA-Funding-Cuts_JH_CM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-30 08:57:29.250173

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Next Monday, the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature is expected to convene for a special session to vote on a proposed congressional map to submit to a judge for consideration in the state’s court-ordered redistricting process currently underway. 
Third District Judge Dianna Gibson will ultimately decide which congressional map will remedy the 2021 boundaries that she ruled last month were a product of an unconstitutional process after Utah lawmakers that year repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ voter-approved ballot initiative, known as Proposition 4, that sought to create an independent redistricting process. 
But the judge has also given lawmakers an opportunity to propose a preferred map. While the state’s Republican supermajority is abiding by court orders “under protest,” state lawyers continue to fight the ruling by appealing to the Utah Supreme Court and possibly the U.S. Supreme Court. 
As lawmakers fight over dueling redistricting experts, Utahns ask: Why not one of our maps?

In the meantime, though, Utahns have an opportunity to weigh in on Utah’s unique mid-decade redistricting process — during a time when redistricting fights are unfolding across the nation as President Donald Trump ups the pressure on states to bolster Republicans’ slim majority during the 2026 midterms. 
Unlike other states, however, a judge has ordered Utah’s mid-decade redistricting process with the aim of remedying lawmakers’ watering down of an independent redistricting commission about six years ago, turning it into an advisory body that legislators could ultimately ignore when they adopted the 2021 congressional map that, up until now, has guided elections. 
Since the adoption of that 2021 congressional map, Republicans have easily dominated all four of Utah’s U.S. House seats. Now, depending on the map Gibson chooses (either one drawn by lawmakers or by the plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit that continues to make its way through the courts) Democrats may have a more competitive chance in at least one district. 
Last week, the newly convened Legislative Redistricting Committee held two public hearings as it weighed a set of maps. Five maps were drawn by Republicans’ retained redistricting expert Sean Trende, a senior elections analyst for RealClearPolitics, and Democrats’ preferred map was drawn by their hired expert, Daniel Magleby, a professor at SUNY Binghamton in New York. 
How to weigh in
Through the Utah Legislative Redistricting Committee’s website, Utahns can not only post public comments on each of the proposed maps, but also view other map proposals and submit their own. 
The website includes instructions on how to comment on a map. Here’s a direct link to the dozens of proposed congressional maps that have been submitted since lawmakers began taking 2025 submissions starting Sept. 17. 
However, even though the website has been accepting and posting public map submissions, leaders of the Legislative Redistricting Committee indicated last week they’d be reluctant to consider a map submitted by the public. 
Utah lawmakers consider slate of new congressional maps ‘under protest’

Last week, a Utahn, James Carter, urged lawmakers to reject all six of their proposed maps and instead pick one drawn by a member of the public. But the committee’s co-chair Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, indicated he would have reservations with doing that, saying it’s “impossible to ascertain amongst all the maps that were drawn and submitted if any of them were drawn using political data in the timeframe that we have.”
“It’s almost an impossible task,” Sandall said. “Because that is our mandate under Prop 4, no political consideration can be made in drawing a map. And we would have to go in and depose any or all of the map drawers to find out if political data was used, and we just don’t have that time.” 
Nonprofit releases map scorecard
The Better Utah Institute — a nonpartisan nonprofit that that is related to the progressive advocacy group Alliance for a Better Utah — released on Monday an analysis of the six proposed congressional maps being considered by the Legislative Redistricting Committee, with an aim of informing the public during the public comment period that ends Oct. 5, the day before the special session. 
The Better Utah Institute said it scored the proposed congressional maps using these five measures: “city and county splits, compactness, competitiveness, and proportionality.”

“These standards matter because they show whether maps serve people or politicians,” the Better Utah analysis says. “Splitting cities and counties silences local voices. Compactness reveals when districts are carved up to protect incumbents or punish parties. Competitiveness ensures voters, not one party, decide elections. Proportionality shows whether results reflect the real balance of political views in Utah.”
The lower the scores for city and county splits, the better, based on Proposition 4’s standards. And higher scores for compactness, competitiveness and proportionality mean a better score for a map. 
“We’re doing this because redistricting decides whose voices count in Congress for the next five years,” the Better Utah Institute said. “When maps are drawn fairly, every community gets a seat at the table. When they’re rigged, people lose trust in government itself. These scores pull back the curtain so Utahns can see clearly whether the maps on the table strengthen our democracy or weaken it.”
Proposition 4’s standards lay out the following criteria, in order of importance: 

Equal population
Minimize city splits
Minimize county splits
Compactness
Contiguity and ease of transportation
Preserve traditional neighborhoods and communities of interest
Follow natural and geographic boundaries
Maximize boundary agreement


According to the analysis, while Democrats’ preferred map — named after Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, and Rep. Doug Owens, D-Millcreek, the only two Democrats on the legislative committee — had the biggest number of city and county splits compared to the other legislative maps, theirs scored the highest in the Better Utah Institute’s analysis for the other principles of compactness, competitiveness and proportionality. 
Out of the other legislative maps, Option B scored the next highest for compactness, competitiveness and proportionality with only six city and county splits.

(Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The Alabama Attorney General’s Office last week asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling ordering a new trial for an inmate on death row.
In a 62-page filing, attorneys for the state argued that a three-judge panel of the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals erred in ordering a new trial for Michael Sockwell, convicted of a 1988 murder, amid questions as to whether a potential juror was removed from consideration because he was Black.
“The panel majority took a frozen cold voir dire transcript, read twenty words of it in the least charitable light, and reached a different factual conclusion about the prosecutor’s motives and credibility than either the district court or the state high court,” the appeal said.

A message seeking comment was sent to attorneys representing Sockwell. The news was first reported by legal journalist Chris Geidner.
Sockwell was convicted and sentenced to death for the killing of Isaiah Harris in what prosecutors called a murder for hire plot. Prosecutors alleged that Sockwell and others were hired for $100 to kill Harris, with more promised after the killing.
No one saw Sockwell shoot the victim, and Sockwell testified that another person was responsible for killing the victim. He also said that he did not receive any more for his role in the incident and that he received $50 for “fixing a car.”
During the jury selection process for the trial, the district attorney in the case used her peremptory strikes to remove 15 of the 40 remaining candidates to be jurors in the trial. Of the 15, the district attorney removed seven of 32 white jurors and eight of the 10 Black jurors who were part of the pool.
Fearing that the district attorney was stacking the jury with only whites, Sockwell’s attorneys raised what is known as a Batson challenge, in which attorneys can challenge the validity of a juror strike based on race, ethnicity or sex.
The district attorney questioned one juror who was Black who she eventually removed. Attorneys for Sockwell then asked the district attorney why she had used her strike to remove that potential juror. The district attorney said the prospective juror gave vague answers to her questions, and denied removing the candidate because of race.
“He had said to the court that he heard a little something,” she said according to the court transcript. “The court questioned him further and he finally said well, I heard it from the paper or something. The court questioned him further. He was very vague and unclear in his answer.”
Sockwell’s attorneys said that the district attorney did not use strikes against white jurors who gave vague answers.
The trial judge sided with the prosecution, and the case proceeded to trial. The jury eventually found Sockwell guilty and recommended a sentence of life in prison without parole. The judge overruled the recommendation and sentenced Sockwell to death.
In a June decision ordering a new trial, the three-judge panel ruled 2-1 that the district attorney at the trial had a history and practice of removing a significant number of Black individuals from trial during jury selection. The court’s opinion included five examples of the district attorney using her peremptory strikes to remove potential Black jurors.
Despite that, the Alabama Attorney General’s Office stated that the Alabama Supreme Court found that the trial court dismissed the alleged Batson violation, as did the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, the Alabama Supreme Court and the federal district court.
“In particular, the majority erred in rejecting the state-court finding that the prosecutor’s reference to race was ‘a descriptive identification,’ while accepting Sockwell’s contention that the remark was an admission ‘that she struck (the juror) for being the same race as the defendant,’” the AG’s filing said. “ Sockwell did not prove the ASC (Alabama Supreme Court) wrong with ‘clear and convincing evidence,’ and the Eleventh Circuit cited none.”

Broadcast journalist Jack Kavanagh created the website as an outgrowth of the tip sheet he circulated among his colleagues at KOVR, a Sacramento television station.
Monday’s edition typified recent versions, being utterly dominated by conflicts between California’s Democratic figures, especially Gov. Gavin Newsom, and a federal government controlled by President Donald Trump and Republican majorities in Congress.
The specifics include the administration’s immigration sweeps, the potential effects of a government shutdown due to a congressional stalemate, tariffs and, of course, the California redistricting ballot measure, Proposition 50, on the November 4 ballot. It could, if successful, shift five California congressional seats from Republicans to Democrats, countering a pro-Republican gerrymander in Texas in advance of the 2026 midterm elections.  
It is, in a sense, just a more intense version of the long-standing transcontinental rivalry over policy issues between the national government in Washington and a state whose leaders often pretend that it is an independent nation.
However, it has taken on the aura of a holy war, something like the existential conflicts that raged in Europe during the Middle Ages, tinged with Newsom’s increasingly obvious hopes of succeeding Trump in 2028.
While resisting Trumpism may play well for Newsom within California and perhaps in other blue states, it also may be indirectly bolstering Trump’s standing in the nation as a whole, since he often portrays California as an example of failed progressive governance.
Trump Derangement Syndrome, as it’s been dubbed, also tends to displace attention to many issues that predate Trump’s era and will have a more profound effect on California’s future than anything Trump is likely to do.
He had nothing to do with California’s high rates of homelessness, poverty, and unemployment, its very high living costs, its shortage of housing, its long-standing water supply conundrum, the shortcomings of its public school system or the multi-billion dollar deficits in its state budget.
While Newsom inherited most of them upon being elected governor in 2018, in the main, California’s unresolved issues have stagnated or worsened in the nearly seven years since. And they are likely to still be there when he leaves in 2027, possibly to pursue the presidency himself.
One of the most troubling is, or should be, an economy that may not be in recession, at least not officially, but has not fully recovered from the sharp downturn that occurred in 2020, when Newsom ordered a shutdown of many businesses to counter the COVID-19 pandemic.
The state has more than a million unemployed workers, its jobless rate of 5.5% continues to be at or near the highest of any state and its job creation has not kept pace with the growth of its labor force.
A recent report from the Legislative Analyst’s Office, which advises the Legislature on budgetary and economic issues, describes what has been happening: “For the two-month period July and August, the state’s labor force grew by 17k, the number of employed workers fell by 7k, and the number of unemployed workers increased 24k.”
Nothing in California is more fundamentally important than a healthy economy that expands employment opportunities. Over the last five years, California has had an economy that a previous report from the analyst described as “sluggish.”
It provides Trump with ammunition for claiming that California exemplifies what the nation should not emulate.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081425-Newsom-Redistricting-Rally-TS-CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-30 08:57:29.250173

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)MOBRIDGE — South Dakota will offer a 13-week police certification course that gives priority to tribal recruits once every summer, the head of South Dakota’s Division of Criminal Investigation recently told the State-Tribal Affairs Committee. 
Speaking at the Grand River Resort, just west of Mobridge on the Standing Rock Reservation, Division Director Dan Satterlee told the committee and representatives from three of South Dakota’s tribes that the state wants to make it easier to recruit and train police on reservations. The committee met Sept. 19.

Training tribal police in-state helps tribal and local officers, Satterlee said, because the recruits get to know the counterparts they might need to work with during joint investigations.
“When they go to training together, they can build those connections and build those relationships,” Satterlee said. 
This year’s tribal-priority basic law enforcement certification class began in August, Satterlee said, and nine people in the class work for tribal agencies.
The news was one of several nods during the meeting to efforts at improving police coordination between the state and tribal agencies.
Local training a recent focus for tribes, state
Law enforcement officers in South Dakota are required to complete the basic training course within a year of being hired by a local police agency. Tribal officers also need certification, but have traditionally gone to New Mexico for training with the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. That basic training includes the same requirements as the Pierre-based academy — proficiency in firearms, training in self-defense, arrest protocols and the like — but also covers the unique legalities of working in tribal areas. 
Because the New Mexico academy is open to all tribal recruits, the state has traditionally given preference to non-tribal officers when filling slots at its own police academy. Each state course can fit 48 officers, so if slots remain for a particular class in the past, Satterlee said, tribal recruits on a waiting list would get a call. 
Last year, though, then-Gov. Kristi Noem moved money from her office’s budget to fund an additional class that would admit tribal officers first. Nine tribal officers were certified through that first course last year, alongside officers from other agencies. Another four have since been certified. 
This year, legislators provided $175,000 to conduct another tribes-first course each summer. Officers willing to go to New Mexico don’t struggle to find slots, Satterlee said, but “unlike coming to our academy, they can’t visit their families on the weekends.”
Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Chairman Ryman LeBeau, who was on hand for the committee meeting, asked Satterlee if the state would admit more than nine tribal recruits.
“We can fill up to 48, and we’d love to have 48,” Satterlee said. “For this one, we had nine that applied and made it through the background check, etcetera, so we had nine enrolled.
Legislation suggested to formally recognize tribal officers
U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, has pushed for a federal tribal training academy for the Great Plains, most recently this spring by sending a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.
Retiring Standing Rock tribal chairwoman calls for more communication with South Dakota leaders

Satterlee said he’d like to see it in South Dakota.
The State-Tribal Affairs Committee voted unanimously to urge the state Legislature to pass a resolution supporting a federal tribal academy in the state. 
The committee also voted to move forward with drafting a bill for the 2026 legislative session that would recognize tribal officers as law enforcement under state law. Assaulting an officer can draw felony charges in South Dakota, but not if the officer assaulted works for a tribal agency. The committee would like to update the definition, noting that tribal officers often assist their state- or local counterparts for incidents on state land.
Surge at Standing Rock
State Department of Public Safety Secretary Bob Perry told tribal leaders at the committee meeting that the state would be happy to sign agreements for assistance with tribes. 
The Highway Patrol has a memorandum of understanding with the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe to patrol during the tribe’s annual powwow.

Tribal leaders have sometimes been reluctant to open their borders to state police out of concerns that the visiting force might step beyond assistance and do things like serve state warrants on tribal citizens, Perry said.
Tribal police to lawmakers: Recognize us as law enforcement

Perry said agreements with the state would mean “we’d come when we are requested, and leave when we’re asked.”
“We don’t come in and try to serve state warrants or issue state citations or gather intelligence for state crimes,” Perry said.
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe partnered with the state Highway Patrol for a temporary surge patrol between July 20 and Aug. 2. That partnership resulted in 13 citations and 47 warnings during 36 total hours of trooper patrols on Standing Rock, Highway Patrol Lt. Caleb Walters said. The patrol did not make any arrests, he said.
Standing Rock police did make arrests in the coordinated event. Derris Waukazoo, Standing Rock’s police chief, told the committee the surge came in two phases, the first focusing on the service of warrants and the second on patrols. 
Waukazoo’s officers logged 817 incidents, which include any contact with people, and 75 arrests for crimes ranging from drunken driving and public intoxication to aggravated assault. 
Arrests also included drug possession, which Waukazoo said is a driver of a lot of reservation crime.
Callback to cartel controversy
Janet Alkire, who attended the committee meeting during her last week as chairwoman for that tribe, said Standing Rock’s call for help was necessary. She also said there are opportunities for collaboration in the future, though a formal agreement will likely remain a hard sell. 
She was pleased to hear Satterlee and Perry talk about the kind of assistance they can offer without such an agreement, such as help with missing persons cases, or during disasters. 
“I’m really grateful for that,” Alkire said.
She also gave a nod to the controversial remarks from former Gov. Noem that helped spark discussions on an additional training course for tribal recruits. 
Noem alleged Mexican drug cartels had infiltrated tribal areas during a speech to lawmakers, and repeated the claim several times in the months that followed. All nine tribes banned her from their lands based on those comments, as well as comments tribal officials viewed as disparaging to Native American children.
Alkire asked Waukazoo if any of the arrests in the summer surge involved cartel members.
“No,” he said, an answer that elicited laughter from the room.
“We’re kind of joking about it, but it’s a serious question, and we really did want to know, because we actually don’t know sometimes who comes on our lands,” Alkire said. 
The tribe is welcoming to outsiders, but last year’s comments sparked questions from tribal members, Alkire said. 
“When something gets out there like that, that we have the cartels infiltrating, it scares our people,” she said.

(Getty Images)Starting Wednesday landlords will be required to state the total amount of rent a tenant is required to pay up front in the lease, including those hidden fees normally buried deep inside rental agreements.
“When you ask how much a unit is, when you see an advertised amount for a unit, that’s what your rent is,” said Assemblymember Venicia Considine, the Las Vegas Democrat who sponsored the bill. Landlords and property owners “can’t put in hidden fees or junk fees anymore. On top of it, anything that they’re saying is a mandatory charge must be within the amount of the total that they give you.”
The new requirements are a result of Assembly Bill 121. The law also mandates landlords offer a fee-free way to pay rent and prohibits collecting application fees to obtain a credit report or run a background check for a minor who resides in the house.
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo this year vetoed bills that sought to bolster renter protections and make changes to the eviction system. AB 121 was one of the few successful tenant bills.
“This feels like one of the first real big tenant protections passed in quite a few years,” said Ben Iness, the coalition manager with the Nevada Housing Justice Alliance. “What makes this bill so effective is that it covers all aspects of the rental process. I hope it’s something we can build on in the future.”
Considine revived AB 121 after it was vetoed by Lombardo in 2023.
Similar legislation was also introduced in 2021, when Democrats controlled both chambers and governorship, but stalled in an Assembly committee. 
During the Biden administration, there were attempts federally, including lawsuits filed by the Federal Trade Commission, to hold some national landlords accountable for tacking on “junk fees” or inflating rental prices using rental algorithm software. 
Invitation Homes and Greystar, which both manage properties in Nevada, have been in the center of federal lawsuits. Invitation Homes agreed to pay $48 million to settle the lawsuit last September.
Considine doesn’t expect the Trump administration to rein in bad practices. 
“If we have the opportunity to get a bill passed that helps people, I just don’t feel like as a Nevada legislator, I should wait or rely on the federal government to do something that we could get done here,” Considine said.
The legislation doesn’t just protect individual renters but ensures large property owners aren’t “extracting wealth from our communities,” said Jonathan Norman, the statewide advocacy, outreach and policy director for the Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers.
“Maybe $100 fees seem like a small number,” he said. “When it’s $100 every month, and there’s 3,000 Invitation Homes, which has 3,000 properties in Clark County,  that’s not a little bit of money,” he said. “It’s really the predatory extraction of wealth.”
 ‘Some teeth’

Whether it’s an extra fee of $10 or a $100 tacked on to the expected rent, it also adds up for a tenant. For many tenants, those fees weren’t detailed upfront when signing a lease and often hidden in addendums buried in the rental agreement, Norman said. 
And when people are already struggling to afford their rent, a hidden and unexpected cost could push them over the edge and put them at risk of an eviction, added Norman.
“When we talk about people being responsible with their budgets, we often put a lot of responsibility on tenants and say, ‘Well, they should have known what they could afford,’” Norman said. 
If people sign a lease that says their rent is $1,200 but wind up paying $1,500 because on page 60 of the lease there’s an addendum that adds mandatory fees, it will likely strain their finances, he said.
Landlords aren’t required to take partial payments. Considine said in some cases people try to pay the actual rent amount, but are denied an opportunity by the landlord because they can’t pay the extra fees tacked on.
The bill does offer “some teeth” for tenants who sign leases after Oct. 1 and are charged hidden fees, Norman said. 
Tenants can seek statutory damages up to $250. The amount “may seem relatively small” but courts would likely “couple that with reasonable attorneys fees” could help “incentivize enforcement of this new law,” Norman added.
All renters, whether they signed a new lease or are an existing tenant, have to be offered a free way to pay rent.
There are many leases that incorporate fees for paying rent, but the law would supersede any existing language, Norman said.
It’s similar to what’s happened after a 2021 law was enacted to prevent landlords from charging more than 5% for late fees. 
“There were a lot of leases that existed that had a higher late fee than that, but the law and the court said, ‘no, we know your leases are no longer accurate,’” Norman said. 
When intaking new clients, legal aid attorneys plan to ask tenants screening questions around hidden fees and payment options to ensure the law is being followed.
The Nevada Housing Justice Alliance is planning to host tenant information sessions to spread the word out to ensure people understand their new rights. 
 Other bills

There are 173 bills that are scheduled to go into effect Oct. 1.

Assembly Bill 555, sponsored by, Democratic Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, prohibits private insurance companies from charging people more than $35 for a 30-day supply of insulin. 
Assembly Bill 215 prohibits teenagers from working between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. before a school day. Teachers and students pushed for the change, citing the negative impact lack of sleep has on learning, mental and social health. The legislation was sponsored by Assemblymembers Daniele Monroe-Moreno and Brian Hibbetts, a Democrat and Republican, respectively. 
Assembly Bill 111 makes driving on the wrong side of the road, previously a civil offense,  a misdemeanor crime. The bill, sponsored by Hibbetts, is nicknamed “Jaya’s Law” after 3-year-old Jaya Brooks who died in a wrong-way crash in Las Vegas last year.
Assembly Bill 32 requires the Nevada Department of Corrections to create a program to allow formerly incarcerated people to work as firefighters within the Division of Forestry. The program is expected to help recidivism rates. The legislation was sponsored by Assemblymember Jovan Jackson, Nevada’s first formerly incarcerated person elected to the state legislature. 
Assembly Bill 277 makes the Net Proceeds of Minerals Bulletin publicly available by the state once again. A new interpretation of state law resulted in the bulletin being kept private.

Campaign fundraising

According to campaign finance records, Barnes funded his campaign entirely with $20,000 and has not reported any other contributions. He spent $18,677 through Sept. 23. He said in a previous interview that he would fund his campaign on his own.
Beaty raised $132,864 as of Monday and spent $126,843, according to campaign finance records. About 22% of his funds have come from political action committees (PACs), the rest from individuals and businesses.

What happens after today?

The candidate with the most votes will be the presumptive representative for District 13. There are no Democratic candidates in the race. A general election is scheduled for Jan. 13, 2026. 

Will the results alter control of the Legislature?

No. Republicans currently hold 72 of the 105 seats in the Alabama House, after Woods’ election and two resignations after the 2025 session in May. Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, resigned after being appointed president of the Public Service Commission in June. Rep. Debbie Wood, R-Valley, announced her resignation earlier this year to move near the Florida panhandle. Republicans hold 27 of the 35 seats in the Alabama Senate.

Long before highways and fence lines, mule deer crossed snowy passes, pronghorn streaked across sagebrush basins, and bighorn sheep traced rocky ridges in search of water. These movements are not just instinct. They are survival, woven into the fabric of our ecosystems.
That fabric is starting to tear. Highways slice through winter range. Fences hem in open basins. Housing tracts and mine sites rise where seasonal forage once grew. Ancient routes that kept wildlife, and the systems we rely on, alive for generations are disappearing.
The Nevada Department of Wildlife’s 2025 Statewide Wildlife Connectivity Plan is the most ambitious effort yet to stop that unraveling. It maps where animals move, identifies the barriers in their way, and lays out how to restore the broken links. It is grounded in science, rooted in collaboration, and, if fully funded and acted on quickly, capable of reversing years of fragmentation.
Connectivity is not just about wildlife. It is about clean water from healthy watersheds. It is about fewer drivers swerving to avoid a deer in the headlights. It is about hunting and fishing traditions that depend on thriving herds and native fish runs. Lose connectivity, and you lose all of these.
We have already seen what works. At Pequop Summit on I-80, a single wildlife overpass cut collisions by nearly 80 percent. In other states, targeted underpasses have brought entire elk herds back to historic ranges. The lesson is simple: give wildlife a way through, and they will take it.
But here at home, some corridors are already hanging by a thread. In the East Humboldt Range, mule deer trying to reach winter habitat face four lanes of highway and a maze of fencing. Every season, more are lost to collisions or pushed into marginal terrain. Without intervention, this corridor could vanish entirely.
Our challenges are bigger than any one crossing. Nevada is growing fast. Renewable energy projects are critical for confronting the climate crisis, and this plan can guide developers to low-impact sites that keep migration routes intact while still advancing clean energy goals. Mining, roads, and even recreation can chip away at migration corridors until they are nothing but lines on an old map. Once that happens, they are almost impossible to restore.
This plan matters because it can prevent that outcome but only if it moves from paper to action. That will mean prioritizing the most threatened corridors, integrating climate resilience into every project, and holding agencies to timelines and results. It will mean working with Tribes, ranchers, and local communities who have managed these lands for generations. And it will mean steady funding so momentum does not stall after the ribbon cuttings.
Nevada still has what many states have already lost: vast, connected landscapes where wildlife can move freely across seasons and generations. That is a gift and a responsibility.
If we get this right, future Nevadans will still watch mule deer crest a snow-dusted ridge, still glimpse pronghorn racing the horizon, still see native trout running in clear mountain streams. Children will grow up in a state where the wild is not a memory in photographs but a living, breathing presence.
If we fail, those sights will fade, and the loss will be permanent.
Our wildlife is still on the move. How long they can keep moving depends on what we choose to do now.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pequopsummit-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-09-30 08:57:29.250173

Sign up for their newsletter here.
BESSEMER — Residents living around the site of a proposed 4.5 million-square-foot data center campus have a new ally in their fight against what they say is an unwanted and unneeded development: the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
In an open letter sent to Bessemer’s planning and zoning commission, representatives of the organization’s local, state and national offices expressed concerns about the proposal, called Project Marvel, and its implications for the surrounding community.
“On behalf of the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, Metro Birmingham Branch of the NAACP, and the NAACP Center for Environmental and Climate Justice, we are writing to oppose the construction of the Logistic Land Investments data center known as Project Marvel,” the letter said.

Bessemer’s residents are about 70 percent Black, according to census figures. Though the proposed data center site is technically within city limits, the community surrounding the project location is more mixed racially and economically, with both Black and white residents expressing their vocal opposition in multiple public meetings in recent months.
The letter argues that the data center “will harm the way of life, the environmental and financial interests of the people of Bessemer, the communities of Rock Mountain Lakes and Red Mountain Heights, and all citizens of Alabama.”
Residents have expressed worries around the environmental, health and economic impacts that may stem from construction of the data center campus, which is estimated to take between seven and 10 years, according to the developer, Logistic Land Investment, LLC.
If built to full capacity, the facility would consume as much as 1,200 megawatts of electricity every hour, 24 hours a day, according to estimates provided to residents. That amount of energy is equivalent to 10 times the usage of all residences in nearby Birmingham or around 90 times the usage of all residences in Bessemer.

Water usage, too, is a significant concern. Developers have written to a nearby utility for approval to use as much as 2 million gallons of water per day, a demand the utility said it wouldn’t be able to meet without “significant upgrades,” according to public documents.
City leaders, some of whom signed non-disclosure agreements with the project developer, have argued that the project would be a financial boon for Bessemer, providing needed jobs and tax revenue.
Residents, however, have pointed to a lack of transparency around the project as a reason for concern. Brad Kaaber, a representative of Logistic Land Investment, has said in public meetings that an environmental assessment has been conducted but has refused to provide it to residents or to Inside Climate News.
The development company did not respond to a request for comment on the NAACP’s letter.
In the letter, NAACP leaders wrote that energy demands from the data center and related backup generators would “contribute significantly to the current climate crisis and health issues” in Jefferson County.
The county is already the site of Alabama Power’s James H. Miller Jr. Electric Generating Plant, which for nearly a decade has earned the dubious distinction of being the nation’s largest greenhouse gas emitter.
Data for 2022 released by the Environmental Protection Agency shows that the Jefferson County plant emitted nearly 22 million metric tons of greenhouse gas pollutants that year, including over 21 million tons of carbon dioxide, 62,000 CO2-equivalent metric tons of methane and 108,000 CO2-equivalent metric tons of nitrous oxide.
For comparison, Miller emits around 1.5 million more metric tons of carbon dioxide per year than the entire country of Guatemala, according to global data.
That reality puts residents in Bessemer and beyond in a vulnerable position, the NAACP argued in its letter, which cited Inside Climate News reporting on the project.
“…The state has a long history of rescinding civil rights regarding environmental protections that can help protect residents in places like Bessemer,” the letter said. “Siting a fossil-fuel
polluting and energy depleting data center in an already overburdened majority Black community is unfortunately on par for many environmentally unjust decisions that impact places like Bessemer.”
The NAACP letter calls for “full transparency” around the project and asks that the city produce copies of any non-disclosure agreements, disclose expected employment and tax impacts around the development, disclose anticipated energy and water usage, and “provide guarantees that no resident of Bessemer will suffer increased [utility] costs” because of Project Marvel.
City officials have not yet responded to requests for response to the letter.
The letter asks that city leaders oppose the project or, at a minimum, think more deeply about its impacts before moving forward.
“At the very least, the data center cannot be built without full analysis of these impacts, and full disclosure to the community of the risk and a true opportunity for community-centered decision making for next steps,” the letter said.
Other national organizations have already weighed in on the proposal, including the Center for Biological Diversity, which has said it is considering legal action over the project’s potential environmental impacts, including on the Birmingham darter, a newly discovered fish species scientists believe may be present on the proposed data center site.
Several statewide and regional organizations, including the Alabama Rivers Alliance and the Southern Environmental Law Center, have also fought for transparency around the project.
The Bessemer City Council is expected to consider the data center’s preliminary development plan and related rezoning request at an Oct. 7 meeting.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/bessemer1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-30 08:57:29.250173
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-09-30 11:40:41+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Healey convenes solar leaders in search of energy answers,Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/energy/healey-convenes-solar-leaders-in-search-of-energy-answers/,Gov. Maura Healey heard from solar industry officials at a Monday summit pleading to cut red tape and costs associated with installing more of the green energy source in Massachusetts.,"GOV. MAURA HEALEY AND HER ADMINISTRATION — on the hunt for energy solutions — received a clear message from the solar industry on Monday: Get more power from the sun into Massachusetts, and move faster to do it.
Solar industry officials urged Healey at a Monday summit to make it easier to build solar and reverse a decline in deployment of the renewable energy source in the state in light of federal rollbacks, slipping climate goals, and high energy costs.
The discussion, which also featured Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper and Energy Resources Commissioner Elizabeth Mahony, comes as President Trump has stifled Massachusetts’s offshore wind projects and pulled important federal tax incentives for renewable energy projects. It’s left Healey searching for new ways to both meet the state’s clean energy targets and lower energy costs as winter looms and power demand is on the rise.
“The solar we build now will be the most affordable solar that we will be able to build for some time,” said Jess Robertson, director of policy and business development at New Leaf Energy, a Massachusetts-based renewable energy developer. “Solar and storage are the only new resources that we can bring online fast enough to address both reliability and affordability in this era of rising electricity demand.”
The overarching industry asks that Healey and her team heard Monday are to site and permit solar projects faster, cut the costs and red tape for solar power to enter the electricity grid, and ensure incentives are aligned to produce more of the green energy source.
The challenges facing the state around boosting solar power are intersecting with Healey’s energy affordability legislation now sitting with the Legislature. That measure has sparked debate about Healey’s proposals to cut the net-metering incentives for large solar energy developments and bring more solar projects into the state’s recently updated SMART solar incentive program, provisions which the industry is opposing.
“Everything’s on the table,” Tepper, the energy and environmental affairs secretary, said when asked if the administration would consider changing those aspects of its energy legislation. “We’re talking about everything. We didn’t get everything perfect, but we’re here today to talk to people about that.”
While Massachusetts has led the way in solar deployment in the past, there’s a sense of urgency to reverse declining performance in more recent years. Installation of new community solar projects, for instance – which are solar installations meant to serve renters, condos, and homes without available rooftop space for panels – is down 16 percent in 2024 compared to the prior year in Massachusetts, marking the lowest year of installed capacity since 2015, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
Those stakes have only grown since Healey signed a landmark siting and permitting reform law late last year: Federal tax credits for renewable energy projects will expire at the end of 2027 and residential energy tax credits will end at the end of this year as a result of Trump’s sweeping domestic policy law enacted earlier this year.
The Trump administration also revoked the Solar for All program that was set to deliver $156 million for Massachusetts. And he has halted new offshore wind production, of which the state must procure 5,600 megawatts by the middle of 2027.
Meanwhile, power demand in New England is expected to rise 11 percent by 2034, according to ISO New England, the region’s grid operator.
Healey has fashioned herself as an “all of the above” energy governor as a way to bring costs down and said she plans to mobilize last year’s law — regulations for which are currently out for public comment — to speed up solar deployment and reduce interconnection costs.
“It is the cheapest and fastest energy that we can build,” Healey said. “Massachusetts used to be one of the top states for solar installation, and now we’re in the middle of the pack. I want to change that, and that’s why I’ve asked the team to come together to hear directly from industry leaders what is slowing things down, what is getting in the way, what needs to happen.”
The solar industry, meanwhile, is appealing to Healey’s message around energy costs. Nick d’Arbeloff, president of the Solar Energy Business Association of New England, told Healey at the roundtable that “more solar means greater energy affordability.”
There are some concrete steps in the works. The Healey administration revised the SMART program last month to allocate 900 megawatts of solar energy during the next program year – enough to power roughly 150,000 homes — set annual incentive levels, and include incentives for low-income customers.
But more battles are to come.
Sen. Michael Barrett, a Lexington Democrat, who co-chairs the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, has previously expressed skepticism of Healey’s pitch to lower the net-metering rates for large solar projects and bring more solar developments into the SMART program.
Healey argues in her affordability legislation that reducing high net-metering rates would save ratepayers $380 million over 10 years, though doing so could make it less profitable and attractive for developers to launch new solar projects in Massachusetts. The administration also wants more solar projects to qualify through the SMART program, which the industry worries could hinder development, since those projects have to abide by other land use and energy storage requirements.
Meanwhile, a new state report released on Monday also throws into question the state’s largest energy efficiency program, an initiative that has become something of a political hot potato.
State Auditor Diana DiZoglio found that as a community’s population density and the proportion of renters increase, benefits from the Mass Save program typically decrease. Denser urban municipalities with more renters — groups less likely to directly benefit from energy efficiency improvements on a property — “were consistently found to contribute more to the program even when they ultimately do not get much back, if anything, from the program,” the report found.
The report also recommends a major overhaul of the program structure, including having utilities no longer administer Mass Save and suggesting increased transparency on gas and electric bills. The program is a partnership of the state’s six utility companies with guidance from the state Energy Efficiency Advisory Council and funds efficiency projects through a surcharge on utility bills.
Mass Save has come under fire from Republicans and some Democrats, who tie it to high energy bills. The Department of Public Utilities earlier this year cut Mass Save’s budget by $500 million, and Healey proposed a plan in her affordability legislation to change the way the program is financed from ratepayer funds to bonds.
“What we’re seeing right now in this very well-intentioned program called Mass Save is, unfortunately, essentially a wealth transfer from the poorest communities in Massachusetts to the wealthier, more affluent communities” DiZoglio said in an interview. “And we’re seeing essentially that lower-income communities are actually subsidizing energy efficiency improvements for these wealthier, more affluent communities.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9468-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-30 07:58:42.056446

“This wire is steel core, not copper,” the notice reads. “It has no scrap value!”
The public notice is a step Mason County’s Public Utility District No. 3 is taking to respond to the destruction of cables as wirecutters get increasingly brazen. In one case, a Thanksgiving Day copper wire theft from underground electrical vaults on the Tahuya Peninsula left around a thousand homes without power.
“These aren’t isolated incidents; copper theft is increasing across Mason County,” Justin Holzgrove, director of engineering and utility services at the PUD, told a state Senate committee this month. “Despite requirements for ID, waiting periods and recordkeeping, copper continues to be stolen and resold with ease. And this tells us that the current protections are either not enforced, too easy to bypass or too lenient to matter.”
Daniel Grisim, a security manager at Comcast, told senators the issue has “risen to a crisis level” over the past few years as copper prices have soared. In some cases, would-be thieves are going to great lengths to cut fiber-optic cables, not realizing they’re not copper and lack scrap value.

Lumen sees more copper theft in Washington than any other state, with 350 incidents this year, compared to 146 all of last year, forcing the company to deploy “covert video surveillance and GPS tracking alarms in high-risk areas,” spokesperson Sarah Wix said in an email. 
Washington state lawmakers are toying with possible solutions to discuss in the 2026 legislative session set to begin in January. 
Holzgrove wants the state to require regular, unannounced audits at scrapyards, heightened penalties for theft targeting critical infrastructure and proof of ownership for those selling scrap copper wire. He also wants payments for copper to be via delayed check only. 
A bill proposed this year looked to add civil penalties for scrapyards that make deals for stolen copper used in telecommunication cables, but it failed to gain traction in the Legislature despite bipartisan support.
Rep. Cindy Ryu, D-Shoreline, is leading a workgroup working on proposals to bring to the Legislature next year. Potential legislation looks to balance harsher criminal punishments with increased requirements on scrap metal businesses, she said. 
She also wants to better develop a “no-buy” database that scrapyards can use to see if prospective sellers have criminal convictions for theft and similar crimes.
Under current state law, metal sellers aren’t allowed to remove or alter identifying material on the metal they’re selling or falsely declare the metal isn’t stolen. And scrapyards aren’t allowed to purchase metal from a known theft, a minor or someone who is obviously under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Legislation approved in 2022 also aimed to strengthen regulations on scrapyards in the wake of a nationwide spate of catalytic converter thefts from cars that coincided with increases in the prices of the precious metals they contain.
Sean Daoud, of the Recycled Materials Association, suggested utilities and telecom providers imprint their names on wire. This would make it easier for scrapyards to identify stolen metal.
In one theft example, thieves wore lineworker uniforms, drove a utility truck and provided a fabricated invoice to fool a scrapyard into buying stolen wire, said scrap recycling lobbyist Holly Chisa.
In yet another instance, Mason County’s Public Utility District No. 1 is now on its third go-round running broadband cable funded by a state grant after it’s been cut, said General Manager Kristin Masteller. Each time, the state has had to reimburse the utility for repairs. This time, the utility raised the lines as high as possible to try to deter theft. 
Copper wire theft has also disrupted Sound Transit light rail service this summer.
The threat from this is threefold. First, it disrupts service to customers, not to mention potentially emergency services. Second, it’s expensive to repair. And third, it puts the safety of lineworkers and the people stealing the wire at risk.
“Obviously, it’s a huge inconvenience, and there’s a financial impact,” Masteller said. “But I never want any of our employees to roll up on an outage and find a dead body. That’s terrible, and luckily, we haven’t to date, but it’s a real possibility.”
In one case, a few years ago, someone appeared to suffer severe burns after breaking into one of the utility’s vaults and cutting live wires. A utility crew investigating the incident “expected to see limbs” because of the scene, Masteller recalled.
Grisim emphasized to lawmakers that the consequences of these incidents are far worse than standard property crime. 
Wire theft is a particular concern in rural areas like Mason County where miles of line are often left unguarded.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/power-lines-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-30 07:58:42.056446

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Experts warn that Indiana’s cities, towns and counties could take a hit to their credit rating through no fault of their own, but rather due to continued fallout from the state’s effort to curb property tax growth. 
S&P Global Ratings, which provides independent credit ratings and research, warned that the new law enacted earlier this year “creates uncertainty” for local income tax-backed debt, according to a recent story in industry publication The Bond Buyer.
“At this point, we believe it’s too soon to assess how these changes will influence our ratings,” S&P Associate Director John Sauter told The Bond Buyer.

But a report co-authored by Sauter flags concerns with new provisions of the wide-ranging bill, which limited local tax growth and has left some municipalities scrambling to continue providing government services. 
Rep. Ed DeLaney, an Indianapolis Democrat, said the news confirmed his concern that Senate Enrolled Act 1 “was not well thought out.” 
“There is good reason for local governments to be concerned about their fiscal situation and for our citizens to be concerned about both local services and a threatened increase to local income taxes,” DeLaney told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “As often happens, the super-majority was so focused on sending a message about property taxes that it pretty much forgot every other consideration, including the question of what the total implication is for our voters. It seems that total taxes will increase for many.”
He said that revisiting the property tax law would be a “useful topic” for a special session, “unlike eliminating Democratic representation in our congressional delegation.” Republicans are currently weighing a November special session to redraw boundary lines for congressional districts at President Donald Trump’s behest. 
 Provisions under Senate Enrolled Act 1

Senate Bill 1 went through several versions before landing on a compromise that would save homeowners a collective $1.2 billion in property taxes over three calendar years — money that would come out of the pockets of local units of government, including libraries and schools.
And while S&P previously worried about smaller tax bases and falling revenues, both of which would impact a locality’s final rating, experts flagged concerns about another provision. 
In an effort to grant counties and cities a reprieve, state lawmakers opted to revisit local income taxes. Previously, such levies were an option only available to counties and capped at 3.75%. The new law lowers the cap to 2.9% but allows municipalities to impose their own rate up to 1.2% within that tax.
Indiana Senate sends finalized local property, income tax plan to governor

However, those taxes must be recertified annually, which S&P says creates uncertainty for debt tied to those taxes. Much like how people use their credit rating to borrow against their future income, local units of government rely on these bonds to finance capital projects and operations.
Due to the changes under the law, these municipalities could see their ratings take a hit. But the top credit rating agency said it wouldn’t take any action until 2028 when those requirements start.
That gives state lawmakers some time to act.
At a tax panel earlier this month, top Republicans confirmed that a follow-up bill to the law would be their first fiscal priority going into the next session. 
“Chairman (Jeff) Thompson and I have had a number of conversations even before session was over earlier this year (about) changes we would need to make,” said Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle. 
Moving out some effective dates for implementing changes, for example, would “give us time to start to process some of the changes,” said Holdman, who authored the first version of the bill. 
He said the results have been all over the board.
“We’ve had some financial advisors who lit the hair on fire of some local mayors and county commissioners and county council members with some bad information to be honest with you, and so we’re just trying to get a handle on (that),’ Holdman continued.
Thompson, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, also acknowledged “modifications” to Senate Enrolled Act 1 are a priority for 2026.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The U.S. Department of Justice is asking Minnesota to hand over its voter registration list. Secretary of State Steve Simon is refusing — and now the DOJ is suing Minnesota and five other states that have rejected the Trump administration’s requests for voter rolls. 
The DOJ has reached out to more than half the states in recent months for voter lists, Stateline reported. Thursday’s lawsuit targeted six states that have refused to hand over the voter registration data: California, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.
President Donald Trump has long pushed false claims about American elections, including the lie that he won the 2020 election, and the claim that noncitizens are voting en masse. In March, Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek information about suspected election crimes; The DOJ has since shared voter information it collected with the Department of Homeland Security.
The Reformer interviewed Simon, who has held his office since 2015, about the back-and-forth over voter rolls. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Can you outline why you are saying ‘no’ to the Department of Justice’s request for Minnesota’s voter registration list?

This starts and ends with the law. We ask ourselves the question, what does the law say about whether or not we can transmit very private and personal information on millions of Minnesotans to the federal government? We’ve looked at the law, and our legal position — which we explained in two letters in painstaking detail — is that the law requires the Department of Justice to show two things, at least. First, why specifically they need this sensitive information, and second, what they’re going to do with this private information.
In other words, who are they going to share it with? For what purposes? What are the safeguards? How will it be stored and kept and transmitted? We believe that state and federal law imposes those requirements. So that’s the short answer, is our read and interpretation of the law is the Department of Justice has not yet done what it would need to do to be entitled to this kind of highly sensitive information on millions of Minnesotans.

I know you sent a letter to the DOJ back in July asking those questions — did you ever hear back from them?

They have never explained with specificity precisely how this information — this very sensitive personal information on millions of people — would aid their inquiry into compliance with federal law. Nor have they shared the other thing we asked about, which is, how are you going to use it? Who will you be sharing it with? How will it be safeguarded? 
Even before this lawsuit was filed, our concern was heightened two weeks ago, when there was national reporting that the Department of Homeland Security had said that it covets this information. It has plans to use this information that DOJ is seeking from many states around the country, including Minnesota. That fact, that interest — that stated public interest by another federal agency — is something that the Department of Justice never, ever disclosed to us in any of our correspondence back and forth, which only heightens the concern that the DOJ has not been forthcoming, has not been open, has not been fully transparent about what exactly they plan to do with this sensitive information.
Does Minnesota maintain all of the data that the DOJ was requesting in its voter registration list, like Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers?
Yes, we do have that information. 
Just to back up a little bit — why do states run elections, and why is that important?
The United States Constitution is clear that states are in charge of the time, place and manner of elections. That’s the exact language in the Constitution. The one exception, also in that constitutional provision, is that Congress may step in from time to time and assert authority over some aspects of the election system. The most prominent modern day example is the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
So the Constitution is clear: States are in the driver’s seat, unless and until Congress steps in. It says nothing about anyone else. It says nothing about the President of the United States or the executive branch or anyone else. It’s the states in charge, with guidance and select intervention by Congress. But that’s it. So that’s been our constitutional tradition since the founding, and that’s a system that has worked very well by and large in this country.
You were in office during Trump’s first term. From your point of view as Secretary of State, how have your interactions with the federal government been different during Trump’s second term compared to the first?
What we’re seeing now out of Washington D.C. is not normal, and this is another example of that abnormality. Normally, when the Department of Justice under either or both political parties asks states for elections-related information, it’s very specific. They will ask about one person, or a group of people, or some geographic unit based on some allegation of possible wrongdoing or discrimination. Now we’re seeing huge and sweeping data requests for millions of Minnesotans and tens of millions of Americans in the eight affected states that we have never seen before, for purposes that are murky at best and that have caused a lot of suspicion and alarm across the country — in red states, blue states and purple states. So it’s different this time around. It’s far more sweeping and ambitious and yet less clear.
What are your plans for 2026? Are you running for re-election?
I’ll have an announcement about that in the coming weeks.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/NN240606_0023-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 07:58:42.056446

(Photo provided by JJ Lane.)There are still 13 months to campaign before  Missouri residents will be called back to voting booths to decide the fate of abortion rights, exactly two years after voters legalized the procedure. 
But this time, efforts both supporting and opposing the proposed constitutional amendment are getting a head start. 
The 2026 ballot measure, which was approved by the Republican supermajority of lawmakers in May, would repeal the constitutional right to an abortion but allow exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation.  
In the past week, the campaign opposing the proposed amendment, called Stop the Ban, raised nearly $850,000. (Prior to that — as of a quarterly finance report published in July — it raised $500, all through individual donations of $100 or less.)
The contributions include six-figure donations from several of the main financial backers of the 2024 abortion rights campaign, including The Fairness Project based in Washington, D.C., Abortion Action Missouri, Planned Parenthood Great Rivers Action, Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes and Global Impact Social Welfare Fund, a Virginia-based nonprofit. 
Campaigns are required to report contributions over $5,000 within 48 hours of receiving them. Any smaller donation is made public as part of quarterly finance reports through the Missouri Ethics Commission. 
The 2024 abortion-rights amendment was spearheaded by a campaign called Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, which included the ACLU of Missouri, Planned Parenthood, Abortion Action Missouri, the Fairness Project and Action STL.
A new campaign called Stop the Ban, formed in May to oppose the 2026 abortion ban amendment, also includes PROMO Missouri, a statewide LGBTQ advocacy organization.
The campaign in a statement Friday accused Missouri Republicans of attempting to overturn the will of the people, a message that’s been echoed by Democrats in the statehouse and attorneys for abortion rights groups in courthouses in Jefferson City and Kansas City as legal battles over abortion access continue. 
“Missourians won’t let that happen,” campaign leaders said.” We’re building a grassroots effort to fight for what we know Missourians from every corner of our state and every political party want: the freedom to make our own decisions for ourselves and our families.”
Stop the Ban will be up against a new campaign launched this month called Her Health, Her Future. That PAC is backed by the governor’s office.
Claudia Kehoe, wife of Missouri Governor Mike Kehoe, is the campaign’s treasurer. Her education and career includes a background in banking and finance.
“We think it’s important to protect innocent life,” the governor said last week. “This measure will go on the ballot in November of ‘26, and so I’m excited that (Claudia) wanted to continue what her heart believes in. And that’s her mission, to protect the unborn.”
House parties
Abortion Action Missouri began laying the foundation for this latest grassroots campaign last week when the organization hosted more than a dozen house parties across the state to talk about abortion. 
Among the hosts was Maryellen Picker, a retired 76-year-old school teacher who on Thursday evening gathered 16 women in the living room of her Clayton home. 
Decades earlier, Picker’s sister had an abortion at the age of 16. They were living in Missouri, but their mother had to fly with her sister to New York to have the procedure. 
“The stigma was horrible, and I don’t want it to be like that,” Picker told 30-year-old Lena Woods as they broke into small groups to talk about abortion.

Woods, who volunteers as a clinic escort, said while the 2024 election felt like a “huge hill” to climb, the path to victory was clear to her.  
“Last time I felt like we were guaranteed to win,” she said.
This time around, facing a new gerrymandered map and ongoing legal battles over the ballot language, it feels different. 
“This time I’m like, ‘oh no, I need to do more,’” Woods said. 
The woman lounged barefoot on mismatched chairs and a long couch beneath pieces of abstract art, sipping on wine and cucumber water for what Jess Dewes, 51, a volunteer with Abortion Action Missouri, called a “power party.”
Dewes asked what brought everyone together that evening. 
Anger, one woman said. Fear, added another. 
“They’re counting on us being tired and counting on us quitting,” Dewes said.
“Because we are already a very gerrymandered state, we have very little power right now in Jefferson City,” she added. “The supermajority in Missouri, they have a lot of power right now. They’ve got a lot of people, they’ve got a lot of money, they’ve got a lot of political strongholds. So building power is our best way to take back some of the control that we’ve lost so that we don’t keep voting and then winning and then losing again.” 
Before they parted ways, Dewes reminded the women to ditch the “Yes on 3” merch that proliferated the St. Louis area last year and still remains in some yards. This elicited groans as some of the women learned that the new legislative proposal is called Amendment 3, the same name held by the previous abortion rights amendment. 
Most of the women gathered at Picker’s home were over the age of 50. 
Dewes said they match the demographics of many of the volunteers she’s worked with in signature gathering efforts for the abortion rights campaign. Many looked old enough to be her mother. 
“Their anger about having to fight for it again is so multidimensional, and their purpose is tied to generations,” Dewes said. 
Latest language for Missouri ballot measure fails to mention amendment would ban abortion

Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, said the goal is to grow the abortion rights movement “block by block.”
“This harnessed so much attention last year and so much energy, and people are mad that they went immediately to interfere and overturn the will of the people.”
Helping fuel this effort, she said, is the legislature’s decision to repeal voter-approved paid sick leave earlier this year. Months later, the Republican supermajority gerrymandered the state’s congressional map in an attempt to take voting power away from Kansas City’s Democratic stronghold. 
While Stop the Ban has raised almost $1 million, as of Monday, Her Health, Her Future has received one reportable donation: $50,000 from Drury Displays Inc., a St. Louis based digital billboard advertising company. 
Mike Hafner, a former advisor to Kehoe’s gubernatorial campaign who is now an advisor for Her Health, Her Future, said the campaign is focused early on fundraising. 
“Our opposition has proven to be very well-funded and very well-organized,” Hafner told The Independent last week, saying the campaign hopes to avoid the same fundraising gulf that existed last year. 
Ahead of the November 2024 election, the campaign in support of the abortion rights amendment raised more than $31.5 million. At the same time, fundraising efforts among the anti abortion movement were split among a handful of campaigns totaling less than $4 million in donations. 
Abortion access remains fragmented in Missouri as courts decide what abortion restrictions should remain in place under the 2024 abortion rights amendment. As of Monday, procedural abortions were available by appointment at Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis. Medication abortion remained inaccessible.

A Barre group has hit its fundraising target of $800,000 to buy a long-vacant building on Main Street in the hopes of tearing down what some call the city’s “biggest eyesore.”
The former Newbury five-and-dime at 143 North Main St. has sat vacant since 2010. The Barre Area Development Corporation launched a campaign earlier this year to buy the building for $1.1 million and received a $400,000 contribution from the city of Barre in December 2024. 
Ultimately, owners Jeff Jacobs and Steve Lewinstein agreed to lower their asking price to $775,000 and extended the deadline for the offer, according to Steve Mackenzie, the president of the development group. 
That’s still well above the assessed value of $325,800. Mackenzie has previously said the sale price was clearly an “excessive amount” but that the development group believes it’s worth the investment to improve downtown’s appearance and support local businesses. 
“The property has sat vacant for 15 years, and I think that’s the frustration within the community, is that nothing has happened and the building has just gone downhill,” he said on Monday. 
Mackenzie said the two parties were still working on the purchase and sale agreement. The final transfer may be months away. The property needs to be inspected and the development group is seeking liability protection prior to taking over the building. A code inspection in December found that the property had rotting wood, patches of collapsed floor and standing water, according to inspection documents. 
Mackenzie said that the development group was taking things one step at a time. But his long-term vision for the site is to tear down the current building and redevelop the property into commercial space similar to Barre’s nearby City Place building. He noted that the process for that project took five years, suggesting that the timeline for the new building could be similar.

(Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)
My company, Silicon Ranch, commissioned the first utility-scale solar farm in Tennessee in 2012. Since that initial milestone, Silicon Ranch has worked collaboratively with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and more than 50 local power companies to commission more than 50 energy infrastructure projects across the Tennessee Valley. 
We’re on pace to invest more than $2 billion, and contribute millions more in taxes, all across this region, and it’s been incredibly gratifying to witness how our investments are bringing a much-needed economic shot in the arm to many rural communities throughout the Valley.
As proud as I am of the meaningful work we do every day to invest in rural communities and supply affordable, clean, and reliable energy to our utility partners to serve homes and businesses across the region, I’m equally proud of the agribusiness we’ve built over the past several years to care for our land and to create opportunities for aspiring farmers. 
Through our agribusiness Regenerative Energy®, we employ farmers and shepherds to graze livestock on the land that we own, enabling them to produce grassfed meats while we improve the health of our soil, care for our land and generate clean, renewable energy, all on the same piece of property. 
Given our deep commitment to agriculture, Silicon Ranch naturally supports a wide range of agricultural groups and causes, including Future Farmers of America (FFA). We were again proud to serve as a title sponsor of this year’s Future Farmers of America Ham Breakfast held at the Tennessee State Fair in Lebanon on August 18, where to my surprise and disappointment, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins devoted her entire keynote address to criticize the solar industry for “wasting and replacing” farmland. 
U.S. Agriculture secretary backs Tennessee higher ed grant cuts

Unfortunately, this claim — that solar energy presents a legitimate threat to agriculture — has become a deeply politicized talking point, but I believe it’s important for folks to have access to facts based in reality, not rhetoric from Washington. 
As part of her statement, Rollins noted that “within the last 30 years, Tennessee alone has lost over 1.2 million acres of farmland and is expected to lose 2 million acres by 2027,” implying that solar energy is the culprit for this loss of farmland and the biggest threat the agricultural community faces today. While the loss of farmland in our state is indeed concerning to us all, the claim that this loss is the result of solar development is flagrantly misleading. 
The figure Rollins quoted can also be found in a 2023 study commissioned by the Tennessee General Assembly and conducted by the Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (TACIR). TACIR found that between 1997 and 2017, Tennessee lost 1.1 million acres, or 9.3%, of the state’s farmland. Contrary to Rollins’s suggestion, however, the commission revealed that this loss did not result from solar energy projects, but rather from other forms of development such as shopping centers, subdivisions, and warehouses.
In fact, the TACIR study concluded that even at the most ambitious deployment of solar to meet TVA’s target of securing 10 gigawatts by 2035 (as documented in its Integrated Resource Plan), solar would still occupy far less than 1% of Tennessee’s farmland.
The TACIR report goes on to state that for land used to site solar projects, agrivoltaics — the practice of combining energy generation and agricultural production on the same piece of property, a practice pioneered by Silicon Ranch in 2018 — provides a viable way to develop solar “without taking farmland out of production.” 
My team and I share Rollins’s dedication to Tennessee’s agricultural past, present and future. After all, Tennessee is our home. That’s why we’ve worked to create an industry-leading brand of agrivoltaics that enable us to generate both critically needed energy and agricultural opportunity, in the form of both healthier pastures and career possibilities for aspiring farmers who lack access to land.  
Despite the rhetoric from Washington, we at Silicon Ranch remain steadfast in our mission: to create new opportunities for farmers, to steward the land we own, and to prove that American energy dominance and productive agriculture are not competing priorities, but complementary pursuits.

Photo by Gloria Rebecca Gomez | Arizona MirrorThe ACLU of Michigan and the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center have issued new legal guidance to local law enforcement agencies around the state on how to engage with federal immigration authorities — and urging them not to do any of that enforcement themselves. 
The guidance, updated from 2017, suggests local agencies adopt policies that protect the relationship between local law enforcement and their communities, which they say is often harmed by increased cooperation with immigration agencies or changing their policies to collect more information about immigration status during routine traffic stops. 
“[W]hen noncitizens perceive that local law enforcement agencies are helping to enforce federal immigration law, rather than prioritizing public safety in their communities, they may be less likely to reach out to police or sheriff’s departments when they are witnesses to or victims of a crime, because they fear that they or their loved ones might end up detained and deported,” the letter to law enforcement reads. 
Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility, and having local law enforcement take on that role opens them up to legal liability around racial profiling and Fourth Amendment violations, the letter signed by Loren Khogali, executive director of the ACLU of Michigan, and Susan Reed, the director of the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, also notes.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
One specific program discouraged in the guidance is Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program, which delegates certain immigration enforcement actions to local law enforcement, and whether or not local agencies should join it. Those immigration actions include serving and executing administrative warrants to noncitizens in custody and enforcing “limited immigration authorities with ICE oversight during routine duties,” according to the agency’s website. 
Seven Michigan law enforcement agencies currently have 287(g) agreements with ICE — Berrien, Calhoun, Crawford, Genesee, Jackson, and Roscommon counties, as well as the city of Taylor, all have signed memorandums of agreement in 2025 that give them access to these partnerships and trainings from ICE. 
But others have pushed back against this program — including Washtenaw County Sheriff Alyshia Dyer. 
“Many local police want no part of this,” she is quoted in a joint press release by the two groups as saying. “When people in our community are too afraid to call 911, it puts everyone at risk. Building trust is essential to effective policing at the local level, and 287(g) agreements in particular threaten the trust we’ve spent decades working to build at the local level.”
Michigan is not a “sanctuary state,” meaning that no state-level law prohibits local or state law enforcement from complying with or aiding immigration agents. East Lansing is designated by the U.S. Justice Department as a sanctuary city, and is the only Michigan municipality listed as such. 
But local law enforcement in Michigan is also not required to coordinate with immigration agencies. House Bill 4339, introduced in April by Rep. Joseph Pavlov (R-Smiths Creek), would change that, though that bill has not moved forward in the Senate after being passed by the House. 
Municipalities are also under no obligation, the letter adds, to divert their local resources or funding to immigration enforcement.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/end-ice-collab-700x467-1.jpg,,,2025-09-30 06:56:30.898451

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin lawmakers are once again trying to make changes to the state’s elections system, including allowing elections clerks to start processing absentee ballots the day before Election Day, though partisan divisions on how the changes should be made are already showing. 
Assembly Republican and Democratic authors announced competing bills at a joint press conference last week, saying they are starting a conversation around the proposals and aim to get them done this session. It’s unclear whether those conversations will end in new laws ahead of the 2026 elections, which will include a spring Supreme Court election, a high-profile, open race for governor and state legislative races where control is up for grabs. 
“There’s not a lot new in here,” Assistant Majority Leader Scott Krug (R-Rome) said. “We’ve gone through a lot of these things before, but we’re here to talk about things that should matter to every Wisconsinite, whether you’re Republican, Democrat or independent, about having faith and confidence in your elections from the beginning of the process all the way through to the end.”
Krug said his proposals would help ensure three things for voters: the “person who’s voting next to them is who they say they are,” that the “person is eligible to vote” and that they know “who won the damn election before they go to bed.”
One bill, Krug said, would take a “comprehensive look at how we approach absentee voting in the state of Wisconsin.” This would include allowing for processing of absentee ballots to start on the  Monday before Election Day and regulating drop boxes in Wisconsin. 
“Absentee voting is here to stay, so we want to make sure that we include a process where we can actually get these results across the finish line before we go to bed,” Krug said. He added that by pairing the issue with drop boxes regulations in his new bill he hopes it will “draw all legislators to the table.”  
Election clerks have called for change for years. Currently in Wisconsin, elections workers aren’t allowed to start processing absentee ballots until 7 a.m. on Election Day. This has led to extended processing times, especially in the larger cities including Milwaukee — bolstering suspicions among  Republicans since 2018 about  late night “ballot dumps” in Democratic cities. 
Despite passing the Assembly, a bill to implement Monday processing died last legislative session due to opposition in the Senate. 
In addition to reviving Monday processing, Krug promoted new standards for drop boxes.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a decision that had banned drop boxes in Wisconsin until the new ruling in July 2024. Some Republicans, though not Krug, were critical of the decision. 
“People who are in our communities who see drop boxes on the corner want to know if they have security, that they have standards, that they’re being used the same across the state of Wisconsin,” Krug said. “I know we don’t all agree on what those provisions and those standards should be, but we’ll have a good conversation about that.”
Another bill, Krug said, would eliminate the “ballot drawdown” process from Wisconsin statute and replace it with a process known as “risk-limiting audits.” The drawdown is used when there is a numerical discrepancy and as a result a ballot may be randomly selected and removed from the vote count. 
“Clerical errors can lead to an actually legal ballot being tossed out,” Krug said. “We’ve got to get rid of the drawdown.”
Risk limiting audits are a statistically based audit technique, which audits a certain number of ballots depending on the margin of victory in a given election, has been growing in popularity in recent years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The bill language for Krug’s first two bills is not available.
Krug said AB 312, which was introduced earlier this year, is also included in his package. The bill would require absentee voting sites to be open for at least 20 hours during the period for voting absentee in-person. 
“There’s going to be a limited number of session days going into the fall and spring,” Krug said, adding that it could be difficult to get “27 or 30 election bills” across the finish line individually. 
“Time is of the essence,” Krug said for getting the changes done before 2026 fall elections.
While the lawmakers held their press conference jointly, Rep. Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) said she is not currently supportive of Krug’s bills but that having the conversation is important. 
“I think it’s over bloated,” Snodgrass said about Krug’s “Monday processing” proposal. “I’d like to see a cleaner bill.”
“We are meeting the moment. Our country, and our state has never been more divided and more contentious. The partisan divide has become not just contentious, but even hostile,” Snodgrass said, adding that she and Krug want to “model that civil conversations in debate can happen in the same room, from the same podium and with the same goal in mind despite diverging ideas.” 
Senate Democrat critical of Krug’s legislation
In addition to Assembly Democrats not being on board with Republican election proposals, there already appear to be some obstacles in the Senate.
While speaking to reporters after the Assembly press conference, Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) criticized Krug’s Monday processing proposal, saying he was “very disappointed” with the new version as it contains a “poison pills” meant to satisfy the right-wing portion of his party.

“The Monday processing concept has always been a good idea on its own merits, but it’s never been about the right to vote. It has always been about efficiencies for our clerks and our election officials to process ballots more smoothly,” Spreitzer said. “None of those things are about voting rights, and I’m not willing to trade those things for undermining people’s voting rights.” 
Spreitzer said the dropbox restrictions are “nonstarters” that would “functionally ban them in most communities.” A bill draft, according to VoteBeat, includes a ban on clerks fixing errors on ballots and guidelines for dropboxes, including where to place them, how to secure them, how to collect ballots and how to keep records of when they’re emptied as well as requiring they be under a continuous, livestreamed video feed. 
“I don’t know where these ideas are coming from, but it’s got to be from the extreme part of the Republican caucus, and I just don’t think these are what we should be putting forward related to our elections,” Spreitzer said. 
Spreitzer said Monday processing may not happen until Democrats have control, given the recent version of the bill.
“It may mean that we need to wait for a Democratic majority to pass this,” Spreitzer said. Senate Republicans currently hold a 17-15 majority. Democrats are hoping to change that in 2026 and need to win at least two additional seats to flip control of the chamber for the first time in over 15 years.
Waiting would delay any changes to 2027 at the earliest. 
Democratic bills
Snodgrass, alongside three of her Assembly Democratic colleagues, introduced proposals that have overlapping goals with Krug’s legislation last week.
Snodgrass said the Democratic package is meant to focus on “strengthening our democracy” by increasing access, educating people and providing the resources necessary to ensure that all eligible electors can vote. She said they specifically want to remove barriers to voting, not impose them.
One bill would require elected state officials to serve as poll workers during their first term and once every three years after that to help increase their understanding of the state’s election administration. 
“There’s no better way of learning than doing so,” Snodgrass said, adding that the bill would help elected officials be a “voice to talk about how Wisconsin’s elections are secure.” 
A pair of bills seek to ensure that polling places and voting are more accessible by requiring that election officials have one hour of voter accessibility training, and requiring election officials use the Wisconsin Elections Commission’s accessibility checklist at each polling place and uniform signs with  instructions for curbside voting. Several of the bills focus on helping young people in the state participate in elections. 
One bill would require that at least one special school registration deputy be present at each public high school in the state so eligible students can register to vote at school during the day. One bill would require high schools to give voter registration forms and nonpartisan voting information to students who are eligible to vote. 
The Department of Public Instruction would be required, under one bill, to develop a curriculum on the electoral process and voting. The agency would also have to mandate at least one hour of voter education instruction annually for K-12 students. 
“Too often, young people want to get involved, but don’t know how,” Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) said. “By making voter registration and civic information part of the high school experience, we eliminate barriers and send a clear message, your voice matters, and your vote counts. This bill is not about partisanship. It’s about participation. It’s about preparing students to step confidently into adulthood, not just as graduates, but as citizens ready to shape their communities and their future.”
The package also includes a constitutional amendment proposal that would allow 17-year-olds to vote in primaries if they will be 18 by the general election. Another bill would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to preregister to vote if they turn 18 before the next election.

On Friday, officials conducted groundbreaking ceremonies at Minidoka National Historic Site east of Twin Falls to kick off the restoration and repair projects.
Minidoka National Historic Site preserves an American concentration camp where 13,000 Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.
Minidoka National Historic Site is undergoing a multiyear renovation that will preserve the Block 22 Barracks, the mess hall and root cellar buildings.
“These improvements will allow visitors to step inside history, helping them better understand the lived experiences of Japanese Americans incarcerated at the Minidoka Relocation Center during World War II,” officials said in a press release announcing the projects.
In addition to renovating and preserving the historic buildings and sites, crews will build a new maintenance facility at Minidoka National Historic Site that will house offices, work stations, a carpentry shop and equipment repair bays, officials said.

Other projects are also in the works at National Park Service sites in southern Idaho. 
The Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument is having fire protection systems installed to protect some of the monument’s fossils, officials said. 
Additionally, Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve’s historic Mission 66 utility building will undergo an adaptive restoration project designed to restore a feature of the monument’s historic district, officials said. 
Funding for the projects comes from the Great American Outdoors Act’s Legacy Restoration Fund, which provided up to $1.3 billion per year for five years for overdue maintenance and repair projects in the National Park system.
“These projects will significantly enhance the visitor experience, not only through visible improvements like expanded programming, education, and interpretation, but also by investing in critical behind-the-scenes work that keeps park facilities safe and functional,” Wade Vagias, superintendent of the south Idaho parks, said in a written statement. “We are deeply grateful that these high-priority infrastructure projects were selected for Great American Outdoors Act funding, as they might otherwise have remained out-of-reach.”
The Great American Outdoors Act was passed by Congress and signed into law in 2020 during President Donald Trump’s first term in office. 
After five years, the Legacy Restoration Fund is set to expire today, and the National Park Foundation said legislation is needed to extend it to continue protecting national parks for future generations. 
Since the Great American Outdoors Act was signed into law, the Legacy Restoration Fund has invested a combined total of $82.9 million for 16 different projects in Idaho. Officials said the funding was used to rehabilitate recreational facilities and operations buildings and support water infrastructure and other utility projects.

(Courtesy photo)The role of a community pharmacy remains vital when it comes to serving the most vulnerable populations. That rings true, even in places many wouldn’t expect it to be, according to Lindsey Angelotti, one of the owners of Ella Community Pharmacy in Hamilton County.
That operation has two well-established locations in Westfield and Sheridan with young owners who are committed to the long haul. Angelotti owns the pharmacies with her husband, Erik. They took over ownership of Ella Community Pharmacy in 2017.
“If you took both of our pharmacies off the map, I can assure you that Sheridan would be bordering on the official definition of a pharmacy desert,” Lindsey Angelotti said. “In (both) our communities, we attract the patients who have complex medical needs … we provide access to patients that don’t have the resources or means or technology or family members or the support that your average, affluent adult in Hamilton County would take advantage of.”
There have been plenty of pharmacies that have gone away, both within the state of Indiana and across the country. The Indiana Professional Licensing Agency reported 1,354 licensed pharmacies in November 2024 and that is down to 1,328 in July 2025. 
What’s causing many of these closures? It comes down to money. For many, it’s just not worth keeping the doors open from a financial standpoint anymore.
Plenty in the industry and outside of it point the finger in one direction when it comes to who is to blame – toward PBMs, which is short for Pharmacy Benefit Managers. These companies work, as representatives of the drug plans that hire them, with insurance companies and pharmacies to administer benefits and negotiate drug prices. Issues about how those prices are set – and how much money should return to the pharmacy – are at the heart of the debate.










The vast majority of their business is still dispensing prescriptions. And when you're taking a heavy loss on the vast majority of their business, you can't survive.


– Pharmacist Lindsey Angelotti



PBMs aren’t new to the industry – these groups have been around since the 1950s, starting in the role of claims processors for the industry. However, especially in the last 15 years, being a PBM has became big business. While there are many PBMs in operation, most of the business is handled by three major groups, which collectively do more than 75% of the industry’s business, according to the National Community Pharmacists Association. The largest one of these PBMs? CVS Caremark, which, as its name suggests, is part of the same family of companies as CVS Pharmacy and the health insurer Aetna.
Though PBMs are often labeled as middlemen when it comes to setting drug prices, many consider themselves a professional service that represents the interests of the health plans they represent – and the people covered by those plans. The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, a national trade organization that represents many of these PBMs, says these groups are often at odds with drugmakers, too.
“PBMs are committed to lowering prescription drug costs by taking on Big Pharma to provide Indiana patients with greater access to medications and empower employers in the state to offer high quality pharmacy benefits,” said Phil Christofanelli, the senior director of state affairs for PCMA, in a statement.
It’s hard to track how many pharmacies have closed across the country, but one advocacy group said more than 325 did so from mid-December 2024 through mid-March 2025 alone. Most of those were independent operations. Another group said pharmacy closures in 2024 averaged eight per day nationwide, representing a 3% drop in total locations throughout the country. One of the main culprits? PBMs are reimbursing pharmacies below the market cost of many drugs, sometimes even at a net negative, advocates and community pharmacy owners say.
How much under reimbursement is happening? Darren Covington, executive vice president at the Indiana Pharmacy Association, says some pharmacies are losing money on about 40% of their medicines after factoring in the amount of money it costs to dispense a drug.
“If you can imagine any other retailer or business that would undersell 40% of their products or services, it’s just not sustainable,” he said. “And so that’s why you see so many closures.”
What is a pharmacy desert?
All those shuttered pharmacies in Indiana and beyond contribute to so-called pharmacy deserts, and it’s not just the independent pharmacies that are shutting their doors. Many big pharmacy chains, including Walgreens and CVS, have closed hundreds of locations nationwide over the last few years, too. In 2025 alone, two Walgreens stores and one CVS closed in Indianapolis.
Similar to the term food desert, the pharmacy version refers to the lack of any type of pharmacy in a community or area. The typical measurement is neighborhoods and homes that are further than one mile away from a pharmacy for urban areas, two miles for the suburbs and 10 miles for those who live in rural areas. A 2024 Ohio State study found that nearly half of the counties in the U.S. had at least one pharmacy desert. A 2021 study showed that 60% of Indianapolis neighborhoods fit the qualifications of an urban pharmacy desert.
But the risks caused by pharmacy deserts are more than a few extra minutes of travel time.
Researchers, advocates and pharmacists themselves argue that almost every place is at risk of being harmed by a potential pharmacy closure, at least when it comes to adequately serving the most vulnerable populations. That would include those who are homebound, low-income, elderly and those residents who don’t speak English as their first language. To those groups, an engaged and caring pharmacist can become a steward of that patient’s health care in ways that most wouldn’t understand.
“Most people don’t understand that retail pharmacy is more than just a drive-thru experience. It’s compared to fast-food in a negative way sometimes, but in reality, (pharmacists) are a very important part of your health care needs,” Lindsey Angelotti said.
What is the blueprint of a successful community pharmacy?
Even in the face of closures and conflicts, independent pharmacies can find success. The key is the willingness to change and to explore other revenue streams, according to Covington.
“Independent pharmacies – the ones that are still making it – they’re adapting,” he said. “They’re finding their own niche markets, but the vast majority of their business is still dispensing prescriptions. And when you’re taking a heavy loss on the vast majority of their business, you can’t survive.”
For Ella Community Pharmacy, the goal has always been to be the best two pharmacies in Hamilton County for its customers and the community, but how the team achieves that mission has certainly changed, even during the span the Angelottis have owned the place.
While providing medication is still at the core of what its team does, the operation has diversified its offerings over the last few years. The Angelottis expanded the pharmacy’s packaging services and have gotten into the medical equipment and consultation side of things, too.
“We’ve pushed ourselves to push the envelope and be more cutting edge than we once were because without that cutting edge right now in community pharmacy, you can’t stay alive,” Lindsey Angelotti said.
Independent pharmacists urge lawmakers to adopt PBM bill

She acknowledges that the current reality of a community pharmacy profit model is hard to overcome. Ella has more than a few prescriptions that it takes a loss on once they go through the claims process. But she said the key to being a vital — and financially successful part of the community – is being on the cutting edge.
She’s thankful to serve a customer base that appreciates everything a solid independent pharmacy can mean to those around it. Ella’s Sheridan operation traces its roots back to the turn of the 20th century, and the Westfield location was added in 1981, so history is on their side. Customers often share stories of older family members visiting the pharmacy decades ago, but they have also embraced its next chapter, too. To her, the patients her team serves on a regular basis have become an extension of her family, and she always assures them that they’re in it for the long haul, no matter what obstacles come next.
“I tell my patients that we’re going to stick around as long as this community will keep us. If we have support from them, we’ll be here for them,” she said.
Interest in pharmacy careers is also waning
Coupled with the decline of actual brick-and-mortar pharmacies is the fact that not as many students want to be pharmacists as two decades ago, either. Purdue University’s College of Pharmacy’s numbers remain strong – 146 candidates graduated from its professional program in May, according to Patti Darbishire, the executive associate dean of Purdue’s College of Pharmacy. She said the school hasn’t had issues filling its 150-person class size each year, mostly thanks to a popular pre-pharmacy undergraduate program.
However, declining applications for the last 10 to 15 years is a national trend that is often talked about in her educational circles, she said. Other high-paying opportunities for those involved in health fields have contributed to more competition for interested students.
Like with many health care professionals, some established pharmacists left the profession during the pandemic, adding to the shortage, too. But pharmacy, which offers other avenues other than a career on the community/retail side of things, remains a solid career choice, especially for those wanting that interaction with the public. Darbishire also pushes back on the money aspect — saying the starting salary of a pharmacist is still around six figures per year — despite all the current obstacles.
“We need better branding about what a pharmacist looks like and what they do,” Darbishire said. “We’ve always had a good starting salary… it pretty much holds at about $125,000 for a new grad so that’s pretty appealing.”
Could there be a legislative solution?
Lawmakers at both the federal and state levels have PBMs on their radar, though real action steps by most have been less than swift. In fact, Indiana’s 2025 legislative session was proof of that. However, in Arkansas — like Indiana, is run largely by Republicans — lawmakers recently took aim at PBMs by banning these entities from owning pharmacies. Though the new law is currently not in effect due to a federal court injunction, the move was lauded by state officials and pharmacy owners themselves as one that will cut costs and improve accessibility.
Indiana’s Senate Enrolled Act 140, which was authored by state Sen. Ed Charbonneau, R-Valparaiso, in its original form, would have, like the new Arkansas law, banned PBMs from owning their own pharmacies or health insurance companies.
The proposal, which caught the attention of the country’s largest PBMs, was dialed back before being passage. Some of the language that did male it into law were provisions aimed at PBMs who have been under-reimbursing pharmacies through a practice known as price spreading. That is when these groups charge an insurance company one price for a medication dispensed, but send much less money for that same medication to pharmacists for reimbursement, while pocketing the profits. A recent Indiana audit found that nearly $323 million had gone to PBMs through this practice during a five-year period from taxpayers covering state employee health plans and Medicaid. Those plans spend a total of over $2 billion per year for prescription drugs.
Though he had hoped for more reform and called the Arkansas law the “North Star” of reform, Covington said banning PBM ownership of pharmacies here in the Hoosier State is likely not in the cards at this time. For example, he said, there are many areas of Indiana that are only served by a CVS Pharmacy, complicating the matter.

Whether there will be more proposed PBM reform at the Statehouse level next year or beyond is yet to be seen. However, House Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis, who was the House sponsor of Senate Enrolled Act 140, hopes to continue to do what she and other lawmakers can to preserve the relationship people have with their pharmacist and do what she can to help drive down the cost of health care.
“We’re just going to keep moving the needle and chipping away on this issue,” McGuire said.
While this pharmacy access and billing issue may feel at an arm’s length for many Hoosiers, McGuire also points to one that is hitting many Hoosier workers in their pocketbooks – the cost of their health insurance through an employer’s plan. She specifically called out the amount of money PBMs make from their price-spreading practices, citing that state audit and said she’s talked to as many PBMs as possible, trying to see some justification for these money levels. However, she still believes there’s a lack of transparency from these groups.
“I think employer groups got a little concerned about us trying to get involved in their contracting, because they think they’re getting a good deal and they’re not getting a good deal,” she said.
The PCMA pushes back on the idea that PBMs are anti-community pharmacy. It points to data that shows the number of independent pharmacies grew 4.9% in the state over the last decade, and new findings from a 2025 research study that showed 9,098 independent pharmacies closed during this time and 10,974 new independent pharmacies opened nationwide from 2010 to 2023. However, the authors of that study wrote themselves that the sheer amount of openings and closings may be of concern even if the percentages showed a “healthy churn.”
“PBMs recognize the valuable role of pharmacies in Indiana to provide access to medications, Christofanelli said in his statement. “PBMs are not putting independent pharmacies out of business. Independent pharmacies are opening and closing across the country, representing a normal churn that many businesses experience.”
But Covington says things must continue to change in favor of pharmacists regarding profit models and more for them to do their job effectively. For example, people should know about the professional services every pharmacist puts into the job. When the latest legislation passed with a dispensing fee, critics immediately called it a “pill tax,” which Covington rebukes.
That fee, as well as changing reimbursement rates to a medication’s invoicing costs, were steps in the right direction for many of his members, he said. The new law does not specify a fee amount; instead, it directs it to be “fair and reasonable.’
“It’s not a tax, first of all. The government doesn’t collect the money,” Covington said. “There’s a cost to perform a service, and either that cost gets paid or pharmacies will continue to be under-reimbursed and will continue to close – and there’s a societal cost to that, too.”

The end of ACA tax credits is expected to cost people thousands of dollars more in annual premiums. Advocates urge Congress to extend the credits but time is running short. 
The post Wyomingites brace for spiking health insurance prices as marketplace changes loom appeared first on WyoFile .","Lately, budget planning has been a source of uncertainty and dread for Laramie resident Jessica Brauer. 
The executive director of the Laramie Plains Civic Center gets her health insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace, which was created under the Affordable Care Act in 2010 to help more Americans afford coverage. 
A prominent feature of the program, known as the Advance Premium Tax Credits, provides subsidies that drastically reduce premium costs. With the credits, Brauer pays around $325 a month. Without them, she said, her monthly costs would be $816 — a 150% jump. 
She has been lucky to be generally healthy, she said; she hasn’t needed extensive or expensive care. She carries the policy more for the off chance that something catastrophic were to happen.
But now Brauer — one of more than 40,000 Wyoming residents who are covered on the marketplace — is wondering if she’ll be able to afford insurance without the tax credits. Congress has not extended them beyond 2025, meaning they will expire after December unless federal lawmakers take action.
Because of the way enrollment works, Brauer and others don’t know how much the costs will change. 
“That’s the part that is the most unsettling … I don’t totally know until the marketplace opens on Nov. 1” what the cost breakdown will be, Brauer said. “So I’m in kind of an odd holding pattern, where I am waiting for the marketplace to open and then I’ll know what my options are. I’ll then know if they work with my budget or not.”
In addition, Brauer was covered through Mountain Health Co-op, which announced in August that it will no longer offer health plans in Wyoming at the end of the year. That means Wyoming will be down to just two providers.
If she does face costs in that $800-monthly range, Brauer said, she’ll likely find another option. 
“Frankly, I don’t think I would be able to pay it,” she said. “That is comparable to my mortgage payment.” 
The end of the tax credits will have significant implications on the health care access of thousands of small business employees, self-employed individuals and others in Wyoming, advocates warn. Between 11,000-20,000 state residents are at risk of losing their coverage due to the anticipated cost increases, according to Healthy Wyoming.

“These tax credits have been a lifeline for folks in Wyoming to afford health care insurance,” Healthy Wyoming Executive Director Jenn Lowe told WyoFile.
While patients like Bauer are bracing for significant — and in some cases untenable — increases, advocates worry that too many others aren’t aware of what’s about to happen. 
The change comes amid several recent developments expected to further diminish care in Wyoming, a state that has long struggled to provide health care access. 
Mounting challenges
Wyoming’s rural nature creates many challenges to health care access. Hospitals here struggle to hire and retain doctors and nurses, services like baby deliveries have eroded and patients increasingly travel long distances for specialists and other health services. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July, is projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years. That will result in 10.3 million fewer people enrolled nationally, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Changes include increased work requirements and potential penalties for states that have expanded Medicaid.
As one of the few states that hasn’t expanded Medicaid, Wyoming will avoid some of the immediate hits, experts say. But it will still likely result in coverage losses as well as other downstream effects. The cuts in the federal bill could cost Wyoming nearly 200 jobs per year and shrink the state’s economy by $140 million over five years, a new economic analysis finds. 
The Wyoming Medicaid program covers 62,000 patients, according to Families USA. Some 42,000 residents, meanwhile, get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which is available to people who don’t qualify for Medicaid and don’t have insurance through an employer.
In 2020, Congress created the enhanced tax credit to overcome affordability challenges. That helped contribute to an all-time low in America’s uninsured rate, health advocates say. Congress extended the credits in 2022 and must act again to make them permanent before they expire at the end of the year. 
According to health care access advocates, insurance premiums will jump substantially for Wyoming residents enrolled in the Affordable Care Act marketplace unless Congress acts soon to extend tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025. (Blood Cancer United) 
Time is running short; there are about 30 days until enrollment opens. 
“Because [Wyoming is] a big rural state, health care costs are already higher,” said Thea Zajac, senior director of grassroots advocacy for Blood Cancer United, a national nonprofit that fights to cure blood cancers and improve the quality of life for patients and families. “The premiums in these plans tend to be higher in states like Wyoming and Alaska, and so the jumps for folks in the state are going to be even more dramatic” than in more populous states. 
The estimated impacts look alarming for some. According to Healthy Wyoming, a 60-year-old couple with an annual income of $82,000 will face an increase of $37,422 in annual health care costs due to the tax credit loss. 
It’s been difficult to spread the message to the public, Lowe and Zajac said. Insurance is complicated, and it’s likely many people who receive the credits aren’t even aware of that fact. Both expect that many people will go to sign up for the marketplace and be shocked at the new rates. 
“I think there’s a lot of people who have these plans who are just going to be blindsided by this,” Zajac said. 
“I honestly feel like, I would say more than half will probably just decline to even buy insurance,” Lowe told WyoFile. 
In a development that could bolster health care here, Wyoming stands to receive $500 million to $800 million from a new federal program, the Rural Health Transformation Program, which aims to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. But critics are skeptical that short-term funding boosts can create sustainable solutions.  
Looming deadline
Lander resident Elizabeth Aranow and her husband, both independent contractors, are insured through the marketplace. They are also contending with huge unknowns when it comes to the costs of health care coverage. 
If the tax credits aren’t renewed, Aranow said, monthly costs could be “hundreds, if not thousands of dollars more,” she said. “But we just don’t know.”
It’s created a new layer of stress in their lives, she said, and fueled questions like: “Do I need more contracts? Do I need to stop doing contract work and find an employer that offers health insurance? 
“And so it’s, it’s unsettling to have such a big financial question,” Aranow said. Not having insurance isn’t an option, she added. “I want to be responsible and I want to financially plan, but I can’t financially plan for something I don’t know what it is. And I think that that makes it even harder.”

Congress can still act. Ideally, the body would pass an extension as part of the continuing resolution that needs to pass by Sept. 30 to fund the federal government, Zajac said. 
“We’re at the last kind of possible point to really fix this before people are now going to start getting their renewal notices,” she said. “The deadline is looming.”
Wyoming’s congressional delegation supported the Big Beautiful Bill. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, a physician, said the new Rural Health Transformation program the bill created will ensure continued health care access in the state. 
“It will give Wyoming’s rural providers the resources to adopt innovative technologies, expand access to care, and retain highly skilled healthcare professionals,” Barrasso wrote in a Sept. 26 newsletter. 
Wyoming’s health department is currently holding public meetings around the state aimed at gathering input on rural health care challenges and opportunities.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A new consent order issued by the New Jersey Supreme Court on Monday will require the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office to speed processing of expungement petitions that often stretch past the 60-day review called for by state law.
The agreement will require Essex prosecutors to reduce their expungement backlog over the next five months, alongside some other concessions. State Public Defender Jennifer Sellitti praised the agreement as one that will allow Essex residents who have earned a second chance to “no longer face indefinite delays.”
“It is a significant step toward making the promise of New Jersey’s expungement laws a reality,” Sellitti said.

The consent order resolves litigation the Office of the Public Defender filed over the expungement backlog in Essex.
New Jersey has multiple expungement programs, but most often, individuals can have their records cleared after 10 years — and sometimes sooner — if they have completed their sentences, paid any fines, and have not reoffended.
Once an offense is expunged, authorities by law cannot share that information except with law enforcement, corrections, or court officials, though persistent delays throughout the expungement system have led to the disclosure of convictions for some expungable offenses.
Those delays were greatest in Essex County, which in February accounted for a quarter of the state’s expungement backlog. The 501 expungement applications backlogged there then more than doubled the number in any other county. Passaic County had the next most, at 244.
“As always when the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office recognizes an area which can be improved, we address it promptly and seek appropriate resolution. We are pleased that this matter was resolved amicably,” Essex County Prosecutor Theodore Stephens said in a statement.
The consent order will require the prosecutor’s office to cut its backlog so that no more than 20% of petitions are pending after 60 days by February 2026. Beginning next March, the office will be required to reduce its backlog to below 20% of cases and keep it there through at least March 2027.
The prosecutor’s office also agreed not to object to expungement petitions based on missing probation documentation when the courts have already confirmed a person is eligible.
“By establishing clear benchmarks and removing unnecessary barriers, this consent order ensures that the process is fair, timely, and accessible for everyone,” said Fletcher Duddy, an assistant public defender. “It’s about giving people the ability to move forward with their lives without being held back by outdated administrative hurdles.”
Expungement delays are not new to New Jersey, nor are they unique to the state.
The New Jersey State Police in March settled a lawsuit over yearslong delays to thousands of expungements. The terms of that settlement include the creation of an online portal allowing individuals to track the progress of their expungement requests.
In March 2024, Gov. Phil Murphy signed bipartisan legislation to bar the State Police from releasing information about to-be-expunged offenses during background checks.

Biologists list 63 bears confirmed dead in 2025, up from 56 at this time in 2024, which was a record year.
The post Yellowstone ecosystem grizzlies dying at record pace in 2025 appeared first on WyoFile .","Federal wildlife biologists list 63 Yellowstone ecosystem grizzly bear deaths this year, a count that’s ahead of last year’s pace, when the highest number of mortalities on record was documented.
Last year, there were 77 known and probably grizzly bear mortalities, surpassing the previous record of 70 in both 2021 and 2018. By this time in 2024, 56 of that total number had succumbed, putting this year’s Sept. 13 “provisional” count ahead of last year’s record pace.
The accounting comes as Wyoming’s rifle elk hunting season — a time of increased conflicts between bears and armed people — gets underway. Double-digit numbers of grizzlies are typically shot and killed in hunter encounters every fall in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
“There’s no food for the animals to eat … so they’re coming down into the valley.” Meredith Taylor
This year’s high tally of preliminary mortalities, which are logged by the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, also comes as the ecosystem is in moderate to severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
“There’s no food for the animals to eat — for instance, bears — so they’re coming down into the valley,” said Meredith Taylor, a retired Dubois outfitter who teaches an ethnobiology class. “I was up on Togwotee Pass … in August … and I was absolutely horrified how poor the plants [were] — no berries.”
In September alone, biologists added 17 ecosystem grizzly bear deaths to the 2025 list. The specific dates of seven of those mortalities have not been entered.
On Sept. 21, Wyoming Game and Fish captured and moved two cubs from private land after they were “frequenting a residence” and could not be hazed away. There’s an open debate regarding whether grizzly conflicts are increasing and whether, if so, it’s attributable to having more bears or to more frequent droughts as a result of climate change.
Regardless, there’s a continuing push to remove federal regulations protecting the species. The grizzly is a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, with a population of 727 in the Yellowstone Ecosystem “demographic monitoring area” and an untold number on the fringes of that core zone.
‘Recovery goals exceeded’
U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman has introduced the Grizzly Bear State Management Act of 2025 that would remove federal grizzly protections for Yellowstone ecosystem bears “without regard to any other provision of law.” The bill passed out of a House committee.
The measure “shall not be subject to judicial review,” the bill states.

The state’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives has simultaneously sought to delist grizzly bears through the federal appropriations budgeting process. There is no “preferred” course of action, she told WyoFile in July at a Pinedale town hall meeting. 
“Whatever we can get through,” Hageman said.
Hageman was optimistic that she could corral the needed Democratic Party votes for legislative grizzly delisting to pass Congress.
“We might be able to,” she said. “This is a huge success story. Wyoming has spent millions of dollars recovering this species, we’ve done a phenomenal job and we manage them well.”  
‘Desk activists‘
In a statement announcing her bill, Hageman pointed out that Yellowstone-region grizzlies have “far exceeded” recovery goals. She blamed “federal lethargy and wildlife policy dictated by special-interest lobbyists under the Biden Administration” as factors that have kept protections in place.
Federal wildlife managers have “disregarded recovery data” and Washington bureaucrats “continue to obstruct delisting with needless delays and politicized decisions,” she stated. She blamed “desk activists” for “a troubling uptick in attacks on people, livestock, and property.”
“Families shouldn’t have to live in fear of grizzly bears rummaging through their trash or endangering their children,” Hageman wrote.
In addition to Hageman, the Yellowstone grizzly faces a Trump administration that recently installed former Wyoming Game and Fish Director Brian Nesvik as head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which has oversight over threatened and endangered species. As Game and Fish leader in Wyoming, Nesvik proposed a controversial hunting season for grizzly bears that a judge blocked at the last minute.
Taylor said she wrote Hageman to say “delisting the grizzly bear [at] this time is really a bad idea.” Climate change has reduced the annual crop of whitebark pine nuts as warmer temperatures have allowed insects to ravage stands of what was once a keystone grizzly food.
Whitebark pine, also a threatened species, is expected to see its suitable landscape decline by 80% by the middle of this century,” according to a recent paper published in Environmental Research Letters. Notably, federal scientists who’ve studied the importance of whitebark pine to grizzly bear populations have concluded that the adaptable, omnivorous species can sustain without the high-elevation seeds.  
Hunting could provide big game gut piles for scavenging, but the season also brings obvious dangers for bears and people. “Of course, that’s a time when people are out there with guns,” she said.

For the last several months, Laramie Rep. Karlee Provenza and Jackson Rep. Mike Yin have been traversing the state to encourage conversation across party lines.
The post The art of listening spotlighted on Democratic lawmakers’ Wyoming tour appeared first on WyoFile .","BANNER—On a recent evening at the Kearney Community Hall, Sheridan and Johnson county residents gathered for a community discussion organized by two of the state’s democratic lawmakers. 
For the last several months, Laramie Rep. Karlee Provenza and Jackson Rep. Mike Yin have been on a listening tour of Wyoming, visiting cities and towns outside their progressive communities and encouraging Wyomingites of all political stripes to show up and participate. 
“We’re traveling around the state so that we can get a better understanding of what the problems are that impact your day-to-day lives, and what are the solutions that you want to see moving forward,” Provenza told the crowd assembled Wednesday evening. 
The two lawmakers first hatched their plan long before the country was reeling from Charlie Kirk’s assassination. In a moment pulled taut by controversy, their listening sessions took on a new significance. 
“At a time of such political violence and hate and rhetoric in our country, it’s maybe more important than ever that we can sit at a table with our community and disagree and still love each other,” Provenza said.  
In Banner, about 90 people showed up. Most leaned to the left, a handful were Republicans and at least one couple said they were independent voters. The evening sun shone through the community hall’s northwest windows. String lights cast a warm glow above about a dozen tables where attendees sat and faced one another. Quilts hung throughout the room. Participants broke bread with veggie trays and homemade cookies.

The two lawmakers are hardly alone in their touring endeavor. Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, for example, has held more than a dozen town halls since this spring and aims to visit each county. At her town hall in Laramie in March, U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman said it was her 74th in the state. 
What sets Provenza and Yin’s gatherings apart is how they facilitate conversation between the attendees. Instead of listening to a stump speech or participating in a Q&A, attendees break into smaller groups to discuss what’s worrying them about Wyoming and what they’d like to see done about it. 
“You might be happy about what’s happened federally. You might be not happy,” Provenza said. “But we’re going to stick to Wyoming problems and Wyoming solutions today.” 
To set the tone for the night, Provenza and Yin presented community agreements, or guidelines, to keep the evening productive. Treat each other with respect. Assume good intentions. Pipe down if you’re hogging the conversation. Speak up if you usually don’t. Communicate constructively. 
“Do we all agree to these?” Provenza asked. The room applauded. 
The first prompt was simple — “What keeps you up at night? What are the biggest concerns that impact your daily life?”
Not everyone saw things exactly the same. Some actively disagreed. But a few patterns emerged when a speaker from each group stood and shared highlights. 
People were worried about public lands, public education, guns in schools, affordable housing, access to health care, the state’s election system, low wages, high grocery prices and property tax cuts hurting local services. 
Kris Korfanta, a resident of Ranchester, said her group — which had mixed political affiliations — worried about the assumption that “those who disagree with us have bad intentions.”
“Thank you for also speaking to voices that you may not necessarily agree with,” Yin told Korfanta. “It sounds like you have folks from all over.” 
The groups were then asked to get more creative. 
“We want you to brainstorm some news headlines that you would [like to] see in the next one to five years,” Provenza said, encouraging folks to focus on policy and solutions, and not individuals. 
“What would you read in a newspaper headline if you read it and you went, ‘Thank God, Wyoming’s on the right track?’”
After another round of discussion, the groups weighed in with their headlines. A couple hoped to see Wyoming’s historically high suicide rate drop to the lowest in the country. While some called for the elimination of the state’s gender wage gap, one table hoped Wyoming would repeal its open-carry law and ban assault weapons. Another wanted to see Wyoming lead the country in job creation and construction of new homes. Others still wanted to see voter turnout surpass the 50% mark and open primary elections. 
Provenza and Yin plan to take what they’ve learned from the sessions and bring it to the rest of their statehouse colleagues.
“I want to go to the Legislature and say, ‘Look, we went to every corner of Wyoming. These are the things that every corner of Wyoming told us that they wanted to work on. Let’s work on them together,’” Yin said, adding that he appreciated other lawmakers who participated in the sessions. 
In Banner, that included Republican Reps. Tom Kelly of Sheridan and Marilyn Connolly of Buffalo. After the event, Kelly told WyoFile he’d attended because “the rhetoric has gotten so toxic.”
“We’re seeing less about trying to accomplish goals and more about trying to win arguments,” Kelly said. “And I think I wanted to set an example for other conservatives that there are other people to listen to.” 
Kelly shared a table with Korfanta, the Democrat from Ranchester. She told WyoFile after the event she’d intentionally chosen to sit down at a table with Republicans. Why?
“Practice,” Korfanta said. “It’s important to practice and not get riled up by what somebody said.”
The next night, Yin and Provenza would head to Cody, and soon after, Washakie, Hot Springs and Big Horn counties. There were more gatherings, more conversations ahead.

Comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s comments on his late-night talk show about MAGA’s reaction to the assassination of conservative leader Charlie Kirk sparked the latest national controversy over the First Amendment.
I’d like to take readers back to 1994, when free speech was part of my lawsuit against Cheyenne Newspapers Inc. after I was fired for refusing to wear an anti-union button during our newsroom’s attempt to unionize. (If you’d like to learn more about the case, you can read this earlier column.)
Free speech was part of my complaint against the company, because the right to wear a button to express any opinion has long been recognized as protected under the First Amendment. Co-plaintiff Kelly Flores and I were expressing the right not to wear a button that expressed an opinion we did not share with the company’s management.
While we were silent, our message was clear: that’s free speech too. 
I still maintain that both the U.S. and Wyoming constitutions protected us. The former, though, is often interpreted by the public as the right to say anything, with exceptions for speaking to incite violence or cause other harm. But that’s not always how it works.


Despite the First Amendment saying, “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech,” our case was rejected by a federal court in Cheyenne. 
But the story doesn’t end there. Because the Wyoming Constitution also offers free speech protection for the public and the press, our lawsuit was transferred to the state district court in Gillette.
We got our hopes up because the Wyoming Constitution says, “Every person may freely speak, write and publish on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right.”
While Wyoming is a right-to-work state where an employer can fire an at-will worker without cause, workers can’t be fired for discriminatory or retaliatory reasons. I believe suspending workers without pay for a month and then terminating them for not wearing a button is textbook retaliation!
But the judge still ruled in the newspaper’s favor. We appealed to the Wyoming Supreme Court, which heard our case. In fact, because it was an intriguing civil lawsuit, the high court decided to hold the hearing at the University of Wyoming College of Law so students could attend.
One of the justices, Larry Lehman, asked what I considered the best question that day: Does an employer have the right to demand a worker have a swastika shaved into the hair on the back of his head? In other words, does that demand reasonably go beyond the scope of firing a worker for not complying with management’s order in an at-will state?
The question took me — and the newspaper’s attorney — by surprise. All I remember is that he stammered throughout his response and never actually answered the justice’s question. I thought this would work to our benefit.
But apparently, the correct answer was yes, you can demand an at-will employee to wear a button or swastika or anything else without violating the worker’s free speech rights. When the Wyoming Supreme Court ruled several months later, it voted 5-0 to uphold the lower court’s decision.
Guess who wrote the opinion? Justice Lehman.
Here’s one of his conclusions: “Terminating an at-will employee for exercising his right to free speech by refusing to follow a legal directive of an employer on the employer’s premises during working hours does not violate public policy.”
Lehman added “that irony exists in this case because the employer purports to be an advocate for free speech.”
One of the reasons I decided to sue for wrongful termination is I wanted to establish there are limitations to what companies can ask an employee to do without violating their free speech rights. Wearing a button totally against my belief that workers have the right to form a union to collectively bargain was the ideological sword I was willing to die on.
I must admit I was devastated when I lost the case, and it shook my faith in the fairness of the justice system and its interpretation of the First Amendment’s protection of free speech. 
But losing didn’t break me, and I’ve continued my journalism career for more than three decades. I was confident none of my employers would order me to do something against my principles, and that’s proven true.
I want to stress that I hold no ill will against the Wyoming Tribune Eagle, a paper I proudly worked at for 18 years. The management team responsible for my leaving left long ago, and publications owned by Cheyenne Newspapers Inc. were sold to a different publisher. 
The Tribune Eagle has an excellent editor, Brian Martin, who has the wisdom to regularly run my WyoFile column, which helps me stay in contact with long-time Cheyenne readers from my days as an editor of the Wyoming Eagle. I greatly appreciate his support.
And the Tribune Eagle now has a union. I’m happy I was part of that fight.
About a year after Drake v. Cheyenne Newspapers Inc. was decided, an attorney friend attended a legal conference in California. After a particularly boring run-down of recent cases, a lawyer offered what he called “some comic relief.”
Of course, he was referring to my case. I feared that the discussion might be about the lawsuit being frivolous or not pertinent to the issue of free speech. But the speaker explained that Wyoming is one of the most anti-worker states in the nation. I agree.
He detailed the case and said that in any other state, Flores and I probably would have won. My interpretation: We had the misfortune of being fired in an anti-union state where the highest court did not respect the Wyoming Constitution’s guarantee of free speech for all citizens.
I still believe in the First Amendment. But don’t count on it being a lifeline to your employment.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia  MercuryRichmond-area House of Delegates candidates participated in a forum focused on housing affordability and economic issues last Thursday night. Virginia Poverty Law Center hosted the event at the main branch of the Richmond Public Library. 
Housing affordability and rental protections were key topics addressed at the forum as well as ideas on energy affordability and debt collection. With rising inflation, long-simmering housing stock and affordability issues in much of Virginia, and the state’s need to contend with federal funding fallout, affordability has emerged as a key campaign talking point.
Those in attendance were Dels. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, Rae Cousins, D-Richmond, Deborah Gardner, D-Chesterfield and Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, along with Scott Konopasek, who’s vying to represent House District 59 that spansHanover, Louisa and Henrico, Jonas Eppert, who is angling to represent Chesterfield County-anchored House District 74 and Lindsey Dougherty, who  is again running to represent House District 75, which includes Chesterfield, Hopewell and Prince George. None of their Republican challengers were in attendance.
 Housing affordability and quality 

While the forum covered a range of affordability issues from energy to taxes, the bulk of the questions focused on housing policy. 
Konopasek shared his experience as a landlord and said that lawmakers should take people’s hardship into account to help curb evictions. 
One such proposal has already been explored but was met with Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s veto this year. The bill, by Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, would have extended the rent grace period from five days to 14 days. The idea is that the extended time gives tenants a chance to resolve sudden financial setbacks and be less likely to face eviction. 
Eppert also said he supports the idea of limits on raising rent. A related idea was presented this year by Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, which would require advance notice to tenants if rents are being raised and would have set limits on the rates if it had become law. 
As Gardner’s district includes some mobile home neighborhoods, she was asked how the state can further help localities preserve these communities. In mobile home neighborhoods,  residents own their homes but  often don’t own the land beneath them. Sometimes developers purchase these properties and then residents are forced to move. Despite the term “mobile” being in the name, the housing type is often not stable enough to be relocated once initially placed. 
“We need to make sure that when parks are purchased, there are restrictions on what (developers) can do when they redevelop,” Gardner said, adding ideas for policy solutions that would discourage displacement or support families in their relocation.
State and regional housing grants support new affordable homes in the greater Richmond area 

Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond — who moderator and journalist Michael Pope said was a “last-minute addition” to the forum emphasized how “localities can make a difference in housing projects that they allow to come in.” Jones is running for reelection and was a former Richmond City Council member.
However, tensions often emerge when the state legislature floats ideas to encourage or require certain housing actions by localities, because local governments have authority over local land use decisions like zoning and housing developments. 
A bill by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, which passed that chamber this year before falling in the Senate, would have incentivized localities who address housing affordability issues before permitting the state to step in if they don’t.
“We have to assist localities either with a stick or a carrot to make these things happen,” Jones said. 
When asked about accountability for landlords in maintaining habitability for tenants, Gardner recalled how local news almost always includes “somebody complaining about a slumlord.” 
While the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act has been referenced in lawsuits challenging landlords for unsafe living conditions, Gardner believes the legislature can find ways to strengthen it. 
Willett shared that when door-knocking for his campaigns or volunteering for Meals on Wheels, he’s seen firsthand how some homes and apartments exist in “unacceptable” conditions. 
On that front, Cousins had carried a bill that Youngkin vetoed which would have allowed tenants to bring a lawsuit against their landlord over abatement issues while putting their rent into an escrow account in the interim. 
 Energy affordability and debt collection

Though housing dominated the forum, energy affordability was a flashpoint in the discussion.. 
When asked how energy costs could be brought down, Eppert noted how the proliferation of data centers in the state are driving up energy costs for Virginia consumers. 
“Dominion is a regulated monopoly. Key word, ‘regulated,’” Eppert said. 
He also suggested data centers could tap into renewable energy and battery storage to generate additional electricity on site. 
Dougherty echoed what Eppert had suggested and noted Dominion Energy’s proposed gas peaker plant in her district.
When responding to a question about debt collection, Jones and Cousins pointed to a proposed bill this session that failed which they’d like to vote on again. Carried by Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Virginia Beach, the proposal would have regulated how wage garnishments occur. 
Jones also noted that people sometimes fall into debt after a medical emergency and then have trouble getting back on track. 
 Absent Republicans weigh in

While Republicans did not attend the gathering, the Virginia Mercury reached out to them the day before the event to ask broadly about their housing affordability policy plans. Most did not respond to requests for comment.
In a phone call, Republican Del. Carrie Coyner — who serves on the state’s Housing Commission and is the incumbent candidate in House District 75 —  emphasized her bipartisan effort with Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield (who is running for lieutenant governor) to create a special housing assistance fund that low-income families with school-aged children can tap into. The goal, dubbed “5,000 Families” is to prevent displacement during school years should a family become financially unstable. 
“We know that kids who are able to stay in the same school for their entire school year have higher rates of getting ahead and keeping up in school than children who have to move around,” she said, and added that she’s been in touch with constituents facing such situations. 
Though the proposal did not clear budget negotiations, she plans to try again next year. She also wants to bring back a bill to ensure that properties are appraised with their affordability status taken into account. The bill was left in a committee this session. 
“You can’t keep your rent affordable, and then have the assessors charging you as if you’re collecting full market rate rent,” Coyner said.
A spokesperson for Kelsey Linnehan, a Republican running against Cousins to represent House District 79 said that the campaign was not invited to the event but shared ideas for addressing affordability issues. 
Linnehan supports eliminating Virginia’s car tax — a proposal both gubernatorial candidates Republican Winsome Earle-Sears and Democrat Abigail Spanberger back and which has failed when previous administrations have tried to undo it. In Richmond specifically, Linnehan appreciates the city council’s consideration of lowering property tax rates, “which would also make home ownership more affordable.” 
Richmond City Council recently delayed a vote on the proposal Linnehan referenced to a meeting date next month. 
Editor’s note: Due to Jones’ status as an unexpected participant in the candidate forum, The Mercury was not able to reach out to his opponent, Republican Richard Stonage, ahead of the event as it did for other candidates.

(Photo: Sam Stockard/Tennessee Lookout)The Elon Musk-owned company preparing to dig a 10-mile tunnel from downtown Nashville to the airport is estimating a cost of $240 million to $300 million to build two underground lanes to ferry passengers back and forth.
Jim Fitzgerald, chief of development for The Boring Company, told the Nashville Rotary Club Monday that’s how much the company would charge the state under a commercial contract. Because of its engineering-based operations, which keep most facets of work in-house, Fitzgerald said his firm can do the job cheaper than the industry rate of roughly $500 million to more than $1 billion per mile for two lanes. Riders would catch Musk’s Tesla vehicles at above-ground locations and ride in tunnels to their destination.
“That is one of the ways that we are trying to disrupt the tunneling transportation infrastructure industry,” Fitzgerald said in response to audience questions.
A 2018 transportation plan proposed by former Mayor Megan Barry projected the cost for a light rail system at $200 million per mile, a total cost of $5.4 billion for 24 miles of rail along five corridors. Mayor Freddie O’Connell’s new transportation plan focuses more on bus transit and doesn’t include light rail construction.

Nashville organizations such as the Music City Center and Chamber of Commerce are backing the Boring proposal because of the possibility of reducing traffic congestion. Numerous residents raised questions about it at a State Building Commission meeting, including environmental impacts.
The Boring Company, which has the support of Gov. Bill Lee, promised to fund the “Music City Loop” project completely yet obtained a no-cost lease to launch its digging equipment in a state-owned parking lot near the Capitol. The state also plans to provide Boring with free public right of way underneath state highways for the project.
Fitzgerald told the audience once the company “proves” itself with the first leg of the plan it will decide where other lines can be constructed. 
Fitzgerald, who declined to answer questions Monday from the Lookout, said the 6-mile “Vegas Loop” has 4,400 passengers per hour. The company is planning to build 60 miles of tunnels there but has hit some snags.
A ProPublica report showed the company built tunnels without permits for work on county property, dumped untreated water into storm drains and sewers, then was fined $112,000 over workers’ complaints about severe burns and muck spills. Boring is contesting those violations, according to the report.
On Sept. 11, work on the “Las Vegas Loop” was paused after a Boring Company worker suffered a “crushing injury” on the project. 
Boring started looking at Nashville for its next major U.S. project in March 2024, he said. 
Fitzgerald said he understands Nashville’s propensity for “hellacious floods” but noted tunnels will be waterproof and equipped with sump pumps while stations will be elevated and built with drains. In case of flooding, the tunnel would be evacuated and cleaned up by Boring, regardless of the cost.
Tennessee governor: State will provide right of way for Musk’s Boring tunnel

Asked by a Rotary Club member why this plan will work when questions were raised about the underground tunnel portion of the Metro mayor’s failed proposal seven years ago, Fitzgerald said the company is conducting “substantial investigations” on the makeup of the area’s subterranean conditions. The region’s karst topography is characterized by weathered limestone that creates sinkholes, caves, springs and underground streams that change over time.
Critics of the project have raised questions about the potential for drilling into caves and underground streams, as well as the possibility for damaging utilities such as sewer lines. Boring has said it would work with local utility companies to avoid disruptions.
Fitzgerald, though, said the deeper the company digs the more consistent and predictable the rock becomes, lessening the likelihood of environmental damage.
Discussing safety, the Boring officer said he would feel comfortable letting his 16-year-old daughter ride in the Vegas tunnel by herself.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)President Donald Trump’s budget request would completely eliminate funding for five National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research laboratories in Tennessee, a new interactive map of the national weather and climate agency’s locations shows. 
Trump’s proposal would terminate all funding for the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, an arm that NOAA states “enables better forecasts, earlier warnings for natural disasters, and a greater understanding of the Earth.”
New York-based nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund released the interactive map, created using public “NOAA in Your State and Territory” documents and other government sources, earlier this month. It lays out NOAA’s 735-site national reach “to help policymakers and the public alike understand the agency’s local footprint and impact,” the nonprofit stated in a news release.
The map shows nine NOAA locations in Tennessee, including three National Weather Service offices and a Center Weather Service Unit at the Federal Aviation Administration’s Memphis Air Traffic Control Center, in addition to the five research laboratories housed under the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. Three of those research centers are based in Oak Ridge.
NOAA’s Tennessee research facilities range in focus from air quality to forest carbon sequestration to climate anomalies and historical context. 
The Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory houses a NOAA supercomputer called “Gaea” that is used to “develop and refine advanced weather and climate models,” according to NOAA documents. A NOAA research location in Crossville is one of more than 138 stations nationwide that feeds climate monitoring data to the U.S. Climate Reference Network. 
The president’s $4.5 billion budget request for NOAA in fiscal year 2026 represents a 30% cut, focused on programs having to do with climate research, including the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. Some of the research office’s functions would be moved to other offices.
NOAA’s research office received $656 million in fiscal year 2024. Trump’s fiscal year 2026 proposal would slash that to $0. 
NOAA Budget proposals from the U.S. House and Senate take a less drastic approach: making small cuts and avoiding laboratory closures or keeping the budget flat, Inside Climate News reported on Sept. 13.
The new federal fiscal year begins on Oct. 1. If Congress does not pass a budget or a resolution to extend government operations under the current budget by then, the federal government will shut down.

(Courtesy of Colorado Parks and Wildlife)Colorado will soon make history with a long-awaited wildlife crossing project on Interstate 25, but the state faces fiscal headwinds in continuing its plan to build other facilities to help animals avoid highways. No federal grant money was awarded to the Centennial State for the current fiscal year and the Trump administration has frozen some previously awarded funds. 
And money allocated for overpasses and underpasses by a recent state law has dried up as budget challenges have discouraged the state Legislature from continuing to appropriate funds first authorized in 2022.
Nevertheless, four significant infrastructure developments to benefit wildlife are completed, underway or planned in the state. In addition to the Greenland Wildlife Overpass Project in southern Douglas County, the state Department of Transportation has finished a crossing on Colo. 9 north of Kremmling and another on U.S. 160 west of Pagosa Springs. The fourth, which is not complete, is on Interstate 70 near Vail Pass. Colorado and New Mexico have also been working on a wildlife crossing at Raton Pass, on I-25 at the states’ joint border.

Renee Callahan, the executive director of ARC Solutions, a nonprofit organization that guides states and other interested governments in building wildlife crossings, is especially enthusiastic about the latter project.
“Pretty much every species that you can think of that is in Colorado, is in this area,” she said, pointing to the nearby Fishers Peak State Park that is home to bears, cougars, deer and elk. “And I think the other thing that makes that one really important is (that) wildlife don’t pay attention to state lines.”
“Colorado is obviously one of the leaders in addressing the problem of roadkill and wildlife collisions,” Ben Goldfarb, a journalist and the author of the recent book “Crossings: How Road Ecology is Shaping the Future of Our Planet,” said. “Colorado has built more wildlife crossings than the vast majority of states and it’s in the process of building more. We see fantastic projects all over the state.”
The state is not alone in the effort to confront the problem of wildlife mortality and human suffering when animals and motor vehicles collide.
“Wyoming has also been working on this issue for, easily, as long as Colorado, if not possibly longer,” Callahan said. “Wyoming has put together, you know, a priority list of their crossings, and they’re really kind of setting them up and knocking them down. California has been a leader in this. They are building the Wallace Annenberg wildlife crossing over the 101, which is essentially 10 lanes of traffic that is essentially impermeable to wildlife.” 
In addition to Colorado, Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming have received money from the federal government to build wildlife crossings. 










Colorado has built more wildlife crossings than the vast majority of states and it’s in the process of building more. We see fantastic projects all over the state.


– Ben Goldfarb, author of Crossings: How Road Ecology is Shaping the Future of Our Planet


But, unlike most or even all of those states, Colorado has no dedicated state funding for wildlife crossing projects. That leaves the state even more susceptible to political winds blowing out of the nation’s capital than are caused by ups-and-downs in federal financial appropriations. The U.S. government’s source of dollars, the Federal Highway Administration’s Wildlife Crossings Pilot Program, is part of a legal battle that erupted earlier this year when the Trump administration froze grants to states from agencies across the federal government. 
WCPP is available to support projects that states, Native American tribes, and local governments undertake. Authorized by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, Congress approved $350 million for spending on WCPP each year. Grants were awarded for fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025. Among the projects that received a grant is the Greenland Wildlife Overpass, which is under construction and expected to be completed in December.
The Greenland Wildlife Overpass is extensive and is expected to benefit large numbers of animals. Chuck Attardo, the Colorado Department of Transportation’s I-25 south corridor environmental project manager, explained that the Greenland Wildlife Overpass is a system that includes not only a 40,000-square-foot overpass, but a series of underpasses and wildlife fencing along the highway and on the overpass, too.
“There’s actually two types of fences on the overpass,” he said. “There’s the 8-foot wildlife exclusion fence. And we need to create a funnel on either end of the overpass that gets elk and pronghorn to use this.”
Among the largest crossings on the planet
Investment of public resources in wildlife movement infrastructure on roads and highways has been shown to produce a positive economic return. This occurs because the overpasses and underpasses result in a sharp downturn in motor vehicle-animal collisions. According to a 2021 report from The Center for Large Landscape Conservation, those accidents kill more than 200 people, and injure more than 26,000 more, every year in the United States. Avoiding them, the Federal Highway Administration said in 2008, saves more than $8 billion each year. In Colorado the annual cost of wildlife-motor vehicle accidents is about $313 million.
The most expensive crashes involve large ungulates. On average, the economic cost of hitting a deer is about $19,000, while smashing into an elk causes expenses of about $73,000. And if a motorist is unfortunate enough to make contact with a moose on a highway, the bill is likely to be about $110,000. If a motorist and an antelope, bear, bighorn sheep, or cougar collide on the highway, the costs would be proportional to the animal’s size. The expenses include vehicle repairs, health care to recover from an injury, outlays associated with any human deaths in the wreck, and a “passive use value” — or the inherent value of an animal species’ presence — according to the center.
Wildlife benefit very substantially from overpasses and underpasses.
“Wildlife crossing structures in the form of overpasses and underpasses in combination with wildlife fencing are proven to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions by an average of 87 percent for animals deer-sized or larger, while allowing for their safe movement across roads,” concluded an April 2015 rarticle published by ARCeport. One 2001 study found that a wildlife crossing reduced highway hits of deer and elk by 96% after installation of a Canadian overpass. 


Motor vehicle-animal collisions kill more than 200 people and injure more than 26,000 more every year in the United States, according to the Center for Large Landscape Conservation.


Colorado’s Greenland endeavor is likely to save even more wild lives. CDOT has suggested that 90% of wildlife-human motor vehicle accidents will be avoided. And the overpasses have been shown to be effective in allowing large mammals to move along migration corridors. A paper by scientists from British Columbia that examined wildlife crossing structures in western North America concluded that well-designed overpasses doubled the likelihood of successful large ungulate and large predator migration relative to poorly-built bridges. 
The Greenland Wildlife Overpass will feature a bridge more than 200 feet long and about 200 feet wide that will soar across six lanes of freeway traffic. The overpass will be among the largest roadway wildlife crossings on the planet. Intended to tie together two wildlife corridors, it will allow large herbivores, like elk, mule deer, and pronghorn, to move between them. Predators, too, will benefit from the structure and its associated wildlife fencing and underpasses.
Legal challenges to funding freeze
The expected benefits Colorado’s new overpass did not stop the Trump administration from freezing WPCC grants earlier this year. On Jan. 20, on the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump issued two executive orders that mandated federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, “​​immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through” two significant laws enacted during the Biden administration: the Inflation Reduction Act and the IIJA. Others froze funding under separate federal grant programs. The White House explained that the executive orders applied to “all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance,” including for wildlife crossings. 
A coalition of states, including Colorado, sued to force the federal executive branch to release those funds. On March 6, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell issued an injunction that blocked the White House effort to prevent outflow of grants to states. The judge, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2011, sharply criticized the grant freeze.
“​​It is difficult to perceive any rationality in this decision — let alone thoughtful consideration of practical consequences — when these funding pauses endanger the States’ ability to provide vital services, including but not limited to public safety, health care, education, childcare, and transportation infrastructure,” he wrote. 
The administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit to put a hold on the preliminary injunction that McConnell imposed, but that request was turned aside on March 27. 
Department of Justice lawyers told McConnell during proceedings in his court “that there is no date written into the EOs or the OMB Directive or instructions when the freeze will end but argued that the funding recipients can be assured that it will end eventually,” according to McConnell’s order. But there is not yet any indication of when Colorado’s additional expected WCPP funds will arrive. 
“Though that money was supposed to be released more than six months ago, it is still being held up,” Attardo said.

The continued blockade is at odds with what appeared to be a bipartisan commitment to federal funding of wildlife crossings, Goldfarb added. He said some projects outside of Colorado appear to be receiving WCPP money, but he cannot see any logical explanation for the disparity.
“I think we’re seeing this weird contradictory signal where some projects are getting the funding they’re owed and some are not,” Goldfarb said. “I’m not sure what determines which succeed and which are illegally, in my view, having funding withheld from them.”
“It is theoretically a nonpartisan issue,” he added. “But at the same time spending any money is kind of partisan in Washington right now.”
One concern is that, even if the grant money is released, the state may not have the time to fulfill a grant agreement with the Federal Highway Administration, which generally specifies a deadline for the funds to be committed to a project.
“They usually have an amount of time that they are in effect for,” Callhan said. “Let’s say it’s around three to five years, typically. But if you don’t obligate, which in Federal Highway (Administration) language means, ‘sign a contract for that grant before those dollars expire,’ they will go away, effectively, within that time frame.”
She said that, were that to occur, states would have to convince federal legislators to renew the funding. “So I don’t see this grant coming back under this Congress and maybe the next Congress,” she said. And, “even then, you know, not under the executive branch.”
Another problem that plagues state, local and Native American tribal wildlife crossing project managers is the possibility that the federal grants could be pulled back by the highway administration, especially given a Trump administration effort to effectively re-write existing grant agreements.
“The concern that I’ve heard from some states is that they sign a contract now underneath the (injunction issued by McConnell), which basically says ‘these terms don’t apply for now,’ but x years down the line, when (the states’ current) lawsuit is finally decided (and) if the Supreme Court (says), ‘yes, you can put whatever conditions you want in,’ then those states are potentially going to be in a position of having to disgorge those federal dollars,” Callahan pointed out.
Colorado’s coffers are unlikely to be of much help in resolving the financial uncertainty. Although the state General Assembly enacted a law in 2022 that provided some funding for wildlife crossing projects, the money it made available is no more. Senate Bill 22-151 established a “wildlife safe passages fund,” with $5 million from the state’s general fund, and the Legislature added another $500,000 to it in 2023, but that resource is tapped out.
“Since then, we haven’t gotten any more money out of that,” Attardo explained.

The state’s recent budget crisis, which pushed Gov. Jared Polis to convene an August legislative special session, has not yet resulted in any further damage to the state’s commitment to fund wildlife infrastructure on its highways. But the Legislature rejected a bill during this year’s regular session that would have imposed a fee on insurance policies to pay for crossings. House Bill 25-1303 did not make it out of the Senate Finance Committee.
Goldfarb views an enduring and fixed source of state funding as essential to continued progress to address the need for wildlife overpasses and underpasses.
“We see lots of states earmarking funding for this issue,” he said. “New Mexico has done it. Utah has done it. California has done it. Oregon has done it. Having that secure, deviated, auto funding is really important to be able to fill the matching requirement.” Goldfarb referred to FHWA guidelines that require states to put up a portion of the total cost of a project to receive WCPP funding.
10s of millions of bees a day
In general, roads are extremely dangerous to wildlife. As many as 10 million amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles are killed on them every day. Hundreds of millions of vertebrates, including at least 340 million birds, die on U.S. roads every year. 
Some of the animals that suffer the most from meetings with largely hairless primates piloting large machines on concrete or asphalt surfaces are endangered or threatened. And the causes of their deaths may be dominated by those encounters. For example, the red wolf — a canid formally known as Canis rufus that is native to North Carolina — loses a significant fraction of its population to motor vehicle collisions each year.
The critically endangered ocelot, a felid known to live in Texas, is also known to be especially vulnerable to population loss resulting from encounters with human motorized behemoths.
The Federal Highway Administration told Congress in 2008 that “road mortality is believed to have affected the population survival probability for multiple species” known in the U.S., including the moor frog, leopard frog, spotted salamander, timber rattlesnake, pond turtles, hedgehog, badger otter, Florida panther, Iberian lynx, and Florida key deer, as well as the ocelot. Among mammals, the most commonly killed are white-tailed deer, raccoons, and opossums, according to a paper published earlier this year. 
Some animals that commonly draw awe from Coloradans are among those particularly susceptible to vehicle collisions. Mountain lions, for example, die when hit by motor vehicles at a rate of one to two per week in California. More than 600 were killed in accidents in the Golden State between 2016 and 2023. Deer, too, suffer in great numbers. Nearly 50,000 lost their lives on California highways in 2023, according to the Road Ecology Center at the University of California at Davis.

Even more crushed by the onslaught of vehicles are invertebrates. The toll among insects in America is difficult to fathom. Billions, according to a recent Atlantic Monthly report, are likely killed on roads every year. They include 10s of millions of bees every day, just in the Western states. 
“Roadkill is not only eliminating animals, it’s in many cases eliminating those healthy animals that populations need to remain strong,” Goldfarb told NPR in Sept. 2023. 
And the problem is getting more severe as animals seek to move in a quest to cope with climate change. Goldfarb explained, in the same NPR interview, that warming temperatures “make it even more important that we give them opportunities to cross highways.” “They’re trying to find new habitats and roads are preventing them from doing that,” he added.
In Colorado, CDOT and the Colorado Parks and Wildlife have worked to mitigate some of the toll inflicted on the tiniest denizens of our world. The state has a rare invertebrate crossing in place. “You do see some instances of mitigation for small critters,” Goldfarb said. “A lot of the small I-25 underpasses will have sticks and brush in them so that rodents can follow them.”
“We build more crossings for ungulates because there’s a human safety connection for them,” he continued. “We need to be thinking about the smaller, rarer species as well.”
The agencies have been working to evaluate the feasibility of tarantula passages. The large theraphosids move in huge numbers in parts of Colorado every autumn as they seek mates.
“If we produce a lot of culverts or underpasses, things like tarantulas, box turtles, other reptiles and amphibians can use those culverts as well as other insects and not get squished,” Richard Reading, the vice president of science and conservation at Butterfly Pavilion and an ecologist, told CBS News in 2022.
The state has plans for additional wildlife crossing infrastructure on the Eastern Plains. Those projects, though, along with — possibly — the Vail Pass crossing, may not survive the fiscal gauntlet that has fallen over the federal Wildlife Crossings Pilot Program this year. Attardo said the need for those additional projects is extensive, estimating that “hundreds” are necessary.
“Estimates are probably in the billions of dollars statewide,” he said, referring to the financial investment. “But there really is nothing in the queue to go next.” 
Colorado will prioritize three projects once the federal grant freeze is resolved: the Raton Pass crossing, a project on U.S. 40 near Empire, and a structure on U.S. 160 west of Durango.
“Those three projects are going to apply for the wildlife crossing pilot program funding,” Attardo said. “This round, we expect to get money again.”
Some wildlife advocacy organizations hope to convince Congress to increase the annual federal WCPP allotment of $350 million to $500 million in this year’s federal transportation bill. In one example, Madeleine West, the public lands director at the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, told a Senate committee in Nov. 2023 that funding of wildlife corridor projects “Is the top conservation issue for hunting and fishing organizations.”
However the fiscal details are worked out, Goldfarb emphasized the urgency of continuing work on wildlife crossings.
“On the one hand Colorado is doing a lot,” he said. “On the other hand it’s not nearly enough to address the massive scope of the problem.”

NEW ORLEANS – The boat at the docks of Bayou Bienvenue was loaded with stacks of green bullrushes. Its passengers — three local coastal restoration experts, two young scientists and a few stalwart volunteers with the Central Wetlands Reforestation Collective — prepared to climb waist deep in the muddied soil of the bayou, home to alligators, snakes and wild hogs. Beyond the rumble of the airboat, white egrets and the quick flash of a rare pink spoonbill could be seen flying over the narrow islands.
Jimmie Price, an environmental scientist and 25-year-old New Orleans native, sat at the front of the boat, carefully answering questions about the planting work to be done. With practiced deftness, the team docked at a narrow island, leapt onto the banks and tossed bundles of bullrushes, fireman-style, onto the narrow strip of land.
In what was once a richly forested area, there are now only a few wavering trees. Cypress and native grasses that were one of the region’s greatest defenses against hurricanes have been decimated in areas by canals and trade routes, leaving the bayou vulnerable to salt intrusion and storm surge.
Amid more frequent and increasingly intense climate threats, local groups are attempting to restore the region’s shifting land and depleted hurricane buffer. But while funding for coastal restoration is dwindling, local residents stress that this work is not just for South Louisiana.
“The Gulf is 10 miles closer to Baton Rouge. It’s 10 miles closer to Chicago, frankly,” James Karst, communications director for the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, said of the region’s escalating land loss and extreme weather. “These are things that are impacting all of us, or at least they will. I hope that people will recognize that. ”

‘Disadvantages to future generations’
The Mississippi River Delta is home to millions of acres of wetland. One of the most important river systems in the world, it provides essential migration habitat for bird and fish populations, as well as a vital trade route for much of the United States. For thousands of years, cypress trees, native grasses and natural sediment distribution have helped prevent the land in the lower delta from disappearing into the sea.
Over the past century, engineers have attempted to control the natural system, levying the Mississippi on all sides. But experts have also warned that consequences would be felt in the future. 
Over a hundred years ago, noted engineer E.L. Corthell advised that levying the river would bring about so much subsidence that it would cause the “gradual abandonment” of the lower delta.
“The present generation should not be selfish,” Corthell wrote in a December 1897 issue of National Geographic. “Yet it is safe to say that the development of the delta country during the twentieth century by a fully protective levee system, at whatever cost … will be so remarkable that people of the whole United States can well afford, when the time comes, to build a protective levee against the Gulf waters.”
Indeed, efforts to engineer the Mississippi continued throughout the 20th century, putting significant stress on the lower river basin. Perhaps most notable, in 1956, Congress approved the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, known colloquially as Mister GO, a channel that linked the Industrial Canal and the Gulf.
Designed to provide a quick route for shipping and defense, Mister GO opened the region to the intrusion of saltwater from the Gulf, devastating the freshwater cypress and native plant populations and depleting the natural hurricane buffer. The canal also created an inland path for high winds and storm surge, in what has been deemed a “hurricane highway,” leaving areas such as adjacent St. Bernard Parish and New Orleans’ Lower 9th Ward vulnerable to extreme damage.
On the heels of the three hurricanes that struck the region in 2005 — Cindy, Katrina and Rita — Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority was formed to manage the changing coast into the future. It drew from decades of varied and creative plans, some as drastic as abandoning the most southerly parts of the delta entirely.
But there was a key shift in managing issues such as salt water intrusion from building levees to offensive strategy, said Denise Reed, coastal scientist with the University of New Orleans and an adviser to CPRA.
“We go from this way of trying to hold the line and build levees and walls to managing marshes and managing hydrology,” Reed said. 
In its 20 years, the CPRA has strengthened roughly 350 miles of levees and restored 60 miles of barrier islands and headlands, according to its most recent master plan. But perhaps its most promising intervention, the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, which was expected to restore 21 square miles of new land over the next 50 years, has been cancelled.
With state efforts on unsteady ground, planters wade out into Bayou Bienvenue with their stacks of wild grasses and infant trees.
‘What we’re planting, those are the first responders’
The Central Wetlands Reforestation Collective team grasped the bulbous roots of the bullrushes and pushed them deep into the mud of Bayou Bienvenue. If all goes well, the new plants will spread around the barrier islands, protecting the fragile shores. But summer heat in Louisiana is scorching, and the water is hot and thick with nutria droppings, an invasive rodent species that feeds on juvenile cypress trees. 
While the threat to the vulnerable plant life is formidable, the group of planters also manage their own risks. An alligator made its way around the barrier island to where the team’s coastal restoration coordinator, Arlo Townsley, was waist deep in mud. He extricated himself calmly and made his way to shore.

Over the next year, their aim is to finish planting a total of 63,000 trees. Hardy plants such as tupelo, cypress, buttonbush shrubs and lead plants are also important to the healthy ecology of Louisiana’s wetlands. Several have been harvested by the team from native species in the delta and then grown in nurseries across New Orleans.
The importance of replanting the region cannot be understated, Price said.
“Those trees, those organisms, those marsh grasses, they act first,” he said, referring to the role of native plants in preventing coastal erosion and protecting the region from extreme weather.
Hurricane season 2025 was projected to be a very active one for Louisiana, with 17 named storms predicted, four of which were forecast to develop into major hurricanes. As of Sept. 30, there have been no major storms or impacts along the Gulf Coast, but Price knows a quiet season is never guaranteed. 
“What we’re planting, those are the first responders,” he said. 
Over the past four years, Price has worked with the Lower 9th Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development, helping teach young New-Orleanians about the region’s hydrological system and how to participate in restoring it.
While engaging local residents in the fate of the coast is important, Reed said, these projects might have a limited environmental impact.
“It’s just not enough,” the UNO professor said. “How many millions of projects do we need like that to actually make a difference?”
Limited sediment and money
There is a complex network of collaborating state and federal bodies working to restore Louisiana’s coast. The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration has rebuilt approximately 12,500 acres of coastline through the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act, which Congress enacted in 1990 to pay for the design and construction of coastal wetlands restoration projects.
One of the most important sources of funding for coastal restoration in Louisiana over the past decade is winding to a close. In 2010, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, considered to be one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history, released 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf, decimating oyster, dolphin and sea bird populations in the region and threatening local communities that depend on subsistence fishing.
Funds from the $5 billion settlement for the five Gulf Coast states, allocated in 2012, were the resource behind much of the CPRA’s other projects. Where comparable funding will come from for future coastal restoration is unclear.
“But that doesn’t mean to say we shouldn’t have all the ideas in hand,” Reed said. “It really did help us when Deepeater Horizon came along, that we had a plan ”
Short of an environmental disaster, energy revenues might be one avenue to increasing coastal restoration funding.
The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, which U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu steered through Congress in 2006, opened the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico to an additional 8.3 million acres of offshore drilling. A portion of these exploration revenues go toward coastal restoration in Louisiana. Expanding the state’s revenue percentage might be a viable option for bringing additional revenues to the region, Reed said.
Restoring the delta is also a question of national responsibility, she continued.
“The Mississippi is clearly a national resource and a national asset, and clearly the levees along the river have contributed to the issue,” Reed said, arguing that the federal government should have a role in restoring the delta.
Who should bear the cost and responsibility to save Louisiana’s coast is also a battle over priorities. With limited sediment and funding, planners might have to make tough calls about which part of the lower Mississippi River Delta can realistically be restored — and which parts could be yielded to the sea.
“You only have so much sediment, you only have so much money,” said Clint Wilson, dean of Louisiana State University’s College of the Coast and Environment. 
For Wilson and other engineers, maintaining the lowermost reaches of the delta, especially the final 30 miles, may no longer be practical. The question, he said, is one of economics.
“The communities are getting smaller. Then what’s the economic driver for spending hundreds of millions of dollars to maintain the river?” he said, arguing for a need to prioritize trade routes and, to some extent, the petrochemical industry in South Louisiana.

‘We don’t deserve to be protected?’
The question of what is prioritized could be far more personal for residents living in the lower delta. 
“We’re a part of this country too. And so why should you overlook us for industry. We don’t deserve to be protected?” said the Rev. Tyronne Edwards of the Zion Travellers Missionary Baptist Church.
Edwards says his family has lived in the lower delta “before it became Plaquemines Parish.” It was once a hub of sugarcane plantations, where thousands of people were enslaved in service of one of Louisiana’s most profitable exports. 
Edwards’ ancestors were among those whose labor helped to build the area and who later came to settle in Phoenix, a small town on the east bank of the Mississippi River, about 30 miles south of New Orleans Lower 9th Ward. 
The residents of Phoenix have long fought for their voices to be heard, Edwards said, organizing for civil rights and against voter suppression. Today, he says the east bank floods frequently during heavy rains and storm surge. Unable to rebuild and elevate their houses, restoring and protecting the coast is essential to their community’s future, according to the pastor. 
Additional land barriers and mangrove replanting are two of the solutions Edwards, also a Plaquemines Parish councilman, said he hopes to see. For the past decade, he has been a regular attendee at CPRA meetings but has been unsatisfied with its response to community feedback, he said. 
The CPRA 2023 Master Plan included the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion on the Plaquemines east bank, at nearby Will’s Point. Like the cancelled Mid-Barrataria Sediment Diversion upriver on the west bank, its aim is to build new wetlands by restoring the natural process of the Mississippi River. 
The CPRA did not respond in time for publication regarding the status of the Mid-Breton Diversion and whether it would be included in the forthcoming 2029 Master Plan, which is currently accepting public input. 
“I’m really frightened about the state of coastal restoration because it seems like we have abandoned it,“ Edwards said. “The East Bank to me is like the bastard child, the forgotten people, when it comes to coastal restoration.”

(Photo courtesy of the North Dakota Governor's Office) North Dakota Lt. Gov. Michelle Strinden and two state lawmakers recently returned home from a weeklong, overseas trip hosted and paid for entirely by the government of Israel.
During the conference, funded by Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, U.S. lawmakers visited Israeli communities impacted by the Israel-Hamas War.
A United Nations report published earlier this month concluded Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians, which the government of Israel denies. Israel’s war with the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas has led to mass violence and starvation in Gaza. Al Jazeera reported in late September that Israel’s war on Gaza killed at least 65,500 people, though the death toll does not account for thousands believed to be buried in rubble.
A growing number of countries have announced they recognize Palestine as an independent state in recent weeks.
The Israeli government is ramping up its outreach efforts to foreign countries amid widespread criticism of its conduct and its treatment of Palestinians, said Sen. Jonathan Sickler, R-Grand Forks, who went on the trip.
“Israel is seeing that they’re losing, to a certain extent, the public relations campaign out in the world,” he said.
The trip also coincided with the start of Israel’s ground offensive in Gaza City. U.S. lawmakers at one point were close enough to the city to see and hear the attack, said Sickler.
“You’re hearing the artillery shells, you’re seeing the plumes of smoke and dust on the horizon,” he said. “You get this sense that you’re just in the middle of this hellish history that’s going on in the world.”
Sickler said the trip is believed to be the largest delegation of elected officials ever to go to Israel. In all, about 250 representatives from all 50 states — both Republicans and Democrats — attended, according to the Israeli government. From North Dakota, Strinden and Sickler were joined by Rep. Bernie Satrom, R-Jamestown.
In an address to the U.S. delegation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed that Israel feels isolated on the world stage and urged the U.S. to stay in its corner, Sickler said.
“He talked about the strength of the relationship with the United States and how important that is to Israel,” he said.

Strinden was invited to provide brief remarks to Netanyahu, other Israeli leaders and the U.S. lawmakers on the trip. According to a written copy of the speech shared with the North Dakota Monitor, she assured Israeli officials that North Dakota is on their side and highlighted values the U.S. and Israel share.
Strinden noted that following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, the North Dakota Legislature adopted a resolution voicing its commitment to their nation.
“We recognized Israel’s right to act decisively and unilaterally in self-defense and to eliminate the Hamas terrorist organization,” Strinden said in her speech.
The trip included a visit to the site of the Nova Music Festival, where Hamas militants killed hundreds of civilians, as well as other sites impacted by the conflict.
“We had an opportunity to converse with multiple people on an informal basis and hear their stories,” Satrom said in a statement to the Monitor. “Probably hearing from a woman who was a survivor of the 10/7 attack who lost many friends, neighbors and her home was the most impactful.”
Sickler said the trip has made him think about how North Dakota can do more to support Israel. North Dakota colleges and universities could consider collaborating with Israeli higher ed institutions, for example, he said.
House Minority Leader Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks, was also invited to attend, but declined. He said he had family and work obligations, but that global criticism of Israel’s government also influenced his decision, too.
“Certainly in the context of difficult geopolitics, I think that weighed heavily, too,” Ista said.
Ista earlier this year asked the North Dakota Ethics Commission whether it was lawful for him to attend. In an advisory opinion, the commission determined that the trip was permissible because the organizers said it was educational and no lobbying would take place.
State Treasurer Thomas Beadle said he plans to attend a trip to Israel in December as part of the National Association of State Treasurers, which he leads.
Beadle also requested an Ethics Commission advisory opinion about his Israel trip, in which the commission also found it lawful for him to attend the trip since it’s educational in nature.

According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, as of Sept. 23, all parts of West Virginia are experiencing conditions ranging from abnormally dry to extreme drought.  
The USDA has issued a disaster declaration for the following counties due to drought: Barbour, Brooke, Lewis, Braxton, Hancock, Nicholas, Pocahontas, Randolph, Upshur and Webster. 
The following surrounding counties are also eligible for assistance: Calhoun, Clay, Doddridge, Fayette, Gilmer, Grant, Greenbrier, Harrison, Kanawha, Ohio, Pendleton, Preston, Taylor and Tucker.
“West Virginia’s farmers play an important role in our state’s economy, culture and way of life,” Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a news release. “I want to thank the USDA and the Trump administration for stepping up to help West Virginians in need. My office will continue to work with the WVDA and our partners at the federal and local levels to provide assistance to those affected by the drought.”  
“USDA’s quick declaration, combined with the strong cooperation of our partners, shows how important it is to work together in times of need,” State Agriculture Commissioner Kent Leonhardt said in the release. “Our farmers are facing real challenges, and this coordinated response ensures they will get help when it matters most. WVDA will continue working closely with state and federal partners to deliver resources quickly and strengthen agriculture for the future.”
Farmers in affected counties can find out more information by contacting their local Farm Service Agency offices. 
Help is also available to affected farmers through their local conservation districts, according to the West Virginia Conservation Agency. 
Conservation districts can opt to provide farmers cost-share assistance for temporary fence, livestock water supply, revegetation of feeding areas, cover crop establishment and irrigation water supply. To be eligible for assistance, a portion of one county within a district must have been designated a D1, moderate drought, or higher classification from the U.S. Drought Monitor.

Idaho’s Department of Environmental Quality has quietly rewritten cancer protection rules to benefit Perpetua Resources’ Stibnite gold project near Yellow Pine, making Idaho’s children the most vulnerable in the nation to pediatric cancer. These 30-year-old rules had simultaneously protected Idaho’s children while minimizing regulatory burden. Now, to facilitate this mega-mine, the state would put both our children and our industries at unprecedented risks.
Despite Stibnite’s Sept. 19 ribbon-cutting media blitz, this isn’t about a “critical mineral” mine. Stibnite’s antimony ore is a byproduct of extracting an estimated $18 billion in precious metals. The gold hides in arsenic-iron ores containing few strategic minerals. 
Each ounce of gold yields 200 to 1,000 pounds of arsenic waste. Between 500,000 to 1 million tons of arsenic, more than ever mined in Gem State history, would be disposed of behind a 450-foot earthen dam — half-again taller than our last ill-fated earth-filled Teton Dam. In 16 years, it would hold 120 million tons of waste — as much as Idaho’s entire Silver Valley, now a $1 billion Superfund site, produced in a century. 
Overshadowed by last week’s news was a favorable court ruling in the citizens’ lawsuit seeking to deny the mine’s Permit to Construct and restore our children’s cancer protections. This lawsuit targets just one percent of Stibnite’s arsenic waste: the portion emitted into the air. Even this small fraction is deadly enough to warrant strict limits – limits that are now gone.
Here’s how: In the first draft permit four years ago, DEQ and Perpetua sought to exempt 99 percent of arsenic emissions from regulation entirely. Citizens fought back, forcing DEQ to relent. DEQ then granted Perpetua a tenfold increase in Idaho’s allowable cancer risks. But when Perpetua and DEQ finally admitted they still couldn’t meet the standard, they didn’t shrink the mine as the old rules required— they changed the rules.
The “Stibnite Project-specific adjustment factor” now allows a company to emit a person’s full lifetime cancer risk dose during the life of the project instead of the life of the person — in as little as six years rather than 70. This means a child could receive their lifetime allowable cancer exposure by first grade.
DEQ Board Chairman Dr. J. Randy MacMillan, a pathologist, called the idea “a significant ignorance about cancer, carcinogens, and carcinogenesis” and warned it “greatly underestimates the actual cancer risk.” In May 2024, the board voted 7–0 to gather more information before making such a radical change.
One year later, after Gov. Little changed the board’s composition, in a closed-door executive session with their attorney, the board reversed itself. In a scripted “public meeting” lasting minutes, board members, including Chairman MacMillan, voted 7–0  to approve the permit and adopt the adjustment factor.
What changed between May 2024 and May 2025? Perhaps the message delivered in that secret meeting will come out in court. What’s clear is who was not consulted: Idaho parents, doctors, cancer survivors, or anyone who will live with the consequences.
Idaho’s two-year statute of limitations means families would have to sue within two years of a child’s exposure — long before cancer could appear. This practically immunizes industry from civil liability for pediatric cancer. Combined with DEQ’s rule change, it’s a free pass for short-term high-risk operations to shift the burden of harm onto children. A decision of this magnitude should not be made behind closed doors through a single permit to accommodate one mine.
In  President Donald Trump’s words: “In this Cancer Awareness month, our Nation stands with the thousands of families who face the tremendous challenges of childhood cancer. We acknowledge their fortitude, faith, and unbreakable spirit — and we solemnly honor the memories of the precious young souls taken far too soon.”
Idaho families deserve transparency and the same commitment. Gov. Little and AG Labrador should withdraw the state’s defense of this radical policy change, restore Idaho’s cancer protections, and debate proposed changes in the open legislative rulemaking, where the public, medical community, and other industries have a voice. Idaho families deserve no less.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-30 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Justice served? Mississippi Today asks congressional delegation about DOJ welfare scandal probe,Taylor Vance and Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/30/mississippi-welfare-scandal-congressional-delegation-doj-investigation/,It's unclear with a new presidential administration whether the investigation will ensnare more individuals or if the federal government will still force Mississippi to repay the millions of dollars it believes were misused.,"WASHINGTON — A majority of Mississippi’s congressional delegation had little say about the vast welfare scandal that rocked the state for years and led to multiple people pleading guilty to state and federal crimes.  
Mississippi Today recently interviewed members of the state’s congressional delegation in Washington and asked each of them whether they were satisfied with the Department of Justice investigation, which began during President Donald Trump’s first term and stretched at least into the Biden administration. Congress has oversight of the Justice Department and has the authority to request information about the agency’s investigations.  
Seven people have pleaded guilty to crimes within the welfare scandal that first came to light in 2020. Millions of taxpayer dollars meant to provide support to the poor in one of the country’s most impoverished states were diverted to the rich and powerful — including pro athletes.

In December 2024, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under Democratic President Joe Biden administration sent a penalty notice to Mississippi, determining the state must pay back nearly $101 million in welfare money it says officials misused. The state asked for an extension and has yet to make any repayment.
It’s unclear with a new Trump administration whether the investigation will ensnare more people or if the federal government will still force the state to repay the millions of dollars it believes were misused.
Prosecutors have suspended sentencing for the seven people until they decide they no longer need the defendants’ cooperation for potential cases against others. Federal authorities have been tight-lipped about the progress of their investigation or who else they might charge in the future.
Another person charged in connection with the scandal has been indicted on federal fraud charges. He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. 
Todd Gee, who was U.S. attorney for southern Mississippi during the Biden administration, resigned once Trump won reelection. Trump has appointed Baxter Kruger as the new federal prosecutor for the district, but the U.S. Senate has not yet confirmed him.
Five years after prosecutors indicted six people in connection with the scandal, and with a new federal prosecutor’s nomination pending, followers of the scandal continue awaiting a resolution — accountability for all perpetrators of the theft. Many are concerned a resolution may never come.
U.S. Rep. Trent Kelly, a Republican who represents northeast Mississippi, said he knew that some of the misspending involved an organization in his district, a reference to the Tupelo-based Family Resource Center. That nonprofit’s former director is one of the people who pleaded guilty to federal charges within the scheme. Kelly, a former district attorney, believes federal and state officials have dealt with the misspending. 
“I trust them to dig in,” Kelly said of the U.S. attorney’s office. “We’ve gone through multiple administrations with that. Hopefully, the people are going to be held accountable, or the money is returned if it was taken inappropriately. Or either people are validated in saying they didn’t do anything wrong.” 
U.S. Rep. Mike Ezell, a Republican who represents the Gulf Coast and south Mississippi, said he wondered how much political motives have influenced the trajectory of the investigation that has spanned Republican and Democratic administrations. The welfare scandal has at times sparked conflict between state officials, including Republican State Auditor Shad White and Republican Attorney General Lynn Fitch, both of whom are seen as prospective candidates for governor in 2027.    
“That’s one of those things that just seems to, you sometimes wonder how much politics are involved in it,” Ezell said. “You know, the attorney general’s in on it, the auditor’s in on it. I know they’ve had some back and forth with each other about it, so I just kind of want to let them folks handle it themselves. But I will say, if anybody’s broken the law, if anybody’s intentionally stolen money, they need to be held accountable.” 
The welfare scandal and the issue at its core — the misspending of cash assistance provided through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program — has remained a subject of concern in the state. Just last week, White’s office published a report alleging that a nonprofit that received over $2.4 million from the TANF program had fumbled its financial paperwork.     
U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the state’s lone Democrat in Washington who represents the Delta region and most of Jackson, was the only congressman from the delegation who said he was not satisfied with the Justice Department’s investigation and believes state officials should be held accountable for the misspending that occurred under their watch. 
“I think the state of Mississippi should be made and held accountable for its lack of management of those taxpayer dollars because the … intentions of Congress were not met by the expenditure of those funds,” Thompson said. 
U.S. Rep. Michael Guest, a Republican who represents central Mississippi, said he had not been briefed on the investigation and referred questions to the Justice Department. U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Republican, similarly stated that he didn’t have enough information about the situation to comment on its status. 
U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith is the only member of the state’s delegation who did not grant an interview to Mississippi Today in Washington or respond to a request for comment about the welfare scandal. 
Since the scandal, the state has spent less TANF money for basic cash assistance to needy families. 
In 2023, the latest year for which federal data is available, the state spent about $4.3 million of its welfare funds on basic cash assistance – even less than the state spent during the height of the fraud scandal 2016-2019, when an average of around $8 million was going towards direct cash annually.
But that decline also predates the scandal.
The number of families, children and adults receiving basic cash assistance in Mississippi through the federal TANF program has consistently declined from around 25,000 people in 2010 to an all-time low of under 2,200 in 2023, ticking up slightly to 2,500 in the most recent available data. 
The Mississippi Department of Human Services has said that “a request for assistance in the State of Mississippi is a request for help in finding and keeping a job.” But in September 2024, the latest month available, only 310 adults were in the program. The vast majority of families on the program, or 1,143 out of 1,464, were “no parent” families, meaning they did not contain an adult participating in the TANF Work Program.
The state agency has paid nearly $2.1 million to Jones Walker, the law firm representing the state in its civil lawsuit aimed at recouping the misspent funds. Most of it has been categorized as spending under the state’s TANF Work Program since 2022. Though publicly visible work on the state’s civil case against numerous entities alleged to have misspent TANF dollars has slowed to a crawl since last year. Jones Walker has continued raking in funds, nearly $300,000 since the beginning of this year.
The state has spent roughly $100 million in TANF funds since the beginning of fiscal year 2024. 
Here are the complete responses from the congressional delegation when asked if they were satisfied with the investigation into the welfare scandal by the Department of Justice. 
Trent Kelly 
“It had very little impact on me, so I don’t know what’s done. I think a lot of that is for political posturing so to speak, people wanting to run for office. I trust the attorney general, I trust all those folks who were there, the governor, to get to the bottom of where they were.

Rep. Trent Kelly,
“I know there were grants and things in my district that I think they addressed. I don’t spend a whole lot of time thinking about it. It’s not something I can impact. I’ve learned in life I impact things I can, and things that are outside of my purview I just don’t worry about a whole lot.”
“I trust them to dig in. We’ve gone through multiple administrations with that. Hopefully the people are going to be held accountable or the money is returned if it was taken inappropriately. Or either people are validated in saying they didn’t do anything wrong.” 
Bennie Thompson 
“Of course not. It’s, for all intents and purposes, I’m not aware that (the U.S. Attorney’s office is) doing anything at this point beyond those individuals who have pleaded guilty. And … of other ineligible individuals having received TANF money. I’m not aware of anything.

Rep. Bennie Thompson
“I think the state of Mississippi should be made and held accountable for its lack of management of those taxpayer dollars because the people — that we did in Washington creating the TANF program – the intentions of Congress were not met by the expenditure of those funds.
” Now HHS obviously is derelict in its oversight responsibilities for the expenditure of those funds, also.” 

Michael Guest
“Neither I nor my office has been briefed on the federal investigation into this matter. 

Rep. Michael Guest Credit: Eric J. Shelton, Mississippi Today/ Report for America
“I defer to the Department of Justice to answer any questions as to the status of the investigation and if any additional prosecutions may be forthcoming.”


Mike Ezell 
“That’s one of those things that just seems to, you sometimes wonder how much politics are involved in it. I really hadn’t put a lot of thought into that because, you know, my background being a law enforcement officer, I think if there was some cheating and there was some embezzling, if there was any sort of illegal activity, I’m sure that the auditor’s going to find it. And you know, those that need to be prosecuted, they’ll be prosecuted. You know, the attorney general’s in on it, the auditor’s in on it. I know they’ve had some back and forth with each other about it, so I just kind of want to let them folks handle it themselves. But I will say, if anybody’s broken the law, if anybody’s intentionally stolen money, they need to be held accountable.

Rep. Mike Ezell
“On issues with programs like TANF: When you set up a program, you’ve got to have checks and balances. And sometimes the big problem that I have seen in government is that we don’t have enough checks and balances to follow the money, to see where it’s going, to see that the people that need the money are getting the help that they need. And that that is one of one of the things that I have complained about over the years.”

(Photo by Jennifer Miranda/Getty Images)Americans uniformly believe that workers deserve a basic standard of living free from employer exploitation. All states and the federal government have minimum wage laws. These laws do more than prevent exploitation. They also stimulate the economy, reduce poverty and inequality, and contribute to solving social and health problems.
Unfortunately, the West Virginia Legislature seems uninterested in the benefits of advancing our minimum wage and cold to the life difficulties of minimum wage workers. West Virginia’s minimum wage has been stuck at $8.75 per hour since 2016.
The purchasing power of $8.75 in 2016 has eroded almost 35% since then. That means that today’s minimum wage worker has actually taken a huge pay cut versus the same minimum wage worker in 2016. To provide the same purchasing power now, West Virginia’s minimum wage would have to rise to $11.78.
Two other ways show how shameful the problem has become. If today’s minimum wage worker works a full schedule of 2,080 hours — without unpaid time off — she would earn only $18,200 before taxes. While this is above the federal poverty level of $15,560 for a single person with no children, the income necessary to escape poverty with one child is $21,150. Both our minimum-wage worker and her child are consigned to poverty simply because the Legislature won’t act.
A better way to evaluate West Virginia’s minimum wage is to compare it to the “living wage,” a concept developed at MIT in 2003. The living wage is what a full-time worker requires to cover the costs of her family’s basic needs in the place where they live. It includes the specific local costs for food, child care, health care, housing, transportation, clothing, personal care items, broadband and taxes. The 2025 living wage before taxes for one adult in West Virginia without children is $40,415. With one child, the living wage rises to $68,660.
Raising the minimum wage will make working more attractive 
The labor force participation rate is the percentage of people aged 16 and older who are employed or actively looking for work. West Virginia’s LFP rate is 54.3%, the absolute worst in the nation. It isn’t the availability of jobs in West Virginia that is the problem. It is their attractiveness. One obvious way to increase the value and attractiveness of work is to raise the minimum wage.
Low-wage workers are no different than the rest of us. Each one evaluates the economic choices in front of them. For example, is it better to stay home and take care of the kids or to get a job? A higher minimum wage tilts that calculation in favor of working.
Both Democrats and Republicans want to see more West Virginians working. But “poverty shaming” low-income people or threatening to remove public benefits unless they take bad jobs isn’t a sustainable policy. Attracting more people to work through raising the minimum wage and making work more dignified is the better approach by far.
Raising the minimum wage will help save children’s lives
A higher income for low-wage workers leads directly to better health for expectant mothers and a higher survival rate for newborns. It also reduces the frustration and anger among low-wage workers that lead to child abuse and neglect.
Infant mortality in the United States is driven almost entirely by excess infant deaths among low-income mothers. In 2023, approximately 9.8% of live births in West Virginia were low birthweight babies, defined as those weighing less than 5.5 pounds. Low birthweight is a significant contributor to infant mortality.
If a child in a low-income family survives their first year of life, they are still at risk for abuse and neglect. Family income is strongly associated with risk for child maltreatment. A study from Indiana University reported a 9.6% decrease in reported child neglect cases for every $1 increase in the minimum wage.
Foster care is often where abused and neglected children end up, but West Virginia’s foster care system is in shambles. Increasing the minimum wage is a smart policy means of saving children and reducing the strain on our foster care system.
Raising the minimum wage will help save adult lives
In 2020, sociologists Angus Deaton and Anne Case identified a troubling trend they called “deaths of despair.” These are deaths from suicide, drug overdose and gun-related violence. They found that while wealthier people tend to be healthier and live longer, those with lower incomes often struggle with feelings of depression and hopelessness, leading to an earlier death.
Not only would increasing the minimum wage help people move out of poverty and rely less on government assistance, but it could also reduce these “deaths of despair.”
People under financial stress are more than 20 times more likely to attempt suicide. In 2022, West Virginia had a suicide rate of 18.3 per 100,000 people, which is 65% higher than the national average and has increased by nearly 23% over the last 20 years. In fact, suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people in the state.
A 2020 study found that for every $1 increase in the minimum wage, there was a 3.4% to 5.9% decrease in suicide rates among adults aged 18 to 64 who had a high school education or less. 
Raising West Virginia’s minimum wage can save lives. 
Raising the minimum wage will benefit the whole economy
Raising the minimum wage not only benefits those workers whose wages were below the new minimum, it would also benefit many other workers in the economy. This is because employers want to avoid wage compression. If a minimum wage worker suddenly receives an increase because of a change in the law, workers above him in the employer’s pay scale are usually given an increase so they remain above. This ripples up the chain of compensation, even to salaried employees.
The overall economy directly benefits from an increase in the minimum wage because of the difference in the way low-wage employees spend additional income versus higher paid workers. More money in the pockets of low-income people results in more spending for necessities, rather than in saving. As a result, an increase in the minimum wage directly increases the amount of money circulating in the overall economy. This has a wealth-creating effect for everyone else.
Raising the minimum wage will save taxpayers money
Medicaid, food stamps and other forms of public assistance are funded with tax dollars. 
Increasing the minimum wage reduces dependence on all forms of public assistance, thereby lowering the general tax burden.
What’s more, raising the minimum wage is “revenue-neutral” for governments since the increase in wages is not paid for with tax money. In fact, an increase in the minimum wage creates more tax revenue for governments because it creates more taxable income and stimulates more taxable economic activity.
Not only is raising the minimum wage the right thing to do in the world’s wealthiest economy, but for all these reasons it is also a powerful economic and social policy.

(Photo courtesy of VIP Petcare) LEXINGTON — Some veterinarians who oversee pop-up vaccine clinics in retail stores fear a proposed state regulation could reduce access to preventive veterinary care in rural Kentucky by making such clinics impossible to offer. 
The Kentucky Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners during a public hearing Monday heard concerns about a proposal that would change regulatory requirements for Kentucky veterinary facilities. 
Those concerned about the regulation — which included representatives from humane societies and licensed veterinarians with the company VIP Petcare — argued the amendment would mean less access to pet vaccines for rabies, canine parvovirus and other diseases. 
VIP Petcare, a mobile veterinary services company,  operates clinics within retail stores such as Tractor Supply Co. and Feeders Pet Supply. Franklin County Humane Society executive director Kerry Lowary said she feared the proposed regulation could also make it “financially untenable” for nonprofits to conduct animal vaccine clinics.

“I implore the board to reconsider advancing these regulations until it receives input from the organizations offering affordable, low cost spay and neuter services and conducting community-wide vaccination clinics,” Lowary said to the board, meeting at its offices at the Kentucky Horse Park.
What would the regulation do?
The board, made up of licensed veterinarians for large and small animals, oversees the licensing and certificating of the more than 2,600 active veterans throughout Kentucky. The board in July advanced the proposed regulation requiring the “dedicated” space that veterinarians use to treat animals be a “clearly distinct, purpose-built area that is physically and operationally separate from non-veterinary spaces and retail shopping areas.” 
Such a space would be required to be confined and enclosed with floor-to-ceiling walls so that “patients are fully contained and separated from persons who are not veterinary personnel or an owner.” 
The regulation appears to not affect traditional veterinary offices and mobile veterinary units housed in large vehicles that already meet the space requirements. Government-sponsored vaccine clinics, including mass rabies vaccine clinics sponsored by local public health departments, would be exempt from the regulation. 
According to minutes from a July special meeting, the board argued the regulation was needed because of “real issues with public safety,” such as the possibilities that improperly disposed needles could cause an “inadvertent” puncture and that aggressive animals could “lash out” at passersby. The board also argued that temporary veterinary spaces could be a danger to animals that have an adverse reaction to treatments and need follow-up care.
Licensed veterinarians and other representatives with VIP Petcare told the board that their in-store operations are safe, saying that during tens of thousands of “patient encounters” there have been no examples of animals escaping or syringes being mishandled. 
A lack of access vs. ‘limited’ risks
Thomas Kerr, the director of veterinary compliance with VIP Petcare, told the board the in-store clinics offered by the company vaccinated more than 4,200 dogs and cats against rabies, conducted 1,700 tests for heartworm and tick-borne disease and microchipped almost 400 pets.

Kerr said the company, which was bought by the company Pet IQ in 2018, has operated in Kentucky for 11 years. Pet IQ was subsequently bought by a private equity firm last year. 
“These proposed rules, while well-intentioned, do not align with the real-world evidence of how care is already being delivered,” Kerr told the board. “Instead, they create barriers that reduce access for the very communities most in need. In a state where rural areas already face healthcare challenges for both people and animals, we should be working together to expand, not restrict options for families and their pets.” 
Michelle Shane, the executive director of the board, told the Lantern the proposed changes to the regulation came about after questions from veterinarians about “what was allowable, what facilities they needed to register.” She said the board had not intended to single out a particular type of veterinary facility when it proposed the state regulation. 
Kentucky, like other states, is grappling with a shortage of veterinarians to care for both pets and large farm animals, though a 2024 report commissioned by the American Veterinary Medical Association found the number of graduates from veterinary colleges nationwide would likely meet future demand. 
Katryna Fleer, a licensed veterinarian and medical director with VIP Petcare, told the Lantern a licensed veterinarian is on-site at every in-store vaccine clinic along with other support staff. Fleer and another VIP Petcare employee said the clinics are usually set up either in the “warehouse” section of the store in the back or in a low-traffic section of the store. 
“We can’t ask them to build us a ‘purpose-built’ space for what we do,” Fleer said, speaking about the stores the company partners with. “Safety of our teams, of the pets, of the owners, of anybody else in the store, it’s just top of mind.”

Nicole Logan, a senior vice president of Tractor Supply Co., also sent a letter to the board urging it to reconsider changing the regulation because their stores can not accommodate floor-to-ceiling walls for pop-up clinics. Logan wrote the company had not received complaints of danger to customers, their employees or pets because of the pop-up clinics. 
Another licensed veterinarian with VIP Petcare Brenda Specht said she travels over multiple states to run the pop-up clinics, each one usually running up to two hours in length. She said she refers pet owners to “full-service” veterinary offices if she finds more serious issues such as “rotting teeth.” 
“Very often it’s 30, 40, 50 miles away to go to find somebody who can do good dentistry,” Specht told the board. She acknowledged there is a “limited risk” of public safety issues connected to the clinics, but that it hasn’t occurred yet. 
The board can choose to make further amendments to its proposed regulation following the public hearing or keep its proposal the same. From there, the regulation goes before the state legislature’s Administrative Regulation Review Subcommittee where state lawmakers can determine whether a regulation is “deficient.”

The appeal is in response to UK’s denial of the Lantern’s request for records of email exchanges that preceded the university signing a $375,000 separation agreement with DeShana Collett, who had been a tenured professor in physician assistant studies. 
A provision of the legal settlement between UK and Collett required her to withdraw her request for the records. She had sought emails among UK administrators that mentioned her. 
Collett played a prominent role last year in opposing a change to UK’s internal governance and presided over a vote of no confidence in UK President Eli Capilouto.

She and others had warned that faculty would be stripped of decision-making power over academic decisions. But the UK Board of Trustees approved the new governance plan proposed by Capilouto. It recommended creating a faculty senate, which is now in effect, to replace the University Senate.
In the final meeting of the University Senate, Collett presided over a vote of no confidence in Capilouto. Collett later wrote to faculty members warning of acts of retaliation by the UK administration after the vote. Collett warned that the provost’s office had taken control of the University Senate’s online voting system and would have access to how individual Senate members had voted on Capilouto. 
Joe Childers, Collett’s attorney, told the Lantern last month that after the controversy Collett was “subjected” to an environment at UK that made her uncomfortable. 
Childers filed requests on her behalf for records pertaining to her, including emails among administrators. UK denied Collett’s request for the records but the attorney general’s office issued an opinion partially in her favor in February. In that opinion, the office ruled that UK violated the state’s Open Records Act because procuring the documents “did not place an unreasonable burden” on UK and it had denied records related to the requester, Collett. The attorney general’s office said that UK did not violate the act “when it withheld privileged attorney-client communications” in accordance with state law. 
Childers previously told the Lantern that after the attorney general’s opinion UK agreed to provide the documents by July 31. However, the settlement agreement was reached before the documents were provided to Collett. 
The Lantern is seeking the same records that Collett sought in its appeal. UK denied the Lantern’s request, saying in a letter that “the Attorney General has already ruled that the records are exempt as preliminary and/or attorney-client privileged” both within the scope of the Febuary opinion and outside of it. 
However, contrary to what UK wrote in the denial, the attorney general’s office did not cite the provision protecting preliminary records in its ruling on Collett’s appeal.
UK spokesperson Jay Blanton said in a statement to the Lantern that state law “distinguishes between the rights and privacy of an employee and the rights of the public, in this case a media outlet.” 
“An employee is entitled to otherwise exempt records that relate to the employee to preserve their privacy interests,” Blanton said. “In contrast, the public — a media outlet such as the Lantern — is not entitled to materials that were exempt for a public request. Thus, the University appropriately refused to disclose preliminary materials or materials that were exempt for a public request.”
However, Michael Abate, who frequently represents news outlets seeking public records, called UK’s stance in this situation “shocking” in a statement to the Lantern. 
“They’ve paid nearly $400,000 to a former professor in part to keep these very records secret. I can’t recall another time where a settlement was conditioned on the withdrawal of an Open Records Request after the Attorney General said the records must be released,” Abate said. “To make matters worse, the University misrepresented to the Lantern what the Attorney General previously held — suggesting it won on an issue the AG declined to address. That only heightens the need for the public to see what’s in these records. What is the University trying so hard to hide?”
In recent years, UK has gone to court with Kentucky news outlets over denied open records requests, including the student-run newspaper, the Kentucky Kernel.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0809-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-30 05:56:36.367494

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)This year, a political drama unfolded in a small town north of Colorado Springs, resulting in an upheaval of town leadership and a triumph over a corporation with an estimated annual revenue in the billions.
The controversy engulfed the town of Palmer Lake (population 2,575), which sits just east of the foothills and atop the Denver Basin aquifers, an important source of water for the town. Buc-ee’s, an expanding chain, selected a location a few miles from Palmer Lake to construct a new travel plaza. Their travel plazas are known for their branded snacks, brisket, relatively high wages, clean bathrooms, and rows upon rows of gas pumps. Many Palmer Lake residents, however, opposed the development, vehemently.
There are many compelling reasons why a community would resist the construction of a glorified gas station, but in Palmer Lake, the crux of the issue was groundwater scarcity. And as Colorado becomes increasingly arid, contentious disputes about how to accommodate population growth and commercial development without exhausting groundwater resources are bound to arise more frequently. The Palmer Lake controversy is a harbinger, unless small towns proactively establish rules for growth in a water-limited future.

Water is of perpetual concern in Colorado, especially in the midst of a climate change-induced megadrought. Colorado’s municipalities, industries, and agriculture rely heavily on surface water (water from rivers, lakes, etc.), especially the Colorado River. And although the Colorado River is diminishing, over-allocated and contentious, it is renewable. Groundwater, stored in underground aquifers that accumulate over millions of years, is not.
Aquifers tapped by wells supply 17% of Colorado’s water, but at current withdrawal rates, much of Colorado’s groundwater may become inaccessible in just decades. Groundwater depletion is of particular concern for agriculture, which uses 89% of the state’s water. A hodgepodge of laws, regulations and court cases dictate by who and how much water may be extracted, making it difficult for new developments to establish sufficient access to water. To build a travel plaza, Buc-ee’s had to be annexed by Palmer Lake (or another town) to tap into Palmer Lake’s existing water rights.
Buc-ee’s had little reason to suspect that its proposed annexation would be the cause of so much vitriol. In the town of Johnstown, south of Loveland, Colorado’s first Buc-ee’s location has so far generated $1 million of tax revenue and increased foot traffic for local businesses. That was not a sufficient draw for residents of Palmer Lake. Vocal opponents to Buc-ee’s overwhelmed town council meetings and ultimately resulted in the resignation of the mayor and multiple trustees.
Residents also called a special election to pass an ordinance requiring a town vote before new land annexations. Residents opposed to the Buc-ee’s cited concerns about community character, traffic, and preserving dark skies and conservation corridors. Gas stations also increase air pollution and further entrench cars reliant on fossil fuels in an era where electric cars could and should become dominant. However, even though Buc-ee’s committed to fronting the cost of two new wells for itself and the town, the estimated 19% increase in Palmer Lake’s water usage for the Buc-ee’s location was the straw that broke the camel’s back.
So what does this mean for the rest of Colorado?
For one, Buc-ee’s fans will have to keep commuting to Johnstown. But more importantly, communities in Colorado can learn from the controversy and create plans to dictate how water should be managed, conserved and allocated in alignment with the Colorado Water Plan. Specifically, communities should develop guidelines for prioritizing water uses. Large population centers have experts and agencies dedicated to ensuring stable access to water as the climate heats up.
The City of Castle Rock, for example, was 100% reliant on groundwater from Denver Basin aquifers in 2005. With planning and hefty infrastructure investments, such as water storage capacity and better wastewater treatment, Castle Rock has decreased reliance on groundwater to 69% and is aiming for 25% by 2050. Expensive water projects may be challenging for small towns to pull off in the same way, but setting stipulations for usage and growth is possible.
The residents of Palmer Lake did an admirable thing in preventing the Buc-ee’s annexation and preserving their groundwater for future use. To prevent another upheaval, the town should perhaps codify water usage guidelines for development. Palmer Lake maybe could have kept its town leaders and avoided a divisive dispute had leaders previously decided not to approve developments with exorbitant water requirements.
Pretty soon, water will determine the success of every proposed development in Colorado. Buc-ee’s may have been the first casualty, but it won’t be the last.

(Photo courtesy of Amazon)Last week, the Goochland County Planning Commission voted to create a proposed technology overlay district (TOD) and technology zone, with some recommendations. These areas of zoning would incentivise companies, like data centers, to build within them and clear the way for peaker gas plants and small modular reactors to be built in the district.
Many counties in the state have these specialized zones that are often already commercial or industrial use. They offer incentives to companies to build in those specific zones and often have additional rules for being set back from residential areas and other ordinances. 
Goochland’s proposed district was advanced by the county planning commission in a 3-2 vote. The area would stretch for about five miles along Route 288. 
The TOD is a controversial subject in the county. Hundreds of residents came to the two public hearings the planning commission hosted on the proposed ordinance and urged the board to reach out to counties where there is an abundance of data centers or where similar energy projects have been proposed. 
Their main concerns are impacts on utilities, water use, fire hazards, sound and air and pollution.
“Small nuclear reactors and gas peaking plants do not belong anywhere near neighborhoods, schools and senior living facilities,” said Lawrence Frank, a resident of Goochland County.
The objective of creating the overlay district is to keep these types of developments away from residential areas by providing those incentives. Companies can still build outside of those areas if they so choose.
“Do I think Google and Amazon will choose to build a data center next to a neighborhood when they could choose a different property in the TOD where a retired couple won’t be sitting on their back deck all day with a dB app monitoring noise, then calling the sheriff and the local news station every time the noise limit is exceeded? I don’t,”  commissioner Guy Kimmerly said
Kimmerly ultimately voted against the proposed TOD because he felt it would allow agricultural land owners within the district to build data centers on their land. He suggested making the energy projects subject to conditional use permits that allows for more public input into the permitting process.
“I do agree with the fact that we do need to put the energy generating facilities in the CUP,” commissioner Dwain Cosby said. “That does give you the public the opportunity whenever there’s a CUP to (have public input).”
Data centers will still be able to be built in the TOD by-right, which means they can be permitted without discretionary review if it meets the requirements for the district. 
Some key changes were approved in the board’s vote following public comment, which the Board of Supervisors will need to consider. Those changes include:

Make energy generating facilities allowable only through a conditional use permit, both for primary and accessory uses.
In the areas of the Technology Overlay District with current base zoning of A2 (agricultural), impose a 500- foot setback from residential property for a data center permitted by right and require conditional use permit approval for locating closer in those areas. 
Limit by-right maximum building height to 80 feet’ for structures located adjacent to residentially zoned property
Reduce the decibel limits lower than currently proposed 65 dB in the day and 60 at night.

The Board of Supervisors is anticipated to vote on the proposal in the coming weeks.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rendering-3-1024x573.png,,,2025-09-30 05:56:36.367494

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star.)On a rainy Thursday afternoon, Anne Pfitzer and Jillian McLeod-Tardiff donned pink Planned Parenthood safety vests over their rain jackets as they walked the streets of Biddeford, knocking on doors to let residents know about the local clinic, where they could access a variety of services from cancer screenings to flu shots. 
After being cut off from federal Medicaid funding by Republicans’ sweeping budget bill in July, the organization has taken the fight to court while staff continues to provide services in Maine and across the country. 
“Hopefully it will come out in favor of Planned Parenthood, but in the meantime, services are still being provided,” Pfitzer told a mom who answered the door while her two kids played in the front yard. “That’s partly why we are here today; to say that even though all this is happening, you can still rely on Planned Parenthood.”
In light of the rapidly changing federal landscape, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England last month launched a regular neighborhood canvass in Biddeford and will soon be knocking doors in Sanford, as well. In addition to spreading awareness of the clinics located in those communities, the outreach is intended to let people know that anyone can access their health services, which are not limited to the reproductive health care typically associated with the organization. 
“I think there’s a lot of misinformation floating around, not only perpetuated by folks out of state, but also by political actors in state. Every year we see bills that seek to undermine our reproductive rights,” said Lisa Margulies, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England’s vice president of public affairs.
“And so this is a way of getting out into the community and letting people know that they have these rights in Maine, and these services are available to them,” Margulies said.
Before the canvass, half a dozen staff and volunteers gathered downtown for a brief training. 
Maine Family Planning appeals ruling that upheld loss of $1.9M in Medicaid funding

“So today, the goals are to spread the word about resources available, clear up any misconceptions people may have about these recent bills, and to sign up new supporters,” Lindsay Ware, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England’s civic engagement project leader, told the group.
Getting the word out
In groups of two, staff and volunteers knocked on more than a 100 doors that day. Some who answered were already supporters of the reproductive health care provider, making regular donations. Others used Google Translate to understand what the volunteers were saying, and exchanged contact information to learn more. And a handful said they were happy with their current health care providers but accepted the volunteers’ printed hand-outs. 
One young woman who had just moved to Biddeford had not heard of Planned Parenthood, but told McLeod-Tardiff that they were planning to start a family soon and could utilize some of their services. 
“While there are politicians who are trying to take away our care, we’re out here in the rain, talking to real people, making sure that people know that they can get care,” said McLeod-Tardiff, a canvassing organizer with Planned Parenthood’s local chapter.
“And it feels good, because a lot of the other canvassing that we do has to do with elections or ballot measures,” she added, “and this is just purely getting information out there directly to potential patients.”
Pfitzer spent years working internationally on reproductive health care as a grantee of the U.S. Agency for International Development. But after President Donald Trump’s administration ordered mass layoffs at the agency, Pfitzer lost her job earlier this year. She now volunteers for Planned Parenthood in Maine and splits her time between that and volunteering in Maryland for other causes. But this one is personal, she said.
“I’ve given my whole career to that work, and I’ve seen it under so much attack here,” Pfitzer said. “So it’s my own form of resistance by saying, ‘You fired me from doing it overseas, well, then I’ll put that energy to countering that here in my country.’”

Services continue amid legal challenges 
Both Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning, Maine’s largest reproductive care provider, were blocked from receiving federal Medicaid funding and have asked the courts to reverse initial rulings that have sustained those cuts.
In August, Maine Family Planning was denied a preliminary injunction by U.S. District Court Judge Lance Walker, a Trump appointee. That case will now be heard in the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. Planned Parenthood was initially granted a preliminary injunction, which was later reversed by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in September. 
Meanwhile, both providers have said they will continue to treat patients on MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, free of charge. 
While Planned Parenthood of Northern New England has not announced any changes to services yet, Maine Family Planning — which operates 18 clinics, many in rural, medically underserved areas — will have to shutter its primary care practices in Ellsworth, Houlton and Presque Isle next month if the appeals court does not rule in its favor, said Olivia Pennington, the group’s director of advocacy and community engagement.
The Maine Legislature has provided some temporary relief, in the form of $6 million in family planning funding, but it does not fully meet the deficit both organizations face. 
“There are so many providers who simply don’t take Medicaid because it does not actually cover the cost of care,” Margulies said, noting that Medicaid reimburses health care providers at a lower rate than private health insurance. “And so should we and Maine Family Planning and others not exist in our community, there’s simply no other place folks can go.”

(Photo by Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)This is one of multiple stories published by NC Newsline around the first anniversary of Hurricane Helene, documenting communities recovering in western North Carolina. Read the first story here.
GREEN MOUNTAIN — A few ounces of Helene’s floodwaters remain trapped in the headlight of Leo Sharp’s Harley-Davidson.
When the Nolichucky River surged, it swallowed the bike, flooded the tool shed and ripped away the vegetation. Water rushing down the mountain left everything caked in mud, the barn barely standing and half of the home destroyed.
The year since has brought a new roof; a reinforced shed; the skeleton of a new bedroom. Sharp and Tessa Reed, who call the riverside property home, still sleep most nights in a tent pitched on wooden scaffolding across the property.
Estimated repair costs were far beyond their own means. The couple didn’t have flood insurance, and have yet to receive aid from FEMA. Help has come in fits and spurts, from neighbors, friends and church groups. At first, they had hoped to have the home repaired by July 2025. Now, the timeline is indefinite.
“It’s hard to get any one thing done when everyone is pulling you in different directions,” Reed said, standing in the echoey, wrapped shell of a room. A rolled-up carpet and cardboard are stuffed in a clawfoot bathtub.
They don’t plan to leave or sell. Nor do their neighbors. They’ll stay and rebuild, they’ve decided, even if it’s with their own hands.
“In the moment, it was like, what are we going to do?” Sharp said. “Then afterward, you’re just saying, ‘thank God I have you.’ Thank God for everything we do have. Everything else just kind of becomes unimportant. It’s been a hell of an onion to peel.”

The homestead
Sharp and Reed, 38 and 29, moved to Yancey County three years ago. Their new, century-old home was a dream come true, a far cry from their original home in Virginia and Sharp’s decade aboard a Navy submarine.
They had transformed their home into a business — selling herbs and tea, eggs, honey from their beehives. Helene destroyed the garden, topped the beehives, washed away the chicken coops and ruined freezers full of meat and vegetables.
After checking on their neighbor Freddie and Sharp’s mom, who lives five miles away, they began to dig out. The bedroom was unsalvagable, with the foundation eroded and black mold creeping in. An estimate for a bare minimum rebuild totaled $120,000, nearly what they paid for the home in the first place. Somehow, it could have been worse.
“I think if we had another three inches (of rain), we would have lost the house and the barn,” Reed said.

Over the coming months, neighbors, friends and roving groups of volunteers and charity workers began to take on projects on the property.
One group rebuilt an enclosure for the ducks and geese, digging out a small pond and building a wire fence. Two young Amish men helped install insulation, and built a retaining wall to prevent the shed from collapsing. A group of men from Wisconsin helped the couple construct the bedroom’s frame. And Living Grace Ministries, a Virginia-based church, has had members coming by for months to lend a hand.
A friend named Mike, who lived two hours south in Saluda, would make daily trips up to help the couple. He brought them peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
“We’ve called him Mountain Dad,” Reed said, smiling.
The river
The Nolichucky was unrecognizable when the flooding subsided. An island in front of the couple’s home looked more like a landfill: toppled trees, scraps of metal from cars and homes.
After months without a hint of green, Sharp spotted a bundle of yellow daffodils sprouted among the debris. A year after the storm, the island is mostly rebuilt, and plants grow again.

Still, the couple has gotten to know the local wildlife well — and saw both the storm and the cleanup upheave it.
“Truck after truck after truck, excavators driving through the river,” Reed said.
The excavator was such a common sight that it earned a nickname: “Carl.”
“We had seen hellbenders and trout during the spring and the summer,” she said. “While we were out here fishing, almost every day.
“You couldn’t pay me to get in that water now. I don’t care how many water tests come back OK.”
Reed’s a bird person. But she hasn’t seen kingfishers or osprey fly over, as they normally do. Sometimes she spots a heron.
She started seeing copperheads frequently after the storm, after having seen none in years. Sharp’s mother and her neighbors started to see bears venturing further out, near homes.

The mine
In recent months, Sharp and Reed noticed work vehicles and excavators constantly coming down the railroad tracks. A neighbor’s Facebook posts shed light on why: a 50-acre mining operation along the Nolichucky in Mitchell County to supply CSX the materials it needed to stabilize a railroad bed.
For those living nearby, the noise was deafening and constant — sometimes going into the early morning hours.
But for Sharp and Reed, it was the air quality that was the most apparent: clouds of dust descending on their home. Reed has systemic lupus, and had started to notice more persistent flares. And Sharp had recently had a cancer scare.
“It gets in the house, it gets in your car, it gets in everything,” Reed said.
Sharp, a licensed drone pilot, captured overhead footage of the active mine. When the Department of Labor learned that the operation was being done without a permit and a judge shut it down days later, his photographs and video accompanied the story across TV stations.

It was, it seemed, another test for a region already exhausted by hurricane recovery.
“Out here after Helene, there were so many people that dipped their fingers into the area,” Reed said. “It’s just fishy … opportunistic.”
In late August, the company’s application for a permit was denied by the Department of Environmental Quality.
“Taking advantage of our area was not the right move,” Sharp said. “It did a lot of people harm, so we fought it. Even though we’ve only lived here a few years… we fought for it to get shut down. This is where we call home.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3564-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 05:56:36.367494

(Luis Alvarez/Getty)A state agency responsible for administering Medicaid in Georgia has failed to adopt or follow through on most of the recommendations made in an earlier audit that were meant to help more children, including those with disabilities, obtain dental care, according to a recent report. 
Despite a 2021 state audit that highlighted falling dental care utilization among a group of Georgia children enrolled in Medicaid, a recent follow-up review found that the situation has worsened.
The 2021 report identified a downward trend in the percentage of children covered by Fee-for-Service Medicaid who received dental care, with it dropping from 44% to 33% over a three-year period. An August report found that this decline has continued.
Participation had fallen further to a new low of 28% in budget year 2024, with the review attributing this decline to a lack of coordinated, data-driven management by DCH.
“DCH was unaware of this trend because it did not routinely analyze claims to evaluate services provided and identify differences between subpopulations and geographic areas,” the 2025 audit stated. “The lack of a data-driven management approach also limited DCH’s ability to develop informed strategies to address deficiencies.”

According to data from DCH, an average of nearly 100,000 children receiving Medicaid benefits, or about 6%, were enrolled in the Fee-for-Service program between January 2021 and August 2025. However, this relatively small population largely represents children who are disabled or receive specialized care.
Georgia administers Medicaid benefits through two different models: Fee-for-Service and managed care organizations. For those enrolled in Fee-for-Service Medicaid, also known as traditional Medicaid, the state directly pays health care providers, including dentists, a fee for each service they provide. For Medicaid plans provided through managed care organizations, known in Georgia as care management organizations, the state pays a fee to a private insurance company that then manages the patient’s care. 
This year’s follow-up review found that the main issues identified in the 2021 audit remain largely unresolved. 
The report found that DCH has since discontinued its quarterly reviews of dental claims data and abandoned “secret shopper” calls, which were meant to assess whether providers were offering appointments to new patients without long wait times. The state agency has also not established utilization goals for its children’s program, nor has it fully analyzed provider networks to accurately reflect the number of dentists accepting new patients, the audit found. 
David Crews, chair of the Board of Community Health’s audit committee, noted the limited progress at the panel’s September meeting. He said the department has “developed a structured and strategic approach to ensure a sustained effort to address these findings and bring the resources necessary to address the findings.” Crews did not provide details on these efforts.
The state “partially addressed” efforts to increase participation from dental care providers in the Medicaid dental program, according to the audit. Although the General Assembly passed a new law last year offering loan forgiveness to dental students who practice in underserved areas, it’s not clear whether the Department of Community Health has specifically used this program to boost the number of dentists in its Fee-For-Service network, according to the follow-up review.
The state has fully addressed a key recommendation to provide more comprehensive dental coverage for adults, which the General Assembly targeted by funding full dental benefits for adults starting in last year’s budget.
Rena Harris, chief program officer for the Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities, said in an interview that the audit identified historical issues in the state’s Fee-for-Service program, such as lower provider reimbursement rates than those in a care management organization. She also said the audit encouraged the state agency to adopt procedures in place for care management organizations to help increase access to Medicaid-covered dental services for children with disabilities. 
The agency initially adopted some procedures to address concerns raised in the 2021 audit but eventually “abandoned” those efforts, according to the audit review. The agency, for example, began analyzing Fee-for-Service dental claims and enrollment data trends, but that was eventually discontinued. The review further states that DCH has not shared those findings with a policy compliance specialist assigned to its dental program.
“That’s what the children need. So if they reimplement these processes that halted, that will result in children who receive Fee-for-Service dental care having better access, which will hopefully bring their services on par with the children who receive services through CMO,” Harris said.
Harris said she was encouraged to see DCH’s response in the audit. She said that while DCH did not follow through on earlier recommendations, the agency has since shown accountability and appears “open to restarting the processes that were halted,” some of which were likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 audit noted that dental services expenditures in both Fee-for-Service and managed care declined in fiscal year 2020, likely due to reduced overall utilization of health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It’s difficult to fully comprehend all of the challenges that were faced during that time, and I know that our state government and our state agencies were incredibly stressed during that time, especially the state agencies that were responsible for people’s health and safety,” Harris said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1169329573-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 05:56:36.367494

They spent kindergarten through fifth grade at the rural Bridgewater-Hebron Village School. Then, they took buses to bigger schools within School Administrative Unit 4: first Newfound Memorial Middle School and then Newfound Regional High School, both in Bristol.
But parents from those three towns disliked the arrangement. The change in schools from fifth to sixth grade was disruptive to their kids’ learning, they argued, and the busing distance to the Newfound schools was inconvenient.
So in 2024, aided by a targeted state law and advocacy from local leaders, residents in each town voted overwhelmingly to leave SAU 4, create their own smaller SAU, and expand the school to serve kindergarten through eighth grade. The new district began operations this summer. 
The withdrawal is part of a trend. New Hampshire towns are increasingly voting to split apart their school districts and go their separate ways. The result: Even as school enrollment has steadily declined, there are now more school administrative units than there were 20 years ago — 105 in 2025 compared with 85 in 2005. 
In 2020, voters in Nottingham withdrew from SAU 44, choosing instead to provide K-8 education to its residents and send students to Dover High School or Coe-Brown Northwood Academy via tuition agreements. Strafford residents also withdrew from SAU 44, leaving behind just Northwood. 
Voters in Cornish, Croydon, Franklin, Goshen, Middleton, Rollinsford, and Wakefield have also opted to spin off their own school districts in the last decade, according to Barrett Christina, executive director of the New Hampshire School Boards Association.
The splintering is driven by many factors. Voters in departing school districts crave an increase in control over curriculum and leadership, says Christina. Leaving a larger SAU allows town school boards to choose their own superintendent, for instance, and voters to more directly influence school policy, he said. 
But the trend is now crashing against an opposing force. Republican lawmakers are raising the alarm about the number of school administrative units in the state, citing what they see as unsustainable administrative bloat in public schools. And some are exploring options for the state to rein it in.
“The number of SAUs is up 25% in the last 20 years,” said Sen. Keith Murphy, a Manchester Republican, in an interview.. “And that speaks to the natural tendency of school boards to want more control over the schools in their town. And so we’ve got to find a balance between that, and … the need to make sure state money is being spent responsibly.”
This fall, a bipartisan study committee is meeting to examine the possibility of consolidation. The committee is charged with looking into the current role of SAUs, the existing research on the effects of school consolidation, the feasibility of a county superintendent model, and the effectiveness of the existing school merger process. Members must produce a report by Nov. 1 that could include proposed legislation for the 2026 session. 
Democrats have generally opposed the push to require consolidation, arguing it tramples on local control and is not needed. And a bill in early 2025 to establish county superintendents to oversee all schools within the county was unanimously killed by the House this year. 
That bill, House Bill 765, would have eliminated SAUs and created 12 superintendents: 10 for each county and one each for Manchester and Nashua. It was rejected by the House Education Policy and Administration Committee because lawmakers in both parties objected to making superintendents elected officials. 
Rep. Hope Damon, a Croydon Democrat and member of the study committee, said consolidation decisions should be made carefully, with local expertise. 
“You have to look at what the trade-offs are,” Damon said in an interview. “So if you’re going to have less administrative costs, what services are you not asking the administrators to provide or oversee, and what impact does it have to reduce those services?”
For now, lawmakers in both parties are helping to gather more information about why schools splinter — and whether they would benefit from combining instead. 
Christina said the School Boards Association exists to help school boards navigate the separation process, but not to advise whether they should. That is a question to be decided by voters in those school districts, not his organization, he said.
Still, Christina said there are a number of reasons that could entice a district to leave. Some want to save money by exploring different administrative arrangements. Others feel outvoted by larger towns in their districts on policy and spending decisions. 
“They feel that they are either paying too much and not getting enough in return, or they feel that we just want our own person that the school board gets to hire, gets to fire, gets to contract with, and not having to share that vote or superintendent evaluation process with 15 other school boards.” 
Murphy and other Republicans say overall cost concerns may trump the desires of specific towns to break away. The breaking apart of an SAU means towns now have a smaller tax base to support superintendents and other administrators, they said.
“A superintendent is $100,000-plus person, and if they’re only superintendent-ing 300 kids or something, it’s not very good,” said Rep. Dan McGuire, an Epsom Republican.
“It isn’t just superintendents,” added Murphy. “That’s the top. Then there’s HR departments, and legal departments, and purchasing departments. All those various members.”
But critics say it is not necessarily true that the alternative — consolidation — would save money. In a thesis study released in 2024, Yale University graduate Grace Miller found that the 49 Vermont school districts that had merged since 2015 did not significantly reduce those schools’ per-pupil expenses when compared to districts that did not merge. The savings in administrative costs were generally canceled out by additional expenses in salaries and transportation, Miller found. 
“I do not think that we have, at this point, any confirmation that reducing the number of SAUs is actually going to save money,” said Damon. “I don’t think we have confirmation that it doesn’t save money either.”
And school districts sometimes break apart even while acknowledging that it could increase taxes. In a joint letter to voters ahead of the 2024 town meetings, school boards for Bridgewater, Hebron, and Groton said the goal was not saving money.
“Change is not easy, but it is sometimes necessary,” the letter read. “This is one of those times. Making changes will not result in tax saving, in fact it may slightly increase our taxes to make sure we are doing the right thing for the academic future of our kids.”
To Drew Cline, the chairman of the State Board of Education and the president of the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, even though consolidation and fragmentation are opposite approaches, they may often be motivated by the same instinct: saving money.
“Some of the forces that are driving them apart overlap with the forces that want consolidation,” he said. “… A lot of districts are splitting up on the idea that they feel like they’re overpaying a larger district, and they feel like the administrative costs are out of control, and they feel like they can do this better and more cheaply on their own. And then you see folks saying, ‘Well, maybe if we got (the SAUs) bigger, we can have economies of scale, and that will save us money.’
“So they’re really just trying to figure it out,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Bus2-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-30 05:56:36.367494

If that’s allowed to happen, Ohio will see $363 million less spent on health next year and it will see the demand for uncompensated care go up by $163 million, a 10.3% increase, a new analysis says.
The federal government is on the brink of an end-of -the-month shutdown as Congress debates a stopgap spending measure. One of the sticking points is a Democratic demand that the health subsidies be extended.
Created in 2021, they were intended to make health coverage on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces more affordable. 
Known as an “enhanced premium tax credit,” it’s available to people making up to 400% of federal poverty guidelines. 
For a family of three, that’s between $26,650 and $106,600 a year. Nearly 20 million Americans and 530,000 Ohioans receive it.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The subsidies save the average recipient about $700 a year, but those savings can be nearly $20,000 for some households. 
Their existence is credited with helping to push the percentage of uninsured Americans to an all-time low.
With President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Congressional Republicans this year extended tax cuts heavily skewed toward the wealthy, and they cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending over 10 years. 
At this point, they seem uninterested in extending subsidies to buy health insurance. 
Asked about the matter last month, the offices of Ohio’s Republican U.S. senators, Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, didn’t respond.
A report released last week by the Urban Institute said that if the subsidies are allowed to expire, it could have bad consequences for all Americans.
Ironically, the worst consequences would be felt in Republican-ruled states such as Florida and Texas that didn’t expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That’s because a higher percentage of their residents had to turn to the insurance marketplace for coverage. 
Ohio emergency doc: Medicaid cuts will hurt everybody, close hospitals

Florida will see demand for uncompensated care go up by 18%, the report said. That’s care provided to those who can’t pay. 
Costs for such care fall on the government or hospitals themselves. 
Ohio’s emergency physicians have warned that big increases in such costs will result in longer wait times, reductions in services, and more stress on rural and safety net hospitals.
Nationally, expiration of the subsidies will result in 7.3 million fewer people insured on the marketplace and 4.8 million more uninsured Americans, said the study, which was done with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. 
In Ohio, that will mean 0.4% less health spending on the non-elderly, or $363 million less a year. Increased demand to hospitals for uncompensated care will go up 8.9%, it said.
The report said the loss of the subsidies — and the consequent loss of health spending on low-income workers — would be bad for everybody.
“Because lower spending on health care services means lower revenue for health care providers and fewer services rendered, the resulting decline in revenue could have adverse consequences, particularly for already financially at-risk hospitals and the communities they serve,” it said. 
“This loss of health insurance coverage could have significant negative consequences for individuals, as health care use declines and unmet health care needs increase when people become uninsured.”

Enbridge Gas North Carolina is asking for a 12.37% increase to its residential natural gas rates, which it says would result in a $6.30 increase in the average residential customers’ monthly bill. Last week, the North Carolina Utilities Commission heard expert testimony from Enbridge employees on the need for the increase and from the state’s Public Staff, which represents customers in rate cases.
The proposed adjustment is 13% lower than the inflation rate since 2021, the last time Enbridge, then known as the Public Service Company of North Carolina, had a general rate review. (A utility company can also request to increase or decrease its rates because of changes in fuel prices. These recovery riders, as they are known, do not typically require public hearings.)
Enbridge acquired PSNC in 2023 in a $14 billion deal from Dominion Energy. According to Enbridge, it has more than 655,000 customers in 28 counties in the North Carolina.
Enbridge Gas filed for the rate review and adjustment on April 1, and the Utilities Commission held public hearings on the request over the summer, including in Asheville, Gastonia and Statesville. Enbridge has requested that the new rates go into effect Nov. 1, if approved.
Enbridge has said the rate increase is needed to recover costs associated with infrastructure investments to provide natural gas service to customers safely. The company is seeking a higher rate of return on common equity.
Michelle Boswell with the Public Staff wrote in her testimony that the utility company could reduce payroll and benefits to control expenses, noting that the company was able to operate with fewer employees during COVID-19.
But Enbridge has noted that it has gained more than 53,000 customers in North Carolina since 2021, and James Spaulding, financial and business services for Enbridge, rebutted Boswell’s testimony.
He said it was not accurate to use the average headcount from 2022 and 2023 as a basis for ongoing payroll and business expenses.
“To disallow the recovery for these positions would be detrimental to the Company’s need to staff its business adequately,” Spaulding wrote.
In an earnings call last month, management of the Calgary, Canada-based Enbridge Inc., told analysts they were optimistic about the rate review case in North Carolina.
Michelle Heritance, Enbridge’s head of gas distribution and storage, said the company is “very confident” that the case in North Carolina will be approved. She expects to see the outcome in the fall, as well as for Utah, and for new rates to take effect in those jurisdictions by next year.

The bus model of school transportation is trying to rebuild its workforce after the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw many drivers retire and left some families without consistent bus service. (Photo by Robbie Sequeira/Stateline)As a middle-school student in 1980s Philadelphia, Shelley Hunter remembers getting to and from school pretty easily thanks to the city’s public transit service, SEPTA, which had bus and train routes near her home and her school. Sometimes, she even felt comfortable enough to take a city cab.
Now, Hunter is a single mother of two living in Grapevine, Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, juggling her unstable housing situation and early and late shifts at a local hospital where she works as an EEG technician.
In a heavily car-dependent area, getting her own kids to school is a lot harder. Her family has been able to use a school-sponsored ride-hailing service, joining a trend that’s quickly gaining acceptance around the country.
“The DFW area isn’t like New York or Philly — there isn’t a train at your door. In some cities here, you can’t even cross to another city by transit,” Hunter told Stateline. “If we’d changed schools every time our housing situation changed and they had no bus route near them, my kids would have switched four or five times in a year. That would have blown up their education.”
Big, yellow and once ubiquitous on early morning or rush-hour streets, the traditional school bus has been undercut by national bus driver shortages, worsened by the pandemic. And with states stretched thin by federal funding cuts, a pathway has opened for an industry of small-car, ride-hailing and private transport services to ferry children to and from school.
Some school districts sign contracts to gather children every morning in cars or transport vans; in other cases parents pay individually for a driver to arrive, Uber-like, and ferry their child off to class.
Growing interest in charter schools and private vouchers will likely bring more business to these alternatives to traditional school buses. And recently, the shift has been helped by new state laws that encourage school districts to embrace new transportation models.
School systems are remaking the old yellow bus into a high-tech machine

A new Idaho law this year, for example, allows school districts to use smaller capacity vehicles to carry schoolchildren, not just yellow buses. Similar new laws in Louisiana and Virginia allow districts to hire ride-hailing companies, though Virginia’s is a two-year pilot program.
New Jersey enacted a law last fall allowing school employees who undergo training and pass background checks to transport up to eight students to and from school in personal vehicles.
And in South Carolina, where the state, rather than individual districts, runs the bus system, lawmakers introduced a privatization bill that would have phased out the state’s ownership and operation of yellow buses. It would have allowed districts to choose their own transportation fleet and contract with private companies.
The bill, which died in committee, also would have required South Carolina to sell or lease its yellow buses by 2029, ending state ownership of the system.
A recent State of School Transportation survey, conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in partnership with HopSkipDrive, a ride-hailing company that supplements school bus service, found that 80% of school administrators say driver shortages are straining their districts, with two-thirds reporting smaller budgets despite rising demand.
Three-quarters of school administrators link poor transportation access to chronic absenteeism. In another survey by the same group, parents, and especially mothers, reported missing work — and sometimes losing their jobs — because they often got stuck in traffic jams that made them late. Respondents reported that students missed meals, tutoring and extracurricular activities.
“When school transportation isn’t running as it should, we see a direct impact on attendance. Families who don’t have reliable alternatives often end up missing school entirely or showing up late, which disrupts learning and stability,” said Miriam Vasquez, executive director of student welfare and attendance at the Alameda County Office of Education in California.
But critics, including the lobbying association for school bus contractors, said the changes could undermine safety.
“Buses are built to withstand collisions in ways no passenger vehicle can,” Curt Macysyn, executive director of the National School Transportation Association, told Stateline. “One bus takes 36 cars off the road, and drivers have specialized training you don’t get anywhere else. I haven’t seen another model that replicates all of those pieces.”
Filling gaps
Around 2023, Hunter was stretched thin. She didn’t have a home of her own, so she had been living with her kids at friends’ homes. She spent a lot of money trying to get her children to and from school safely.
At first, Hunter tried Uber and Lyft, but anxiety overwhelmed her with each trip. She began downloading tracking apps and paying friends to accompany her children just to make sure they made it to class safely. But that started becoming too emotionally and financially overwhelming.

It wasn’t until she contacted the school district that she learned she was eligible for help under the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, a 1987 law that allows students experiencing homelessness to stay in their original school and receive transportation assistance.
“I never wanted my kids to switch schools because it’s stressful and they learn less,” said Hunter. “I also wouldn’t have known if I was eligible for assistance without asking.”
The district put her in touch with HopSkipDrive.
Operating in 17 states, HopSkipDrive offers a small-vehicle ride-hailing service covered under the McKinney-Vento law for families with unstable housing situations. The company operates similarly to ride-hailing companies such as Uber, but it contracts directly with schools, camps and districts through agreements that usually include a base trip fee plus mileage.
HopSkipDrive co-founder Joanna McFarland isn’t advocating for replacing the yellow bus model, or for shrinking routes or service, she said. Rather, she is lobbying states to allow more flexibility for districts to use small-vehicle services for the hardest-to-reach students.
Vasquez, of Alameda County, works almost exclusively with district students eligible to attend their home schools under the McKinney-Vento law. She noted that some families may not be aware of the transportation benefits available to them, and sometimes have to be persuaded to participate, given the stigma of their situation.
Under McKinney-Vento, districts are legally responsible for providing transportation, but only what’s considered “reasonable.” Vasquez points out that “reasonable” often ends up being a mass transit card or bus pass, which may not necessarily be safe or age-appropriate.
It’s why, she said, Alameda County contracted with HopSkipDrive to fill some of the gaps for those families in 2024.
“It’s very layered. We don’t just need more buses, we need routes that match bell schedules, laws that make it safe to transport younger kids, and case management that makes sure families actually know their options,” said Vasquez.
According to the State of School Transportation survey, roughly a quarter of school administrators say their school or district has cut or shortened bus routes in response to driver shortages.
Drivers keep passing stopped school buses, despite use of cameras to catch them

In Ohio, multiple districts canceled public high school busing this year while still transporting students to private or charter schools under new state mandates. Several New Jersey districts eliminated “courtesy busing,” prompting more walks to school for students within 2 miles. A similar change affected middle and high school students in Florida’s Duval County last year.
“While cutting transportation has become a default option, it has unacceptable consequences,” said McFarland. “What schools really need is a policy that gives them the flexibility to add more tools, like small-vehicle options, so they can get more kids to school, often in less time and at lower cost.”
McFarland told Stateline when she co-founded the service in 2015, she was one of those parents who needed to sacrifice working time to take her kids to school. A decade later, more than 10,000 schools across the country use HopSkipDrive, she said.
Fewer yellow buses
The safest form of transportation to and from school is still the yellow bus, said Macysyn, of the National School Transportation Association. For Macysyn, the COVID-19 pandemic turned a predictable model of school transportation on its head.
During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, many bus drivers retired, left the workforce or in some cases died, and districts have scrambled to find someone to take the wheel, be it substitute teachers, administrators and, sometimes, even parents.
The number of bus drivers decreased by 15% between September 2019 and September 2023, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Private school bus contractors now account for 38% of the nation’s pupil transportation services, according to the National School Transportation Association.
In the changed post-pandemic school transportation system, Macysyn worries that small-car and ride-hailing alternatives will compromise on safety and reliability as they push efficiency and expediency.
“I’ve yet to see anybody replicate the yellow bus system in its entirety,” he said. “The bus, the driver training, the safety standards, the student management and being able to put all of it together and make it work.”
A major focus for yellow bus advocates has been under-the-hood laws, which allow bus driver applicants to earn a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) without having to identify and explain engine components during the road test.
Since then, these laws have passed in 12 states: Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.










Transportation is the entry point to education. Yet every time there’s a budget crunch, buses are the first thing on the chopping block.


– Curt Macysyn, executive director of the National School Transportation Association


Macysyn believes these laws, as well as boosting pay for bus drivers, can rebuild the workforce. He also cautions against privatization bills like the one in South Carolina, arguing that individual vehicles taking kids to school wouldn’t be more cost-effective than the yellow bus model.
“Until you lose it, people don’t realize what would be gone if the yellow bus system disappeared,” he said. “Transportation is the entry point to education. Yet every time there’s a budget crunch, buses are the first thing on the chopping block. If we don’t get kids to school, what happens in the classroom is irrelevant.”
Back in Grapevine, it’s been two years since Hunter first signed up to use the HopSkipDrive service, and though her oldest has graduated, her 13-year-old son still uses it.
Hunter says her children developed personal, intergenerational relationships with their HopSkipDrive driver. She describes her decision to use the service as a “blessing” and says her children’s school commutes have been cut in half.
“The people that are driving are kind to my kids,” Hunter said. “They’re not just driving; they care.”

Ned Lamont’s administration has identified major cost overruns in CT's Medicaid program.","Deep cuts in federal Medicaid assistance aren’t the only threat to health care for needy families and children here.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration has identified major cost overruns in the entitlement program, known as HUSKY in Connecticut, which has struggled to stay out of the red since 2022.
Less than three months into the new fiscal year, the Department of Social Services, which oversees the majority of state Medicaid spending, expects to exceed its $3.7 billion line item by $100 million, Lamont’s budget staff reported in its last monthly report to the comptroller’s office.
The legislature authorized $284 million extra to cover Medicaid cost overruns in 2024-25. And the health care program topped its budget by $166.3 million in 2023-24, according to records from the comptroller’s office.
But it remains unclear whether state officials, who have secured record-setting budget surpluses over the past eight years, will invest more in Medicaid.
“The costs of pharmaceuticals are just astronomical,” Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said last week, adding that continued increases in inpatient hospital costs also are straining the Medicaid budget. “It just costs more to deliver that kind of care.”
Since 2022, pharmaceutical costs covered by Medicaid — after industry rebates have been applied — are up more than $278 million or 47%, according to the department. Inpatient hospital costs over the same period are up $119.3 million or 10.1%.
Hospitals are increasingly faced with Medicaid patients with chronic and complex conditions, said Shantelle Varrs, the department’s deputy commissioner. Increased demand for behavioral health services, staffing shortages and rising medical inflation also are pushing inpatient service costs upward, she added.
Further complicating matters, a temporary boost in federal funding ordered in 2020 in response to the coronavirus has been exhausted.
Congress had boosted assistance to all states five years ago, even as it temporarily blocked them from terminating Medicaid enrollees during the worst of the pandemic. But that “continuous coverage” mandate expired in April 2023, and Connecticut and other states lost their enhanced reimbursements last year.
But while Connecticut’s Medicaid caseload has dropped since that mandate was lifted, the caseload remains about 10% greater than pre-pandemic levels.
An omnibus federal program run cooperatively with states, Medicaid in Connecticut covers medical and behavioral health services, substance abuse treatment, and nursing home and in-home care. It also supports hospitals and federally qualified health centers that treat uninsured and under-insured patients. The program served nearly 926,700 individuals in Connecticut last fiscal year, according to the Department of Social Services, and remains one of the largest programs in state government.
And the legislature has continued to expand Medicaid to meet growing needs.
For example, in January 2023, the state began covering children 12 and younger from families without qualifying immigration status. Initial expectations were that 4,250 kids would be enrolled, but that number reached 15,000 by July 2024.
Legislators this year also took a first step, albeit much smaller than planned, to boost long-neglected Medicaid payments for providers who treat low-income patients.
Connecticut hadn’t raised these reimbursement rates broadly since 2007, leaving many insured patients unable to find physicians who will treat them. Leaders said a $250 million infusion in this area is needed to make a big difference and pledged to get there in four years, starting with $75 million in extra Medicaid spending this fiscal year.
But because of budget caps and savings rules, that $75 million investment ultimately was scaled back to just $15 million in 2025-26.
The General Assembly this year also ordered an $80 million investment in Medicaid funding for health centers. And while Reeves called that a “smart investment,” she said it largely recognizes demand that already has been straining these providers, meaning it won’t necessarily stem ongoing growth in Medicaid costs.
“So, we might not see this turn around for another year or two,” she said.
Meanwhile, Medicaid continues to gobble up an ever-larger share of the state budget.
The $3.7 billion the legislature authorized the department for Medicaid this fiscal year is up 55% from one decade ago, while the General Fund has grown 34% over the same period.
“We are monitoring these trends closely,” Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said Monday, noting it’s early in the fiscal year, which began July 1. “As the year progresses, these estimates will likely be revised to reflect changes in the economy, expenditure patterns, or other factors.”
Lamont took some heat last year from his fellow Democrats in the legislature’s majority and from health care advocates when his administration launched a study to return the state’s Medicaid program to a model known as managed care.
Connecticut currently uses what’s known as a managed fee-for-service model for its Medicaid program, where the state pays providers directly for services delivered to Medicaid beneficiaries. In managed care, or a traditional “capitated managed care” model, the state instead pays a set monthly fee per member to insurance companies to manage the Medicaid program, and the insurance companies pay providers.
The eventual report, authored by independent consultants, found that Connecticut’s Medicaid program boasts lower costs and similar levels of access when compared to peer states, leading to the conclusion that employing managed care would not likely save the state money, prompting the administration to pull back.
Despite the surging costs in Medicaid, Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, said Monday she believes state legislators will want to invest more in Medicaid, particularly given expectations that new federal cutbacks will eliminate hundreds of millions of dollars annually for vulnerable patients.
Those cutbacks, most of which won’t take effect until next year or later, also will take a heavy toll on nutrition assistance programs.
It still is unclear whether state legislative leaders and Lamont will begin the debate in special session this fall, or in regular session next February, on whether to use state resources to temper federal cutbacks.
Osten and other Democratic leaders say Connecticut has the resources to help, but it likely must scale back savings programs that have channeled more than $1.8 billion annually since 2017 into reducing pension debt and building reserves.
“People are going to have to choose between health care, their rent, mortgage payments and other necessities” like groceries, Osten said, adding a sicker, less productive population will cost Connecticut in terms of economic productivity and demand for care at hospital and health clinic emergency departments.
“I do believe we end up paying,” she said, “one way or another.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Andrea-Barton-Reeves.jpg,,,2025-09-30 05:56:36.367494

Bill DeMora recently introduced a bill that would ban the sale of intoxicating hemp products to people under 21. Unlike some others that have been introduced, this bill would focus solely on hemp and not on changing voter-passed marijuana law.
Ohio Senate Bill 266 would also ban the sale of intoxicating hemp products that have not been tested under the same rules as marijuana and would prevent selling intoxicating hemp products that are “considered attractive to children,” according to the bill’s language.

This bill would prohibit selling an intoxicating hemp product “that bears the likeness or contains the characteristics of a realistic or fictional human, animal, or fruit, including artistic, caricature, or cartoon renderings,” according to the bill’s language. 
“I put this bill in to get rid of the stuff that everybody agrees is bad,” Columbus Democratic state Sen. DeMora said. “Everybody agrees (intoxicating hemp products are) targeted to children to look like Skittles and Oreo cookies and that it’s unregulated. … We need to act because this stuff is poisoning kids (and) making kids sick.” 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has previously asked lawmakers to regulate or ban delta-8 THC products.
“It’s a huge problem,” DeWine said talking to reporters on Monday. “There’s really no regulation at all. We need regulation. We need the legislature to take action on this. We’re also looking, frankly, at some things that I might be able to do without legislative action.”
DeMora thinks marijuana and hemp products should be dealt with separately. 
“Hopefully this bill will, if nothing else, we can all agree on one thing — to get the bad stuff out of the hands of kids and stop the marketing toward kids,” he said. 
The 2018 Farm Bill says hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC. 
Ohio is one of about 20 states that does not have any regulations around intoxicating hemp products, according to an Ohio State University Drug Enforcement and Policy Center study from November 2024. 
This is one of a handful of bills in the Ohio legislature that are trying to regulate intoxicating hemp products. 
Ohio Senate Bill 86 
Ohio Senate Bill 86 would ban intoxicating hemp products sales to anyone under 21, impose a 10% tax on intoxicating hemp products and regulate drinkable cannabinoid products. 
The bill would require intoxicating hemp products to be sold only at adult-use marijuana dispensaries instead of allowing them to be sold at CBD stores, convenience stores, smoke shops, or gas stations. 
It would require intoxicating hemp products to only be sold if the products have been tested and comply with standards for packing, labeling, and advertising.  
Republicans Ohio state Sens. Steve Huffman and Shane Wilkin introduced S.B. 86, which unanimously passed the Ohio Senate in April.  
Ohio Senate Bill 56 
Ohio Senate Bill 56 would regulate intoxicating hemp and change Ohio’s marijuana laws. 
It would only allow a licensed marijuana dispensary to sell intoxicating hemp products that have been tested and complied with packaging, labeling and advertising requirements. 
Huffman, R-Tipp City, introduced S.B. 56 which would have the Ohio Department of Commerce regulate intoxicating hemp products and drinkable cannabinoid products. 
The bill would also reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, limit the number of active dispensaries to 400 and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
S.B. 56 passed in the Senate earlier this year, but has yet to make it out of the House Judiciary Committee. 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. 
Ohio lawmakers can change the law since it passed as a citizen initiative not a constitutional amendment.
Ohio House Bill 160 
Ohio House Bill 160 mostly deals with potential changes to the state’s marijuana laws, but it also has an intoxicating hemp provision that would require every THC product to only be sold at Ohio’s regulated marijuana dispensaries. 
H.B. 160 would reduce the THC levels in marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap the number of marijuana dispensaries at 350, and reallocate the bulk of marijuana tax revenue to the state’s General Revenue Fund. 
It would ban using marijuana in public spaces and offer expungement for prior convictions for marijuana related offenses. 
It would also make it illegal to purchase marijuana in another state and bring it back to Ohio. 
State Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, introduced H.B. 160, which has had three hearings so far in the Ohio House Judiciary Committee.

Mike DeWine is moving forward with a ban on carbonated, sugary drinks from food assistance programs.
The cost of groceries adds up.
“I remember being the kid in elementary school who had lunches that were a bit hodgepodge, or didn’t have the same types of meals that other people did,” Ohioan Lis Regula said.
This is why Regula said he was grateful to get some help from the government when he was growing up.
“It is still a crucial gap-fill for [people] to be able to meet their family’s nutritional needs,” he said.
He was one of the around 1.5 million Ohioans using food stamps, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), to help buy groceries.
But DeWine’s SNAP working group wants to make some restrictions.
The state-led coalition of health and business leaders just released a report recommending that Ohio ban SNAP benefits from being used for pop or energy drinks — carbonated beverages high in sugar or drinks with sweeteners.
“I don’t think we should have a policy in this state where we are essentially subsidizing diabetes in children by buying pop with food stamps,” House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said during the budget process in the spring.
Stewart and the GOP put a similar type of provision in the state budget, but DeWine vetoed it, saying the language was too broad.
“Ohio should restrict beverages that list sugar, corn syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, or similar caloric sweeteners as the primary ingredient or as the second ingredient if the first ingredient is carbonated water, as displayed on an individual product’s Nutrition Facts label regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration…” the workgroup report states. “Importantly, this definition does not exclude foods that support nutrition.”
Democrats thought it could impact juices or drinks like Gatorade. These would be carved out under the proposed policy.
“Overly broad restrictions could limit access to products essential for infants, individuals at nutritional risk, and those recovering from illness or surgery,” the report states, indicating that products like Pedialyte would still be covered.
The working group was meant to not just evaluate the idea, but also help with a federal waiver request, which would allow Ohio to restrict SNAP.
The language was modeled after several other states’ waivers.
If approved, Ohio would join 12 other states like Texas and Florida in restricting soda pop.
“I support not using SNAP to purchase these beverages,” DeWine said in July.
Regula said this infringes on personal liberty and could increase stigma for kids whose families make less money.
“It keeps a kid from being able to have soda at their birthday party,” he said. “What really is the point of that?”
Stewart argued that this is meant to promote health and responsibility.
“When you’re using the taxpayers’ money to buy your food, I think taxpayers have an ability to say, ‘We’re not going to buy junk food with it,'” Stewart said.
DeWine’s spokesperson said that the office is in the process of formalizing the waiver soon, as the deadline is in late October.
The governor is also looking into a waiver that would allow for prepared chicken to be available with SNAP benefits.
Right now, consumers can only buy cold chicken; the workgroup recommended asking to allow for hot rotisserie chicken.

(Jill Hummels for the Kansas Reflector)Many of my columns for Kansas Reflector have focused on agricultural topics. In recent weeks, I’ve heard from folks in Kansas and elsewhere, with the most of those comments coming from people having a connection to agriculture.
But their concerns stretch far beyond grain prices and the overall agricultural outlook. They go to the core of who we are as a country, and they caused me to reflect on past events in my own life, and to draw some parallels from those events to the present.
In 1985, I took a two-week business trip around the world. One of the stops was in Mumbai, India. Upon walking into the terminal, I saw dozens of soldiers with machine guns, with their fingers on the triggers. That shook me that day, and I have never forgotten that moment. Little did I think that, one day in America, we would see the same thing. Those displays of “power” provide no calm; instead, they provoke fear and uncertainty. There has not been any let-up in these tawdry displays of raw power since Trump took office.
The common theme in comments about my columns has been a deep concern about the viability of our democracy.
It was apparent that the writers were not members of the radical left. Instead, they were from folks whom I would refer to as ordinary Americans. (I attach no negative connotations to that description.) Many expressed disgust at the absolute failure of our elected representatives in Kansas, and others, to show any sense of loyalty to the Constitution, and to the people whom they are supposed to serve.
My correspondents share a common concern about how far we have fallen as a nation. Cruelty and incompetency are the modus operandi for this administration.   President Donald Trump is learning some hard lessons about throwing his weight around with other countries, many of whom once had at least a semblance of trust in the United States. Take your pick — Brazil, China, India — to name a few. And then there is Russia, with the pathetic display at the so-called Alaska summit.
The damage done to Kansas farmers and their cohorts across the nation will take years, if at all, to be repaired.
The broader picture requires us to ponder whether we are at an inflection point in this country. The vitriol is awful.  While I understand the right of free speech, one of the first things that I learned in law school, per the late Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, is that you can’t shout fire in a crowded theater.  At this point in time in our nation, there are many fires burning, and they have been set by our friends and neighbors.  The monster of unchecked social media is fueling the fire.
When we citizens, and those who represent us in Washington, know the lessons of history but allow them to be repeated, we fail at the moral duty that is at the heart of a democratic and enduring society.
Lies have become truth in the eyes of the Trump faithful. The premise is that if the lie is repeated often enough, it must be the truth. Outrage always comes first, rather than reason or compassion.
Sad to say, but I believe with all of my heart that an inflection point is near for our country. That is the message—loud and clear—that stands out from all the remarks from others about my columns. We have endured new political assassinations and violence, while our leaders seem unable or unwilling to unify Americans.
I remind those of you who read this of the famous words of our late President John F. Kennedy, who said “ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you can do for your country.” As Kennedy reminded us, we have a civic duty — not to tear our country apart, but to build it together.
The crossroads are in sight. What will future generations say about us?

Photo from Getty Images.“We’re in a hell of a mess here,” said Ohio farmer Chris Gibbs as he worked on his combine at the start of harvest season. 
“A severe cash flow mess,” he sighed. “A working capital mess.” 
Gibbs, who farms more than 500 acres of corn, soybeans, wheat, and alfalfa hay in Shelby County, along with a 90-head cow-calf operation, described the five-alarm fire raging in the farming community from Trump’s blanket tariffs.
Some growers have called the fallout from his chaotic trade war, and the reciprocal tariffs it provoked, a “farmageddon” that could ruin what made rural America great. 
It’s that bad.
The Trump tariffs are shrinking incomes and exploding expenses for farmers, who, thanks to a president they still overwhelmingly support, fear losing their farms. 
Many don’t know how much longer they can hang on. 
Trump’s punitive tariffs on foreign buyers made their crops less competitive in markets around the world (and drove down prices more) while other senseless tariffs on fertilizer, steel, aluminum, and lumber just sent the cost of doing business through the roof.
The double whammy of Trump tariffs is especially painful for family farms that make up about 87% of all farms in Ohio. 
Individual farmers struggle to break even, buy supplies, sell their crops, and build a sustainable future with long-term customers. 
But the current tariff dance with Trump keeps them up nights.
Everything a farmer buys “from phosphate and potash to agricultural chemicals, herbicides, machine parts, is up by 50% over the last decade, while our proceeds from the sale of crops is down by 40%,” said fifth-generation Ohio farmer Joe Logan. 
The former president of the Ohio Farmers union — a group focused on family farmers — maintained “the industrial agricultural community is chugging right along, raking in billions of dollars” while family farmers are not making any money. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Instead, they’re battling irrational tariffs, rising costs, high interest rates, farm bankruptcies and abiding dread. 
How will they move crops without buyers or the major trade deals Trump promised to fix what he broke?  
Farmers felt the same creeping despair with the tariff debacle of 2018 when Trump first slapped punitive tariffs on crucial exporters of American crops, including China. 
The move caused a tidal wave of financial disaster for U.S. farms and irreparably damaged trade relations abroad.  
“Farmers, agribusiness and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) had invested millions of dollars and decades of time to cultivate foreign markets like those in China,” explained Logan, “which, up until that point, bought most of our soybeans.” 
But the biggest crop farmed in Ohio was fated to lose its biggest customer then and now. 
In 2018, Trump destroyed enduring trade deals in overseas markets and “the trust that we had built over the previous 30 years,” Gibbs said. 
“That left us with acute losses because of retaliatory tariffs, primarily from China.”
The U.S. soybean crop dropped 20% in value overnight in the summer of 2018, recalled the farmer from west central Ohio.
“I came out swinging pretty hard with that and was very critical of the president and the policy at the time.”
The tariff madness was enough for Gibbs, a lifelong Republican and former chairman of the Shelby County GOP, to leave his party in 2019 and join forces with state Democrats as an advocate for rural Ohio and America. 
Then came 2025 and another blast of Trump tariffs to hammer farmers with shattered export markets and rising input costs.
“This is déjà vu all over again,” Gibbs griped. “We’re back in the same situation but only worse. In the major commodities, corn, wheat, soybeans, sorghum, rice, cotton, prices are below the cost of production, so there’s built-in loss. But we also have exorbitant costs that never recovered since Covid.” 
Plus, the front-end cost of farming has been jacked up by Trump tariffs on seed, fertilizer, and machinery. 
Farmers in already-thin margins are getting crushed.  
Tariffs on imported goods have made it more expensive for them to farm while retaliatory tariffs, imposed by other countries, (in response to Trump’s trade war) mean fewer American crops being sold and, when they are, at lower prices. 
It’s a no-win gambit for farmers and the ag industry that generates over $9 trillion in economic activity and supports millions of jobs.
Last year, China accounted for 54% of U.S. soybean exports. This year it bought zero so far.
Not a single soybean from U.S. farmers.
Chinese buyers turned to Brazil and other suppliers for the crop in 2018. U.S. soybean trade with China never fully recovered. 
“We did hear that China made a big purchase recently,” said Logan, “but unfortunately that purchase was from Argentina rather than the U.S., so we’re in a world of hurt.” 
He believes more farmers are waking up to the hollowness of Trump’s promises for a “golden age” through tariffs but expect the government to bail them out again like it did in 2018.
Trump floated using tariff revenue as farm subsidies. 
Farmers will wait, because what choice do they have? And sweat. 
“I used to tell my son, when he was just getting started, until you wake up in the middle of the night, 2:30 in the morning, and you got sweat rolling down your face, you haven’t really experienced what it is to farm,” Gibbs said with a rueful laugh. “I’m feeling that now, 49 years in. It’s hard.”

Ford/Maryland Matters)State officials have been doing what they can to connect Maryland residents with food, housing, health care and financial resources ahead of a looming government  shutdown.
What they can’t do is make the White House and Congress come to an agreement that would head off the shutdown that is scheduled to hit at 12.01 a.m. Wednesday.
“There’s rumors that the Trump administration is going to use the shutdown as an excuse to lay off … people,” said Del. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s). “It’s a scary time for them.”
After a meeting between President Donald Trump (R) and congressional leaders at the White House ended without an agreement Monday afternoon, Vice President JD Vance said bluntly, “We’re headed to a shutdown.”
Maryland has already lost the most federal jobs of any state, shedding more than 15,000 federal jobs since Trump took office in January, and the administration has directed agency heads to prepare for large-scale layoffs if a shutdown occurs.
Even without layoffs, a shutdown could threaten a large part of Maryland’s workforce — the state had an estimated 269,000 federal workers in 2023, according to a report from the Maryland Department of Labor.
“Marylanders should not have to bear the consequences of political games that put their paychecks, healthcare and security at risk,” David Turner, the communications director for Gov. Wes Moore (D), said in a statement. “At every step, the governor’s priority is making sure that Marylanders know their state will stand with them.”
‘We’re headed to a shutdown’: White House talks end with no deal as deadline nears

He said the state has been working to connect Maryland residents with resources to help cope with a shutdown, including career transition support and increased administration of both unemployment insurance and interest-free loan programs for furloughed workers.
“The potential mass firing of more federal workers and furloughing tens of thousands of contractors in Maryland as the result of shutdown will only further jeopardize both our citizens’ livelihoods and Maryland’s economy,” the statement said.
Lewis said that besides the large number federal employees in Maryland’s workforce, the state is also home to federal contractors or researchers, meaning a government shutdown could have a “ripple effect” on the economy. Nearly 11% of Maryland’s gross domestic product came from the federal government in 2023, according to a report from the Maryland Department of Labor.
Legislation to provide emergency assistance to furloughed workers was passed during a long government shutdown in the first Trump administration, and that fund is still operational, according to Lewis. The fund was also expanded to provide support to federal workers who have been laid off.
“Maryland’s going to stand ready to try to help our citizens where and how we can,” he said.
The Maryland Labor Department has resources like the Federal Shutdown Loan Program for essential workers — those who have to work without pay during a shutdown, but get back pay after it ends —  and unemployment insurance for furloughed workers, according to a statement from Labor Secretary Portia Wu.
The state provides these resources along with support for laid off federal workers, such as other types of unemployment insurance and support in finding a new job, according to the statement. Many Maryland counties have also offered job fairs to help federal workers transition into a new role.
“A federal government shutdown creates immediate financial hardship for our dedicated public servants,” the statement said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
On Capitol Hill Monday, lawmakers came out to support companion bills by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) aimed at helping workers through any shutdown. The Help Federal Employees During Shutdons — or Help FEDS — Act would require that states allow essential federal workers, who have to work without pay during a shutdown, to apply for unemployment insurance.
Elfreth said she remains hopeful her Republican colleagues will listen to their “better angels” on helping federal workers.
“I think everybody is up here because we happen to be optimistic in nature. You couldn’t really be a politician in this Congress without being an optimist,” she said.
“Many federal employees live in all 435 congressional districts, and so our colleagues are going to have their own constituents working on Wednesday if we shut down without a paycheck,” Elfreth said. “It’s just about calling forth everybody’s better angels in this moment, at least on this issue.”
The lawmakers were joined by Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which she said represents nearly 160,000 federal employees and 38 federal agencies nationwide.
“My hope is that everyone works together to provide the necessary resources to fund the government, deliver services to the American people and avoid a wasteful and costly government shutdown,” she said. “I am grateful for the people standing behind me today that are willing to stand up and support federal employees.”

(Photo by Staff Sgt. Jared Duhon/U.S. Air Force)County leaders urged the Prescription Drug Affordability Board on Monday to move quickly to set an upper payment limit on two popular drugs prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.
They got some of their wish. The board directed staff to proceed on the process that will be needed for it to approve upper payment limits on Jardiance and Farxiga, but it also told staff to investigate alternative methods to keep costs of the drugs down.
The county leaders spoke at the outset of a 2.5-hour meeting, just the latest in the almost six-year history of the board as it moves slowly toward reining in the cost of select prescription drugs for state workers and state health plans.
The board is closing in on approving upper payment limits, a cap on what the state would be willing to pay for the drugs Jardiance and Farxiga. But the board is also looking at “non-UPL” options still. Those include imposing a penalty on drug manufacturers for price increases that exceed the rate of inflation, creating navigators to help patients find the most-affordable drug and, the most complicated option, finding a way to decouple compensation for pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen who negotiate lower drug prices, from inflation or rebates.
For the county leaders — who are featured in a new digital advertising campaign to bring attention to the board’s work — the answer is upper payment limits, and soon.
“In my county, these costs are straining our budget, and once upper payment limits are set, we will be able to save money that can protect services and ease the burden on our taxpayers,” said Charles County Commission President Reuben Collins. “It’s critically important that you act as soon as possible to upper payment limits on what state and local governments pay for these medicines. We also urge you to act quickly on other high-cost drugs under review.”
Maryland market threatens to push more Medicare Advantage plans out of the state

The talking points were the same for Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman, Howard County Executive Calvin Ball and Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich, who all testified in Monday’s virtual hearing.
Ball called it “unacceptable for Howard County residents … to have to choose between paying for their prescription drugs or buying groceries,” and all of the county officials repeated some version of the statement that “drugs don’t work if people can’t afford them.”
That point was seized on by opponents of upper payment limits, who said UPLs could backfire, by removing the incentive for drug makers and pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate on prices, putting needed drugs out of reach of some patients.
“Carriers and PBMs [pharmacy benefit managers] control how drugs are covered and their incentives are tied to rebates, not patient affordability,” said George Huntley, CEO of the Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition. “Changing rebate flows without protecting patients could easily create unintended consequences.
“That’s why the board should focus on non-UPL solutions directed at reducing patient costs and preserving access: point-0f-sale rebates, delinking PBM compensation and out-of-pocket protections for Marylanders so they can afford their medications predictably,” he said.
The board is currently tasked with lowering drug costs for those who have health care plans through the state, a goal it has yet to achieve since its inception in 2019 due to several hurdles and a lengthy rule-making process. It only recently determined that the two popular drugs to treat type-2 diabetes and other conditions may pose “an affordability challenge.”
But health care advocates are urging the board to move quickly on implementing upper payment limits on the two drugs. That’s because a law that will go into effect October will allow the board to expand its cost-lowering efforts to the private insurance market, not just for those on the state’s health plan.
That expansion will only occur one year after the board successfully implemented upper payment limits on two drugs to cap how much the state is willing to pay for those medications.
To nudge the board in that direction, the four county leaders who testified Monday, along with Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, are being featured in a social media campaign sponsored by Maryland Health Care for All coalition to bring attention to the board’s work to bring down prescription drug costs.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Jardiance and Farxiga are the first prescription drugs that successfully underwent a “cost review” process that considered various market factors to determine if the medications were likely unaffordable for Marylanders and the state to pay for.
Farxiga, a brand name for the drug dapagliflozin, and Jardiance, a brand name for empagliflozin, are the first drugs to make it all the way through the cost review process, which involves collecting data, industry secrets and public testimony from different parts of the health care system to help the board determine if a drug is unaffordable. Four other drugs have been identified for cost review next.
PDAB staff are still pulling together information for determine how do bring down costs on those drugs. Upper payment limits, which is a cap how much the state is willing to pay for those medications, are just one tool that the state could use for cost reductions. But the board will need to implement upper payment limits in order expand its authority from the state’s health plan to the private insurance market.
Created in 2019 by the General Assembly, the Prescription Drug Affordability Board was slow to launch due in part to a veto from former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) amid pandemic-induced economic uncertainty in 2020 that delayed the board’s formation.
After Gov. Wes Moore (D) allocated funding for the board’s operation in 2023, the entity went through lengthy rule-making to create the “cost review” process for targeted drugs.
Opponents of the board’s effort in the pharmaceutical industry criticize the board’s lack of progress over the years, and believe that board’s actions will make life-saving drugs less accessible to patients who need them.
Cost savings for the state, and for Marylanders, are still a ways off.
Also on Monday, the board announced that Dr. Georges Benjamin will be replacing Joseph Levy, a professor in health economics at Johns Hopkins University, on the board. Benjamin has been executive director of the American Public Health Association since 2002, and served as Maryland’s secretary of health from 1999 to 2002, in addition to other roles.

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Maryland State Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis told the state board of elections in August that he has worked with the U.S. Department of Justice on its request for state elections data, but apparently that’s not good enough for state Republicans.
Maryland House Republicans wrote to DeMarinis Friday to say they don’t believe the Justice Department request violates Maryland law, which limits access to the registered voter database. DeMarinis has so far balked at the request, out of concerns that some of what has been requested contains sensitive, personally identifying information.
“As you are aware, Maryland citizen groups have long voiced concerns about the integrity and accuracy of voter registration data,” House Republicans write. “Discrepancies have been noted, but no meaningful explanations have been offered. We believe that providing clarity on the process will help restore public confidence and ensure the integrity of our electoral process. Refusing to provide information to the DOJ demonstrates a lack of good faith in ensuring the security of our voting records for our citizens.”
In Maryland, information on the state’s 4.3 million voters can be accessed legally when used for electoral purposes, with Democrats and Republicans typically using the lists for campaigning, for campaigning. Besides providing the feds with the process for requesting the voting list, DeMarinis said he also asked about the electoral purpose of the Justice Department request. He told the board that the response was to demand the list with all personally identifiable information.
Nearly 30 states including Maryland have received such requests, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and public policy organization. Many have turned down the request or supplied copies that are already available to the public.
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

The requests maybe be part of an effort by President Donald Trump to build a national voter database, according to the New York Times. So far, the Justice Department has filed lawsuits against California, New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and New Hampshire, seeking court orders for the records.
House Republicans noted the lawsuits to DeMarinis, adding, “We hope that Maryland can avoid costly litigation.”
Chief changes
Old hands are becoming new chiefs of staff for Maryland legislators on Capitol Hill.
Jim Notter, a longtime staffer for Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), will move over to become the new chief for Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D). He replaces Zephranie Buetow, a former Homeland Security assistant secretary of legislative affairs, whose hiring was praised in January by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies for ensuring diversity in congressional staffs.
Notter has worked in Hoyer’s office for more than a dozen years, the last two of which as Hoyer’s chief of staff. Before joining Hoyer’s office, Notter worked for former Maryland Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes.
Notter’s replacement is Margaret Mulkerrin, who previously served as Hoyer’s deputy chief of staff and has worked for the congressman since 2021. After a press conference Monday on Capitol Hill, Hoyer called the chief changes “good news” for both him and Alsobrooks.
“Angela called me up and she said, ‘I want to get a new chief of staff.’ Jim had been interested in that job,” Hoyer said Monday. “She asked me if that would OK. I said, ‘I want you to succeed, Angela. I want you to have the best.’”
He then looked toward Mulkerrin and said, “I had a wonderful, wonderful alternative.”
McCray the author
In addition to being an electrician, entrepreneur and elected official, Sen. Cory McCray (D-Baltimore City) can now add the title of his author to his resume.
McCray’s book, “The Apprenticeship that Saved My Life: Guidebook to Navigating the Earn-While-You-Learn Opportunity of a Lifetime,” was officially released Tuesday.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The 42-year-old senator said he began working on the book project in June 2022. He said the book not only delves into personal details of his youth (incarcerated at age 13 for 30 days at Cheltenham Youth Facility in Prince George’s County for possession of a stolen firearm), but it is also a “self-help guide” for facing the unknown without fear (walking inside a large red-and-blue building in Southwest Baltimore to start an electrician apprenticeship program in 2003).
He graduated from the program five years later. He’s a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 24, but he’s also been into real estate with his company, McCray Properties, and has run for office.
A goal summary highlights each chapter, but also includes definitions, as in chapter 9’s “Understanding the Different Trade Apprenticeships,” which goes into the work of carpenters, electricians and roofers. Afterward, the book talk about how those trades can expand into health care, information technology and videography.
McCray, first elected to Hiuse of Delegates in 2014, has continuously advocated for apprenticeship programs as another avenue for young people who may not be ready to attend a college or university after high school graduation.
“It’s a guidebook for students, but the secondary audience is the most important: parents, teachers, guidance, counselors and mentors,” McCray said Monday. “Those are the folks that’s giving these young folks direction and giving them a framework that they can keep referencing to go back to.”
Those writing blurbs for the book inculde Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) and former U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez (D), and the foreword was written by Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D), who meet McCray in the spring of 2010, when he was a mayoral staffer.
“To those who read this book: I hope you recognize it for what it is — a love letter to the forgotten, the overlooked, and the underestimated. And in doing so, I hope you come to understand the incredible journey of a young man who once found himself behind walls, only to rise as one of the greatest public servants, husbands, and fathers I have ever known.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/board-of-elections-scaled-newsletter1-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-09-30 03:56:26.416181

That is false.,"The cornerstone of our representative democracy is trust in our election process. As Secretary of the State and chief elections officer in Connecticut, my priority has always been to keep elections secure and accessible to all eligible voters.
That requires being proactive, working with registrars, town clerks, and federal and state partners to adopt best practices. But it also requires addressing any gaps when fraud or misconduct arises.

Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas
Recent articles claimed election fraud cases in our state failed to inspire a legislative response. That is false. They were immediately answered by legislation, proposed and championed by my office, to address the issue in the following elections.
In the last three years, the General Assembly has passed legislation adding new requirements on how absentee ballots are dated and marked, camera surveillance for ballot drop boxes, new restrictions for circulating absentee ballot applications, and expanded the definition of vote interference. This year alone, legislators approved new laws to extend the role of election monitors in Bridgeport, fund a public education campaign on absentee ballots, and strengthen curbside voting rules. These are tangible, immediate safeguards that make our elections more secure.
Election fraud is a direct attack on our institutions. The Bridgeport absentee ballot cases deserve a forceful response, and the combination of indictments and new legislation is that response.
Our work is not finished. We will continue to press for laws that protect both election integrity and access. No eligible voter should lose the right to cast a ballot in the name of security.
Fraud in Connecticut is exceedingly rare, and when it occurs, it is met with decisive action. Claims of “Faustian bargains” or a “dirty state” are not only false but dangerous to the democratic institutions that protect us all.

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Attorneys for Colorado immigrant-rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra argued in a new court filing Monday that her six-month detention is unconstitutional.
They want a federal judge to grant her an immediate release or hold a bond hearing.
“She’s now been detained for longer than six months. At this point, the burden shifts to establish that continued detention is actually necessary,” Laura Lichter, one of Vizguerra’s attorneys, told reporters following a vigil outside the Aurora immigration detention center where Vizguerra is incarcerated.
“There’s not going to have much of a basis to do that, because Jeanette is not dangerous. She’s not going to run away,” Lichter said. “She wants to be right here doing what she’s been doing, fighting for her legal rights, within the warm embrace of her family outside of this private prison.”

The new filing rests on precedent set by a 2001 U.S. Supreme Court case. The government has about three weeks to respond.
Vizguerra, a longtime activist for the labor movement and immigrant rights, has been held at the Aurora facility since March, when she was arrested outside the Target store where she worked amid the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. Her lawyers immediately sought her release, alleging in a habeas corpus petition that she is being retaliated against in response to her constitutionally-protected speech and protest.
Vizguerra, who has lived in the United States for nearly three decades, has been publicly critical of President Donald Trump, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the country’s immigration system in general. She gained national attention when she sought sanctuary in a Denver church to avoid deportation during Trump’s first term, landing on Time Magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people.
“This administration, we believe, went after Jeanette and targeted her for who she is, for what she represents and what she means to this community,” Lichter said. “It’s not just shameful, but it’s unconstitutional.”










This administration, we believe, went after Jeanette and targeted her for who she is, for what she represents and what she means to this community ... It’s not just shameful, but it’s unconstitutional.


– Laura Lichter, Jeanette Vizguerra's attorney


Immigration authorities, however, say Vizguerra is a “convicted criminal alien,” referring to 2009 conviction of using a false Social Security number. She also pleaded guilty to entering the country illegally in 2013 — she had returned to Mexico to see her dying mother — and was sentenced to a year of probation.
Federal lawyers are relying on a 2013 reinstated removal order to justify Vizguerra’s detention and an effort to deport her, but her lawyers argue that the order was filed illegally and carries no weight. She has received several stays of removal since then, the most recent expiring last year.
Vizguerra addressed the crowd gathered outside the detention facility on Monday night through a video call.
“From the beginning, me making my case public meant that I became a target for the government, because I made them uncomfortable,” she said, translated by Miriam Ordoñez, the immigrant rights coordinator for the American Friends Service Committee.
“For the first time, I feel vulnerable. I feel my health is deteriorating,” she said. “I am extremely worried for my family and I need to be out with them.”
Vizguerra called for a boycott of the commissary and phone services within immigration detention centers across the country during the first week of each month so people who are detained can “stop these profits and take back our power.”
Ordońez said it takes between $80 and $100 to “survive” in a detention center like the one in Aurora, which averages about 1,100 detained people per day. Phone calls can cost about $1 per minute, and a pack of ramen noodles costs $7.

(Photo by Brittany Britto/Capital News Service)State officials said Monday they will close the 44-year-old Maryland Correctional Institution at Jessup, citing the prohibitive cost of renovating the Anne Arundel County facility.
More than 700 inmates and hundreds of staff — the facility is budgeted for 308 positions — will be transferred to other facilities ahead of the planned June 2026 closure of MCI-Jessup. Closure of the facility is projected to save roughly $21 million in annual operation costs, according to a statement issued Monday afternoon by Gov. Wes Moore (D).
“MCI-J has long outrun its facility lifespan and we refuse to kick the can further down the road,” Moore’s statement said. “Our plan to close this facility will save taxpayers money, ease strain on our hardworking and dedicated correctional staff, and honor the state’s commitment to meeting every Marylander with humanity, including incarcerated individuals.”
The facility, opened in 1981, is a medium security facility housing 709 inmates. The prison was an annex of the Maryland House of Correction, which was closed in 2007.
Moore, in the statement announcing the closure, said “prolonged underinvestment in routine and preventive maintenance have contributed to building and infrastructure degradation across the facility.”
Officials said the buildings at the facility suffer from foundation issues. Others have drainage problems. Renovating the property including grading, asphalt, plumbing and electrical upgrades and roofing could cost $200 million and take years to complete, according to Moore’s statement.

The decision to close the prison is “a fiscally responsible step forward for our state,” according to Maryland General Services Secretary Atif Chaudhry.
“By closing MCI-J, we’re saving Maryland taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in avoidable costs over the long term and refocusing our resources on more sustainable correctional solutions,” Chaudhry said in the statement.
Services including adult basic education, high school diploma equivalency, special education, vocational trade programs, job readiness, work release, public safety works and apprenticeship programs will be moved to other facilities, along with post-secondary education programs from the University of Baltimore, Georgetown University, Goucher College, Bowie State University and Wor-Wic Community College.
Consolidation of the facility will allow the state to redeploy staff to other prisons.
The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services has long struggled with understaffing, leading to increased overtime for the department and safety issues. The Jessup prison is budgeted for 308 staff.
“Adequate staff is proactive security,” said Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services Secretary Carolyn J. Scruggs. “By shifting staff to surrounding facilities, we will not only provide coverage needed to deter incidents and make our facilities safer, but we can minimize the costly, constant and exhausting cycle of mandatory overtime, improve morale and reduce burnout.”
Moore said the state will work with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Emplouyees, the union that represents staff at the prison, during the closure process.
As part of the effort to close the prison, those incarcerated there will be transferred in phases. In the first phase, older prisoners serving life sentences as well as those with disabilities who require housing under the Americans with Disabilities Act will be moved first.
After that, others will be transferred to other state prisons including the Maryland Correctional Institution at Hagerstown, the Roxbury Correctional Institution in Hagerstown, and the North Branch Correctional Institution in Cumberland. Individuals will be transferred based on individual security needs, according to the statement.
Once closed, the buildings will be “shuttered and winterized” at a cost of about $1.5 million. Moore said the state will decide the future of the property later.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MD-prison-e1443819223464-1.jpg,,,2025-09-29 23:56:27.585689

(Photo by Chalabala/stock.adobe.com)The Maryland Attorney General’s Office is reviewing an Anne Arundel County judge’s decision to dismiss charges against two county police officers in connection with a high-speed chase that resulted in the death of a passenger in the car they were chasing in 2023
The attorney general’s office said Monday that it is “reviewing the court’s decision to determine next steps” in that case against officers Eddie Vasquez and Kieran Schnell.
When they were indicted in December on misconduct in office charges stemming from the chase, they became first officers charged by the attorney general’s Independent Investigations Division, which was created by the General Assembly in 2021 to investigate cases involving police officers that result in death or injuries likely to result in death.
The Anne Arundel County Police Department said in a statement that both officers, with the rank of corporal, were reinstated “to full-duty status” after last Tuesday’s ruling. Schnell is a six-year veteran of the department, while Vasquez has five years.
The charges stemmed from a December 2023 chase that began when Schnell followed a vehicle with its headlights off traveling 92 mph in a 35-mph zone on Fort Smallwood Road. Vasquez soon joined the chase. After more than 2 miles, at speeds reaching up to 109 mph, the car crashed into a utility pole, killing passenger Damione Gardner, 22.

The driver, Meziah Johnson, now 25, survived. According to court records, he pleaded guilty in June to negligent manslaughter, drug possession and theft up to $25,000.
At a hearing last week for the officers, Anne Arundel County Circuit Judge Stacy McCormack said the state hadn’t reached the burden necessary for the case to proceed. She also said the state did not prove that “compelled statements” made by the officers during an internal affairs investigation were kept separate between the attorney generals’ investigations division and the attorneys preparing for the trial.
“The burden is an affirmative one,” the judge said. “The AG must demonstrate that its evidence is not tainted by any direct or indirect exposures to the compelled testimony.”
“I think it’s very important to note that I understand that this is a serious case involving an accident where an individual lost his life,” the judge said, before dismissing the charges.
Andrew Jezic, an attorney representing Vasquez, said Monday both officers were back on duty about 45 minutes after the judge’s ruling.
“These are good officers. Their main focus was getting these two guys out of the car and into the hands of the emergency personnel,” Jezic said. “This ruling could not have benefited finer, more dedicated officers and extremely nice young men.”
After Vasquez “wiped away his tears” and hugged family and friends, Jezic said one of the first statements Vasquez said to him, “I can’t wait to get back out on the road.”
“This has been an incredibly stressful experience for him,” Jezic said. “I don’t think he did anything wrong.”
Jennifer Donelan, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office, said in an email the division has completed 80 investigations of officers, and nearly none of them found officers had broken the law, but “when they did, we took action.”
“Throughout the process, we publicly release case information, body cam footage, and post updates to our website, all to keep the public informed on the latest developments in our cases,” she said. “This commitment to transparent reporting ensures that the community remains informed and that the IID is held accountable for its work.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AdobeStock_72920225-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-29 22:58:04.551102

Jeff Landry shakes hands with a Louisiana National Guard member during a May 10, 2024, trip to the Texas-Mexico border. (Governor's Office photo)Gov. Jeff Landry has formally asked the federal government to support a yearlong activation of up to 1,000 members of the Louisiana National Guard, pointing to the Trump administration’s “successful model” of deploying the military in Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee.
Landry’s office announced Monday evening he had sent a letter to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth with his request.
“Louisiana currently faces a convergence of elevated violent crime rates in Shreveport, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans coupled with critical personnel shortages within local law enforcement,” the governor wrote. “These manpower shortages limit their ability to effectively address this public safety threat and consequently, incidents of homicide, carjacking, and gang-related violence, significantly exceed the national average.”
The governor’s letter asks for federal assistance through the end of fiscal year 2026, which is Sept. 30 of next year.
Landry’s “proposed mission and scope” for Guard members would be “to deploy throughout the state to urban centers, support law enforcement presence in high-crime areas, provide logistical and communications support, and secure critical infrastructure,” according to his letter.
“All operations will adhere to established rules for use of force and prioritize community outreach, to ensure transparency and public trust,” the governor continued.
Landry’s request comes as members of the Tennessee National Guard are expected to arrive this week in Memphis, Tennessee. Gov. Bill Lee said the military members will not carry weapons or make arrests unless asked by local police, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
“Since taking office, we have made real progress in driving down crime across Louisiana — but the job is far from finished,” Landry said in a statement. “Federal partnerships in our toughest cities have worked, and now, with the support of President Trump and Secretary Hegseth, we are taking the next step by bringing in the National Guard. This mission is about saving lives and protecting families. To the criminals terrorizing our communities: your time is up. Law and order are back in Louisiana.”
In recent weeks, Trump has indicated he would deploy the military to other cities around the U.S., frequently mentioning Chicago, Baltimore, New Orleans and most recently Portland, Oregon. The Republican president has also authorized the use of California National Guard members and Marines in Los Angeles, over the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Landry has openly supported Trump’s suggestions to deploy troops to Louisiana cities. Earlier this month, the president indicated he was deciding between Chicago and New Orleans.
“Do we go to Chicago? Or do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that’s become quite tough, quite bad,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.
Last month, Landry committed 135 members of the Louisiana National Guard to support President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department. Trump declared a “crime emergency” in the nation’s capital, despite its violent crime rate reaching a 30-year low.

(Getty Images)The virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic is still circulating, but some Alaskans seeking to be vaccinated against the disease may have to wait for that service.
State health officials continue to recommend wide use of COVID vaccines, according to a newly released bulletin from the Alaska Division of Public Health epidemiology section.
The wording of that recommendation, however, is modified to reflect newly released guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Health care providers should recommend vaccination “for all eligible patients” at least 6 months old, “especially considering those who are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 infection,” the bulletin said.
That is slightly different wording from previous state recommendations, which was more general. The subtle change puts state recommendations in line with what the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended on Sept. 19: that anyone at least 6 months of age should be vacationed as “determined by individual decision-making.”
Advisory committee members who made the recommendation were appointed by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr., a critic of vaccines. Kennedy fired all members of the previous board, which had recommended the vaccinations without the same qualifications.
Alaska’s COVID-19 case numbers have been declining since the peak of the pandemic, as they have globally, and the past year’s records were part of that trend, the epidemiology bulletin. Case counts are reported through laboratory testing and emergency room visits. The totals do not reflect cases among people who tested themselves but did not report the results.
Over the last COVID-19 season, which runs from early autumn to the end of summer, August was the month with the most lab-confirmed cases, totaling over 1,000 in number. That contrasts with seasonal trends in the rest of the nation, where there are surges in the disease during the winter.

	Alaska’s higher August numbers may reflect the flow of more people in and out of the state at that time of the year, said Sarah Aho, the Division of Public Health’s immunization program manager and a co-author of the bulletin.
“There’s a lot of travel in August,” she said.
COVID-19 vaccines are currently available in Alaska, mostly in pharmacies, Aho said. People who want to use those pharmacy services should have no problem doing so, even if they are not over 65 or otherwise in a group that the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices considers to be at elevated risk, she said.
“There should be no issue for someone who wants a COVID vaccine to receive one,” she said.
Alaska is one of many states where pharmacies are allowed to provide vaccines without prescriptions. Pharmacies gained that authority in a 2022 bill that was passed by state lawmakers and signed into law. In some other states, that authority for pharmacists is new.
Beyond pharmacies, there are some vaccine supply problems in the state, Aho said. The delay is especially affecting pediatric offices that depend on supplies through the state program, which has not yet ordered the vaccines, she said.
Children who would be vaccinated at their pediatricians’ offices might have to wait until mid- or late October, she said.
The delay might affect some rural communities, where clinics also depend on supplies from the state program, she said.
Before ordering COVID vaccines, state officials are waiting for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, or acting director, to sign off on recommendations, Aho said.
“As soon as it happens, we are ready to start ordering and delivering,” she said. “Our intent is to have it wildly available.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/vaccinekids5andyounger-scaled-1-1024x6831692734565-1.jpeg,,,2025-09-29 22:58:04.551102

Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, following the annual State of the State address on Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025, in the Alaska Capitol. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy on Monday vetoed his ninth bill of the year, canceling Alaska lawmakers’ efforts to fund public schools by rewriting a portion of the state’s corporate tax code.
Senate Bill 113, passed by the Alaska House and Senate in May by a combined vote of 42-18, would have required internet companies to pay corporate income taxes based on the location of their sales, not the location of their server farms or offices. 
That shift, already enacted by 36 other states, would have required companies like Netflix and Hulu, which do not have any in-state business presence, to pay corporate taxes based on sales to Alaskans. That shift was expected to generate between $25 million and $65 million per year for the state treasury once fully implemented.
In House Bill 57, which increased the state’s per-student public school funding formula, lawmakers included provisions that directed much of that money to vocational and technical instruction, as well as grants intended to help elementary school students improve their reading.
Without SB 113, those programs will not receive additional money.
In 2022, Dunleavy and the Legislature collaborated on the Alaska Reads Act, legislation intended to boost the reading skills of young Alaskans. Initial results have shown some benefits, and funding in SB 113 was intended to expand upon that effort. 
But in a message accompanying Monday’s veto, Dunleavy said he will not approve any tax measures unless they are part of a larger plan intended to bring state income and expenses into line over the long term.
Dunleavy said he wants to see a “truly durable fiscal plan” that includes “not only revenues but also clear guardrails: spending limits, statutory and regulatory reviews, and policies that make Alaska the most competitive state in the nation for investment and new business growth.”
Dunleavy called SB 113 “a simple tax bill that does not consider the comprehensive fiscal approach outlined above.”
The Legislature could override Dunleavy’s veto of SB 113, which would require 45 votes when lawmakers reconvene for the regular session in January, but that’s a level of support larger than the bill received when it originally passed.
Sen. Robert Yundt, R-Wasilla, sponsored the amendment that would have diverted SB 113 funding to education. He did not answer a phone call seeking comment on Monday afternoon. 
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, sponsored SB 113 in the Senate and lambasted the governor’s decision in a written statement. 
“SB 113 was a common-sense, bipartisan solution to help close our revenue gap without costing Alaskans or Alaska businesses a penny,” Wielechowski said. “The Governor had the opportunity to stand with Alaska families, students, and communities – but instead, he chose to side with tech corporations that profit from Alaskans and utilize our infrastructure, while paying nothing back to our state.”
Wielechowski said that the bill would have modernized Alaska’s corporate tax structure using reforms already adopted by other states.
“Every Alaskan knows Alaska is facing a revenue crisis, and that our education system needs critical resources. This bill would have been a step towards closing those gaps without taxing Alaskans while asking these corporations to contribute to the state that they use for their business ventures,” Wielechowski said. “The Governor’s veto sends the message that outside corporations come before Alaska’s schools, Alaska’s workforce, and Alaska’s future.”
Asked whether the governor had a comment about the veto’s effects on education funding, his communications director responded by email.
“Governor Dunleavy continues to encourage lawmakers, as he has done for the past several years, to work with him on a durable and comprehensive fiscal plan,” said Jeff Turner, the communications director. “Passing more taxes without spending limits and policies that give existing businesses the confidence they need to expand and new businesses the confidence they need to invest in Alaska will make our state less competitive.”
SB 113 was the last bill awaiting gubernatorial action this year. Of 33 bills passed by the House and Senate this year, Dunleavy vetoed nine, or 27%, the highest proportion since statehood. Legislators overrode two of Dunleavy’s vetoes during a special session in August.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/240128-State-of-the-State-copy-1024x694.jpg,,,2025-09-29 22:58:04.551102

(Getty Images)An Idaho legislative task force, aiming to make reductions and consolidations to improve government efficiency, dove deeper on Monday into considering changes or a repeal of Medicaid expansion. 
The DOGE Task Force – named for the federal Department Of Government Efficiency that was previously headed by billionaire Elon Musk — took a more detailed look at Medicaid expansion at a meeting at the Capitol in Boise, after members previously indicated the policy was a major target, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
“This is no longer that hand-up that it was sold as … This has now become just a straight handout program,” Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, said Monday. 
Medicaid expansion is a policy approved by voters in 2018 to provide health care coverage to able-bodied adults who fell in the gap between earning too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid and not enough for tax credits to be able to afford private insurance through the state marketplace. Its implementation also came with the elimination of funds used to pay for health care services provided to those who were uninsured. 
Since Medicaid expansion went into effect in 2020, there have been multiple unsuccessful attempts in the Legislature to repeal it. 
More than 87,000 Idahoans are enrolled in Medicaid expansion, according to numbers updated on Sept. 2 by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.

Deputy Director of Medicaid Sasha O’Connell provided task force members with an overview of the Medicaid program and answered pointed questions about potential cost-cutting changes that could be made, such as capping lifetime use and moving more participants onto private insurance through the federal premium tax credit. 
DOGE Committee Co-Chair Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, asked O’Connell what the state’s authority was to make changes to the program — which is largely funded by federal money, along with state funds. Medicaid is mainly regulated federally, though states may ask for permission to change the way they administer their own programs through waivers. 
O’Connell responded that states are given a range of options, but some of those options may mean taking a smaller matching rate from the federal government. Currently, Idaho receives $90 from the federal government for every $10 it puts into Medicaid expansion benefits; choosing to change the program so it doesn’t align with federal regulations around it may mean reducing this, she said. 
 What changes are already underway for Medicaid expansion?

The state is in the process of asking federal authorities to make certain changes, made through state legislative action and supported by passage of the federal “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” including: 

Implementing work requirements, meaning participants will show that they worked, volunteered or participated in workforce training for at least 20 hours a week, with some exemptions for those above a certain age, parents of very young children, and caregivers for adult children with disabilities. 
The state will double how often it checks if people are eligible, going from once a year to every six months.  
Idaho Medicaid will increase cost-sharing among participants, which could include increased copayments or premiums.
The state will end automatic renewal that would use information from other public assistance programs to demonstrate continued eligibility.

The state is also looking to ask for permission to allow those who earn between 100% and 138% of federal poverty guidelines to shift to private insurance through the state marketplace using the federal premium tax credit. Idaho previously sought permission to make this change, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services denied the request in 2019. 
The premium tax credit is set to expire at the end of 2025, and thus far no proposal has advanced out of Congress to extend the credits. The health care advocacy group Idaho Voices for Children previously told the Sun that an estimated 35,000 Idahoans could lose health care coverage without the credits because health care insurance would skyrocket for many. 
Tanner asked O’Connell to come back with more policies the Legislature could enact that would cut costs of Medicaid. He expressed frustration that the program was growing, going from about 64,000 enrollees in January 2020 to 87,657 this month. 
“When you look at the labor reports, we have a ton of jobs out there, it’s not like we’re lacking in this,” he said. “… We need as many options as we can for cuts.”

Jim Pillen and school choice supporters get a victory as the state opts into federal scholarship credit from ‘Big Beautiful Bill',"Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen talking in front of U.S. Reps. Adrian Smith and Mike Flood at St. Teresa Catholic School in Lincoln on Sep. 29, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and U.S. Reps. Adrian Smith and Mike Flood took a political victory lap Monday with a group of K-12 students at the capital city’s St. Teresa Catholic School. 
The group marked the day Pillen opted Nebraska into a federal school choice tax credit program that the state’s GOP members of Congress helped make sure was included in President Donald Trump’s tax and budget bill that passed earlier this summer. 
Nebraska is one of the first states nationally to join the federal voucher program, and other states are likely to follow suit. 
“Let me just make it really clear … I am not opting this in … I am cannonballing it into the state of Nebraska,” Pillen said to claps from kids and parents.
Pillen and other supporters of school choice in Nebraska needed the assistance of the Trump administration after the state’s voters overturned legislative efforts to create a voucher program of the state’s own. Pillen and state lawmakers have pledged to keep trying to pass a state replacement.

The Nebraska State Education Association — the state’s largest teachers union — expressed concerns over the state’s participation in the federal program. 
“Today’s decision by Governor Pillen undermines the clear will of Nebraska voters, who just rejected state-level vouchers at the ballot box,” said Tim Royers, NSEA president. “This federal program is a backdoor voucher scheme that diverts public resources into private systems without accountability or limits.”
Pillen pushed back on the union’s premise, telling reporters that ballot initiatives in the state are flawed because “anybody that writes a big check can pay signature gatherers to get a [measure] on [the ballot]” and that Nebraskans “ totally agree” on school choice.
Voters in all but five of the state’s 49 legislative districts rejected the state’s voucher program in 2024.

“LB 753 and LB 1402 were signed into law in 2023 and 2024 and created similar tax credit programs at the state level for everyday Nebraskans,” part of the executive order reads. “The teachers union stole these opportunities for students in poverty to receive educational opportunities.”
Pillen, during the event, also said pursuing additional school choice legislation remains a high priority for him so Nebraska can be “competitive” with other states — if he’s given the “privilege to serve a second term.” Nebraska is one of the last remaining states without a school voucher program. 
Nebraska’s Smith is credited with leading the congressional effort to include the provision in Trump’s tax bill this summer. He said the motivation for the proposal was former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe in 2021 saying he doesn’t “think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.” 
“I found that particularly chilling,” Smith said. “[It] gave me more motivation here to work on this so that parents and families can be empowered.” 
The federal program begins in 2027. It allocates up to $1,700 a year in federal tax credits to individuals who donate to organizations providing scholarships for K-12 students to attend private and religious schools. 
Pillen, when asked by reporters, said he would be open to broadening the tax credit to people and organizations donating to the private foundations supporting public schools and public school districts as well. 
As the federal program now stands, scholarship funds would be available to families whose household incomes do not exceed 300 percent of an area’s median gross income.
Nationally, more than 138 million people could be eligible to make use of the tax credit in 2027, according to an analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. 
Part of the push for more taxpayer-funded vouchers or programs for K-12 students to attend private schools has been the resistance from some teachers, advocates and lawmakers to reintroducing more religion in public schools, including in Nebraska. Recent efforts in Nebraska have been bottled up in committee or faced filibusters.
“Just think we can be in the environment here, where we talk about God the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit all in one,” Pillen told the audience.

The program offered vocational and rehabilitative skills to people in DOC custody and supported U.S. Bureau of Land Management efforts to manage and protect wild horses and burros. 
The department’s contract with the BLM expires on Sept. 30 and can only be extended for 60 days.

“The Colorado Department of Corrections is immensely proud of the legacy of this program and the positive impact it has had on participants, staff, and the community,” Andre Stancil, executive director of the DOC, said in a statement. “While we regret the end of this chapter, we remain committed to working with BLM to ensure a smooth transition and to creating new opportunities that advance our mission of rehabilitation and public safety.”
Steven Hall, a BLM spokesperson, said the contract will not be renewed due to rising costs. He said the bureau will work with the state and wild horse friend groups to safely transfer about 100 wild horses and burros before the facility closes.
Prison leaders said they are already preparing to relocate the about 100 horses on site. 
The DOC will also work to reassign its five employees and about 30 incarcerated individuals affected by the program termination. 
Hall said the BLM “does not release information on contract negotiations” and did not provide information on the cost of the program.

Last week, Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte joined Gary Evans, chairman and CEO of the U.S. Antimony Corporation, to celebrate an expansion of the company’s smelting facility outside of Thompson Falls. It is the only operating antimony smelter in the United States.
“You may not realize it, but there’s not a bullet fired in the world without antimony,” Evans said during a groundbreaking ceremony on Sept. 25.
Antimony is used to harden and strengthen alloys, including lead used in bullets, and is used in primers, which initiate combustion. It’s also a key ingredient in flame retardants, lead-acid batteries, semiconductors, and various military applications such as flares, night vision goggles, and nuclear weapons production.
USAC was established in 1969 in Montana to mine antimony and operates a smelter and precious metals plant in Sanders County. The company has not conducted mining operations in Montana since 1983, according to its website, due to cheaper materials from foreign sources.
Currently, roughly 85% of the world’s supply and production of antimony comes from China.
“This allows us to disengage our supply chains from people who aren’t our friends,” Gianforte said. “We cannot and must not be reliant on China for these minerals. That’s why President Trump, Interior secretary, Doug Burgum and others have made the production of critical minerals like antimony a top priority. With Montana’s rich tradition in mining, we can and should be a national leader with this important facility.”
Evans said the company began expanding its operations in May and is approximately 40% complete. The facility is expected to be completed by the end of December or early January.
According to the governor’s office, the Thompson Falls smelter can currently produce up to 15 million pounds of antimony oxide, or 5 million pounds of antimony metal, and also refines silver and gold.
Once completed, the $15 million expansion project will increase production by 400%, and add roughly 25 jobs to Sanders County.
Last week, USAC also announced that the U.S. Department of Defense had awarded the company a $245 million sole-source contract by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency to provide antimony metal “to aid in the replenishment of the National Defense Stockpile.”
USAC also operates another smelter in Mexico, increasing its production capabilities, and has expanded mining operations in Alaska.
According to company press releases, USAC has been “stealthily reacquiring” mining claims across 1,200 acres in the area and surveys indicate sufficient quantities of the element could exist in three vein systems on the property.
The company filed a Small Miners Exclusion Statement with the state of Montana this summer, allowing immediate mining operations on five acres, with plans to file exploration permits with the state and the U.S. Forest Service.
“There continues to exist a worldwide shortage of this critical material necessary for our Department of Defense. The significant price increase experienced for worldwide supplies of antimony ore have made this decision to reopen our existing antimony mine adjacent to our smelting operations an easy one,” Evans said in a statement.
One of the largest domestic supplies of antimony is just to the southwest of USAC’s smelting facility, at the Stibnite Gold Mine in Idaho’s Payette National Forest. The mine ceased production in the 1990s, but the company that owns the mine, Perpetual Resources, is seeking to restart operations.
The U.S. Forest Service early this year approved the open pit mine which could become one of the largest gold mines in the country, as well as a top producer of antimony.
Conservation groups in Idaho have sued the state Department of Environmental Quality over the air permit for the mine.
However, the U.S. Army took part in a ground breaking event at the central Idaho mine earlier in September to highlight the importance of securing a domestic supply chain of military-grade raw materials.
In Montana, Evans said USAC planned for the expansion before the Department of Defense award, but said it “took the gamble” to boost smelting production in anticipation of the contract.
“We’re excited about how this expansion will not only help fulfill this contract, but add to the employment to this area. This region of Montana is very pristine, and we’re trying to do our best to keep it that way,” Evans said. “Montanans should be very proud of the contributions your state is making in this extremely important endeavor for our country. There’s a lot of patriotism in what we’re doing by providing antimony to the military.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image001-1024x700.jpg,,,2025-09-29 19:57:49.820769

Many calls to 911, visits to the emergency room, and hospital admissions are related to preventable falls, missed medications, or common infections.
That’s because too many folks can’t afford long-term care. They need someone to help them at home, ensuring they can move around safely, assisting them with prescriptions, bathing, or meals. Health insurance and Medicare won’t pay for the expenses of a home care aide, modifications like grab bars, or assistance with meals or transportation. 
According to a 2024 survey, nearly a third of Americans have no emergency savings at all, with 40% saying they would need to borrow money if faced with an unexpected expense greater than $1,000. Even middle-income families can’t afford the cost of long-term care.
The impacts on women are even more acute. Women bear the brunt of the long-term care crisis as the ones most likely to leave careers or cut hours to care for an aging family member, setting them back financially and personally. When it comes time for their own long-term care, women can face discrimination by private insurance companies, which charge them up to 70% more than men for premiums.
This November, Washington voters will consider Senate Joint Resolution 8201 to protect and grow Washington’s public long-term care fund dedicated to women, aging adults, and people with disabilities by allowing its investment in a balanced portfolio. By growing the state fund by billions more each year, this ballot measure will help keep premiums low and may even expand our long-term care benefits without costing taxpayers a penny.
If measure 8201 passes, 100% of investment income from Washington’s long-term care fund will go to caring for aging adults and people with disabilities. The revenue created from these investments cannot be raided or spent on any other programs or services, and would be subject to increased transparency and reporting requirements, making the program more accountable to the public.
This measure received bipartisan supermajority support in the state legislature with nearly every Republican and Democratic legislator voting in favor—128 for and just 16 against. It’s a rare day when both parties agree that something is so necessary that they come together to make it happen. Home health care aides, grocery workers, teachers, and organizations representing millions of people with pre-existing conditions, like the National MS Society, Lupus Foundation, and The ALS Association, are part of the broad coalition supporting measure 8201.
The measure will enable our Washington State Investment Board to invest a portion of the long-term care benefit fund reserves into a diversified market-based investment portfolio, getting higher returns while reducing risk, while continuing to include investments in conservative government bonds and Treasury bills. 
Based on the outstanding performance of the nonpartisan investment board, this change will bring the long-term care fund in line with the growth of many other state pension funds and other programs like pension and retirement benefits for firefighters, law enforcement officers, teachers, workers’ compensation, and unemployment insurance.
The Washington State Investment Board has a renowned track record, averaging over an 8% annual return over the last 25 years. 
According to an independent actuarial projection, even just a 1% boost in investment returns would mean $67 billion more for the long-term care fund over the next 50 years.

,DC,2025-09-29 23:10:22+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Governors call for Congress to avert federal shutdown but differ on how,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/governors-call-congress-avert-federal-shutdown-differ-how,,"State officials from both parties urged Congress to avoid a government shutdown Monday, though Republicans were pushing harder for an extension of current funding.Though they sometimes clash with federal directives, states depend on funding from the federal government for numerous programs. A government shutdown, which would have a wider effect than any in recent years because Congress has not passed any of the dozen annual funding bills, would delay or cancel that support.The National Governors Association issued a statement Monday from its chair and vice chair, Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt and Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore, calling on Congress to come together to avoid a shutdown. The bipartisan group comprising all the nation’s governors generally avoids commenting on controversial issues that divide its membership.“The consistent use of political brinksmanship when it comes to our government funding does not serve our states, territories or our people well,” they wrote. “It is long past time to stop kicking the can down the road and return to the regular order of debating and passing a budget, but at this juncture, Congress has a responsibility to ensure the government remains operational. We urge federal leaders from both sides to work to set aside political games and pass a budget that reflects the values and promises states commit to every day.”While members of both parties expressed a desire to avoid a shutdown, they proposed different solutions. Republicans urged lawmakers to approve the “clean” continuing resolution to keep the government funded at current levels, while Democrats backed up their party’s position in Congress to seek an extension of health insurance subsidies in a funding bill.“Allowing a shutdown would consequently and needlessly disrupt our economies, threaten public safety, and undermine public confidence in our institutions,” 25 Republican governors wrote in a Monday letter to congressional leaders. “Our families and communities would feel the pain with immediate effect and confusion.”Partisan differences over shutdown extend beyond the BeltwayThe U.S. House, where Republicans hold a majority, passed a stopgap spending measure this month, but it failed to clear the 60-vote threshold needed to pass the U.S. Senate, as Democrats have declined to support a proposal that does not address health care costs. At the state level, the debate has fallen along similar lines. “Put simply, a  government shutdown should not be used as political leverage to pass partisan reforms — these are not chips Congress should be bargaining with,” the Republican governors wrote “The proposed budget extension is a straightforward, bipartisan solution. There are no gimmicks or partisan poison pills; it’s a clean, short-term funding measure that both parties have historically supported.”Republican state attorneys general sent a similar letter, which noted a shutdown would affect state and local law enforcement.Democrats throughout the country, though, echoed congressional messaging that Congress should extend the health care subsidies that were included in the 2010 health care law known as the Affordable Care Act, and take more steps to reduce the cost of health care. Republicans’ failure to include such provisions would put blame for the shutdown on the GOP, Democrats have said.“Instead of supporting a plan that would lower costs and stop making health care more expensive, Senate Republicans are blindly following Donald Trump and pushing the country towards a devastating government shutdown,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who chairs Senate Democrats’ campaign organization, said in a Sept. 19 statement.In a press release last week, the Democratic Governors Association touted efforts by its members to call for extending subsidies.“DGA Chair Kansas Governor Laura Kelly, Delaware Governor Matt Meyer, and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham called on Congressional Republicans to extend critical Affordable Care Act subsidies that 22 million Americans rely on and avoid a government shutdown,” the release read. “Without action from Republicans in Congress, health care costs for hardworking Americans who rely on these subsidies will balloon by an average of over 75 percent.”",,,,2025-09-29 19:57:49.820769

Jay Block (R-Rio Rancho), left, and other members of a Republican task force on medical malpractice questioned NM Health Department Secretary Gina DeBlassie and others during a forum Monday. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Two days before a special legislative session convenes to focus on federal cuts to Medicaid in New Mexico, a panel of Republican state senators solicited testimony from doctors, patients and state officials regarding an issue Republicans here say is more pressing: Medical malpractice reform.
The NM Senate GOP’s five-member “Medical Malpractice Legislative Task Force,” in a three-hour forum Monday in Bernalillo, said Democratic leaders in the Legislature need to prioritize reining in the cost of medical malpractice insurance, along with other associated issues. 
“It’s time we change things in New Mexico,” said Sen. Craig Brandt (R-Rio Rancho). “It’s time we make it where our doctors can stay here, so that when we get sick, or our family gets sick, or loved ones get sick, they can be treated here and not have to be flown to another state to survive.”
NM Gov will add vaccine policy to Oct. 1 special session agenda

Republicans in both chambers called on Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Democrats in the Legislature to put medical malpractice on the agenda for the special session beginning Wednesday. But there are no plans to do so.
In particular, Brandt blamed “trial attorneys” in Democratic leadership for blocking progress on medical malpractice. 
Chris Nordstrum, a spokesperson for Senate Democrats, did not immediately respond to Source’s request for comment on that criticism Monday afternoon.
Health Department Secretary Gina DeBlassie was the first to testify Monday. She told the panel that New Mexico’s rate of medical malpractice claims per physician, which has long been above the national average, has grown in recent years.

Between 2020 and 2024, she said, New Mexico’s claims per physician has grown to two to three times larger than neighboring states, including Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Utah. 
New Mexico does not limit the amount a patient can receive in medical malpractice payouts, and it does not cap the amount in fees an attorney can receive. Those and other factors make  New Mexico a “risky” place to be a doctor, said Kaye Green, the CEO of a hospital in rural Roosevelt County. 
According to the National Physician Institute, 248 doctors have left the state in the past five years. Lawmakers and panelists cited that figure repeatedly as evidence of the acute shortage.
And Sen. Jay Block (R-Rio Rancho) mentioned his father, who he said is currently undergoing radiation therapy for prostate cancer. In an exchange with DeBlassie, Block cited his father’s doctor, who told him 15 urologists currently practice in Albuquerque, a city with 560,000 people. But in Durango, Colo., a city of 38,000 just north of the New Mexico border, eight urologists practice, he said. 
The American Urological Association, in a recent report, ranked New Mexico third-lowest in the country in terms of urologists per capita. The report says 60 urologists practice across the state. 
As a result of the shortage, Block said, “We’re talking months before people can get treatment for prostate cancer,” which is a rising threat for men.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_1021-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 19:57:49.820769

Julie Fedorchak said Democrats have the “ball in their court” to prevent a government shutdown. Fedorchak, who hosted a virtual town hall Monday with North Dakotans, said the Republican-led House passed a continuing resolution last week to keep the federal government open past Tuesday night’s funding deadline. “This is something that [[...]","U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., speaks during a virtual town hall on Sept. 29, 2025. (Screenshot from livestream)North Dakota U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak said Democrats have the “ball in their court” to prevent a government shutdown.
Fedorchak, who hosted a virtual town hall Monday with North Dakotans, said the Republican-led House passed a continuing resolution last week to keep the federal government open past Tuesday night’s funding deadline.
“This is something that Democrats have supported in the past,” Fedorchak said. “They are working in the Senate and have some demands that they are asking for.”
Senate Democrats are demanding any continuing resolution to keep the government open would need to extend the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year. Without the tax credits, individuals and families receiving assistance for plans covered under the ACA marketplace could see their premiums increase by thousands of dollars, according to KFF.
The Senate requires a 60-vote threshold to advance legislation. Republicans control 53 seats, which means they will need support from at least seven Democrats or independents.
In an interview with the North Dakota Monitor after the virtual event, Fedorchak said she does not see funding the government and the health insurance subsidies as the same issue.
“I tend to think they are just using this as a cudgel and I strongly believe that we should just pass the clean CR (continuing resolution) like we provided,” she said. “A government shutdown is really damaging to Americans and benefits nobody.”
US Senate Dems push GOP for extension of expiring health care subsidies

If the Senate passes the continuing resolution, Fedorchak said it would lessen the pressure on lawmakers and open up discussions on other issues, such as health insurance subsidies and federal agency budgets passed through the normal committee process.
The North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party on Monday criticized North Dakota’s all-Republican congressional delegation for not extending the Affordable Care Act premium tax credits.
“If Congress doesn’t act, 35,000 North Dakotans will see their health care premiums skyrocket. That’s more than the population of Williston,” said Adam Goldwyn, chair of the North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party, in a statement.
Fedorchak said she does not support stopping the subsidies without a “glide path,” easing the impact of their expiration. She also said the subsidies are part of the reason why health care costs have remained elevated.
In a statement, Sen. Kevin Cramer said Senate Democrats are the only thing standing in the way of keeping the government open.
“To avoid a Schumer shutdown, Democrats should join Republicans in passing the House bill and get back to negotiating more permanent appropriations bills,” Cramer said.
Sen. John Hoeven said members of Congress are already working to address the health care subsidies and accused the Democrats of holding the continuing resolution “hostage.”
“The enhanced health insurance premium subsidies do not expire until the end of calendar year 2025,” Hoeven said in a statement. “These enhanced subsidies were put in place to give additional assistance during COVID, and they need reforms.”
Agriculture policy
Participants in Fedorchak’s virtual forum also raised concerns about impacts to North Dakota farmers due to President Donald Trump’s ongoing trade and tariff war, which has hindered Chinese purchases of American soybeans and may require federal assistance payments to keep those farms afloat.

Fedorchak said Trump’s trade and tariff deals are aiming to correct a trade imbalance.
“Free trade was pretty one-sided in the past,” Fedorchak said. “There is a lot of uncertainty right now. I completely acknowledge that, but we are making progress.”
She said she is hopeful more trade deals will come to fruition in the future, such as Taiwan’s agreement to purchase an additional 25% of American agriculture products. She also said producers should expand to more domestic uses for their products, like biofuels, and encouraged more processing capability, citing the new soybean processing plant in Casselton.
When asked why farmers should get tariff support payments over other industries impacted by ongoing trade disputes, Fedorchak said farmers need to be supported because they lost their markets.
“That’s a pretty significant government impact on their business, so I think the bridge payments to farmers are in order for the immediate crop year,” she said. “There are other industries being impacted, but they aren’t losing their markets.”
Fedorchak said she will continue having virtual forums every six to eight weeks to keep North Dakotans informed on what’s happening in Washington. She also urged participants to sign up for office hours when she is in town. Future office hours will be posted on her official website and social media.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)School districts and county governments face cascading financial impacts as the ongoing state budget impasse starves them of funding, leaders said Monday. 
Lawmakers had a June 30 deadline to pass the 2025-2026 budget. But with September nearly over and the budget 90 days late, school programs and county agencies that depend on state and federal pass-through money are in jeopardy, representatives from the Pennsylvania School Boards Association (PSBA) and County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania(CCAP) said.
“Late budgets come with real impacts,” PSBA CEO Nathan Mains said. “Imagine trying to plan your own personal budget without a complete picture of your income, or trying to pay all of your bills without as much as 70% of your income. That’s the position school districts find themselves in because of this year’s late state budget.”
The partisan deadlock between the Democratic-led House and the Republican-controlled Senate will soon force school districts and counties to borrow money to keep programs running or reduce services. Some have already planned service cuts and hiring freezes starting in October.
Pennsylvania is the only state in the country that has been unable to pass some form of a budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year.
Gov. Josh Shapiro introduced a $51.5 billion spending plan in February that would require about $4.5 billion more than the state was expected to receive in revenue.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Senate Republicans rejected the proposal, pushing for a balanced budget that wouldn’t dip into the commonwealth’s roughly $3 billion surplus or $7 billion rainy day funds. They also rejected a spending plan that passed the House in July that would have cut nearly $1 billion from Shapiro’s proposal.
The Senate approved  a temporary budget in August to allow funding to flow to schools and counties while lawmakers continued negotiations over transit and education funding, two of the major sticking points. House Democrats refused it, saying they wanted a fully negotiated budget instead of a stop-gap. 
CCAP Executive Director Kyle Kopko said that while it’s important for both parties to advocate for their priorities, every budget impasse pushes county governments closer to financial crisis. 
“We can’t normalize the practice of essentially missing a state budget deadline every other year,” he said, noting that 12 budgets in the last 25 have been late. “Without a state budget, many counties will be forced to raise property taxes, cut critical services, or both.”
Armstrong County announced last week that it would stop reimbursements to families providing foster care services, close some of its senior centers and freeze hiring and unnecessary travel.
Westmoreland County commissioners announced employee furloughs and park closures as its budget reserves run out.










Imagine trying to plan your own personal budget without a complete picture of your income, or trying to pay all of your bills without as much as 70% of your income. That’s the position school districts find themselves in.

And Chester County commissioners last week passed a resolution calling on Shapiro and leaders in the General Assembly to “prioritize their responsibilities and work collaboratively to finalize a budget without further delay.” The county will pay its human services contractors only 75% of what they invoice with the remainder to be paid when the budget is passed.
Kopko noted that even after Shapiro signs a budget, it will take six weeks or more for funds to be distributed to the agencies that are waiting.
CCAP has adopted a formal policy position asking Shapiro and lawmakers to support legislation to reimburse counties the costs and interest associated with short-term operation loans which now fall to local taxpayers.
“We cannot allow Pennsylvanians to be punished again simply because the Commonwealth failed to pass a timely budget, as required by law,” Kopko said.
Susquehanna Township School Superintendent Tamara Willis said the need to borrow money creates “double jeopardy” for districts like hers that are preparing to issue debt to build or repair schools.
With no new buildings in 60 years and the fastest growing enrollment in Dauphin County, the district’s schools are stretched to their limits, Willis said. 
“Any disruption or downgrade to our credit rating will increase the cost of that borrowing, making those bonds significantly more expensive,” Willis said.

In the long run, that means the district will have less money to hire teachers, pay for programs and purchase essential classroom supplies, she said. 
“These are the very investments that directly impact student learning,” Willis said. “So let me be clear, this is not a temporary inconvenience. It is a serious threat to both our daily operations and our long term fiscal health.”
Annie Strite, mental health director and administrator for Cumberland and Perry counties, said the impasse also has detrimental effects on the safety net programs that work hand-in-hand with schools and educators to ensure the wellbeing of students and their families.
Noting September is Suicide Prevention Month, Strite said suicide is the second-most common cause of death for children 10 to 14 and third-most common for teens 15 to 18 nationally. 
“It’s imperative the community mental health system collaborate with our education professionals at every level,” she said.
Strite said in the two counties where she oversees mental health services, five elementary school counselors serve 49 schools in 13 districts and helped more than 1,000 students. She recounted a recent case in which a teacher referred a student for academic and behavioral concerns. 
County mental health workers discovered a family in crisis struggling with, homelessness, financial instability, a recent family death and domestic violence witnessed by the student. The county connected the mother with counseling, the student with in-school therapy and the family with food assistance. 
There are thousands  of stories across Pennsylvania that are similar,” Strite said, adding that without intervention, such situations can lead to more costly involvement with child welfare agencies.
“If the budget impasse lingers still longer, difficult decisions will need to be made to stop services and furlough or terminate staff who serve in these roles,” Strite said.
Sherene Shereen Hess, an Indiana County commissioner and CCAP president, said county governments have not fully recovered from the 2015 budget impasse, when the Republican-controlled legislature and Democratic former Gov. Tom Wolf didn’t reach an agreement for nine months.
”We’re mandated to deliver these services, but it’s going to take a financial toll and it takes a toll on folks with stress too, and I see that,” Hess said. “I see that happening on people’s faces every day.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5507-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-29 19:57:49.820769

Free.,‘We’re headed to a shutdown’: White House meeting ends with no deal as deadline nears,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/were-headed-shutdown-white-house-meeting-ends-no-deal-deadline-nears,,"WASHINGTON — Democratic and Republican lawmakers remained far apart Monday with just over 24 hours until a federal government shutdown begins, after a White House meeting with President Donald Trump and congressional leaders meant to spur negotiations.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries emerged from the White House just after 4:30 p.m. Eastern still entrenched in their positions. Democrats are demanding promises to lower rising health care costs, and Republicans are pushing for a “clean” stopgap bill to keep the government running through mid-November.Schumer said he believed “for the first time the president heard our objections,” but “large differences” remained.“It is our job as legislative leaders to try and solve this problem, or at least fix the problem, and we focused in the room in particular on the (Affordable Care Act) and its extension,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, told reporters on Capitol Hill a short time later.Vice President JD Vance, flanked by Thune, Johnson and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, separately told reporters outside the White House, “We’re headed to a shutdown.”“If they want to talk about how to fix American health care policy, let's do it. The speaker would love to do it. The Senate majority leader would love to do it. Let's work on it together, but let's do it in the context of an open government that's providing essential services to the American people,” Vance said.Government funding runs out at midnight Tuesday. If no compromise is reached, hundreds of thousands of government employees would be furloughed, while many would be required to keep working without pay. States Newsroom published a guide explaining what happens.Health care premium increasesDemocrats point the finger to changes made in the recent tax and spending cuts law — commonly referred to as the “one big beautiful bill” — as the reason for rising health care costs.The law allows enhanced premium tax credits for those who use health insurance on the government marketplace to expire at the end of 2025. Republican lawmakers also cut roughly $1 trillion in Medicaid funding over the next decade to help account for the law’s extended and new tax cuts.“We're deadly serious about addressing the Republican-caused health care crisis, because it's a deadly serious issue for the American people — the largest cut to Medicaid in American history, hospitals, nursing homes and community-based health funding closing right now,” Jeffries, also a New York Democrat, said.Health insurance companies on the Affordable Care Act marketplace have requested or finalized price increases of at least 20% in 29 states, according to an analysis released Thursday by U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington state Democrat.All marketplace insurer rate increase requests are publicly available at healthcare.gov.Schumer also pointed to the Trump administration’s impoundment and GOP lawmakers’ rescissions of federal funds, including those for medical research, foreign aid and public media, as another hard line for Democrats.“We made the point clear that how could we negotiate a bipartisan agreement and then have the president unilaterally through impoundment, or the Republican Party through rescissions, and the president unilaterally through pocket rescissions, undo it all without any input,” Schumer said.GOP slams ‘hostage-taking’ in shutdownRepublican leaders accused Democrats of “hostage-taking,” and pointed to a five-year, $50 billion fund for rural hospitals that was tucked at the eleventh hour into the massive tax and spending cuts package to compensate for health care cuts.Thune raised in his hand the GOP’s 24-page temporary funding bill that would keep the government open until Nov. 21 and said he didn’t understand why Democrats are “saying this is some huge partisan thing.”“This is something we do fairly routinely,” Thune, of South Dakota, said of temporary stopgap funding bills. “This is purely and simply hostage-taking on behalf of the Democrats,” he added.Johnson said the House had “done its job” roughly two weeks ago when all Republicans and one Democrat passed the seven-week stopgap funding bill. “That is the record, and don’t forget it,” the Louisiana Republican said.Republicans failed to gain enough Democratic votes in the Senate, which they control with 53 seats, to clear the final hurdle of 60 votes to advance legislation.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — State Superintendent Ryan Walters will submit his letter of resignation from elected office on Tuesday, his senior adviser confirmed, bringing to an end a short but highly scrutinized tenure that divided even his fellow Republicans.
Matt Langston, who also served as Walters’ campaign manager, confirmed the state superintendent will formally step down the day before he is set to begin his new role Wednesday leading an anti-teacher-union nonprofit. His resignation will prompt Gov. Kevin Stitt to appoint a replacement to finish the final 15 months of his term.
Rather than launching a campaign for higher office, as many Oklahomans expected Walters to do, he announced last week that he would step down to become the CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, an organization he said would “destroy the teachers’ unions.”
Walters’ office did not return requests for an interview in his final days in office, but others who spoke with Oklahoma Voice and issued public statements gave mixed reviews of his performance as the state’s public education leader.
The state’s largest teacher union, the Oklahoma Education Association, which Walters once called a terrorist organization, said he will be remembered for “plunging Oklahoma education into its darkest days.”
“We must leave this divisiveness behind and work together as a team with parents and communities by listening to and supporting our students and education professionals,” the union wrote in a statement. “Our public schools can once again become a source of pride and promise for every community in our state.”

Multiple parties and happy hours in Oklahoma City bars and restaurants celebrated his coming resignation, as Democrats and other critics of Walters’ sang the Ray Charles tune “Hit the Road Jack.”
Even among Republicans and in deep-red rural communities, some conservatives said support for Walters has not been unanimous.
In southwest Oklahoma, the chairman of the Stephens County Republican Party, Leon Farris, said he’s unsure his community would reelect Walters if he ran for state superintendent again.
Walters won Stephens County in dominating fashion in the 2022 General Election with 68% of the vote.
Although Walters still has supporters in the area, Farris said some Republicans became disillusioned with the superintendent’s frequent media appearances, believing “he was just running for the next office.”
“We’ve got people that think Ryan hung the moon and are sad to see him go,” Farris said. “We’ve got people that are very disappointed in his performance and are glad he’s gone.”
Local school district leaders, whom Farris described as widely respected conservatives in Stephens County, complained of frequent headaches dealing with Walters’ administration at the Oklahoma State Department of Education, he said.
Not everyone enjoyed seeing Walters at the center of every firestorm, Farris said, but voters in the area still supported his efforts to bring the Bible into public school classrooms, to empower parents, and to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
“That message resonated with Republicans,” Farris said. “Maybe his methodology didn’t resonate as much with everybody as he had hoped it would.”
Walters’ widespread name recognition didn’t always translate into voter support, said the state’s former Republican Party chairman, A.J. Ferate.
Ferate said he heard Walters’ name constantly while knocking on doors for Republican candidates two years ago, far more often than he heard mentions of taxes or abortion issues. 
For voters statewide, particularly in the Oklahoma City and Tulsa areas, the question “How do you feel about Ryan Walters?” seemed to have become a litmus test for other political candidates, he said. Rather than expressing policy differences with Walters, voters seemed concerned with the “combative approach” that he brought to elected office.
Ferate, an Oklahoma City attorney, doubted that those concerns have dissipated.
“I don’t think that it’s gone away,” he said.

However, in northeast Oklahoma, Walters has remained “very popular” among Osage County Republicans, said Jeff Clymer, the county’s GOP chairman.
Some local Republican Party members believed Walters pushed the envelope too much while others didn’t think he went far enough, Clymer said, but many in the community agreed that the state superintendent was too often unfairly attacked.
Walters would have been well received as a candidate for reelection, Clymer said. It’s less clear what level of support Walters would have in Osage County if he joined the 2026 race for governor.
“The most I heard was he should stay where he is and complete the job,” Clymer said. “It won’t matter now, but that’s what I’ve heard in the past.”
Walters gained national attention for his efforts to require public schools to teach biblical stories and for his order that every district’s classroom keep a copy of the Bible. He spent his 33-month tenure in office under constant media attention as he attacked perceived liberal influence and “transgender ideology” while seeking to give religion a greater role in public education.
His resignation prompted a flood of enthusiasm from local and national organizations advocating for church-state separation and LGBTQ+ rights.
“We’re excited for parents in Oklahoma, who no longer have to deal with Walters’ gross politicization of their children’s education,” said Lauren Powell, of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ+ civil rights advocacy group. “We sincerely hope their next superintendent will be more focused on educational outcomes than culture wars.”
However, some expressed excitement not over Walters’ departure, but because of what he aims to do next.
The head of the Oklahoma Republican Party, Charity Linch, celebrated that his new position with the Teacher Freedom Alliance means a “new weapon of words has been unleashed on the liberal machine in education.” 
“Oklahoma will miss him in the state role,” Linch wrote on social media. “Giants must be slain. Davids must go. We are with you, Ryan!”
Walters’ new organization bills itself as a conservative alternative to teacher union membership.
In a news release announcing his hiring, Walters said the organization will “arm teachers with the tools, support, and freedom they need, without forcing them to give up their values.” 
“For decades, union bosses have poisoned our schools with politics and propaganda while abandoning parents, students, and good teachers,” he said. “That ends today. We’re going to expose them, fight them, and take back our classrooms.”

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked the state license of Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Ian Roberts Monday following his detainment and arrest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The Des Moines School Board was scheduled to meet Monday night to place Roberts on unpaid leave following the BOEE decision on Sunday. The school board had met Saturday to put Roberts on paid administrative leave. A news release published Monday from the DMPS school district said the action to place Roberts on unpaid leave after this decision is required by law.
The school board meeting is one of the latest actions in response to Roberts’ detainment. According to ICE officials, Roberts was approached by ICE agents in his vehicle during a “targeted enforcement operation” Friday. The agency reported Roberts was found in possession of a handgun, a hunting knife and $3,000 in cash. He then allegedly attempted to evade arrest, the ICE press release stated, and Iowa State Patrol officers assisted the federal agents in locating Roberts after his vehicle was found abandoned.

Roberts was given a “final order of removal by an immigration judge” in May 2024, according to ICE, after he had come to the U.S. in 1999 on a student visa.
There have been several questions about DMPS’ vetting process for Roberts. Officials with the school district have said they were unaware of the 2024 removal order or that Roberts may have misrepresented himself as a U.S. citizen, though school board president Jackie Norris said the district has not yet been able to independently verify much of the new information shared following his arrest.
School officials have confirmed Roberts completed the I-9 employment eligibility verification form and submitted the required documentation showing he was eligible for employment with the district when hired. In a news release, officials also highlighted that Roberts’ license had been approved by the BOEE in July 2023 and that he had worked in education leadership positions in other U.S. states, including in California, Missouri, and Pennsylvania, for more than 20 years.
At the Saturday board meeting, DMPS associate superintendent Matt Smith was appointed to serve as interim superintendent. On Sunday, Smith sent a letter addressed to families in the school district acknowledging the “difficult time” parents, educators and students in Des Moines schools are facing following the arrest and detention of Roberts. Smith said he was working with Norris, members of the DMPS executive cabinet and school leaders over the weekend to “to process and distribute factual information as it becomes available to us.”
“What we cannot lose focus on is our children,” Smith wrote. “Communities show their identity in times of crisis and the way we respond will make a difference in the lives of the children we love and serve. We all have strong feelings about what we are experiencing, and healthy expression of those feelings is appropriate. But we must remember to move with empathy and self-regulation and know that our children are watching.”
But others have criticized Des Moines school officials for hiring Roberts, who ICE alleged was arrested on a gun charge in Feb. 5, 2020. DMPS officials said they were informed of a firearms offense in 2022 and that Roberts had pleaded guilty to a charge related to having a loaded weapon in his vehicle while hunting. District officials said they were not informed of any other offenses.
The situation has drawn national attention and political fallout.
Samantha Cantrell, regional press secretary for the Senate Republicans’ campaign arm the National Republican Senate Committee criticized Norris, who is running for U.S. Senate in 2026, for hiring “an illegal alien with a rap sheet to be her Superintendent and work with children.”
“Jackie Norris has put every single Des Moines student and family in danger,” Cantrell said in a statement Friday. “Democrats will stop at nothing to protect criminal illegal aliens.”
Norris gave a statement on behalf of the school board Saturday saying she wanted to be clear “about one fact that cannot be ignored: of course, the school district ensured that a background check was conducted before hiring Dr. Roberts. That is done for every person who is hired by the district and periodic reviews are conducted on a regular basis for all current employees.”

The suit is the second the Montana Environmental Info[...],"The Laurel Generation Station power plant in Laurel Montana as seen in September 2023. (Aerial photography by Ed Saunders)Two environmental organizations that have previously challenged the construction of a new power plant are suing the Montana Department of Environmental Quality accusing the state agency of failing to follow the state Supreme Court’s order to consider the station’s impact on human and environmental health.
The suit is the second the Montana Environmental Information Center and the Northern Plains Resource Council have filed on the Yellowstone County Generation Station, and it raises similar issues because it alleges state officials ignored court orders to meaningfully assess the risks to human health as well as address climate change.
The lawsuit leans heavily upon the landmark Held vs. Montana case, and is one of the first to use it in new litigation. The Held case gained national attention by becoming one of the first lawsuits in the country, filed by a group of youth plaintiffs, who said that the Montana Constitution protects a “clean and healthful environment” and that state leaders were derelict in their duty to protect the state’s environment for current and future generations.
The lawsuit filed Monday in Yellowstone County District Court said the DEQ failed to look at how the plant’s emissions would affect the residents and the environment.
The power generation station, which sits approximately 300 feet from the Yellowstone River near Laurel, has been the subject of multiple lawsuits and challenges, as residents have balked at the 18 natural gas generators.  Attorneys for the two groups argue that the plant will contribute much to climate change and increase health risks for Montanans living in the state’s most populated county.
Furthermore, they allege that the state DEQ failed to consider the individual and cumulative effects of the plant, and instead just estimated the amount of pollutants, including carbon dioxide, that would be released without requiring any action to curb the effects.
“The final environmental assessment fails to adequately evaluate the environmental impacts of the Yellowstone County Generation Station’s greenhouse gas emissions despite the Montana Supreme Court’s clear direction to DEQ in January 2025 to consider and disclose such information,” the lawsuit reads.
Earthjustice attorneys E. Lars Phillips and Melissa Hornbein of the Western Environmental Law Center are representing the groups.
NorthWestern Energy, the owner of the plant and the state’s largest public utility, more than doubled its methane-fired electricity capacity when the plant went online. Court records said NorthWestern plans on keeping the plant operational until at least 2057, while emitting 769,706 tons of carbon monoxide year, translating to more than 25 million metric tons during the course of its estimated lifespan.
The lawsuit also outlines how the Montana economy will increasingly feel the effects of climate change, including more wildfires, smoke-related health problems, including respiratory and cardiopulmonary issues. Furthermore, it alleges recreation, agriculture, and tourism will wane, caused by a variety of factors including, “decreased snowpack and water levels in summer and fall, extreme spring flooding events, accelerating forest mortality, and increased drought, wildfire, water temperatures and heal waves.”
Crops are also predicted to suffer.
“Decreasing snowpack is forecasted to lead to decreased streamflow and less reliable irrigation capacity, during the late growing season, which would have the greatest impact on hay, sugar, barley, market garden, and potato producers across Montana,” the lawsuit said. “Increased temperatures are forecasted to allow winter annual weeds, like cheatgrass, to increase in distribution and frequency in winter wheat cropland and rangeland, resulting in decreased crop yields and forage productivity and increased rangeland wildfire frequency.”
The lawsuit also attempts to quantify the costs of the plant by using the Social Cost of Carbon calculator — a tool which helps experts measure the economic cost of carbon.
Using a rate of $190 per ton of carbon dioxide release, the lifetime estimate of the plant’s impact is pegged at $132,078,050.
“The (Montana Supreme) court directed DEQ to evaluate the direct, secondary and cumulative impacts of the Yellowstone County Generation Station,” the lawsuit said. “DEQ’s brief discussion (of) potential mitigation measures, consisting entirely of summary references to geological carbon sequestration, industrial carbon sequestration, and biological sequestration, completely fails to analyze and disclose emissions control technologies and operational limitations that could reduce the (plant’s) greenhouse gas emissions and related climate impacts.”
Nearby residents say they’re already feeling the impacts of the operational power generation station.
“It is deeply disappointing that the Montana DEQ granted NorthWestern Energy an air quality permit based on a flawed and misleading assessment that ignored the daily harms this plant inflicts on Laurel’s community,” said Steve Krum, member of Northern Plains Resource Council and Laurel resident. “Our families see the brown clouds, feel the vibrations, and live with the hidden toxins every day, proof that a full environmental impact statement is required, not a superficial review. This plant should never have been sited in a populated area, and certainly not without constitutional protections for our community’s health and safety.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Methane-Plant3.int_-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-09-29 18:57:32.211636

The former state Senate leader was leading in campaign cash but far behind in the polls. 


Democrat Toni Atkins is dropping out of the crowded 2026 race to succeed Gavin Newsom as California governor, she announced Monday. 
Atkins, the former Senate president, wrote in an email to supporters that she was leaving the race with a “heavy heart” but that “there is simply no viable path forward to victory.” She made the call after failing to poll at higher than single digits, according to a person familiar with the campaign, and does not plan to run for another office in this election cycle.
Atkins launched her campaign more than a year ago in what has become an open field since former Vice President Kamala Harris declined to run this summer. Another early entrant to the race, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, also dropped out in August to run for state treasurer instead.
Newsom terms out next year. At least six other Democrats are running to replace him, including former Rep. Katie Porter, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. The field could still change, with Sen. Alex Padilla also reportedly considering a run.
Atkins had more than $4.2 million in her campaign account this summer, more than any of the other Democratic candidates, had the support of several allies in the Legislature and held a series of town halls throughout the state in August. 
But Atkins faced steep odds in name recognition having never run for statewide office before. She came in third last in an August Politico poll, with just 4% of voters picking her among the Democrats. Leading the pack was Porter with 21% of voters. On Sunday, Atkins did not appear at a Los Angeles candidate forum, reportedly citing illness. 
Atkins supported publicly funded universal health care and was a prominent advocate in the Legislature for increasing housing construction. She would have been the first openly LGBTQ governor in a field of other history-making Democratic candidates.
On the Republican side, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News commentator Steve Hilton are vying for the seat.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/011923-Toni-Atkins-Governor-Campaign-CM-05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-29 18:57:32.211636

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Lawmakers should be careful in their approach to property tax reform and education funding, superintendents from two of South Dakota’s largest school districts said after a panel discussion Monday.
Jamie Nold is superintendent of the Sioux Falls School District, which has the state’s highest enrollment with more than 24,000 students. Jennifer Lowery is the superintendent at Harrisburg School District, the third largest in the state with 6,000 students, and the fastest growing.
“Property taxes are complex, and you can’t have simple solutions without unintended consequences to a complex mechanism,” Lowery said.
The two shared their perspectives with the Downtown Sioux Falls Rotary Club, reacting to ideas generated by lawmakers on the Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force this summer.
The task force is aiming to reduce property taxes for South Dakota homeowners. It’s heard ideas including state government funding cuts that could be redirected toward property tax relief and new sales taxes to replace property taxes.
From property to purchases: Task force considering fundamental tax shift to reduce homeowner burden

One focus of the task force is to analyze education funding’s connection to property taxes. Task force member and House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, said at the last task force meeting that school funding is the number one cost driver of high property taxes because schools are “incentivized” to spend and collect more property taxes. Some task force members, including Odenbach, have expressed interest in simplifying the process by rewriting or adjusting the school funding formula.
During Monday’s panel and in media interviews afterward, Lowery worried that shifting toward sales taxes and eliminating property taxes for schools would disconnect taxpayers from their communities and shift the onus of investing in school infrastructure onto the state rather than local taxpayers.
Lawmakers should continue to study the issue to identify the property tax “breaking point” for different communities, Lowery said, and seek out a more tailored approach to expand property tax relief programs for some South Dakotans, such as elderly and disabled residents.
“How much tax is too much,” Lowery said, “and how much is an investment in your community and school?”
Lowery added that for the first time in two decades, Harrisburg School District is not constructing a new building. The debt for an old project is also paid off, which will decrease the levy used to determine property taxes in the district.

The change comes at the same time as a “small” 1.25% increase in annual state funding for schools and “detrimental” impacts from Gov. Larry Rhoden’s recently adopted property tax relief package, Lowery said. The package sets five-year, 3% annual caps on countywide growth in owner-occupied home assessments and the amount that school capital outlay budgets can increase as a result of new construction, which means districts growing at a higher rate than 3% are losing funds.
“It’s not allowing us to just take care of our general operation needs, such as our roads and parking lots and brick and mortar,” Lowery said. “Growth causes expense.”
Nold, of Sioux Falls, told attendees he doesn’t care what source the funding for the district comes from as long as it “continues to provide the quality services that we do for our kids.” 
The two superintendents are monitoring the property tax discussion, as well as other legislative issues that’ll affect South Dakota education during the annual legislative session that begins in January. Nold added that task force members “don’t have the final say” on property tax reform.
“There will be a lot of other input that’ll take place outside of what was said in that committee, so we’ll see what the final outcome is,” Nold said.

They’ve been formally designated as critical infrastructure, alongside our power grid and water supply. Yet we treat them as an afterthought in our budgets.","IMAGINE THE US GOVERNMENT declared part of our critical national security infrastructure at risk — then offered barely $1 million per state last year to protect it. That’s not a hypothetical. That’s the reality of how we fund elections in America. 
Our elections are the backbone of our democracy. They’ve been formally designated as critical infrastructure, alongside our power grid and water supply. Yet we treat them as an afterthought in our budgets. The system we rely on to uphold the will of the people — to choose presidents, governors, mayors — operates on shoestring funding, especially at the local level where the work of democracy actually happens. 
American elections are intentionally decentralized, with local governments playing the central role. This design keeps elections close to voters and makes large-scale interference harder. But decentralized doesn’t need to mean underfunded. We can have locally run elections and provide the consistent, predictable funding needed to ensure they are free, fair, and secure. 
Elections are so decentralized that we don’t even know precisely how many election jurisdictions exist in the United States. Estimates range from 8,000 to 10,000 — a 25 percent spread that underscores just how fragmented and opaque our system has become.  
Small rural jurisdictions make up most of our electoral system — according to the MIT Election Lab 75 percent of jurisdictions serve just 8 percent of voters — and they are especially vulnerable. In the small Franklin County town of Buckland in Western Mass., with fewer than 1,400 registered voters, the clerk has to conduct her own outside fundraising if she wants to offer food for poll workers or create professional signs to direct voters to the polling location.  
Despite the vital role elections play in sustaining our democracy, the amount America invests in them falls short. MIT estimates it costs $4 to $6 billion annually to run elections properly nationwide — yet that’s about what the federal government has contributed in total over the past 20 years. 
After the 2000 Bush v. Gore recount exposed glaring weaknesses in our voting technology, Congress responded with the Help America Vote Act of 2002, delivering a much-needed injection of $1.5 billion — including $650 million to replace outdated voting machines. But since then, federal funding has been sporadic, reactionary, and far below what’s needed. In recent years, Congress has appropriated just $75 million in 2022 and 2023, and $55 million in 2024 — barely more than $1 million per state. 
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts alone spent the same as the federal government during the 2024 election cycle — but still less than one-tenth of one percent of the state’s overall budget.
​That funding helps cover critical statewide needs like ballot printing and early voting, easing the burden on local officials. Like elsewhere in the country, towns in Massachusetts need to cover the most expensive items like salaries and equipment. That forces small town clerks in places like Buckland – where the annual election budget is just $10,200, or about 0.1 percent of the town’s budget – to be creative to cover basic costs. Nationally, the picture is similar: in the 36 states where counties run elections, elections receive on average around 0.5 percent of county budgets. 
The Edward M. Kennedy Institute and the Robert J. Dole Institute recently convened a bipartisan group of 20 election experts and practitioners and they confirmed: the backbone of our democracy rests on underfunded electoral jurisdictions. They pointed to the dramatic growth in demands on election officials. Now they must manage cybersecurity risks, defend against misinformation, handle record levels of public information requests, and even deal with threats and harassment. All this, with shrinking resources. 
Local election administrators — many part-time, juggling multiple roles — are on the front lines of defending our democracy. In Buckland, for example, the town clerk isn’t just the chief elections officer; she also handles licenses, parking tickets, and more. We are asking these officials to protect a national security asset — our elections — without giving them the tools to succeed. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. We can continue to run elections locally while providing consistent funding, uniform minimum standards, and the resources necessary for security and integrity. It is time for Congress to expand national security expenditures to consistently bolster elections infrastructure. Our democracy depends on it.

Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, appears at an agriculture forum on Sep. 25, 2025,  in Kansas City, Missouri, where he discussed health, trade and the politics of a government shutdown. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said in-person town halls will lead to violence, but he doesn’t plan to stop holding them.
Marshall said he visited 100 sites throughout Kansas in August and made 20 visits last week, though those numbers could not be independently verified and were not exclusive to town halls.
“Right now, doing in-person town halls will lead to violence. I am very fearful that these two groups will assault each other, and I just don’t think it’s a very good idea right now,” he told reporters Thursday following an appearance at the Ag Outlook Forum in Kansas City, Missouri, where he discussed the Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, effort.
However, Marshall said he doesn’t plan to cease holding in-person town halls.
“I’ve never seen such hatred coming out of people’s mouths at President Trump and his agenda,” Marshall said. “I don’t know why people are upset that the borders are safe and the price of gas and groceries are down and the economy’s looking better.” 
His concerns arose after the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an event this month on a Utah college campus. In June, a Minnesota state representative, Melissa Hortman, was killed alongside her husband. In the wake of their deaths, politicians have expressed worry for their safety at public events.
Marshall claimed without evidence that he has had the most town halls of anyone in Congress in the past eight years. He drew controversy this year for walking out of a town hall in Oakley after he was heckled by a standing room only crowd.
A September report by LegiStorm found that Congressional town halls have reached their highest level since 2021 this year, led by Republican U.S. Sen Kevin Cramer with 74 town halls, followed by Oregon’s Democratic U.S. Sens. Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden, with 40 and 37 town halls, respectively.
At the Thursday agriculture conference, Marshall addressed misconceptions about the MAHA movement and his efforts to educate U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on agriculture. He also opined on the potential government shutdown and reasoned that trade cannot be a cure-all for agriculture woes.
“Anyone that’s sitting there thinking — ‘Oh, we got all these trade deals. Done. That’s going to solve all our problems,’ — is amok,” Marshall said during his session with moderator Sara Wyant. She is also the founder and publisher of Agri-Pulse.
He emphasized the importance of converting American crops into protein or biofuel, such as beef and dairy products or ethanol.
Marshall said the looming government shutdown is a matter of politics. He claimed that Democrats want to add excessive costs to the budget and contribute to a bloated national debt. He called the national debt the No. 1 threat to America’s success.
“Until Congress is willing to go on a diet here, we’re going to continue down this road,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250925_marshall1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-29 18:57:32.211636

(Courtesy of the U.S. Department of Justice)The Trump administration is accusing pro-Palestinian groups and several activists of violently disrupting an event at a West Orange synagogue last year in a new civil complaint that offers a starkly different version of events than one proffered by Essex County prosecutors.
The 21-page complaint, filed Monday in federal court, alleges that a “mob” of protestors descended on Congregation Ohr Torah to protest a real estate event and memorial service held there on Nov. 13, 2024, taunted people with antisemitic chants, and assaulted worshippers. Essex prosecutors earlier this year claimed pro-Israel counter-protestors were the aggressors.
Federal officials on Monday said the pro-Palestinian protestors’ actions were intended to interfere with the Congregation Ohr Torah community’s right to freely exercise their religion. They are charging the protestors with violating a law traditionally used to prosecute people who obstruct or threaten abortion clinics.
“The practice of turning a blind eye to these attacks on houses of worship throughout the United States stops now,” Harmeet Dhillon, the head of the U.S. Department of Justice’s civil rights division, told reporters at a press conference. 
Spokespeople for the two groups named in the complaint, Party for Socialism and Liberation in New Jersey and Muslims for Palestine in New Jersey, could not be reached to comment.

They were at the West Orange synagogue that night to protest an event promoting the sale of property in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Such events have sparked protests across the region, with critics alleging the settlements are an illegal impediment to peace.
Monday’s complaint alleges event organizer Moshe Glick intended to host the event in his home but moved it to the synagogue when protestors indicated they would gather outside his house. About 50 protestors assembled at an intersection near his home, then marched to the synagogue when they heard the event had been moved, the complaint says.
Protestors broke through a line of police guarding the event, defied officers’ orders to stop, and marched onto the synagogue’s lawn, where worshipers had gathered, according to the complaint. The protestors blew long, plastic horns called vuvuzelas to disrupt the memorial service, the complaint says.
Two of the protestors — one identified as Altaf Sharif and the other called Jane Doe — walked over to Glick, with the woman then “blowing her vuvuzela directly in Glick’s ear as a weapon,” the complaint says. When Glick pushed the instrument away, Sharif blew his own vuvuzela in Glick’s face, then “charged at Glick,” according to the complaint.
Another worshiper named David Silberberg interceded and eventually pepper-sprayed Shariff, the complaint says, leading one of the other protestors to yell, “The Jew is here” while pointing at Silberberg. Sharif then attacked Silberberg, putting him in a neck hold and then flipping him over and drilling Silberberg’s face into the ground, the complaint says.
The two men tussled, and Glick then “hit Sharif on the head with his flashlight,” according to the complaint.
Justice officials are filing the complaint under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or Face Act. The law was signed in 1994 by President Bill Clinton in response to rising violence targeting abortion providers. Republicans have sought to repeal the law, saying the Biden administration used it to target pro-life Americans.
The Justice Department is seeking a court order barring the defendants from coming within 50 feet of the synagogue or Glick’s home, and from protesting within 500 feet of any place of religious worship during services or events. 
The filing comes as the Trump administration has sought to crack down on anti-Israel protests. Dhillon said this is the first time the Face Act has been used to civilly prosecute an alleged attack on a house of worship.
The federal complaint comes months after Essex County prosecutors filed charges against Flick and Silberberg, accusing them of attacking Sharif. The Bergen Record reported that witnesses alleged Silberberg had been wearing a ski mask that night and appeared to be with the protestors until he pepper-sprayed Sharif.
Prosecutors are seeking a civil penalty against each defendant of more than $84,000 and statutory damages for each person intimidated or prevented from attending the 2024 religious event.
Michael Bachner, Glick’s attorney, said in a statement that his client has “forcibly argued” to Essex prosecutors that the charges he faces are baseless since his actions were in defense of a third party. The prosecutor’s office dismissed the initial indictment but “maintains the legal right to present the charges to another grand jury,” Bachner said.
“Under no circumstances will Dr. Glick be entering a guilty plea to any charge,” he said. “The complaint brought by the Department of Justice recounts what occurred on that tragic day. We are gratified that finally the people who deserve to be brought to justice will be.”
A spokesman for the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office did not respond to a request for comment.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said farmers should continue “making harvest headway” this week with nice weather in the forecast, though “conditions may be a bit dusty.” 
“Combines are rolling all across Iowa,” Naig said in a statement.
Temperatures for the reporting period were 8.1 degrees above the climatological normal, which according to the report, “quickly advanced crop maturity.” 
Across the state, 80% of corn acres have reached maturity, as opposed to 66% the week prior. The percentage of soybean acres dropping leaves jumped from just 62% last week to 83% this week. 
Soybeans rated 55% good and 18% excellent for the week, while corn rated 53% good and 18% excellent. 
Despite a below-normal weekly precipitation average of just 0.41 inch, soil moisture conditions remain mostly adequate. 
Sixty-five percent of topsoil moisture and 70% of subsoil moisture conditions were adequate for the reporting period. Southern regions of the state were slightly drier than the state average, while central and northern regions were slightly wetter. 
In southeast Iowa, according to the report, just 33% of topsoil had adequate moisture, while the majority, 66% of topsoil was short or very short of moisture. 
According to the seven-day precipitation forecast posted Monday by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, Iowa is projected to receive less than half an inch of rain for the week.

Josh Stein addresses members of the media on Sept. 29, 2025, following the shooting at a waterfront bar in Southport, N.C. that killed three people and left five hospitalized. (Photo:  Office of the Governor) “We have got to do better.”
Flanked by state and local law enforcement in Southport, Gov. Josh Stein said North Carolina must have a greater integration between its criminal justice system and mental health care system.
His comments came two days after a mass shooting at the American Fish Company in Southport which left three dead and five hospitalized.
The suspect, 40-year-old Nigel Max Edge, is charged with three counts of first-degree murder, five counts of attempted first degree murder, and five counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury.
Edge was allegedly traveling by boat on the Cape Fear River Saturday evening, paused briefly at the waterfront bar and opened fire, Southport Police Chief Todd Coring said. Shortly after 10 p.m., the U.S. Coast Guard observed an individual matching the description of the shooter, loading a boat at a public boat ramp in Oak Island.
Police say Edge acted alone in a “highly premeditated” attack.
“We understand this suspect identifies as a combat veteran. He self-identifies, injured in the line of duty. He suffers from PTSD,” Coring told reporters on Sunday.
Brunswick County District Attorney Jon David said Edge was known to law enforcement in Oak Island, but less well known in the criminal court system.
“There were some minor contacts over the years, but nothing significant in his past that would give us any indication that he was capable of such horror,” David said.
At Monday’s press conference, Stein said it’s not enough to just know that somebody may be a challenge within a community.
“We then have got to be able to connect that person with the treatment that they need — to address whatever their underlying conditions are,” Stein said.
During a first court appearance Monday, the district attorney said that while Edge had served in the military, he  had “significant mental health issues” and suffered a traumatic brain injury. The DA reiterated that Saturday’s attack on the waterfront was premeditated. Edge makes his next court appearance Oct. 13.
Identifying those who need help before a crisis 
Last week, North Carolina legislators met in Raleigh to pass expansive changes to the state’s criminal justice system, including moves to tighten pre-trial release requirements and streamline the state’s death penalty process.
The Republicans’ plan orders a study on mental health and its intersection with the justice system, but critics note the legislation does not appropriate money or make any specific directives on mental health initiatives and treatment.
Stein said it was unclear at this point in the investigation if a red flag law would have made a difference in the Southport shooting.
“There are people in our community who people know are a risk — a risk to others, a risk to themselves and they should not have firearms,” Stein said. “That’s what a red flag law allows for a judge through due process to simply remove dangerous weapons from people who are a risk. I think that this public will be well-served if North Carolina had a red flag law.”
Legislation was introduced in early April that would have allowed for extreme risk protection orders if a person poses a significant danger of harming themselves or others by possessing a firearm. That bill never received a hearing.
The governor said the vast majority of folks with mental health challenges pose no risk to others. But some can.
“There are too many people in our communities with dangerous obsessions, exhibiting threatening behavior who do pose risks. We have got to do better.”

A prominent advocate for racial justice and impartial policing in Vermont no longer works for the state.
Etan Nasreddin-Longo, co-director of the Vermont State Police’s Fair and Impartial Policing Committee, was removed from the position Friday, sources close to him say.
The Department of Public Safety confirmed Nasreddin-Longo is currently not a state employee and declined to further comment on personnel issues, according to a press release Monday.
“The department’s longstanding commitment to the principles of fair and impartial policing remains unchanged, and the work of the Office of Fair and Impartial Policing and Community Affairs will continue,” the release states.
Mary Gannon, vice president of the Windham County NAACP, said that while many will think of this as a loss for the community — primarily in terms of the fair and impartial policing that he worked and advocated for — it’s more than that.

“The beauty of Etan and his work and his reach is that his work included the queer community, included the immigrant community,” and was very intersectional, she said. 
Nasreddin-Longo’s removal seems particularly ominous, Gannon said, at a time when there is a nationwide assault on equity efforts, including fair and impartial policing.
Regarded by many community members as a champion of equity and fairness in Vermont, Nasreddin-Longo has served on the committee since 2014 and became co-director in 2016.
He has also served on the Vermont attorney general’s Racial Disparities in the Criminal and Juvenile Justice System Advisory Panel but stepped down this year, a spokesperson from that office said.
State Rep. Kevin “Coach” Christie, D-Windsor 6, one of few Black representatives in the Legislature, said people of color in Vermont know that bias in policing persists in the state. Nasreddin-Longo’s presence on the committee and his work to change that “helped turn that dial down.” 
His recent removal, however, sends a very different message, Christie said. “It’s like we’re all better now. We’re fixed. We don’t need it anymore.”
“What does this say about the ‘Brave Little State’ and the exceptionalism we so often claim?” Christie wrote in a social media post last week. “Are we truly committed to fairness and equity, or are we beginning to placate anti-DEI sentiment in response to a shifting political landscape?”
State officials and Nasreddin-Longo did not immediately respond to comment.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Former Rep. RJ May told a federal judge Monday that he used an account under the name joebidennnn69 to send videos of children being sexually abused.
May, acting as his own attorney, signed a plea agreement last week, more than three months after his arrest on charges of sending child sexual abuse videos. Monday’s hearing formally changed his plea from not guilty to guilty, waiving his right to a jury trial.
The West Columbia Republican will remain in the Edgefield County jail until his sentencing hearing, which is scheduled for Jan. 14.
The 38-year-old’s plea agreement applied to five of the 10 videos with which he was charged. Prosecutors agreed to dismiss the remaining five counts. Each count could bring a sentence of five to 20 years, along with a fine of up to $250,000, plus more than $40,000 in other fees. Federal inmates can’t receive parole.
Prosecutors: App linked to ex-Rep. May sent child sexual abuse videos worldwide

A portion of the fine will go to children depicted in the more than 220 videos identified on the Kik account May said he operated. Through other cases, investigators have identified 21 of the 62 children in the videos, said U.S. Attorney Bryan Stirling.
Many of the same videos appear in multiple cases as people trade them around, Stirling said.
“Every download revictimizes these children and fuels this evil industry,” he said.
U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie will determine how much will go to the identified victims, who live worldwide.
A federal probation officer will prepare a report recommending a sentence, but Currie will have the ultimate decision over how much prison time May serves and how much money he owes. Currie will consider the plea agreement, as well as the dismissed charges, when deciding the sentence, she said Monday.
If May leaves prison during his lifetime, he will spend between five years and the rest of his life under supervised release, which requires submitting monthly reports and following other conditions a judge will set at a later date, Currie said.
May will also be required to register as a sex offender. As a felon, he can never again vote or hold public office, Currie said.
After advising May of his rights, including that he would not be able to change his mind, Currie asked May how he wanted to plead.
“Guilty, your honor,” May said.
The 10 videos May was charged with sending, including the five he pleaded guilty to Monday, were “the worst of the worst” of the videos found on the Kik account, depicting “some of the most disgusting and depraved stuff I’ve ever seen or heard about,” Stirling said.
Ex-SC Rep. RJ May to plead guilty to sending child sex abuse videos

Although prosecutors felt they had an overwhelming amount of evidence proving May sent the videos, the plea agreement takes away the unpredictability of a jury, Stirling said.
“This gives a certainty that he pled to five counts, and he will serve time in the federal penitentiary,” Stirling told reporters after the hourlong hearing.
May, wearing the same orange and white striped jumpsuit in which he has appeared in nearly every court hearing, stared straight ahead as Matthews read descriptions of each of the five videos in court Monday.
Under the plea agreement May made with prosecutors last week, he will not be able to appeal, unless he’s arguing the prosecutors engaged in misconduct, if the law changes in any way that would affect him, or if he claims his attorneys were ineffective.
At May’s request, Currie allowed May to rehire his public defenders, who have only been able to answer his procedural questions since he decided to represent himself, for the sake of his sentencing hearing.
May’s trial, which was set to begin Oct. 9, would have chronicled how investigators tracked a tip that an account on messaging app Kik was sending videos of child sexual abuse to the West Columbia home and personal phone of a state representative, prosecutors said. A founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus in the South Carolina House, May resigned in August from the seat representing part of Lexington County.
Jurors would have heard summaries of the videos during the trial, along with testimony from experts on child sexual abuse videos, logs of messages May exchanged with other Kik users and other activity on May’s cellphone and laptop while the videos were being sent, showing he was the one using the devices at the time, said Scott Matthews, an assistant U.S. attorney.
“The user of the phone was doing things RJ May would’ve been doing,” Matthews said Monday.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office is continuing to investigate who was running the accounts with which May exchanged videos, Stirling said, without giving more information.
A special election will determine who replaces May, who was first elected in 2020.
Five Republicans and one Democrat have filed for the race. The GOP primary will take place Oct. 21, followed by a general election Dec. 23.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4071-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-29 17:57:18.001978

The Jimmy Kimmel late-night show returned to Vermont TV screens last Friday after a sudden reversal by Nexstar Media Group. The national company owns the local ABC affiliate station WVNY, branded as ABC22 or MyChamplainValley, which airs Jimmy Kimmel Live!
Earlier last week, ABC’s parent company, Disney, reinstated the show, but both Nexstar and Sinclair Broadcast Group, which own nearly 70 ABC-affiliate stations between them, said they would continue to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live!
Nexstar then had conversations with Disney executives that addressed their concerns, according to Nexstar’s statement announcing the decision to restart the broadcast.
Ultimately, the show was kept off Vermont television for three nights last week, but was available nationwide on Disney-owned streaming platforms.

“As a local broadcaster, Nexstar remains committed to protecting the First Amendment while producing and airing local and national news that is fact-based and unbiased and, above all, broadcasting content that is in the best interest of the communities we serve,” the company said in the Friday statement.
Nexstar’s media spokesperson, Gary Weitman, declined to elaborate further on the matter.
The show was originally suspended by Disney on Sept. 17, following Kimmel’s on-air comments about Charlie Kirk’s killing and amid threats of repercussions from Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees broadcast licenses.
But Disney announced the show would return on Sept. 22 after receiving intense criticism from across the political spectrum, with many people denouncing the decision to suspend the program as an infringement on free speech. Over 400 celebrities supported Kimmel and signed an open letter organized by the American Civil Liberties Union.
Both Nexstar and Sinclair ultimately decided to resume broadcasting the show on Sept. 26, just days after Disney resumed production.
MyChamplainValley’s general manager, Tina Marie Castano, did not respond to a request for comment Monday.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)Ousted London Mayor Randall Weddle has been reinstated to his post following a brief court battle. 
He wasted no time returning to office and led a special-called city council meeting shortly after the ruling.
Circuit Judge David Williams ruled in favor of Weddle returning to the office in a Monday decision. The order said “the London City Council failed to present sufficient grounds” for removing Weddle from office. 
Weddle had appealed an early September decision of the city council to remove him from office. After an hours-long hearing, the council members voted to remove Weddle based on three charges of misconduct and willful neglect, including that the mayor signed a $5 million mortgage for the city without council approval. 
According to court documents, Weddle’s attorney, Carmine Iaccarino, argued that city council members had engaged “in politics and score-settling” when removing Weddle from office “without legally sufficient basis or substantial evidence to support that drastic action.” Iaccarino had previously represented Weddle during the September city council meeting. 
Chris Wiest, who presented the city council’s arguments, wrote in a brief that Weddle’s appeal should be denied and defended the process. Wiest said Weddle “was given notice of the charges against him, several of which were the basis of the removals of other public officers that were upheld by the Kentucky appellate courts, he was given a full public hearing, evidence was adduced under oath, he was permitted to introduce evidence in his behalf, he was permitted to cross-examine witnesses, and where all necessary votes for unanimity” and state law was followed.
At the end of the September council meeting, Tracie Handley was appointed acting mayor. 
Williams, a judge for the 40th Judicial Circuit, was assigned as a special judge in the case filed in Laurel County, following a motion from Weddle’s attorneys. Williams is the former Republican state Senate president. 
Weddle and the city council have had a months-long brawl leading up to the courtroom drama. City Council meetings became public spectacles as the former mayor and the council members argued back and forth about the allegations. Plus, citizens packed meeting rooms to show their support for or opposition to the mayor.
Special city council meetings were set for Monday evening and Tuesday afternoon to discuss local tax rates, with a vote scheduled for Tuesday. 
Weddle led the Monday meeting, seated next to council members. A livestream on the city’s Facebook page had more than 1,000 viewers at the start of the meeting. 
Weddle told city council members he held “no grudges in what you’ve done. 
“Now that you’ve done what you’ve done, and the courts have overturned your ruling, I’m just asking now that you guys start working with me, and I with you, and let’s move the city of London forward,” Weddle said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5111_jpg-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-29 17:57:18.001978

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Researchers and environmental advocates said nuclear energy plants, like the Duane Arnold Energy Center that may restart in Linn County, have environmental, health and economic concerns that other renewable energy projects don’t carry. 
Speaking at a press conference Monday with the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, researchers from across the country said wind and solar energy projects would be cheaper, come online faster and pose fewer risks to Iowan’s health and the environment than reinvesting in nuclear energy sites. 
NextEra Energy, which operated the nuclear facility that began decommissioning in 2020, recently received approval from federal regulators to transfer its grid connection rights from three slated solar projects to the nuclear plant. NextEra is still waiting on several permits and licenses before operations to restart the plant can begin. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, said in the press conference that solar and wind generation are more cost effective than nuclear, and have lower carbon footprints. 
Jacobson said in general, nuclear energy facilities are more costly than wind or solar projects and can take 10 to 20 years to start new projects, while solar and wind infrastructure can be built and online in a fraction of that time.
While nuclear energy is considered a low-carbon form of energy generation, it’s not considered renewable energy since it still relies on uranium as a fuel source.
While Duane Arnold would be a restart rather than a from-scratch project, Jacobson said it “just makes no sense to go backwards into an albatross technology like nuclear.” 
Bill Orlove, a spokesperson for Duane Arnold Energy Center, said in a statement that the possible restart of the plant would help power “Iowa’s growing economy and to help meet America’s surging power demand.” 
Some metrics predict U.S. energy demand could grow as much as 25% by 2030.
Orlove said the plant would contribute 600 megawatts of generation, which fits with the Trump administration’s goal of adding 5,000 megawatts of nuclear energy by 2030.
Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds has also noted nuclear energy expansion as one of her priorities in advancing Iowa’s energy systems. 
Duane Arnold began operations in Iowa in 1975. Orlove said it “operated safely for decades” and provided “reliable energy to Eastern Iowa homes and businesses.” It remains the only nuclear energy site in Iowa.
Safety concerns
Joseph Mangano, the executive director of the Radiation and Public Health Project, a non-profit dedicated to the research of low-level radiation impacts on public health, said proximity to a nuclear power plant can lead to higher rates of cancer, infant mortality and pre-term and low-weight births. 
“In a discussion about what to do with Duane Arnold in the future, one thing has been missing, and that is, what is the effect on the health of people living near Duane Arnold,” Mangano said during the press conference. 
According to statistics Mangano compiled from the Iowa Cancer Registry, rates of cancer in Linn and Benton counties from 1999-2022 were more than 10% above the state average for infants through 39 years old, while rates prior to 1975 when Duane Arnold began operations, were more than 5% below the state average rates. 
Research conducted by Mangano’s organization also found that following the closures of eight nuclear power plants, including Duane Arnold, infant mortality rates declined in the area. 
“The key point here is that these are just early statistics … there should be no final decision on the future of Duane Arnold unless these statistics, and additional ones, (are) thoroughly analyzed and thoroughly understood by officials and shared with the public,” Mangano said. 
Orlove said nuclear plants have “rigorous monitoring protocols” including radiation monitors, to “ensure the safety of employees and the public.” 
“The health and safety of the public is always our top priority,” Orlove said in the statement. “… Highly trained experts run America’s nuclear plants. With the (Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s) oversight and layers of safety precautions, a nuclear plant is one of the safest industrial environments in the United States.” 
Don Safer, a small modular reactors specialist and the co-chair of Sierra Club’s Nuclear Free Team, said in the call that additional safety concerns exist in the operation of the plant. Safer said the risk for serious accidents due to aging and disused reactors pose “a huge threat.” 
Sierra Club report gives Iowa utilities an F for clean energy plans

“About the Dwayne Arnold reactor: restarting it, I can’t say how much of a mistake it would be, how ambitious it is, and how unlikely that they really will be able to get it going again,” Safer said in the call. 
Safer said in addition to the risks of operation, nuclear power plants also generate nuclear waste that has been difficult to find storage for across the country. 
Safer also asserted there is a connection between nuclear power and nuclear weapons. 
“If nuclear power does not exist, nuclear weapons have a lot harder time, even in the United States and the other nuclear weapons countries, of keeping itself going, because that’s not a big enough industry to train people,” Safer said. 
Duane Arnold is not the only decommissioned plant that might restart. Other projects in the works include Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania, which would reopen to power Microsoft data centers; Palisades Nuclear Generating Station in Michigan and Indian Point Energy Center in New York.
Driving this trend, according to researchers is an increase in government funding toward nuclear energy projects, which while initiated under the Biden administration, was protected in the Republican mega-bill that was enacted in July. 
Orlove said restarting the plant is a “serious undertaking.” 
“We have a dedicated team working diligently to pull together all the necessary pieces to return Duane Arnold Energy Center to service,” Orlove said. “The plant’s possible restart will bring millions of dollars in revenue to the county, the Cedar Rapids Community School District and other districts to fund critical programs and services for residents. It would also bring hundreds of permanent, high-quality, well-paying jobs to the area.” 
Many locals, labor unions and communities welcome the economic benefits anticipated with the plant reopening, the Cedar Rapids Gazette reported.
Wally Taylor, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter’s conservation and legal chair, opposed the restart of the plant, which he lives near, and said Iowans “should not let that happen.” 
“Nuclear power is not the answer to our 21st century energy needs,” Taylor said.

Contents of the analysis were first reported by WPRI-12. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson said late Monday afternoon they were “deeply troubled by the findings” of the audit, which identified decades worth of failures by the state and its contractors responsible for maintaining the westbound span of Interstate 195.
“Rhode Islanders who rely on the Washington Bridge have had their daily lives disrupted for too long,” Shekarchi and Lawson said in a joint statement. “The General Assembly intends to conduct an additional rigorous oversight hearing.”
Their statement did not indicate when a hearing would happen, but Lawson and Shekarchi promised “all options remain on the table” such as putting state officials, including Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) Director Peter Alviti Jr., under oath.
McKee’s office acknowledged multiple requests for comment from Rhode Island Current, but did not send an official response as of 5:20 p.m.
Lawmakers from the House and Senate oversight committees last met on Feb. 13, but couldn’t press for accountability then because of the state’s ongoing lawsuit. 
Rep. Patricia Serpa, a West Warwick Democrat who chairs the House Committee on Oversight, said she believed the decision to withhold the report was worthy of a hearing.
“It just blows my mind that this report existed all of this time, and no one disclosed it,” Serpa said in an interview Monday. “What the actual hell is going on here?”
Serpa’s Senate counterpart Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, did not immediately respond to request for comment. Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz, a North Smithfield Republican, said in a statement she is convinced that an oversight hearing is the only way to get the truth from the governor and RIDOT officials about the Washington Bridge.
“If the executive branch is not held accountable, Rhode Island will remain at the bottom of every infrastructure ranking, and the Governor’s promised ‘day of reckoning’ will be a pledge as empty as taxpayers’ wallets,” de la Cruz said.
While the new report could invite further questions, Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, said he’s unsure how cooperative McKee’s administration will be.
“I haven’t seen any attempt to have a public reckoning or accountability from the DOT or the executive,” he said.

The forensic report is dated April 5, 2024 — three days after McKee indefinitely postponed its release in order to conduct its own public records request for the audit. 
Timothy Rondeau, spokesperson for the AG’s office, said WJE produced the report for defendants in the state’s case as part of the discovery process. It was posted publicly after the office learned an “unknown party” was releasing portions of it on Instagram, he wrote in an email to Rhode Island Current Monday afternoon.
“It has never been our intention, nor do court rules anticipate, releasing discovery materials publicly prior to trial,” Rondeau wrote.
WJE’s audit does not single out one party for the bridge’s sudden failure. Instead, it faults all those responsible for the highway’s condition — including state officials — for not recognizing the bridge’s problems before the emergency closure.
“Greater attention needed to be paid to the importance of the post-tensioning systems in overall structural performance and stability of the bridge,” the report states. “The deteriorating condition of the cantilever beams and corbels was clear.”
It’s a stark contrast to McKee’s message that contractors who worked on the bridge in the past two decades are the sole entities responsible for the bridge’s failure — a point his critics were quick to seize on.
“If you read this report in any detail, it’s obvious that what they’ve been telling you time and again has not been true,” Kansas-based geotechnical engineer and Kansas-based Casey Jones, who regularly posts YouTube videos about infrastructure topics including the Washington Bridge, said in a video posted Saturday. “They’ve done it for political reasons — it’s unfortunate because this should strictly be the realm of engineering.”
Locally, Rhode Island GOP Chairman Joe Powers called the decision to keep the report private a “political betrayal” from the governor.
“Our state leaders knew the bridge was failing for years, yet they kept Rhode Islanders in the dark while thousands of lives were put at risk every single day,” Powers said in a statement Monday. “We deserve leaders who will confront hard truths, not bury them.”
Former CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes, who is challenging McKee in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary, said in a statement Monday that Rhode Islanders “deserve honesty and transparency.”
“Every day, Rhode Islanders are stuck sitting in traffic caused by the Washington Bridge debacle,” Foulkes said. “Governor McKee should immediately explain why the forensic audit was not released and provide clear answers to the decisions and actions of his administration.”
She called for Alviti to be fired as the state’s transportation chief and for the General Assembly to hold oversight hearings.
The westbound Washington Bridge is expected to be rebuilt by November 2028 and cost up to $427 million. Chicago-headquartered Walsh Construction Company was awarded the state’s contract on June 6 after two attempts by Gov. Dan McKee’s administration to secure a bridge builder.
The state’s lawsuit is scheduled to head to trial in late 2027.

Karl Ebbighausen, now retired from the southern Vermont police department, entered into an agreement approved by the Vermont Criminal Justice Council that results in the permanent revocation of police certification.

A now-retired Hartford police lieutenant facing allegations of sexually harassing “a number of persons” has had his law enforcement certification permanently revoked.
The Vermont Criminal Justice Council approved an agreement this month with Karl Ebbighausen that included the action, according to Christopher Brickell, the council’s executive director.
The revocation of Ebbighausen’s law enforcement certification was “effective immediately,” the agreement stated. 
The council received a complaint against Ebbighausen in June, the document stated, and the matter was sent to the council’s Professional Regulation Subcommittee for review.
Between July 2022 and March 2025, Ebbighausen allegedly “sexually harassed a number of persons who worked closely with the Hartford Police Department,” according to the agreement.
“The Subcommittee determined that the facts established by the investigation of the complaint supported a finding of unprofessional conduct,” the document stated.
As part of the agreement, Ebbighausen “acknowledges that if this matter were to proceed to a contested hearing, the State could prove” that he engaged in prohibited conduct.
“In the interest of resolving this matter,” the document stated, Ebbighausen and the council reached the agreement, avoiding a hearing before the full council. 
The panel then posted a public notice of the “Stipulation and Consent Order” on the organization’s website.
Ebbighausen could not be reached for comment. 
Ebbighausen, who retired from the Hartford Police Department earlier this year, had worked for three decades in law enforcement.
The permanent revocation of Ebbighausen’s certification in Vermont will be added to national law enforcement databases. 
He will also have to provide a copy of the consent order in this case to any “law enforcement agency to which he makes application for employment” in “any location or jurisdiction where he may apply,” according to agreement.

(Photo by mihtiander/Getty Images)As the clock ticks closer to 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday morning, Utah state officials are bracing for a looming government shutdown that could have widespread impacts on federal workers and programs across the nation. 
State officials have been scrambling to prepare for the shutdown that will take place overnight unless Republicans and Democrats in Congress reach an agreement on a stopgap spending bill before the deadline. While the Utah Office of Tourism says it’s “committed” to keeping Utah’s national parks “protected, open and accessible” during a shutdown — prepared to use state funds if necessary to continue at least some services — it’s urging the federal government to approve federal funds to support park operations. 
Hundreds of thousands of federal employees face furloughs under Trump shutdown plans

Meanwhile, the Republican supermajority controlling the Utah Legislature in both the House and Senate issued firmly worded letters to congressional leaders urging the U.S. Senate to “immediately pass a clean short-term funding extension to prevent a government shutdown that would harm hardworking Americans across our states.” 
“With the September 30 deadline days away, the Senate must fast-track the clean extension the House passed with bipartisan support,” says the letter signed by Utah House Republicans to both majority and minority U.S. leaders, dated Friday. 
“Holding government funding hostage is not a political game — it carries real, immediate consequences in every state,” Utah House Republicans wrote. “A shutdown would withhold pay from troops, first responders, and firefighters, disrupt vital services for seniors and veterans, and cut off food assistance for struggling families. These avoidable disruptions would inflict severe harm on the American people.” 
Utah Senate Republicans signed a similarly phrased letter dated Sunday, urging the U.S. Senate to support “a solution on the table that Senate Democrats should support, after all they did vote for this funding extension just six months ago.”
“The clean funding extension provides stability for our military service members, veterans, and their families, as well as the continuity of low-income assistance programs,” Utah Senate Republicans wrote. “Allowing a shutdown would consequently and needlessly disrupt our economies, threaten public safety, and undermine public confidence in our institutions. Our families and communities would feel the pain with immediate effect and confusion.”

They added that a government shutdown is “neither sustainable nor a responsible way to govern and the American people understand that.” 
“That is why we are calling on Senate Democrats to fulfill their duties, put their politicking behind, and do what’s best for the country: keep the government open,” the Utah Senate GOP’s letter continues. They added that there is “no path forward” for Democrats’ “nearly $1.5 trillion wish list,” which includes a proposal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies and provisions to roll back Medicaid restrictions in the “big, beautiful” law. 
In addition to signing on to the letter, one of Utah’s top Republicans, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, issued a prepared statement urging Congress to “act without delay” to pass the short-term funding extension. 
A federal government shutdown is nearing. Here’s a guide for what to expect.

“We strongly urge the U.S. Senate to put the country’s interests above politics and keep the government open,” Adams said. “The American people deserve leadership that prioritizes good governance over partisan gamesmanship.”
How will Utah’s ‘Mighty 5’ national parks be impacted?
The Utah Office of Tourism said in a statement issued Monday that “we are committed to keeping Utah’s parks, monuments and outdoor recreation experiences protected, open and accessible.”
“Our priority is to do right by visitors who have planned trips of a lifetime from all over the world to experience our national parks, as well as by Utahns and communities whose livelihoods depend on a healthy visitor economy,” the statement said. 
Utah’s national parks — Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef and Zion — generated about $3.1 billion in visitor spending for the state’s economy in 2024. 
“If the federal government does not provide an adequate solution, Utah stands ready to offer strategic state support to keep our parks open and accessible to all,” the statement said. 
Anna Loughridge, spokesperson for the Utah Office of Tourism, told Utah News Dispatch on Monday morning that some state funding has been set aside to help keep the parks open and fund a limited scope of services in the event of a government shutdown, but she didn’t have a specific number of how much state funding would be available, saying the situation “continues to evolve day by day.”

“Our primary focus is there are federal funds that should be able to support park operations,” she said. “We are committed to being a part of a solution and shaping a Utah that lasts. So ultimately, what we are doing is advocating for federal dollars to fund park operations. If that is not able to happen, then Utah does stand ready to offer strategic support to ensure that parks stay open and accessible.” 
It all depends on whether any federal funds do become available, but Loughridge said a government shutdown has the potential to impact park services like visitor centers, shuttles and custodial services.
“So who’s emptying trashes, cleaning bathrooms?” she said. “So many of those things that impact the visitor experience and, of course, are also sometimes a health and safety consideration.” 
Asked if there are risks of any national park workers getting furloughed in Utah, Loughridge said “that is a question for the federal government.” She said there are “still a lot of unknowns.” 
As of Monday afternoon, the Interior Department was on a list of federal departments that had not yet posted an updated contingency plan on its website to deal with the shutdown, according to States Newsroom’s Washington D.C. bureau. 
 What about other Utah programs?
Utah’s national parks may be the first to feel widespread impacts if the federal government goes dark, but other state programs that rely on federal funds could also be negatively impacted depending on how long the shutdown lasts. 
The Utah Department of Workforce Services — which has a wide range of social programs under its umbrella, including assistance for food, child care, Medicaid, and unemployment assistance — doesn’t expect immediate fallout, however. 
“With the possibility of a federal government shutdown this week, we don’t anticipate immediate impacts to our SNAP, Medicaid and child care assistance customers in the month of October,” a department spokesperson said. “In the event of an extended government shutdown, funding for these programs will likely be impacted.”

What about the Salt Lake City International Airport?
While airports typically continue to function under government shutdowns, officials warn it could bring longer security lines or other delays. 
Transportation Security Administration workers will continue to work — but with delayed pay — during a shutdown. According to the Department of Homeland Security’s updated contingency plan, 61,197 of TSA’s total 64,130 workers would be retained during a shutdown. 
Salt Lake City International Airport spokesperson Nancy Volmer told Utah News Dispatch on Monday that airport leaders will “partner closely” with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Federal Aviation Administration, and TSA “to ensure passengers reach their destination safely and efficiently.” 
Those workers will continue to work at the Salt Lake City airport in the event of a shutdown, Volmer said. During the last shutdown, the airport “supported these workers, however we could, with a food pantry, for example.” 
“We will look forward to supporting these workers again but would also ask that passengers be patient and understanding of the challenges these front line workers are facing,” Volmer said.

State records indicate that in October 2013, Mackenzie McCarroll was awarded an Iowa massage therapy license and subsequently began practicing in Cresco.
In July 2022, and again in January 2024, the Board of Massage Therapy fielded complaints that McCarroll had been hired to provide massage therapy services for hospice clients of Regional Health Services of Howard County, and that four clients receiving in-home care had reported missing morphine medication.
According to the board, its investigation revealed probable cause to believe McCarroll, now 32, had taken the drugs and had admitted to the theft of morphine from at least one of the clients. On Nov. 1, 2022, McCarroll was placed on the state’s dependent adult abuse registry as a result of the alleged thefts.
The board says its investigation also revealed probable cause to believe McCarroll suffers from substance use disorder and other mental health conditions, with her last inpatient treatments occurring in May 2023 and January 2024, and that she had been involuntarily committed for substance abuse issues in the past.
On Nov. 17, 2024, the board alleges, McCarroll was convicted of operating a vehicle while intoxicated, but then failed to report the conviction to the board as required. The board alleges she also failed to report her involuntary committal.
The board recently charged McCarroll habitual intoxication or addiction to the use of drugs, obtaining or possessing controlled substances without lawful authority, and failure to notify the board of a criminal conviction.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma CareerTech plans to ask state lawmakers for an additional $68 million in its budget to expand workforce training, technology centers and career exploration programs.
The CareerTech board on Monday unanimously approved a more than $244 million request for the 2027 budget year, up from the agency’s current $175.5 million appropriation. CareerTech provides training and skills education. 
Director Brent Haken said the request is “bold and aggressive.” 
It includes $31.6 million for increased investments in workforce training in hopes of increasing program enrollments by 10,000 students over the next five years. 
Haken said the agency has requested the same amount for workforce training multiple times in past years, and CareerTech was appropriated $10 million of its $41.6 million ask for the current budget year. This year’s request is the remaining amount in an effort to stay “consistent.”
The board also wants a $20 million appropriation to expand career exploration services at technology centers, which includes reaching out to younger students to inform them of what programs CareerTech offers. Haken said he plans to use $3 million of this to provide an apprenticeship coordinator at every technology center in the state. 
The agency will make a one-time request of $10 million to expand technology centers to areas of the state not being served. 
This funding is used as a one time incentive for schools to “jump start” their CareerTech programming ahead of funding through voter-approved ad valorem tax dollars being available. 
“It jumpstarted that service, where they have four programs already in before they were getting tax dollars for that,” Haken said. “So it showed your people, your patriots, that voted on that ‘We’re gonna do what we said we were gonna do.’ And so you don’t have to wait. Your kid’s a senior or junior, they still have an opportunity.”
Another $5.5 million would develop new K-12 programs. A previous appropriation was successful in creating more than 200 programs across the state, Haken said, and the agency wants to continue that work. 
Haken will present the budget request to state House and Senate members and Gov. Kevin Stitt at a later date.

For the second time in recent years, a Vermont court has appointed an independent manager for Our House Residential Care Homes due to state findings of abuse, neglect and other care concerns.

A Superior Court judge appointed an independent manager to oversee the operations of three Rutland City elder care facilities earlier this month, after approving the state’s request for receivership in July. 
The decision, which cited reported abuse, neglect and chronic staffing shortages, marks the second time in less than five years that a court has appointed a receiver for those facilities. The violations that prompted the appointment also led the Vermont Attorney General’s Office to resume seeking $40,000 in earlier fines from the residential care homes’ owners. Those fines had been previously suspended under a 2022 settlement agreement.
The three facilities —- Our House, Our House Too and Our House Outback  —- are operated by Inn-One Home LLC, which does business under the name Our House Residential Care Homes. Together the facilities located east of Route 7 in Rutland are licensed to provide 35 beds, according to the Department of Disability, Aging and Independent Living.
The three facilities are designated as Level III residential care group-living homes. That means they serve people who cannot live independently and require as-needed help with daily activities but who do not require full-time nursing care. 
Owned by Paula and Pasquale Patorti, the company has a history of health, safety and care violations at its facilities stretching back to 2016, according to the original civil complaint filed May 23. Department Commissioner Jill Bowen brought the case with legal counsel by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office.
The department levied two counts against Our House under state statute on the regulation of long-term care facilities, due to substantial, habitual violations detrimental to resident welfare and situations that caused “imminent danger of death or serious physical or mental harm to residents.”
Washington County Superior Court Judge Benjamin Battles appointed Judy Morton on Sept. 9 as the independent manager — or receiver — of the three Our House long-term care facilities in Rutland City.
Morton is the administrator of the Thompson House Nursing Home in Brattleboro, and was selected due to her relatively reasonable hourly rate and “extensive experience working the long-term residential care industry in Vermont generally” and with the department, according to the receiver appointment order signed by Battles. Morton was not immediately available for comment.
“The primary concern that led the court to appoint a receiver in this case is a pattern of regulatory violations, primarily related to staffing and training, that posed risk to the welfare of defendants’ residents,” Battles wrote.

Verbal and physical abuse
According to the state’s lawsuit, first reported on by Seven Days, the Department of Disability, Aging and Independent Living substantiated evidence that the on-site facility manager for Our House Too allegedly verbally and physically abused a resident in April. 
Two teen staff members observed the manager, Dexter Agasi, yelling profanity like “Shut the fuck up,” throwing a chair and pressing his fingers into the neck of a resident who refused nail care, according to court documents. Agasi then wheeled the resident — who had cognitive impairment and earlier experiences of being abused — into their room and closed the door, and the staff members heard the resident crying “help” and “no,” court documents stated. The staff members reported the situation to Paula Patorti, who told the staff members Agasi knew how to calm residents through “pressure points,” according to court documents. 
After other staff members reported the incident to the state, Agasi was still working on-site when department representatives visited Our House Too on Allen Street in Rutland. During the visit, Patorti told the state inspectors that she did not think the situation rose to the level of abuse warranting a state report, according to court documents. 
The department banned admissions to the elder care home until the facility manager was removed and requested an immediate corrective action plan, department spokesperson Rebecca Silbernagel wrote in an email.
Agasi currently faces two criminal charges related to assault and abuse of a vulnerable adult, to which he pleaded not guilty in June.
At Our House Outback on Mussey Street, the department found residents to be in “immediate jeopardy” due to repeated staffing scarcity, with only one staff member being regularly present at the facility overnight, according to court documents. 
Lack of staffing led to residents not having physical assistance and movement aid for personal care needs including going to the bathroom, causing residents to be “‘double-briefed’ overnight in lieu of being provided more regular toileting,” according to the Battle’s ruling granting the state’s request for a receiver in July.
The department found “actual harm” to Our House Outback residents in March as a result of the “continued pattern of understaffing resulting in violations of resident dignity and skin breakdown due to neglect,” according to the May complaint. The home’s operator disputed the accusation of chronic understaffing causing residents skin impairment, according to the July ruling. 
At the third facility, Our House, on Jackson Avenue, the department found the home had previous regulatory deficiencies related to lack of staff, adequate training, written policies and facility maintenance.
Our House’s fourth facility, Our House Park Terrace, was shut down due to a dearth of staffing in November of last year and residents were moved to the other three Our House facilities. The lack of adequate warning for resident input on the relocation violated state regulations and caused confusion for the department, residents and residents’ representatives, according to court documents.
Our House’s attorney Antonietta Girardi Dutil was not immediately available for comment. 
Silbernagel, of the Department of Disability, Aging and Independent Living, wrote that receivership will remain in place until ended by the court, and the three facilities are still subject to the state’s regulatory requirements during the receivership.
Settlement reopened
This is not the first time Our House elder care homes landed in hot water with the state due to care concerns in recent years. 
The Our House facilities were placed under court-ordered short-term receivership in 2021, and entered a three-year settlement with the Vermont Attorney General’s Office’s Medicaid Fraud and Residential Abuse Unit in 2022 due to persistent problems with abuse and neglect. Our House was required to rectify these concerns, or pay $40,000 in damages and penalties. 
Amerlia Vath, a spokesperson for the Office of the Attorney General, wrote in a statement Thursday that the office’s Medicaid Fraud and Residential Care Abuse Unit is now seeking the total $40,000 from Our House due to the violations found by the state in recent months, even though the settlement had expired and the office had previously not sought to collect any fines.
In May, Our House paid $10,000, but failed to pay the remaining $30,000 by the Aug. 29 deadline, Vath wrote. Patorti then paid $3,000 and asked for a yearlong payment plan, but stopped responding to the Attorney General’s Office after its counter request for a six-month payment plan. Since then, the office has contacted the receiver for the outstanding $27,000 owed, Vath wrote. 
Kaili Kuiper, the state’s long-term care ombudsman with Vermont Legal Aid, said her office was not directly involved in the case, but that ombudsmen will continue to have a presence in the facilities to monitor resident care. Receivership is an important tool for the state to take over managerial and financial control of a facility to ensure the necessary services are being provided to residents at Vermont’s long-term care facilities, Kuiper said. 
“I really think this is an example of the state regulatory process working as it should,” Kuiper said. “It was clearly an issue, and the state stepped in.”

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said Monday he does not see a legal option for suing the state of South Dakota over that state’s eminent domain law regarding carbon dioxide pipeline projects. 
Wrigley had made comments on a Fargo-based radio station earlier this month that he felt a South Dakota law enacted earlier this year may infringe on interstate commerce and was researching possible legal action. 
“Our conclusion has been that there is not, at this time, a legal avenue available to us,” Wrigley told the North Dakota Monitor on Monday. 
Carbon pipelines have become a hot political topic in the two states in recent years as Iowa-based company Summit Carbon Solutions seeks to build a multi-state pipeline to capture carbon emission from ethanol plants. Summit plans a network of pipelines that would send the CO2 to an underground permanent storage area in western North Dakota. 
Summit has obtained pipeline route and storage permits in North Dakota. South Dakota has thus far denied Summit a route permit and the South Dakota Legislature passed a law making it harder for CO2 pipeline companies to obtain easements from landowners. 
North Dakota AG considering legal action over South Dakota eminent domain law

The South Dakota law, signed in March by Gov. Larry Rhoden, forbids companies such as Summit from using the legal tactic of eminent domain to force landowners to provide right-of-way for a carbon pipeline. 
Wrigley called the South Dakota legislation “a bad policy choice” and a “hostile act” against North Dakota in an interview with Scott Hennen on WZFG, The Flag, based in Fargo. 
South Dakota political leaders defended the legislation after Wrigley’s comments circulated, saying its Legislature was standing up for the property rights of citizens.
Wrigley, who voted for Summit’s CO2 sequestration permit as a member of North Dakota’s Industrial Commission, did not mention Summit in the interview. 
The main trunk of Summit’s pipeline would run through South Dakota. 
Opposition to Summit pipeline fueled by ‘horseshoe politics,’ on left and right, panelists say

Last week, David Owen, president of the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce before retiring earlier this year, told a panel at the Greater North Dakota Chamber’s annual policy summit that the idea Summit could route its pipeline through South Dakota without eminent domain was a “fantasy.” 
Summit recently has been trying to alter the terms of its pipeline permit in Iowa. It has obtained a permit for a small section of its route in Minnesota, which also does not allow eminent domain for CO2 pipelines. Nebraska does not have a state agency with authority over carbon pipelines. 
Wrigley on Monday also highlighted North Dakota’s role in siding with property owners on an eminent domain case with the U.S. Supreme Court. North Dakota and South Dakota were among 12 Republican-led states that earlier this month filed a friend-of-the-court brief taking the side of landowners as they seek to be reimbursed for legal fees after winning a court battle with an energy company. 
“There’s a lot of interest in pipelines and transmission lines, things that impact private property rights,” Wrigley said. “I am a strong private property rights advocate.”

Dan McKee is taking more hits to his job approval rating in the latest poll out Monday, Sept. 29, 2025, from the University of New Hampshire. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode island Current)Gov. Dan McKee can’t score a win with Rhode Islanders, with seven in 10 people disapproving of his job performance and almost as many saying he does not deserve to be reelected, according to results of a University of New Hampshire (UNH) survey published Monday.
The Ocean State Poll out of the UNH Survey Center surveyed 737 residents, including 666 likely general election voters. It comes two weeks after a separate University of Rhode Island survey showed equally unfavorable ratings for the incumbent Democratic governor. The UNH survey also suggests more Democratic voters prefer McKee’s Democratic rival, former CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes, over him in a hypothetical 2026 gubernatorial primary, though most voters remain undecided.
McKee faces backlash for keeping Washington Bridge forensic audit secret for over a year

The margin of error in the survey overall was 3.6%, though questions specific to Democratic primary voters have a 5.9% margin of error.
“Rhode Islanders don’t need more political jockeying — they need results,” Christina Freundlich, a spokesperson for McKee’s reelection campaign, said in an email Monday. “Governor McKee is laser-focused on fighting for Rhode Island working families and standing up to extremism in Washington. That’s the kind of leadership that delivered fewer school absences, reduced overdose deaths, and strong economic growth to our state over the last four years — and that’s why Rhode Islanders can count on him to keep delivering in the years ahead.”
Foulkes took a swipe at McKee hours before the survey was published, accusing him of “failing to meet the minimum threshold” for honesty and transparency about the Washington Bridge failure. A state-commissioned audit report completed more than a year ago but only released publicly on Friday documents decades of structural problems with the westbound highway that state officials either overlooked or outright disregarded.
Jon Romano, a spokesperson for Foulkes’ campaign, again pointed to the Washington Bridge in a response to the poll results Monday afternoon.
“It’s no surprise that when our state leaders fail to handle our biggest challenges, the most glaring example being the Washington Bridge, Rhode Islanders are frustrated and fed up” Romano said in an email. “Rhode Islanders deserve competent leadership and shouldn’t settle for less. Helena will fight for every vote and restore trust in government.”
The UNH survey, conducted from Sept. 17 to 23, queried residents before the audit was released. Even before the damning report, more than a third of survey participants who disapproved of McKee’s job performance cited his handling of transportation and infrastructure — the top complaint, followed by poor leadership, named by 12% of disapproving voters.
Other recent polls more directly tie McKee’s poor approval ratings to the Washington Bridge problems: six in 10 survey participants in the recent URI poll said McKee was “highly” or “somewhat” responsible for the crisis, while more than eight in 10 of those who participated in a separate July survey by the Pell Center at Salve Regina University did not believe the reconstruction of the westbound highway would be finished on time and on budget.
Foulkes, who lost to McKee by 3 percentage points in the 2022 Democratic gubernatorial primary, has centered her second campaign around McKee’s handling of the Washington Bridge. In her Sept. 9 kickoff event, Foulkes suggested that Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr. should be fired. McKee has fended off questions about Alviti’s responsibility for the infrastructure meltdown despite outrage from voters.
And the winner is: undecided
Foulkes’ strategy gave her a preliminary leading edge, with more than one-third of likely Democratic primary voters backing her in a hypothetical 2026 primary matchup against McKee, who drew support from under one-fifth of those surveyed. However, four in 10 survey participants were undecided or did not know who they would choose, while 6% had someone else in mind.
Widening the prospective September 2026 ballot to include House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, Foulkes’ remained the most popular of the three. But the 16% of Democratic voters with a favorable opinion of Foulkes — compared with 13% each for McKee and Shekarchi — fell within the margin of error. And again, the bulk of survey respondents appeared unsure, or neutral about all three. Notably, McKee had the largest chunk of unfavorable opinions — leading to a “net favorability” of negative 49 — compared with net ratings of negative 6 apiece for Foulkes and Shekarchi.
“I believe the University of New Hampshire poll confirms what other polling is showing at this time: that this is a wide open race for governor with the majority of voters yet undecided,” Shekarchi said in an emailed statement Monday. “As Speaker, I’m focused on the important issues facing Rhode Islanders, such as housing, health care affordability, jobs and the economy.  I have yet to make any decision on my political future.  However, I am encouraged by the poll results considering I have not run statewide for public office. I do believe a great many voters recognize the accomplishments I’ve made on behalf of Rhode Islanders.”
Despite Shekarchi’s influential role on Smith Hill as House speaker and sizable war chest — $3.8 million cash on hand as of June 30, the largest of any state official — half of voters surveyed don’t know enough about the Warwick Democrat to sway their thoughts about a potential governor run. Roughly 13% of survey participants overall “definitely,” or “probably” want Shekarchi to throw his hat in the ring, up to 18% among Democratic voters.
Monday’s poll is the first to gauge voters’ sentiments on a Shekarchi gubernatorial run.
A troubling pattern
But McKee’s standing among residents has been documented through countless surveys spanning his time in office, including by UNH in multiple editions of its Ocean State Poll. Two years ago, nearly half of voters surveyed by UNH approved of McKee’s job performance, but his favor plunged soon after, and has remained at or below 30% over the next 10 editions of the UNH Ocean State Poll. Most troubling for the governor, according to the poll, is the opinion among members of his own party: 36% of Democrats surveyed approve of his job performance — a slight improvement from 27% when the poll was last conducted in May. Roughly one in 10 Republican and independent voters, respectively, approve of his job performance. 
The survey also asked participants to weigh in on another term for U.S. Sen Jack Reed. More than half of respondents said he deserves to be reelected, though one-fifth were unsure or did not have an opinion.
On policy questions, a majority of participants supported Rhode Island working with other Northeast states on vaccine requirements and opposed the federal government’s stoppage of the Revolution Wind project.
The 65-turbine project, already 80% complete in Rhode Island Sound, was still in limbo when the survey was conducted, but has since resumed work under the Sept. 22 order of a federal judge in D.C.
Half of survey participants identified Democrats, compared with 30% Republican and the remainder unaffiliated. The survey featured participants across education levels, regions of the state, and ages, with near-equal participation among men and women.

Clerk Becky Hadlock did not appear Monday at a legislative committee meeting after being subpoenaed to do so.  
The post Wyoming lawmakers to pursue criminal charges against Weston County clerk for allegedly defying subpoena appeared first on WyoFile .","CASPER—Wyoming lawmakers will pursue criminal charges against Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock for allegedly defying a subpoena and failing to appear Monday at a subcommittee meeting. 
“This is a big violation,” Sen. Dan Laursen, R-Powell, said as the Wyoming Legislature’s Weston County Clerk 2024 General Election Subcommittee met Monday morning in Casper. 
The violation is a misdemeanor. If convicted, Hadlock could be fined up to $100 and sentenced to county jail for no more than six months. 
The Joint Management Audit Committee’s chair, Rep. Chris Knapp of Gillette, subpoenaed Hadlock to appear and testify at Monday’s meeting. But the clerk informed lawmakers via letter that she would not attend due to a scheduling conflict, Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, R-Cody, said at the meeting. Rodriguez-Williams confirmed to WyoFile that the lawmakers would pursue criminal charges against Hadlock due to her failure to appear. 
In the 2024 general election, Hadlock caused an initial ballot miscount in her county’s results after using the wrong ballots. Those results showed Rep. Chip Neiman received 166 votes for House District 1, while 1,289 left that part of the ballot blank, also known as an undervote. That count caught Secretary of State Chuck Gray’s attention. His office intervened and ultimately a hand count was conducted. 
That did not resolve the issue, however, for several Weston County voters who asked the Wyoming State Canvassing Board not to certify the results of the election. 
“I would like to state that if you certify this election, knowing that one county found flipped votes, and no other counties have been checked by hand, that you’re damaging the integrity of Wyoming,” Weston County resident Susan Love told the board at the time. 
The board unanimously voted to certify the results. However, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who chairs the board, said his office planned “a more full analysis evaluating [the clerk’s] conduct.”
The following month, eight Weston County voters filed a formal complaint with Gov. Mark Gordon’s office, alleging Hadlock committed “acts of misconduct and malfeasance.” 
Altogether, Hadlock faced accusations that she mishandled election ballots by ordering and using multiple ballot versions in the general election; improperly tested voting machines during the primary and general elections; used incorrect ballots in the general election, which necessitated hand recounts; and caused a significant undercount of votes. 
As laid out by state law, Gordon was not tasked with deciding whether to unilaterally remove Hadlock from office. Rather, he was required to determine whether to recommend that the attorney general seek the clerk’s removal in district court.
“Although I recognize that Clerk Hadlock made many serious mistakes in the 2024 Weston County elections, her actions do not rise to the level of misconduct or malfeasance, as I understand the meaning of those terms in this situation,” Gordon wrote in his decision. “I do not believe there is a clear path to proving guilt.”
Ahead of Gordon’s decision, Gray released the results of his office’s own investigation and recommended that Hadlock be removed from office. 
“Most importantly,” Gray wrote, “we must highlight that Clerk Hadlock’s conduct in filing a false post-election audit in contravention to Wyoming law indicates a repeated and heightened level of misconduct.”
Hadlock did respond to WyoFile’s request for comment by publishing time.

Aug. 25, 2025. (Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A group of advocates who launched a petition drive last month aiming to cut property valuations in half are now also asking that voters approve the state pay all of Nebraska’s public school teachers at least $50,000 per year.
The new nonprofit “Advocates for All Nebraskans” launched two petitions in August, one intending to amend state law to halve the percentage of a property’s valuation subject to property taxes after 2026 and another to revise the Nebraska Constitution to add a cap on property valuation increases at no more than 3% or the growth level of the state’s general fund receipts, whichever is less.
On Monday, the group announced a third petition focused on guaranteeing a competitive base salary for all of Nebraska’s public school teachers. The proposal for a state-funded $50,000 base teacher salary was dubbed, “The APPLE plan” by members, which stands for “Assist Property Payers through Legislative Education support.”
“This plan is not a dream,” said Eric Underwood, the former chair of the Nebraska Republican Party and a leader of the petition drive. “It’s a blueprint for Nebraska.”
The three petitions will now gather signatures in hopes of making it onto Nebraska’s 2026 general election ballot. The two petitions seeking to change state law require just over 88,000 signatures — representing 7% of registered Nebraska voters — while the one seeking to amend the state constitution needs roughly 125,000 signatures — representing 10% of voters.

Ballot initiatives also need qualified signatures from at least 5% of registered voters in 38 of the state’s 93 counties. All signatures must be submitted to the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office by early July.
Leading the effort along with Underwood is State Board of Education member Kirk Penner of Aurora, former Nebraska State Patrol Superintendent Tom Nesbitt of Lincoln and former Lincoln talk radio host Doug Fitzgerald.
In a campaign press release, Penner said the plan is designed to ensure K-12 schools are properly funded while moving them away from heavy reliance on property taxes.
Underwood argued offering a $50,000 base salary could make much of the state’s controversial school funding formula — known as the “Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act,” or TEEOSA — obsolete.
He said having the state cover the costs of offering all teachers a $50,000 salary would cost roughly $1.2 billion, which is about equal to the total state aid allocated to districts under TEEOSA for the 2025-26 school year.
Since a majority of most school district budgets are allocated to teacher salaries, Underwood claimed the proposal would allow some districts to cut levy rates nearly in half. However, he said the group would still like the state to continue providing foundation aid of $1,500 per student that the Nebraska Legislature approved several years ago.
Underwood said the group did not consult with members of Nebraska’s new School Financing Review Commission on this proposal, as the group is more focused on proposing improvements within the existing formula.
Underwood said the reason why Nebraska is struggling with a years-long teacher shortage is because it doesn’t offer competitive salaries compared to other states. Penner noted that 30 states already offer a base teacher salary, including Iowa which had a base salary of $47,500 for 2024-25 full-time teachers, and $60,000 for teachers with 12 or more years of experience.
“I hate losing football games to Iowa,” Penner said. “And I don’t want to lose our teachers to Iowa as well.”
Underwood claimed Nebraska’s average starting teacher salary is in the lower range of $40,000, while the overall average salary is around $56,000. He said teachers who are already paid more than $50,000 per year can still continue to be paid more, but it would be up to individual districts to cover the difference.
“The idea is that the state should fund the stability,” Underwood said. “The local communities provide the excellence in education.”
A total of $5.3 billion in property taxes was assessed statewide in each of the past two years. A 50% reduction would mean a property tax savings of more than $2.6 billion. The proposed caps do not detail how or whether the state would make up the local school funding being lost.
It would also mean a significant drop in revenues going to the state and local governments across Nebraska. Underwood acknowledged that some local governments may seek to raise their levy rates to make up the difference, but a large enough increase would require a vote of the people. This puts the conversation about tax rates back in the local arena, he argued.
While the proposals would reduce property tax revenue, Fitzgerald argued lost revenues could be balanced through increased economic activity. The property tax relief measures would give Nebraskans statewide more money to spend, and Underwood estimated it could generate about $150 million in extra sales tax revenue.
“When Nebraskans have more, they spend more,” Fitzgerald said.

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Complaints filed by professors “disrupted” by Florida’s ban against diversity, equity, and inclusion spending were mostly dismissed by a federal judge last week.
The academics, through American Civil Liberties Union attorneys, filed the suit against the state earlier this year, claiming SB 266 from 2023 imposed viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment, that the law is over-broad, and that it violates Florida’s Campus Free Expression Act.
University DEI spending prohibition challenged by professors in federal court

Thursday, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker dismissed the complaints that SB 266 “left instructors and students fearful for the future of not only education, but also free thought and democracy in Florida.”
The law banned general education courses “based on unproven, speculative, or exploratory content.”
“In short, this Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs fail to allege facts demonstrating that they have suffered a plausible constitutional injury with respect to their claims challenging the general education requirements,” Walker wrote. “Instead, Plaintiffs’ allegations and arguments attacking the language governing and application of the general education requirements are largely rooted in policy disagreements.”
Professors, in their original 66-page complaint, argued they’ve altered course titles and descriptions to comply with the statute “without clarity on how to comply with the law.”
The Legislature left it up to the Board of Governors to define diversity, equity, and inclusion; political or social activism; and social issues. 
The definitions, the plaintiffs argued in their original complaint, have been interpreted by the Board of Governors and university trustees “to align with Governor DeSantis’s viewpoints.”
The governor holds the power to appoint members to the Board of Governors and university boards of trustees. 
“Plaintiffs’ alleged injury in fact with respect to these provisions boils down to self-censorship, but their factual allegations demonstrate that this harm is self-imposed. The alleged chill and self-censorship of Plaintiffs’ in-class speech is a self-imposed injury based on the fear of losing a course designation to which no Plaintiff is constitutionally entitled,” Walker wrote. 
During a news conference at the University of Florida on Monday commemorating 10 years of Florida ranking as the best state in the nation in higher education by U.S. News & World Report, State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues celebrated the ruling.
“Our focus on academic excellence is why our system is so successful,” Rodrigues said. “And we’re the only state to have done that. The other states just don’t have the stomach to take on the fight to clear this out of their general education curriculum. But Florida has led the way and now we have shown it can be done, so let’s hope others follow.”

Walker did find that Sharon Austin, a political science professor at UF, has, on a First Amendment basis, “plausibly alleged standing to challenge the funding restrictions” SB 266 imposed on her when the university declined to fund her travel to a conference it had previously payed for her to attend. 
The university denied funding her travel to “the Global Inclusion Conference” in 2024, specifically citing SB 266, which also prohibits the state from expending funds to “advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion, or promote or engage in political or social activism.” She attended the conference on the state’s dime in 2023. 
“Given UF’s recent enforcement of the funding restrictions against Dr. Austin and her specific plans to apply for funding to attend and present at the same and similar events in the near future, this Court is persuaded that Dr. Austin, at this juncture, has alleged facts demonstrating a plausible injury in fact — the denial of funds and imminent threatened denial of funding — traceable to the Defendants’ enforcement of the challenged funding restrictions and redressable by an injunction prohibiting further enforcement,” Walker wrote. 
Walker, appointed by former President Barack Obama, said the plaintiffs may not file an amended complaint.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – About 125 commercial vehicle drivers, including some accused of being in the country illegally, were arrested during a three-day joint law enforcement blitz along Interstate 40, the Governor’s Office said Monday.
Last week’s arrests were part of “a targeted enforcement action” involving the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Oklahoma Corporation Commission. 
The enforcement effort focused on motorists who have been issued a commercial driver’s license and trucks licensed and registered in California, the Corporation Commission said in a press release.
California is one of 19 states that will issue licenses regardless of immigration status.
The arrests were for “various violations,” the agency said.
Gov. Kevin Stitt’s office said immigrants in the country without legal status were arrested. They came from several countries, including India, China, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine.
The Oklahoma Highway Patrol would not comment on the enforcement operation, nicknamed Operation Guardian, on Monday. Officials with ICE did not respond to a request for comment. 
Stitt’s office said the Oklahoma Highway Patrol encountered numerous truck drivers with licenses issued by “sanctuary states” that have policies rebuffing federal immigration enforcement.
Stitt released a copy of what appeared to be a  New York-issued REAL ID commercial driver’s license that listed “No Name Given” as a licensee’s legal name.
“If New York wants to hand out CDLs to illegal immigrants with ‘No Name Given,’ that’s on them,” Stitt said. “The moment they cross into Oklahoma, they answer to our laws.”
Stitt said it is a safety issue to operate “commercial vehicles without proper verification.”
“Oklahomans deserve safe highways,” said Oklahoma Corporation Chair Kim David. “We appreciate the opportunity to assist ICE and DPS Troop S by removing non-compliant and dangerous drivers from our roads. By working together as law enforcement partners, we’re reducing risks for every driver.”
The Oklahoma Corporation Commission staffs the ports of entry, while the Department of Public Safety does the inspections, said Trey Davis, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. 
The state’s five ports of entry are designed to ensure proper registration, operation, permitting and weight limits for commercial trucks. In fiscal year 2025, more than 5.6 million trucks entered on a highway intersecting one of its ports of entry, which are also located along Interstate 35 and U.S. Highway 69.
“Our officers’ professionalism, training and use of technology quickly assess each driver and rig to resolve permitting concerns, issue a ticket with an associated fine, or require the driver to pull over and submit to further inspection of their credentials or truck,” said Commissioner Todd Hiett.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration cancelled funding for at least six biking and walking trails across the country, including a $5.7 million grant slated for Connecticut’s Naugatuck River Greenway Trail, or the NRG Trail.
In a letter dated Sept. 9, Maria Lefevre, executive director for the office of the under secretary of transportation, said the administration is prioritizing “projects that promote vehicular travel.” The U.S. Transportation Department rereviewed the grant individually, the letter stated, and withdrew funding because the project “no longer aligns with DOT priorities.”
The letter was addressed to Rick Dunne, executive director of Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments, or NVCOG. Reached for comment Monday, Dunne stressed that the NRG Trail would not be built over any motorized routes, and that it would be used for transportation in addition to recreation.
“We were looking forward to being able to work with the administration on it… but they defined their goals for multi-modalism as funding vehicular access,” Dunne said.
Officials with the U.S. Transportation Department did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication. 
The grant was funded through former President Joe Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure bill and the NRG Trail was selected for funding in June 2024.
The NRG Trail would connect 11 towns in the Naugatuck River Valley. The planned route snakes along the river for 44 miles, bridging towns from Litchfield to Waterbury to Derby.
The trail has been in the works for almost three decades, and the pulled federal grant would have helped close the remaining gaps. It would have funded segments of the trail totaling roughly 16.5 miles.
Progress on those parts of the trail — in Thomaston, Watertown, Waterbury and Naugatuck — will halt until NVCOG can secure alternate funding. 
Naugatuck has agreed to fund its section of the trail, according to Dunne. NVCOG intends to find replacement funding to complete the full project.
Since taking office, President Donald J. Trump has made efforts to revoke many grants across government departments. It’s an unusual strategy, particularly with respect to already funded projects, such as walking and biking trails.
Dunne said that colleagues in similar positions in other states have contacted him to join a lawsuit against the federal government over the canceled grants. Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller stated his intention to sue earlier this month.
Those affected by the lost funding include consultants involved in designing the trail and the communities the route passes through, who may lose out on economic opportunities, said Bruce Donald, Southern New England manager for East Coast Greenway Alliance, a group developing a trail network from Maine to Florida.
“This is fairly new territory,” Donald said. “Usually when money is awarded, you get it and you use it.”
Scott Goldstein, senior director of government relations at Rails to Trails Conservancy, a nonprofit that supports trail network development, said it’s difficult to keep track of the grants that have been revoked because the Trump administration is sending letters directly to communities, rather than making public announcements. 
“These cancellations are happening in the shadows,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PXL_20241002_1826196482-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-09-29 17:57:18.001978

Jared Polis has formally requested a federal disaster declaration for two wildfires that burned over 150,000 acres in Rio Blanco County this summer.

Jared Polis has formally requested a federal disaster declaration for two wildfires that burned over 150,000 acres in Rio Blanco County this summer.
The Lee and Elk fires grew rapidly and forced evacuations in and around the town of Meeker after they were started by lightning on Aug. 2. A combined total of more than 1,200 firefighting personnel were assigned to the fires at their peak intensity in mid-August, fueled by extreme drought and critical fire weather conditions.
In a letter Friday to President Donald Trump and officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Polis requested a presidential “major disaster declaration” and more than $27 million in initial FEMA assistance as Rio Blanco County recovers from the fires.

“Damage from these fires and the subsequent flash flooding puts Colorado families, major energy production, and the local economy at risk,” Polis said in a statement. “This is why Colorado is asking the federal government to continue supporting the state through these recovery efforts. By joining us in partnership, we can help communities in Rio Blanco recover from this disaster as fast as possible.”
The vast majority of the initial FEMA assistance the state is seeking would go towards repairing electricity infrastructure that provides power for natural gas production in the Piceance Basin.
“Both the primary and secondary transmission lines for electricity feeding the oil and gas industry in this area suffered over $24 million in damage from these fires,” Polis wrote to FEMA officials. “The failure to provide immediate and robust federal assistance will result in a significant, prolonged reduction in domestic energy supply.”
Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, significantly increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. The Lee Fire was briefly estimated to be Colorado’s fourth-largest wildfire ever, though its estimated size was subsequently revised downward to 137,758 acres, and it’s currently ranked fifth.
On Monday, all 10 members of Colorado’s congressional delegation signed a letter to Trump in support of Polis’ request.
“Without additional support, residents could face increased electricity costs, oil and gas production could slow, and important habitat and grazing lands could be lost,” says the lawmakers’ letter. “In addition, residents face ongoing hazards from the fire, including debris, burned trees, and threats to water quality and drinking water infrastructure.”
“A Presidential Major Disaster Declaration unlocks a number of federal assistance programs and allows local governments, homeowners, and businesses to be eligible for loans, insurance relief, and other assistance,” their letter adds. “These communities urgently need this relief to rebuild.”

(Photo by Robin Cartwright)Citing the “largest incursion into local home rule authority” since the adoption of the Florida Constitution in 1968, 25 local governments have filed suit seeking to block a new law that restricts local governments from regulating development.
They filed their request for declaratory and injunctive relief in Florida’s Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County on Monday.
The measure, Senate Bill 180, sponsored by Pinellas County Republican state Sen. Nick DiCeglie, was originally intended to help people rebuild properties damaged in hurricanes. But it goes way beyond that, thanks to a late amendment, with two sections in particular drawing the concern of local governments.
Section 18 freezes cities and counties from adopting land-use regulations deemed “more restrictive or burdensome” than those in place before recent or future hurricanes.
Section 28 says that the new land-use laws applies in counties listed in the Federal Disaster Declaration for Hurricanes Debby, Helene, or Milton plus “each municipality within one of those counties.” It covers every part of the state retroactively from August 2024 and prospectively through October 2027.
The law specifically says that “any person” can serve a local government with notification of intent to sue on the belief the local government has violated the law. The local government then has 14 days to correct any problem. If the government chooses to repeal the restriction, any case would be dropped. If it declines to repeal, that person can go ahead and file a lawsuit.
The suit lists specific examples of the new law that have harmed local interests.
Orange County, for example, received a letter in July from the Florida Commerce Department stating that its comprehensive plan amendment was null and void because it is “more restrictive or burdensome,” the lawsuit alleges, “without purporting to identity what it was more restrictive or burdensome than, or to whom it was more restrictive or burdensome.”
The suit also mentions how the Town of Windermere paused a tree-protection ordinance that would have required additional mitigation by developers.
Senate Bill 180 “violates the Florida Constitution and Florida law because it contains more than ‘one subject and matter properly connected therewith,’ has a defective ballot title, is a general law that classifies counties and municipalities on a basis not reasonably related to the subject of the law, constitutes an improper unfunded mandate on the Local Governments, conflicts with Florida’s Community Planning Act, and intrudes on Home Rule Powers.”
“SB 180 should be declared invalid, and the defendants should be enjoined from enforcing it,” the lawsuit reads.
The local governments in the lawsuit are: Alachua, Cutler Bay, Delray Beach, Deltona, Destin, Dundee, Edgewater, Fort Lauderdale, Homestead, Jupiter, Lake Alfred, Lake Park, Margate,  Miami Shores Village, Mulberry, Naples, the Village of North Palm Beach, the Village of Pinecrest, Palm Beach, Pompano Beach, Stuart, Weston, Windermere, and Orange and Manatee counties.
Environmental and smart-growth organizations have also been critical of SB 180. A group of 41 organizations wrote to state lawmakers earlier this month urging repeal of “excessive and dangerous” sections of SB 180.
“With SB 180, the Legislature has sabotaged its own efforts to create a safer, more sustainable and more affordable future for Floridians,” the letter says.
“Initiatives like septic-to-sewer and stormwater grants to improve water quality and comply with the Clean Water Act, lighting ordinances to protect sea turtle habitat, resilience funding programs, and flood insurance rating systems rely on voluntary participation by local governments and often require changes to policies and procedures that could be deemed as ‘more restrictive or burdensome.’ If SB 180 stands as written, these critical initiatives will be delayed or blocked.”
Sen. DiCeglie is familiar with the criticism of his legislation. Speaking Friday before the Tampa Bay Beaches Chamber of Commerce, he acknowledged the law “has been a hot topic.”
“Most of that had to do with planning and recovery efforts,” he said. “We’re going to potentially have to make some adjustments to clarify some of the language in that bill.”
The cities and counties are calling for the trial court to declare that SB 180 violates the Florida Constitution and Florida statutes codifying home-rule powers; to declare “the purported preemptions” in SB 180 invalid as impermissibly vague; to enjoin the enforcement of SB 180; and to grant “such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.”
The lawsuit was filed by the Fort Lauderdale law firm of Weiss Serota Helfman Cole+ Bierman.
The plaintiffs included in the lawsuit include Florida Secretary of Commerce Alex Kelly; Department of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie; Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, and Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia.

Garlin Gilchrist is staking out new territory for establishment Michigan Democrats in his campaign for governor, offering his support for Palestinians facing hunger and strife in the Israel-Hamas war and plainly calling the situation in Gaza a genocide.
Gilchrist first made his stance on Gaza clear over the weekend as a speaker at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee’s national convention in Dearborn, also known as ArabCon. The city has the nation’s largest cohort of Arab Americans and would be a key pick up in the Democratic primary next August.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe lieutenant governor, in a clip that was shared on his Instagram account, said that the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was committing a genocide of the Palestinian people, to which the crowd erupted in cheers.
“This is not a matter of opinion. It is a matter of fact,” Gilchrist said. “This is has been established by the global leaders who study genocide. This is not something we should support. American taxpayer dollars should not fund offensive weapons of war while children are starving, while medical resources are being blocked to civilians, and while lineages of families are being erased.”

Gilchrist also said that candidates for office should not be accepting money from those who support the genocide, noting that he would not accept money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, the largest pro-Israel lobby in the U.S. That line similarly drew cheers and applause.
His commentary on Gaza and Palestine continued in campaign fundraiser alerts issued Monday – in both an email and in a text message.
“What’s happening in Gaza is a genocide. Families are starving. Children are being bombed. And our federal government is writing the checks that fund it,” Gilchrist’s campaign wrote. “I stand for human rights, dignity, and safety. That is why I am standing with the Palestinian people and their family, friends, and allies in Michigan – even knowing that AIPAC and its billionaire allies will flood Michigan with attack ads to try to shut me up.”
The text message sent by his campaign also addresses the controversial nature of his decision to come out in support of the Palestinian people, and positions Gilchrist as taking a bold stance in the face of what could be scorn for pro-Israel groups on both sides of the political aisle.
“Consultants told me not to send this text,” Gilchrist’s campaign wrote in the fundraising message, framed to be frank communication from the lieutenant governor. “They said it was ‘too controversial.’ They said it would cost us big donors. But if we’re afraid to tell the truth, what’s the point of running at all?”
Gilchrist is not alone in his position. Both Amnesty International and the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry have called the destruction of Gaza, the associated strife and the displacement of the Palestinian people a genocide.
Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, who is also seeking election to the governor’s office on the Democratic side, earlier this month called for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, a lasting ceasefire and said humanitarian aid should flow freely to those in need. Swanson said the situation “hurts his soul, and I know I’m not alone.”
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, also in the race, has called for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, neither has gone as far to call Israeli actions a genocide.

(Photo by Clark Kauffman, Iowa Capital Dispatch)A Des Moines nursing home has been cited for “free roaming” rodents, leaking ceilings, a flooded kitchen and an infestation of mice, flies and cockroaches that may have contributed to recent resident illnesses.
Inspectors from the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing visited Azria Health Park Place, located 2401 E. 8th St., in Des Moines, during the first two weeks of September and cited the facility for insufficient staffing and failing to provide a clean, homelike environment. The visit was in response to nine separate complaints, according to state records.
On Sept. 3, the first day of the state inspection, the home halted all food service from the kitchen and ordered meals from outside providers while the staff began cleaning and sanitizing the kitchen to address the state’s findings that residents of the home were in immediate jeopardy.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The inspectors reported standing water in the building, bed mattresses the staff described as “soiled and disgusting,” rooms the inspectors said “reeked of urine,” and mold-like substances in the kitchen and in the window air conditioners placed in resident rooms.  In the activity-supply room and housekeeping office, inspectors reported, the ceilings tiles had collapsed and a “dry, brown liquid streamed down the wall from the ceiling toward the floor.”
In the shower room, “grayish and brown, mud-like” debris marred the floor and the cracked shower tiles. In one resident’s room, a nurse lifted up the floor mats that were surrounding a resident who was “lying on a mattress on the floor,” inspectors said, revealing crumbs, dirt and debris.
According to the inspectors’ written findings, one of the home’s residents reported that the “bathroom ceiling in his room caved in and it flooded the entire room, then it flooded into the whole hallway this past summer.”
Other residents complained of being left to sit in urine, adding that the home “smelled like pee all of the time,” they could hear mice in the ceiling, and there were “many places” in the home where it dripped water after raining.
Rodent droppings, pooled water and mold  
The home also was reportedly short on wound-care supplies, bed linens, gloves, wipes and the briefs used by incontinent residents, with one worker saying a female resident “sat in a pool of urine because they did not have big enough briefs or pads for her.” The worker allegedly said she “had to stash briefs,” hiding them in the building, so the residents she cared for would have them when needed.
State inspectors also reported the kitchen and the home’s basement area had significant water damage as evidenced by collapsing ceiling tiles and the smell of spoilage and dampness.
“The entire floor of the kitchen appeared caked in sticky substances and food particles,” an inspector reported. “Numerous sticky traps were found with one of them showing what appeared to be rodent droppings, light grey fur, and numerous insects near the kitchen dry-storage area.”
According to the inspectors, records indicated that in May 2025, “large standing pools of water” had accumulated in a hallway of the building and in the kitchen.
On Sept. 3, the inspectors found peaches with an expiration date of Aug. 24, and the home’s director of food services allegedly reported the peaches had been served to residents that morning. Worm-like insects were seen on the kitchen floor, as were what appeared to be insect eggs, the inspectors added.
The inspectors also reported finding rodent droppings in the kitchen near the stove, and a “collection of coffee creamers” that were marred by “a mold-like substance with a strong smell growing on it. This mold-like substance was also found in all of the kitchen floor drains.”
In addition, the inspectors noted that the equipment “throughout the kitchen appeared to be covered in a layer of grime,” and cooking surfaces were “visibly blackened and appeared to not have been cleaned in some time.”
The rodent activity in the kitchen was so pervasive that fresh rodent droppings were spotted by inspectors during the inspection itself within minutes of the floor having been swept.
Manager: Years of neglect led to ‘mess’ in kitchen
The kitchen-cleaning logs indicated the area had last been cleaned in April or May, 2025, the inspectors reported. The home’s dietary aide allegedly told inspectors he had seen “rodents in the kitchen every single day since he started,” which was around January 2025.
The aide allegedly stated that the kitchen flooded periodically, and that the last serious flood had been the month before, in August 2025, adding that he had seen what he believed to be “cockroaches in the kitchen for a long time,” as well as a “significant number of flies.” A cook allegedly reported seeing one or two mice per day while working, adding that there were also problems with ants, crickets and flies.
Both the dietary aide and the cook indicated the kitchen was difficult to keep clean as it was simply too dirty and prone to flooding during periods of heavy rain. The situation had been “going on for years,” the cook allegedly told inspectors.
The inspectors reported that they also spoke to the home’s dietary manager, who allegedly stated that he “felt the kitchen was in extremely poor shape. He stated the kitchen has known issues with flies, cockroaches, and rodents that he believes to be mice. He stated the mice infestation is so bad they are catching one to two mice a day on glue traps since he started. He stated he has no idea how the kitchen got that bad and stated it was a mess.”










I don’t do critters.


– Acting Administrator Kristin Pauley at Azria Health Park Place, Des Moines


According to inspectors, the dietary manager also reported that a week before the inspectors arrived, he had picked up a box of food in the dry-storage area “and it contained a mouse nest” and indications that rodents had chewed into the side of the box. The manager allegedly added that in the past few weeks, he had “personally found at least 8-plus mice on sticky traps within the facility, with other mice seen free roaming the facility.” The state of the kitchen, the manager allegedly told inspectors, stemmed from “years of neglect.”
The home’s acting administrator at that time — identified in corporate and state records as Kristin Pauley, who also served as the parent company’s regional director of operations — reportedly told inspectors she had only recently been informed of rodent activity in the building. When the inspector asked Pauley when she had last been in the kitchen, Pauley allegedly stated she had not been there “in a while.”
The inspectors reported Pauley told them she “had never seen a mouse” in the nursing home, adding, “Thank goodness. I don’t do critters.”
Two-hour wait for call-light to be answered
While inspectors were in the building, one of them heard a resident hollering and found a woman yelling that her roommate needed help as she had been left on the toilet for a half-hour and couldn’t sit there any longer. “The emergency call-light was flashing, and the call-light was lit in the room,” the inspector noted.
A few minutes later, another resident called out to the inspector, saying someone needed to “help the little boy” who had been hollering for 20 minutes to get out of the bathroom. A subsequent review of the call-light data at the home indicated residents often had to wait more than 15 minutes for the staff to respond, with some of the waits extending to more than two hours.
A certified nurse aide allegedly told inspectors she had seen cockroaches and mice in the building for months now, but that management downplayed the issue and told the staff that the cockroaches were “just water bugs and the mice weren’t a problem.” A housekeeping supervisor reportedly told the inspectors she had seen mouse droppings in residents’ dressers.
The CNA and a licensed practical nurse stated they had noticed an increase in vomiting and diarrhea among the residents during the past month, and a nurse reported the facility “ran out of briefs” for residents during that time.
A female resident of home allegedly told inspectors she had “diarrhea all of the time” — an issue she hadn’t experienced until moving into the home. A male resident complained “he had projectile vomiting for three weeks,” the inspectors reported.
One staff member at the home allegedly told inspectors she could not eat the food served by the home as she had experienced “diarrhea all day when she ate the food.”
The staff also noted numerous residents had complained about the quality of their meals in the last month. One resident reportedly told inspectors that while he had seen no mice in his room, he sees flies “all the time” and complained that the food at times was “gross.”
Administrator: Staff is working to improve care 
State records indicate the inspections department proposed, but held in suspension, an $8,000 fine for failing to maintain the facility in a manner that keeps the facility free from pests and protects the 59 residents from food-borne illnesses. The inspections agency typically holds state fines in suspension so the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can decide whether to impose a federal fine in the matter.
This marks the third consecutive year in which Azria Health Park Place has been cited for a failure to provide residents with a clean, safe, homelike environment.
The new administrator of the home, Rand Rasmussen, said the facility’s roof was recently repaired and the home has undertaken extensive efforts to clean the building and address all of the issues cited by inspectors, including long response times to call-lights. There have been no sightings of vermin in the building since inspectors left on Sept. 11, 2025, Rasmussen said.
“Going forward,” he said, “we are wanting to change the standard of care that’s being received here and provide a more safe experience for the residents so they can obviously have a better-quality experience here.”
Federal records indicate Azria Health Park Place is owned by the for-profit Azria Health chain and its affiliate by BCP Union Park, with Aaron Kaminer having operational or managerial control of the companies. Chief Operating Officer Carrie Raemakers did not immediately respond to calls from the Iowa Capital Dispatch.
Azria Health Park Place has a one-star rating on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ five-star scale for overall care, inspection results and quality measures.
CMS reports that it has imposed no federal penalties against Azria Health Park Place in the past three years. During that same period, CMS reports, there have been 68 complaints pertaining to resident care at the home that have resulted in a citation by inspectors.
Federal records indicate Azria Health operates at least nine nursing homes or assisted living centers in Iowa and Kansas. Collectively, the nursing homes have a below-average quality rating from CMS.

(Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s plans to boost the country’s struggling coal industry by investing millions of dollars into coal power plants, opening more land to mining and loosening environmental regulations are a “major victory” for West Virginia and the United States, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a news release. 
The Trump administration announced plans to invest $625 million in coal plants and to open 13.1 million acres of federal land for mining leases. Officials also announced plans to delay environmental guidelines in order for power plants to affordably meet the country’s growing electricity demand, including for data centers.
“Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a news release announcing the $625 million investment. “These funds will help keep our nation’s coal plants operating and will be vital to keeping electricity prices low and the lights on without interruption. Coal built the greatest industrial engine the world has ever known, and with President Trump’s leadership, it will help do so again.”
U.S. Department of the Interior director Doug Burgum said in a release that with the coal mining land policy initiative, officials are “strengthening our economy, protecting national security and ensuring that communities from Montana to Alabama benefit from good-paying jobs.” The agency is also “lowering royalty rates to strengthen competitiveness, and streamlining approvals for projects in Montana, Wyoming, Tennessee and beyond,” the news release said.
“I commend President Donald Trump and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright for backing West Virginia’s coal industry and supporting our ‘50 by 50’ policy — which will rely heavily on coal and gas to empower our state to take the lead in securing America’s energy future and advance our position against China in the data and AI arms race,” Morrisey said in a news release.
“America needs to increase its energy production, and West Virginia has the opportunity to lead the way,” Morrisey added. “By upgrading our existing coal-fired power plants to run cleaner and more efficiently, we can lower energy prices for consumers and build the generating capacity we need to compete with China, all while supporting the hardworking West Virginians who work in our coal and gas industries.”
Sen. Jim Justice, R-West Virginia, also commended Trump’s announcement, saying the president is “right on the money” with the investment in power plants. 
“I’ve said for a long time that we are going to face an energy crisis of massive proportions, having to choose between powering our homes or powering industry unless we act,” Justice said in the news release. “This is smart policy in action. I’m proud of what we are getting done here with regard to energy because this $625 million investment is a massive win for our miners, our families, and America’s energy independence.”
The moves were decried by environmental advocates, including the Sierra Club, which said the administration is giving taxpayer money to “wealthy executives in the coal industry.”
“This is a transparent wealth transfer from everyday Americans, who are already making tough decisions at the kitchen table, to the millionaires that run the fossil fuel industry,” Laurie Williams, the organization’s Beyond Coal campaign director, said in a statement. “If Chris Wright, or anyone in Donald Trump’s administration, truly cared about bringing down the cost of electricity, they would be investing in affordable clean energy instead of taking a sledgehammer to the progress our country has made.”
In an email, Chelsea Barnes, director of government affairs and strategy for Appalachian Voices, said the announcements to “prop up” coal power plants and open land for coal mining were made with announcements to “allow coal power plants to further pollute our air and water.”
“But the announcements are no surprise,” she said. “The Trump administration has made it abundantly clear that they’re willing to sacrifice the health and safety of coal miners and the people living near mines and power plants to benefit the coal barons and other billionaires.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The majority of Minnesotans in recent polling want lawmakers to reconvene for a special session on gun control and pass a ban on so-called assault weapons, but that may not ultimately matter as Gov. Tim Walz and legislative leaders negotiate a deal to reduce gun violence and improve school safety.
The August mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church has brought the gun control debate to the fore, and Walz and legislative leaders have been meeting behind closed doors to see if they can come to an agreement for a special legislative session to pass gun control and school safety measures.
Results from a recent Everytown for Gun Safety poll were especially stark in the suburbs: 62% of suburban Minnesotans said they support the Legislature taking action to ban assault weapons. The results mirror a recent KSTP poll, which found 60% percent of suburban voters said there should be a special session and 60% said they support a ban on assault weapons.
Given the importance of those suburban areas in determining the next legislative majorities, you would think Republican lawmakers might be open to compromise.
But here’s another key finding of the Everytown poll, which surveyed 800 likely 2026 midterm election voters earlier this month: On the assault weapons ban, 93% of Democrats said they support it, while 68% of Republicans said they oppose it.
In other words, Republican lawmakers face the prospect of angering their own base, which could lead to GOP convention and primary challenges, especially because many gun rights voters are single-issue voters who can be activated to oppose Republicans deemed insufficiently supportive of 2nd Amendment rights.
Indeed, the Reformer called several suburban Republicans to ask them where they stand on an assault weapons ban. Reps. Andrew Myers of Tonka Bay, Tom Dippel of Cottage Grove, Jeff Witte of Lakeville did not respond to the Reformer’s messages seeking comment. Rep. Kristin Robbins, R-Maple Grove, declined to comment.
First-term Rep. Wayne Johnson, R-Cottage Grove, told the Reformer he doesn’t support an assault weapons ban.
“I am not wavering. I am not in favor of a ban … and I don’t see it working,” said Johnson, who won his 2024 race by 327 votes.
Without Republicans, new gun regulations are impossible. That’s because 67 Republicans and 67 Democrats share power. 
The Senate is currently short two members until a Nov. 4 special election, after which Democrats are expected to maintain their slim majority, but until then, they are a vote shy of the necessary 34.
While Walz is blaming Republicans for the special session stalemate, it’s unclear whether Senate Democrats have the votes in their own party to pass an assault weapons ban.
Three Senate Democrats, who were instrumental in holding up the assault weapons ban when Democrats controlled the Legislature in 2023, didn’t respond to the Reformer’s request for comment.
Minnesota senators recently convened for a working group on gun control, during which Republicans appeared steady in their support for gun rights while Democrats forwarded several gun control proposals.
For his part, Walz has said he will call a special session even if he fails to reach an agreement with Republican lawmakers but he has given no indication of when he would call one.
“It’s clear to me that Republican legislators want to talk about everything else except guns,” Walz recently told reporters, adding that “there is no appetite on the Republican side to hold a floor vote on guns.
On Saturday, parents of the surviving children of the Church of the Annunciation were joined by hundreds of community members at the Capitol calling on Walz to convene a special session.
Brittany Haeg, whose six-year-old son David was injured in the shooting, urged lawmakers to act quickly and decisively. “I’m here to tell you as a Catholic, as a mother, as a human: prayers in place of action when you have the power to act are a betrayal of prayer itself.”
For now, however, it appears gun control advocates have two options: Persuade Republicans to support new restrictions, or beat them in next year’s election.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250927_0003-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 16:57:17.741979

(Photos by Danielle Prokop/Source NM)The bomb threats targeting a New Mexico Democratic lawmaker’s home and office were emailed from a username titled “maga_terrorist,” according to state police reports released Monday to Source NM.
While no explosives were ever found, the threats leveled against Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth and House Floor Leader Reena Szczepanski, both Santa Fe Democrats, on Sept. 11 caused the evacuation of a nearby school and the lockdown of City Hall. The threats followed the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
The original complaint to New Mexico State Police, obtained through an Inspection of Public Records request, has a copy of the email issuing the threats against Wirth and the address from which it was sent.
The emails describe materials used to create a “pipe bomb” that was “set to go off in the next 48 hours” within Wirth’s residential mailbox or the next time the mailbox was opened.
“Even if Peter does not open the mailbox himself I’m still satisfied with the prospect of some family member losing their life or getting injured. MAGA,” the email concluded, using the shorthand for President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.”
The emails were not directly sent to Wirth, but instead were addressed to the governor’s office records email.
In a recent interview with Source NM, Wirth called the threats “a scary set of circumstances,” and said he was shaken by the impact, particularly on the children evacuated from a nearby school.
“It’s just an unfortunate place that we’re at with this political violence, and I hope we can figure out how to stop,” Wirth told Source NM on Sept. 23.
He said no additional safety measures beyond the already required metal detector scans will be necessary for the Oct. 1 special session.
“I certainly feel safer here, and I know the public does as well,” Wirth told Source NM last week. “Having said that, though, this is a challenging time and we’re certainly gonna be vigilant. ”
The Santa Fe Police Department previously took the lead on the  investigation into the threats made against Szczepanski, which were emailed to Mayor Alan Webber’s office on the same day — but subsequently forwarded its information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is now leading the case.
Bomb threats, lockdowns: A state on edge in wake of Charlie Kirk killing

“We learned similar threats had been made toward other lawmakers in Maryland in a similar manner as the ones received in our jurisdiction,” Santa Fe Police Deputy Chief Ben Valdez told Source NM in an email on Monday.
Source NM’s Monday request to the FBI seeking information on the case remains pending.
State police are still investigating the bomb threats made against Wirth, Officer Silver Wilson, a spokesperson at the New Mexico Department of Public Safety, told Source NM.
“So far, no arrests have been made in the Sept 11 incidents that NMSP handled regarding Senator Wirth,” Silver wrote in an email Monday. “The FBI has been made aware of the threats. Nothing has come across our desks relating to any other threats since then.”

This past week marked the one-year anniversary of Helene – a deadly hurricane-turned tropical-storm that wreaked unprecedented havoc in western North Carolina. Helene caused widespread and massive flooding that killed scores of people and caused more than $60 billion dollars in damage to North Carolina’s mountain west.
In the year since, clean-up and recovery have been ongoing – sometimes seemingly never-ending — tasks for the communities affected and state leaders. Indeed, since he took office just a few months after Helene, Gov. Josh Stein has made Helene recovery his administration’s top priority and recently Newsline was lucky enough to get a snapshot of where things stand when we caught up with the Governor’s point person in that effort, Matt Calabria.

As of 2022, the latest year with available data, people 55 and over made up nearly 1 in 6 prisoners — a fourfold increase since 2000 — and their numbers are projected to keep rising. A new report from the […]","An incarcerated person sits inside a housing block at California’s San Quentin State Prison. People 55 and older make up about 19% of the state’s prison population. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)America’s prison population is growing older at a pace that some experts say is unsustainable. As of 2022, the latest year with available data, people 55 and over made up nearly 1 in 6 prisoners — a fourfold increase since 2000 — and their numbers are projected to keep rising.
A new report from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Prison and Jail Innovation Lab at the University of Texas at Austin warns that this trend is straining correctional systems that were not designed to care for older adults.
If current trends continue, the authors estimate that by 2030 as much as one-third of the U.S. prison population will be over 50.

“It puts it into perspective how bad that this has gotten,” said Alyssa Gordon, the report’s lead author. Gordon is an attorney and legal fellow with the ACLU National Prison Project. “People don’t realize that prisons are woefully equipped to handle this crisis.”
The findings are based on data from public records requests to all 50 state corrections departments, publicly available state prison population datasets and the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. Some data, however, were not available for every state, limiting the authors’ ability to make extended state-by-state comparisons.
The report’s findings come as states face competing pressures: a nationwide crackdown on crime and public safety, tightening corrections budgets and severe overcrowding and staffing shortages.
The aging prison population is largely a product of the “tough-on-crime” era of the 1980s and 1990s, when lawmakers at both the state and federal level enacted a wave of punitive policies under the banner of public safety, according to the report. These policies, including mandatory minimums, “three strikes” laws and “truth-in-sentencing” statutes, led to significantly longer sentences and fewer opportunities for early release. Experts say many of those policies remain in place today.
The report also highlights the growing price tag of incarcerating an aging population. Corrections spending data shows an upward trend in medical costs across some states, according to the report.
Efforts to release prisoners from long sentences draw new interest

Prisons often lack accommodations for older adults, including accessible showers and beds, dementia care and hospice services, putting them at greater risk of injury or premature death, according to the report.
Emergency protocols also are frequently inadequate, the authors found, leaving older prisoners particularly vulnerable during natural disasters, disease outbreaks and other emergencies.
Some experts say that the costs of incarcerating older adults could create common ground for policymakers, as reducing this population may lower prison spending without significantly affecting public safety.
“If you want to figure out which population to target where it doesn’t have a public safety implication, this is the population to turn to,” Michele Deitch, one of the report’s authors and the director of the Prison and Jail Innovation Lab, told Stateline. “This is an issue that can gather bipartisan support.”
The report’s authors estimate that more than half of incarcerated people over 55 — more than 58,000 individuals — have already served at least 10 years, with nearly 16,000 behind bars for more than half their lives.
Older adults are less likely to reoffend, with recidivism rates reported at 18% in Colorado in 2020, 12% in South Carolina in 2021, and 6% in Florida in 2022. These rates are far below the national three-year rearrest rate of 66% for the general prison population, according to the report.
In recent years, more states have explored measures to address the aging prison population, including legislation commonly called “second look” laws or policies that expand parole eligibility for older or seriously ill inmates.
Most recently, a new Maryland law, which is set to take effect on Oct. 1, will allow certain incarcerated people to apply for geriatric parole. The law applies to those who are at least 65, have served at least 20 years, are not sex offenders, are serving sentences with the possibility of parole, and have had serious disciplinary infractions in the past three years.

Young I State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/education/mass-mcas-scores-still-not-back-to-pre-pandemic-levels/,"""The results show slight improvement in English language arts scores among students in grades 3 through 8 and no change in math scores for that cohort. Results for 10th graders, the first class to take the standardized test knowing that voters had already scrapped it as a high school graduation requirement, were down across the board.""","A SMALLER PERCENTAGE of Massachusetts schools made significant progress towards, met or exceeded their own goals in 2025, state officials said Monday as they released “sobering” results from the latest round of MCAS testing.
The results, which Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler and Elementary and Secondary Education Commissioner Pedro Martinez are making public during an event at an Arlington middle school, show slight improvement in English language arts scores among students in grades 3 through 8 and no change in math scores for that cohort.
Results for 10th graders, the first class to take the standardized test knowing that voters had already scrapped it as a high school graduation requirement, were down across the board. Officials at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education said they think last fall’s vote might have something to do with the slide.
In a call with reporters Monday morning, Martinez pointed out that there is not one single statewide student group that has bounced back to its pre-pandemic level of achievement in Massachusetts.
“There are other states that have actually already, as a state, already reached pre-pandemic levels. And there’s many states who have some of their groups of students who have reached their pre-pandemic levels,” the commissioner, who started here in July after having run Chicago’s school system, said. “We also continue to see achievement gaps, specifically for students of color, our students with disabilities and English learners. Look, these results are sobering, but they’re not insurmountable. I am confident that we can improve and that Massachusetts can continue to be a national leader in education.”
Tutwiler added, “I have long suggested that recovery from the pandemic will be a process, not an event.”
In English language arts, 42 percent of students in grades 3 through 8 met or exceeded the state’s expectations, an increase of 3 percentage points compared to 2024 but still 10 percentage points below statewide results from 2019. Most 10th graders, 51 percent, met or exceeded the English expectations, but DESE said that represents a drop of 6 percentage points from 2024 and 10 percentage points from 2019.
In math, 41 percent of third-through-eighth graders met or exceeded expectations, unchanged from 2024 but lagging 2019 results by 8 percentage points. Among 10th graders, 45 percent met or exceeded expectations. DESE said that is 3 percentage points below 2024 levels and 14 percentage points below pre-pandemic 2019 levels.
Forty-six percent of fifth graders met or exceeded expectations on the MCAS science exam, up one percentage point from last year but still down 3 points from 2019. For eighth graders, 37 percent met or surpassed expectations (down 2 percentage points from 2024 and 9 percentage points behind 2019 levels). Forty-six percent of tenth graders met or exceeded the science expectations, a drop of 3 percentage points compared to 2024. DESE officials say comparisons to 2019 are not meaningful for 10th graders because the exam has changed since then.
DESE’s Chief Officer for Data, Assessment and Accountability Rob Curtin said the state sees signs in the 10th grade MCAS results that students were likely influenced by the outcome of last November’s successful ballot question to break the link between MCAS passage and high school graduation. He said the “evidence” includes increases in the number of students who either left answers blank or “answered a question in an off-topic manner, in other words, they didn’t answer the question” compared to 2024.
“So these are things that we’re going to continue to look at and examine, but there is some evidence to suggest that there was an impact of motivation as it relates to the results from Question 2 back in November,” Curtin told reporters.
Across the state, 55 percent of schools either made substantial progress towards, met or exceeded their own accountability targets. And while DESE officials pointed out that a majority of schools at least made serious progress in 2025, it represents a decrease from 60 percent of schools that at least made significant progress in 2024.
Of 1,590 schools that serve MCAS-tested grades and had sufficient student populations, there are 280 schools, or 18 percent, that the state has classified as “requiring assistance or intervention” for meeting at least one criterion from a list.
Tutwiler and Martinez chose Arlington’s Ottoson Middle School as the site of the annual MCAS results announcement because the district is one of just 63 (of nearly 400 statewide) where MCAS scores have at least returned to pre-pandemic levels in English language arts, math or both. 
Arlington is one of 13 districts where scores for grades three through eight have at least rebounded in both English and math, along with Amherst, Benjamin Banneker Charter School, Central Berkshire, Cohasset, Excel Academy Charter School, Farmington River Regional, Libertas Academy Charter School, Pioneer Charter School of Science, Rowe, Sizer School: A North Central Charter Essential, Wakefield, and Williamsburg.
Lawmakers created the MCAS system in a 1993 education reform law that was aimed at improving accountability and school performance. The first tests were given in 1998, and students starting with the high school class of 2003 were required to achieve sufficient scores to graduate until voters approved a measure last November to decouple the two.
A panel assembled by Gov. Maura Healey has to make at least initial recommendations for a new statewide high school graduation standard by the end of the year and last week unveiled its first rough sketch of its thinking. Tutwiler, who co-chairs the group, said last week the recommendations “will include rigorous learning experiences and a mechanism to give us confidence that all students are meeting these high expectations.”
The Massachusetts Teachers Association that pushed for the elimination of MCAS passage as a graduation requirement responded by warning against the continued use of a standardized test to assess students.
“Educators and voters have made clear that such essential skills cannot be assessed by a standardized test. We will only nurture students to be ‘critical problem solvers, intentional collaborators, effective communicators, self-aware navigators, and responsible decision-makers’ if we design educator-led systems of assessment and provide the necessary resources that educators, students and schools need to fulfill these goals,” Max Page and Deb McCarthy, president and vice president of MTA, said.
MCAS results are sometimes accompanied by DESE’s corresponding school and district accountability determinations. But Monday’s announcement did not include any details on schools exiting or entering “underperforming” or “chronically underperforming” status. DESE officials said Martinez will evaluate each school’s status in the coming weeks.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Transportation_Education_School-Bus_Boston-3.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-29 15:58:08.950237

This valiant proclamation about the importance of free speech, attributed to the French philosopher and writer Voltaire, seemed to embody everything that was essential and noble about my chosen profession, about democracy, and about our great nation.
Untested youthful idealism and bravado are easy. 
Tacking a banner to the wall in 1984 was, I suppose, the equivalent of posting my personal creed to Instagram or X today, if even less impactful.
Living up to that idealism not just in word but in deed, through the tests of time as a writer, a professor, a father, an engaged citizen, and a college president, has proven to be much harder, especially in today’s fiercely divided political landscape.
I have beliefs and strongly held opinions, and like anyone else, I am gratified when my perspective prevails. 
Still, for the last four decades of my life and career, I have tried to keep Voltaire’s conviction in mind when faced with critical decisions about free expression on campus and in my community.
Because far more important than my perspective is the system of government and agreed upon set of cultural principles that allow me to have it and share it in the first place, and that allow others to do the same.
So, following the assassination of conservative activist and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on the campus of Utah Valley University earlier this month, I joined leaders from across the political spectrum who have expressed condolences and offered words of warning about the rising tide of politically motivated violence in our country.
There are very few matters of public policy that Charlie Kirk and I would have agreed on, and I found some of his rhetoric, particularly about civil rights and the LGBTQ community, odious.
But how I feel about Kirk’s politics and personality in this moment is irrelevant.
Political disagreement should be settled at the ballot box or mediated through the legislative process, not forced by an assassin’s bullet.
We are at a moment when extremists on both the left and the right use strategies ranging from public shaming and cancelling, to censoring and intimidating not just to disagree with the opposition, but to silence them—sometimes permanently.
A distressingly large proportion of college students across the country seem to agree with the tactics.
The recently released 2026 Free Speech Rankings from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) find that a majority of college students (from nearly 70,000 surveyed at more than 250 colleges and universities) feel that controversial speakers should not be allowed on campus, and that it is acceptable to block other students from attending a campus speech.
Even more alarming, a third of the students surveyed find it acceptable, at least in some instances, to use violence to stop a campus speech.
That is wrong, and college leaders everywhere have a responsibility to turn this troubling trend around.
Encouragingly, at this fraught political crossroads, some are trying to do just that.
Last year, StoryCorps founder Dave Islay created One Small Step, an initiative designed to get people with different viewpoints talking to each other, and now he is bringing his mobile recording booth to college campuses in an effort to bridge political divides.
Braver Angels, an organization launched by Donald Trump supporters and Hilary Clinton supporters after the 2016 election with a mission to bring Americans together to bridge partisan divides, now offers workshops and training to equip K-12 schools and colleges with the skills to navigate political differences.
Campus Compact, a network of more than 1,000 colleges and universities nationwide dedicated to effective community and civic engagement, offers tools like Better Discourse: A Guide for Bridging Campus Divides in Challenging Times.
And next month here in Massachusetts, the Department of Higher Education and Fitchburg State University are cosponsoring “Civic Discourse in Action: Advancing Debate, Dialogue, and Deliberation in Massachusetts Higher Education,” a conference for faculty and staff to explore how they can help students build better capacity for principled debate and dialogue across differences.
In 1943, halfway through its engagement in the Second World War, America’s best-known painter and illustrator, Norman Rockwell, delivered to his countrymen one of his most famous works: a series of paintings known as “The Four Freedoms.”
Inspired by President Franklin Roosevelt’s “The Four Freedoms” State of the Union address to Congress, Rockwell’s paintings illustrate, in his signature Americana style, “Freedom from Fear,” “Freedom from Want,” “Freedom of Worship,” and “Freedom of Speech.”
Framed prints of “Freedom of Speech,” which depicts a Vermont farmer standing up to express his opinion at a town meeting, hang above my desk at home and on campus, as a reminder of this bedrock American value.
When “The Four Freedoms” were unveiled in 1943, the Saturday Evening Post commissioned four authors to write essays to accompany each illustration in the magazine.
Booth Tarkington wrote a fictional, cautionary parable inspired by “Freedom of Speech,” which imagines a young Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini meeting in the Brenner Pass in 1912, where they plot to take over their countries by suppressing free speech and “purging” their enemies.
Over grapes, wine, and cheese, they lament nations like England and the United States, where people create their own governments, listen to each other’s points of view, and vote their consciences, while conspiring to create societies where dissent is punished and the people live in fear.
“Speech is the expression of thought and will,” the youthful Hitler observes, “Therefore, freedom of speech means freedom of the people. If you prevent them from expressing their will in speech, you have them enchained, an absolute monarchy. Of course, nowadays he who chains the people is called a dictator.”
America’s destiny has always been to be a beacon for free thinking, free speaking, and free democracy; not a nation for dictators or for those, like Charlie Kirk’s assassin, who would suppress the freedom of the people.
And the campuses of America’s colleges and universities should reflect this openness to ideas and contrary views—places for free inquiry where we can choose not to agree with what others have to say, yet defend for all we are worth their right to say it.

Brett Hulsey, known for controversial behavior in the Wisconsin Assembly, has joined the crowded Democratic field for governor in 2026.
“I am running for governor to make Wisconsin better for my family and yours. My grandkids and yours deserve the best schools, roads and clean lakes and beaches,” Hulsey said in his campaign announcement last week.

Hulsey represented Middleton in the state Legislature from 2011 to 2015. Prior to that, he served on the Dane County Board for 14 years, including chairing the Dane County Personnel and Finance Committee.
While in the Assembly, Hulsey was cited for disorderly conduct after police accused him of flipping a nine-year-old boy off his inner tube and taking pictures of him at a Madison beach. He also used $1,200 in campaign funds in 2013 to buy himself a 1987 Volkswagen Cabriolet, which he said he was going to use for parades and campaigning.
Hulsey decided not to run for reelection in the Assembly in 2014 so he could run for governor in 2014. He came in a distant second in the Democratic primary to Mary Burke. 
During his last campaign, Hulsey made national headlines for his plan to go to the 2014 Wisconsin Republican Convention in Milwaukee, dress up as a confederate soldier and hand out Ku Klux Klan hoods as a way of highlighting the policies of then-Gov. Scott Walker, which he said were racist.
Hulsey, a former teacher, cited his outspoken opposition to Act 10, a Walker-era law that stripped teachers and other public employees of collective bargaining rights, as a  reason he decided to run. 
“Attacks on teachers and cuts to school investment are coming home to roost with lower school performance. I will invest in our kids, schools, teachers, and support staff,” Hulsey said. 
Since his time in office, Hulsey has run the housing, energy and environmental consulting business Better Environmental Solutions LLC. 
Hulsey joins a growing group of Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls.
Candidates who have announced so far include Lt. Gov. Sarah Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys, state Rep. Francesca Hong, former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes and Mukwonago beer vendor Ryan Strnad. 
The primary for governor is scheduled for August 2026.
Republicans in the race include U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann.

A year after seeking to reorganize its depleting finances in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the Vermont Roman Catholic Diocese is struggling to cover about $1.5 million and counting in related legal bills.
Under federal law, an institution requesting Chapter 11 protection must pay attorney fees not only for itself but also for officially recognized creditors — which, in the diocese’s case, includes more than 100 claimants alleging sexual abuse by clergy.
The state’s largest religious denomination filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 30, 2024, after a series of misconduct settlements reduced its assets by half, to about $35 million. Since then, the diocese has spent almost 5% of its remaining money on legal bills, forcing it to cut the workweek for staff at its South Burlington headquarters to 30 hours.
“We also have encouraged employees to seek other possible employment opportunities because we cannot guarantee any position at this time,” Vermont Catholic Bishop John McDermott wrote in a letter to parishioners.

The church and creditors are aiming to mediate a preliminary plan by Dec. 31. But the diocese already “has exhausted its unrestricted investments” and is paying for its operating expenses and bankruptcy case with the $3 million gleaned each year from an annual bishop’s appeal and a tax on the income of its 63 parishes, McDermott wrote.
The diocese has paid $582,932 for its bankruptcy lawyers as of Aug. 31, court records show. The Minnesota-based firm of Fredrikson & Byron, which specializes in business law, has received $491,999. As local support, Burlington’s Dinse firm has received $47,369 and Bethel lawyer Raymond Obuchowski has received $43,563.
The church has paid out even more — a total of $843,089 as of July 31 — for the legal fees of three groups who represent abuse claimants and their Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. The national law firm of Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones has received $564,670, the California-based Berkeley Research Group has received $257,140 and the New York state law firm of Lemery Greisler has received $21,278, records show.
When filing for bankruptcy a year ago, the church said it had no choice in joining 40 other U.S. Catholic entities who’ve sought Chapter 11 protection. The Vermont diocese had paid $34.5 million to settle 67 clergy misconduct lawsuits yet still faces 118 more claims dating as far back as 1950.
Going to court hasn’t been cheap. As the church’s chief counsel, Fredrikson & Byron is charging $235 an hour for a paralegal, $485 an hour for an associate and between $565 and $975 an hour for a lawyer, records show.
Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones, acting as lead attorneys for the creditors committee, usually charges as much as $2,250 an hour for a lawyer, but “for the entirety of 2025, the firm will continue to cap its rate for attorneys working on the case at $950 per hour,” a court filing stated.
Vermont Bankruptcy Court Judge Heather Cooper, who must approve all legal fees, has tried to cut costs. She asked the creditors’ counsel to reduce its first quarter expenses by $4,208 after noticing the firm had incorrectly sought compensation for its online legal research platform.
But all involved know legal bills can add up. In an extreme example, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre on Long Island, New York, reported $70 million in attorney fees over four years before reaching a record $323 million bankruptcy court settlement last December.
Under the Chapter 11 process, the Vermont church must present the court with a tally of its assets and liabilities. A judge then will decide whether to allow it to develop a reorganization plan that would require approval from both the court and creditors.
Vermont abuse claimants are seeking church records detailing the diocese’s assets, including a reported $35 million tied to its headquarters and state-level holdings, and all local operations it oversees, starting with 63 parishes with an estimated collective worth of $500 million. The findings are expected to spark future court debate on which assets can be used to compensate creditors.

Katie Britt and Tommy Tuberville to restore funding cuts to Medicaid and SNAP.
The protest, part of the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign Moral Mondays, was organized by clergy and pastors from across the South, and led by Rev. Carolyn Foster of Greater Birmingham Ministries. The group sang a chorus while they marched from the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church to the Capitol.
“Somebody’s killin’ our people, and it’s gone on far too long. And we won’t be silent anymore,” the group sang.

The OBBBA cuts to SNAP will impact the state more than any changes to Medicaid eligibility because Alabama has not expanded Medicaid. Lenice Emanuel, director of the Alabama Institute for Social Justice, said the cuts in the OBBBA should be considered attacks on human rights. According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009.
“These institutions, they depend on Medicaid reimbursements just to exist. So when Medicaid gets cut, hospitals literally close,” Emanuel said. “And when hospitals close, we have people with heart attacks who are being untreated, and we have families traveling for miles when they have an emergency.”
More than 750,000 Alabamians are enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), but SNAP is a completely federal program. Starting in fiscal year 2028, the state will have to pay for 10% of SNAP benefits. In Alabama, that would mean the state would have to pay an additional $208.7 million with current enrollments, according to an August estimate from the Alabama Department of Human Resources.
“This is not just cruel. It is not just bad policy. It is immoral,” Emanuel said. “We should consider childcare a human right. We should consider food in this state a human right. Healthcare should be considered a human right. Dignity should be considered a human right.”
A presbyterian pastor in Vestavia Hills, Leanne Pearce Reed, and a Montgomery pastor, Gary Brower, said they were protesting because it is what Jesus Christ would do.
“That is why we serve the least of these. And in our congregation, like so many faith communities in this state, we give food to our food pantries so that families can come and have enough to eat,” Reed said. “We do all of these things, and then our lawmakers do not do their part to stand up for the least of these. Our lawmakers say we are going to take health care from those who are already vulnerable.”
Hanna Broome, the religious director for Repairers of the Breach, said it is important to remember Alabama’s history in the Civil Rights Movement and to carry that history to bring change today.
“The South is home to deep pain, but I truly believe also transformative potential when the South shifts towards justice, the nation follows,” Broome said. “This is why we gather, not in protest alone, but in prophecy, to organize and to lead. Moral Mondays are our declaration that we will not be silent while policy makers drag this nation backwards.”
Brower urged lawmakers to be more like the Good Samaritan.
“Jesus makes a point of it being good, because there were two people who did walk by, and they were people with power,” Brower said. “They were people with prestige. They were people with voices. They probably even had podcasts. They were able to shape opinions, but when they saw someone on the side of the road, beaten up, stripped, robbed. They walked by.”
Valtoria Jackson, an organizer, said organizers planned to deliver a letter with data of the impacts of the OBBBA to the Montgomery offices of Britt and Tuberville.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)SEATTLE — The mayor of Washington’s biggest city and the state’s attorney general implored President Donald Trump on Monday not to send federal troops here.
This comes after Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed plans over the weekend to dispatch Oregon’s National Guard to nearby Portland. Local leaders fear Seattle could be next as the president federalizes National Guard troops and deploys them to major American cities.
“We do not need the federal government bringing in armored vehicles, semiautomatic weapons, military personnel to make us ‘safer.’ There is not an insurrection here,” Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell said in a Monday morning press conference at City Hall. 
“Our message today is very clear: Stay out of Seattle,” Harrell added.
Federal officials have repeatedly called Seattle unsafe, including last week when Trump suggested moving 2026 FIFA World Cup matches out of the city due to safety concerns. 
Donald Trump Jr. last month called Seattle and Portland “craphole cities” and raised the possibility of sending federal troops.
Harrell appeared alongside Attorney General Nick Brown, Police Chief Shon Barnes, Fire Chief Harold Scoggins and City Council members Sara Nelson and Alexis Mercedes Rinck. 
Seattle City Attorney Ann Davison, a Republican, was not there, though city officials made clear she’s been involved in discussions about how to respond to a troop deployment. 
Harrell and Brown emphasized they haven’t heard anything from the federal government about its plans for Seattle.
In the coming days, Harrell plans to issue an executive order that “will establish how we will specifically communicate and protect our communities, preserve our local control,” and “will strengthen our policies to prevent unconstitutional and unlawful encroachment” in the city. 
On Sunday, Hegseth told Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek that he was sending 200 members of the Oregon National Guard for two months to protect federal property and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Portland. The state and city quickly sued the Trump administration over the deployment. Hundreds protested outside Portland’s ICE facility.
Trump has launched similar military crackdowns in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Federal troops are also expected to arrive in Memphis this week. 
The deployments to Los Angeles and the nation’s capital resulted in legal battles. In California, a federal judge this month ruled sending troops there violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th-century law that bars using troops for domestic policing with limited exceptions. 
In that case, Trump cited federal law allowing the president to call out National Guard troops if “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” The statute also allows for deployments in the case of foreign invasion or if “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”
Washington, D.C., also sued this month over the deployment there.
After the deployment in California in June, Gov. Bob Ferguson, Harrell and other leaders pleaded for peace at local protests to avoid giving Trump a pretense to send troops here.
Brown said attorneys in his office have been working to “make sure that we will be ready to respond if Washington state is ever put into the same position.”
“The only thing consistent from the president’s policy is that he indeed is attacking the people in places that didn’t vote for him or that he views as an opposition,” he said. “And it’s entirely possible, based on the president’s comments and those in his administration, that what we are seeing in Portland will be attempted here.”
Brown attended a conference last week in Washington, D.C., where he saw what the military policing a city looks like.

“To see American troops walking the streets and what that does for that city, and the tension that the residents of Washington, D.C., are feeling, and the fear that business leaders and community members and people who are just visiting that city are experiencing is unprecedented,” he said. “It is un-American and I think it’s ultimately unlawful.”
Harrell was set to talk Monday afternoon with state Adjutant General Gent Welsh, who leads Washington’s National Guard. He said he talked to Ferguson earlier Monday morning. Ferguson posted to social media that his office has been in communication with Kotek’s team in Oregon. Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, was set to be out of state on vacation this week, and then on work-related travel on the East Coast through Oct. 9. 
In February, Ferguson’s top aides debated sending 200 troops from the state’s National Guard to the Canadian border to combat drug trafficking — and get ahead of the president potentially federalizing the Guard.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4634-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-29 15:58:08.950237

The biggest H-1B employer is Triad National Security, which is Los Alamos National Laboratory’s primary contractor, but many rural school districts in New Mexico all have one or more H-1B employee. (Westend61/Getty Images)
President Donald Trump recently announced a new, huge fee for H-1B visa applications, making it far more expensive for employers to hire skilled, foreign workers in a variety of industries. 
In a proclamation Sept. 19, Trump justified the new $100,000 fee for H-1B applications as a way to “address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers.”
Particularly in tech, Trump wrote, companies have used H-1B visas to replace American workers. According to the White House, the number of foreign STEM workers in the United States more than doubled between 2000 and 2019 to almost 2.5 million. Employers, Trump said, have brought in so much low-wage, high-skilled foreign tech labor that “a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens” has resulted. 
Trump’s $100K fee for H-1B visas could have “huge” effect on tech industry

But data Source New Mexico reviewed paints a different picture, at least in New Mexico, and suggests that rural school districts, educational institutions and hospitals might take a big hit if prospective foreign employees have to pay $100,000 to apply to work here.
According to the latest data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency, 479 H-1B employees received approval to work in New Mexico at 104 different employers. The figure includes those whose employers approved their applications this fiscal year, as well as cases in which employers allowed applicants to work in different positions or for new employers. 
While 30 of the employers can reasonably be categorized as “private,” including at tech or engineering firms in New Mexico, the vast majority of employees work in the healthcare, government or education sectors. 
Triad National Security LLC, Los Alamos National Laboratory’s primary contractor, stands out as the state’s biggest H-1B employer.  The contractor employs 69 H-1B visa holders, according to the USCIS data for this federal fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. 
A Triad spokesperson declined to comment. 
The other biggest H-1B employers include Presbyterian Healthcare Services, which has 62 H-1B employees, and the University of New Mexico, which has 50. 
Rural school districts across New Mexico have one or more H-1B visas, according to the data. Forty-seven of the state’s 104 H-1B employers are educational institutions or school districts, according to Source’s review. 
That includes 19 public school districts in New Mexico that each have one H-1B employee in rural areas all over the state, including in Zuni, Hobbs, Dexter, Cuba and elsewhere. 
In a statement to Source New Mexico this week, Stacy Johnston, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions, said H-1B visas are essential for a state with recent significant job losses, including during the recession that began in 2007 and the COVID-19 pandemic. According to DWS data, the state lost about 50,000 jobs between August 2008 and September 2010, then about 100,000 jobs at the onset of the pandemic.
“Even with all the incredible efforts going on in our state to train our homegrown talent, we know we need more people to make our economy thrive,” Johnston said. “H-1B is a long-established tool for businesses to meet their workforce needs, whether it’s world-class physicists and engineers for our cutting-edge tech industries; doctors and dentists to meet our urgent health care needs; or K-12 teachers in rural districts facing severe recruitment challenges.”

The facility in Pennsylvania is 189 miles from the courthouse.In the Maryland case, Abrego Garcia is challenging his removal from the U.S. and asking to remain in the country while he pursues his asylum case. Wrongful removal sparked conflict between branchesAbrego Garcia, who was mistakenly removed to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, has become a flashpoint between the judicial branch and the administration as President Donald Trump pursues an immigration crackdown. The U.S. Supreme Court ordered that the administration must facilitate  Abrego Garcia’s return, and immigration officials brought him back to the U.S. to face criminal charges lodged against him in June.Shortly after his return, the Trump administration tried to remove him to a third country to comply with removal protections from his home country of El Salvador. The administration has continued efforts to remove Abrego Garcia to Uganda and Eswatini, though Costa Rica has also agreed to accept him as a refugee. The Tennessee criminal charges stem from a traffic stop in 2022 that included Abrego Garcia and several people. No charges were filed at the time.The Department of Justice has alleged that Abrego Garcia took part in a long-running conspiracy to smuggle immigrants without legal status across the United States for money. He’s pleaded not guilty to those charges. Asylum denied in 2019Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. without legal authorization in 2011 when he was 16. He applied for asylum in 2019, but because he did not apply for asylum within his first year in the U.S. – the legal deadline for such claims – authorities denied the application. Instead, an immigration judge granted him deportation protections, known as a withholding of removal, because the judge found it likely that Abrego Garcia would face gang violence if he were returned to El Salvador. Federal immigration officials at the time didn’t object to the judge’s withholding of removal order and didn’t find a third country to deport Abrego Garcia.Earlier this year, Abrego Garcia was picking his son up when immigration officials detained him and said his status changed. Days later, he was deported along with hundreds of men to the mega-prison in El Salvador where he later said he experienced psychological and physical torture.",,,,2025-09-29 15:58:08.950237

And Julia’s VSAC Outreach Counselor, Monda Kelley, saw something different.
“She pushed me,” Julia says. “I tried to push her away, and she came back. She reminded me of who I used to be, this kid who loved being outside and in the trees, and who loved nature. Monda showed me that I could turn that love into a career and she showed me how to do it. Without her, honestly I don’t know if I would have gone to college.”
Finding her path
Family life has long been challenging for Julia. Julia’s older sibling faced substance use issues and money was often tight. In 2019, her father passed away from cancer, and her stepfather died in a motorcycle accident a few years later. But her parents always encouraged education, wanting Julia to succeed and have a rewarding career. Her mother, who works part-time from home, has always been a steady presence, encouraging Julia to figure things out and supporting her goals. 
When Julia began meeting with her VSAC Outreach Counselor, Monda, regularly, she grew to appreciate what VSAC’s Talent Search program could offer. “Monda told me I was smart and that she was going to help me,” she recalls. “We went on campus tours, worked on paperwork, and applied for scholarships together. I still remember taking the coach bus around to tour colleges with Monda and others from VSAC.”
Julia initially enrolled at Green Mountain College, where she was drawn to its forestry and ornithology programs, and its proximity to home. After the college closed, she transferred to nearby Castleton to finish her degree. 
The ‘Compost Queen’
At both colleges she attended, Julia immersed herself in hands-on learning and sustainability work. At Green Mountain, she worked in the campus office of sustainability, where one of her jobs was to bike around campus with a trailer to collect recycling and to monitor compost bins in the dining hall. “People used to call me the ‘Compost Queen,’” she says. Her mentor, a junior and the student manager in the Sustainability Office dubbed “Compost Carl,” showed her what environmental stewardship could look like. “I wanted to be just like him.”
At Castleton, she completed a class in student support networks that trained her to help people through tough conversations and crises—skills that now help her both professionally and personally.
From there, she started at the Eastwood Animal Clinic in Rutland as part of a required internship. She worked as a veterinary technician during her internship and later returned in a different role.
“Some of it was really hard,” she says. “Holding an animal’s life in your hands—it’s a lot. But I loved being around animals, and I still work there now as a receptionist and maintenance helper.”
She’s also stayed involved with conservation work. Every Thursday, Julia works on the trails at lands managed by Audubon. “I really love being there,” she says. “Getting to share the outdoors with kids and families—it reminds me of how I started.”
Music, another lifelong love
In addition to her environmental interests, music has been a constant in Julia’s life. “I’ve always played the saxophone,” she says. In middle school, she participated in music festivals and concerts and in high school at Otter Valley, she played in the band and jazz band, a highlight of which was performing at the Berklee Music Festival. During her junior and senior years, she attended Stafford Technical Center, where she studied music and joined the school’s touring “Road Show.”
In college, she continued with band and jazz band. “It got tough during COVID,” she says. “Trying to manage group dynamics in a virtual band practice—but I stuck with it.” She still plays today and plans to continue to incorporate music into her life.
“Stay curious and stay open”
Julia says that for students who don’t see a path forward, the first step is just staying open to possibilities. “Even if you don’t know what you want to do, find someone to help you figure it out. Try things. Ask questions. There’s more to life than what’s in front of you right now.”
She’s also a believer in staying connected to your roots. “The jobs I’ve had, the people I’ve met—I wouldn’t have found those if I’d gone to a different school,” she says. 
“VSAC helped me open that door,” she says. “They saw through me when I couldn’t see anything for myself. I’m really, really glad they did. And, Monda’s been my reference on every job I’ve had. Even when I didn’t want to listen to her, she kept nudging me forward.”
Now, with those experiences behind her and a strong support network still in place, Julia is looking ahead. Her dream job? Working with Vermonters to design gardens, lawns, and landscapes that support pollinators and wildlife, perhaps even with a focus on forestry and conservation.

The North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP has reelected Deborah Dicks Maxwell president. The term will be the third for Maxwell who in 2021 became the first woman to hold the office.
The State Conference announced the election results Sunday. Delegates from across the state cast ballots Saturday, the day the organization held its annual convention in Durham.
“I am deeply humbled by the confidence you have once again placed in me,” Maxwell said in a statement. “I hope to make you proud as we continue the fight to protect democracy, defend civil rights, and uplift our communities.”
Da’Quan Love, executive director of the state conference, said the nation is at a critical moment in its history. Strong leadership at state conferences across the country is needed to protect citizens against what he said are abuses of power by the Trump administration.
“We are at a time in history in which the president of the United States is attempting to wield unprecedented levels of executive authority to apply undue pressure to state legislatures, governors and other duly elected officials,” Love told NC Newsline.
Love noted that the 2026 midterm elections are approaching, and that the U.S. Senate race between former Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, and former Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley, will be an important one for the country.  That race could potentially flip control of the Senate in favor of Democrats.   
Love said Cooper and Whatley were invited to the State Conference convention but only Cooper attended.
Here’s a list of the other State Conference officers elected Saturday:

Corine Mack was elected 1st Vice President.
Antonio Blow was elected 2nd Vice President.
Mary Degree was elected 3rd Vice President.

,DC,2025-09-29 18:52:06+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Hundreds of thousands of federal employees face furloughs under Trump shutdown plans,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/hundreds-thousands-federal-employees-face-furloughs-under-trump-shutdown-plans,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration began posting plans over the weekend that detail how hundreds of thousands of federal workers will be furloughed during a government shutdown, while others will keep working without being paid. The updated guidance gives the clearest picture yet into how President Donald Trump and White House budget director Russ Vought hope to reduce the size and scope of government when given increased authority over the federal workforce during a funding lapse. A shutdown will begin Wednesday unless Republicans and Democrats in Congress reach agreement on a stopgap spending bill. Congressional leaders were set to meet Monday afternoon with Trump, but it was unclear if any agreement would result that would avert a shutdown.The Defense Department’s plan shows it would keep about 406,500 of its 741,500 civilian employees working without pay during the shutdown, with the remaining going on furlough. The nearly 2.1 million military personnel housed within the department would continue to work throughout a shutdown but would not be paid until after it ends. The plan says the Defense Department believes operations to secure the U.S. southern border, Middle East operations, Golden Dome for America defense system, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions are the “highest priorities” in the event of a shutdown. Medical and dental services, including private sector care under the TRICARE health care program, would largely continue at the Defense Department, though “(e)lective surgery and other routine/elective procedures in DoW medical and dental facilities are generally not excepted activities, unless the deferral or delay of such procedures would impact personnel readiness or deployability.”Thousands of workers to be sent home from HHSThe Health and Human Services Department plans to furlough about 32,500 of its nearly 80,000 employees during a shutdown. The various components of HHS — including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Food and Drug Administration, and National Institutes of Health — have individual plans for a shutdown. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services plans to retain 3,311, or 53%, of its employees during a shutdown and “will maintain the staff necessary to make payments to eligible states for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).”The CDC plans to have 4,891, or 35.88%, of its employees as well as those at the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry keep working. The contingency plans says that “(r)esponses to urgent disease outbreaks and continuing efforts to support the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA), and the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program” would continue during a shutdown. The CDC would not be able to undertake several other activities, including providing “guidance to state and local health departments implementing programs to protect the public's health (e.g., opioid overdose prevention, HIV prevention, diabetes prevention).”Departments with plansHere is a list of the departments that have posted updated contingency plans in September:Defense Department contingency planEducation Department contingency planHealth and Human Services contingency planHomeland Security Department contingency planLabor Department contingency planJustice Department contingency planState Department contingency planSocial Security Administration contingency planHere is a list of the departments that hadn’t posted updated contingency plans as of Monday afternoon:Agriculture Department contingency planCommerce Department contingency planEnergy Department contingency planHousing and Urban Development contingency planInterior Department contingency planTransportation Department contingency planTreasury Department contingency planVeterans Affairs Department contingency planStates Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. Bureau reached out to the  departments that didn’t have contingency plans posted to ask when those might become public.A spokesperson for the USDA wrote in an email the department “is prepared for all contingencies regarding Department operations, including critical services and supports.” A State Department spokesperson said leadership “is undergoing all necessary planning efforts to sustain critical missions.”Federal employees who work  without pay will be paid after the shutdown concludes. According to the Office of Personnel Management — the executive branch’s chief human resources agency — “after the lapse in appropriations has ended, employees who were furloughed as the result of the lapse will receive retroactive pay for those furlough periods.” The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 requires furloughed government employees to receive back pay as a result of a government shutdown. That law does not apply to federal contractors, who face uncertainty in getting paid during a shutdown. Ashley Murray, Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda and Jacob Fischler contributed to this report.",,,,2025-09-29 14:56:56.014178

Upstairs, groups of teens got to learn about topics such as starting a business and working at nonprofit organizations. Downstairs, one group of students browsed tables, talking to representatives from local colleges, nonprofits, and more. One table passed out free candy-colored popcorn.
Christopher Steverson, a senior at Jackson’s Callaway High School, was among the many students in attendance.

“I love making money,” Steverson said. “Money’s always there, you just have to find a way to get it.”
Steverson, 18, runs a lawn care business with his father, and is working on his own streetwear line and has two properties from his father.
He’s one of about 200 high school students from the Jackson metro area who attended workshops and received hands-on experience on college and career readiness, financial literacy and business skills Wednesday at the Entrepreneurship and Employability Skills Symposium. 
United Way of the Capital Area and Jackson State University TRIO Talent Search partnered to put on the event. Tiffany Anderson, the United Way affiliate’s economic mobility coordinator, said young people are working in the gig economy.
“They’re doing braids. They are doing makeup. They are influencers. They’re Ubering,” Anderson said. “They’re doing all the things, so we just want to set them up for success and to do things the right way.”

Steverson attended to network and explore his interests. He learned about improving his credit score and investing in an individual retirement account. He hoped his peers at the event learned new ways to make money.
“I feel like with money, I have the opportunity to change things that not too many people will be able to without,” Steverson said.
At lunch, students listened to a speech from Nick, Khaliq and Kareem Brown from Boss Brothers Universe, a Jackson-based company that publishes books and online videos teaching children about financial literacy and entrepreneurship.

Kymora Dorsey, who attended last year, was excited to volunteer this year as a youth ambassador for United Way. Dorsey, 17, is a senior at Callaway High School.
“I realized that it was a great idea for people to understand what it means to have a business and get an understanding of financial literacy as well as the opportunity to earn $200 as a reward for their ideas,” Dorsey said.
To cap off the day, teams of students competed in a “Shark Tank”-style competition for cash prizes. Each team was coached by a local business owner. This year, two teams won, and each participant earned $250. The students could choose whether to start a bank account with the money or invest it in their business.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The final credits were set to roll at the Providence Place Mall’s Showcase Cinemas by Jan. 31. But the court-appointed receiver for the mall wants to end the show early.
The move was prompted by National Amusements — Showcase’ parent company — opting not to renew its existing lease for Providence Place Mall Cinemas 16 after the Jan. 31, 2026 expiration, Mark Russo, the court receiver, wrote in a Sept. 19 motion in Providence County Superior Court, first reported by Providence Business News.
Rather than wait out the final months under the existing operator, Russo has asked Superior Court Judge Brian Stern for permission to break the lease with National Amusements and find a new company to run the 16-screen movie theater.
A hearing on the proposal is scheduled for 3 p.m. Friday in Providence County Superior Court.
The proposed swap comes as part of the nearly yearlong efforts to shore up and revitalize the downtown shopping center, which has struggled to retain its luster amid changing shopping habits and loss of flagship stores, some of which were never replaced. In October 2024, the property was placed into court-appointed receivership after a group of private lenders alleged they were owed $259 million from a 2011 mortgage loan taken out by the property owner, Brookfield Properties.
Russo and his former law practice partner John Dorsey — now a federal bankruptcy judge who has since been removed from the receivership case — were brought in by the court to manage the transition. Over the last 11 months, the pair of West Warwick attorneys brought in a new management company, added security and began investments to repair aging infrastructure. 
In July, they secured Stern’s permission to advertise the mall for sale to new owners, with plans for a listing to hit the market in September. 
As of Monday, the property had not yet been publicly listed online by Jones Lang LaSalle, the Chicago firm hired to serve as the broker. 
Russo in an email Monday dismissed concerns that losing Showcase could hurt a future sale, or other revitalization efforts.
“I’m not concerned at this point,” Russo said. “I feel good about the likelihood of the cinema space continuing to be an entertainment and movie venue for our patrons.”
He did not respond to follow up questions regarding other tenants’ leases and the pending sale listing.
Russo’s court motion seeks to retain the equipment and furniture in the top floor movie theater, giving National Amusements first rights in court to be reimbursed for the fair market value.
National Amusements and Showcase did not respond to inquiries for comment Monday. The Massachusetts-based media company has run the movie theater in downtown Providence since 2003, buying the adjacent IMAX Theatre in 2008. 
The 128,000-square-foot cinema paid 9.8% of the mall’s annual rent as of January 2024 — the second largest contributor after Boscov’s — according to a June 2024 report by ratings agency KBRA. In the same report, issued five months before the receivership, KBRA downgraded all six classes of its ratings for the mall’s commercial mortgage-backed security because of the heightened credit risk posed by the past due mortgage loan. 
The 1.4-million-square-foot shopping center opened in 1999 after a series of delays and changes to financing and development terms. The final funding package for the $460 million project featured a state bond and a tax treaty with the city of Providence. The state deal used mall sales tax revenue to repay the debt on the bond that paid for construction. The state made its final $73 million payment on the bond in 2019.
The 30-year tax treaty with the city of Providence is set to end in 2028. Under the current agreement, the mall pays $500,000 a year in city property taxes. If taxed at fiscal 2025 city commercial rates, the property would be paying nearly $24.9 million in taxes based on its 2024 city tax-assessed value of $708.7 million.
The pandemic has been widely blamed for the demise of malls nationwide. But in Providence, many consider the 2019 departure of founding anchor Nordstrom as the beginning of the mall’s decline. As of May 2021, the mall and attached parking garage were valued $240 million — less than half the $558 appraisal when the mortgage loan was secured in 2011. 
Meanwhile, movie theaters have struggled to find an audience in the post-pandemic era, with three-quarters of adults opting to watch new movies via streaming services rather than in a theater, according to a Sept. 25 survey from the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Those surveyed cited convenience and cost as reasons why they opted to stream from home rather than head to a theater. 
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.

Emanuel Cleaver, D-Kansas City, testified Sept. 11 against a redistricting plan that would gerrymander his district in favor of Republicans (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Gov. Mike Kehoe on Sunday signed the new Missouri congressional district map intended to bring Republicans another seat, and opponents responded with a new lawsuit challenging the plan.
Lawmakers, acting at the insistence of President Donald Trump, finished a special session on Sept. 12 by passing a bill targeting the 5th District in Kansas City and placing a constitutional amendment on the 2026 ballot to make it more difficult to pass constitutional proposals by initiative petition.
The new lawsuit, like others filed previously, contends that no authority exists in the Missouri Constitution allowing lawmakers to revise congressional districts in the absence of new census data. The new case also argues that the districts are not legal because they stretch for hundreds of miles across the state.
Effort to force vote on gerrymandered Missouri congressional map hits roadblock

The law will take effect Dec. 11, in time for candidate filing in the 2026 elections, unless blocked by the courts or a referendum petition. 
To bring enough voters into the 5th District, which currently includes portions of only Jackson and Clay counties, the drafters destroyed the idea that districts should be as compact as possible, the new lawsuit filed in Jackson County contends.
U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat, has represented the 5th District since 2005.
Kehoe, who has said the courts will decide if what lawmakers did was legal, said in a news release that he signed the bill to make the state’s districts align with voter views overall.
“We believe this map best represents Missourians, and I appreciate the support and efforts of state legislators, our congressional delegation, and President Trump in getting this map to my desk,” Kehoe said.
Opponents have argued that the new map disenfranchises a large portion of Missouri voters. Democrats currently hold two of the state’s eight districts, or 25%, while statewide elections show about 40% of voters support Democratic candidates.
Filed by the National Redistricting Foundation, the legal arm of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, the lawsuit enlists voters from around the state as plaintiffs, raising objections to changes in other districts as well the lines in the Kansas CIty area.
“Missouri’s mid-decade gerrymander is in clear violation of the state constitution,” Marina Jenkins, executive director of the foundation, said in a news release. “It was not prompted by the law or a court order; it was the result of Republican lawmakers in Missouri following partisan directives from politicians in Washington, D.C.”
The constitutional standards for redistricting include districts that are compact, contiguous, as equal as possible in population and do not split communities of interest.
“Every redistricting plan since the 1950s has placed as much of the Jackson County portion of Kansas City as possible in a single district, and more recently, also brought in a substantial portion of the Clay County parts of Kansas City as well,” the lawsuit states. “In fact, the Jackson County portion of Kansas City has not been split in more than 50 years.”
Under the new map, the lawsuit states, Kansas City’s central business district is in three separate districts. The new 4th District stretches from downtown Kansas City to Fort Leonard Wood in Pulaski County, 200 miles away.
Eastern portions of the city that remain in the 5th District are now in a district with Rolla, in southeast Missouri, also 200 miles away, while the remaining downtown portions are part of the 6th District, which runs across northeast Missouri to the Mississippi River.
“The configuration of congressional districts in the Kansas City area under (the redistricting bill) violates the mandatory compactness requirement on nearly every level,” the lawsuit contends.
The National Redistricting Foundation lawsuit is the fourth filed since Kehoe announced plans for the special session.
Judge hears arguments in case seeking to toss Missouri’s new congressional maps

The first was filed by the NAACP of Missouri, which contends that Kehoe did not have authority to call lawmakers into session for redistricting or to change initiative majority requirements. That case is in the hands of Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh, who heard arguments Sept. 15.
The other lawsuits are in their early procedural stages.
One, filed Sept. 12 in Jackson County makes similar arguments to the new case about the compactness of the new districts, while also questioning whether the bill mistakenly places the same precinct in two different districts.
Another, filed Sept. 12 in Cole County, is based on an argument common to all four cases — that the state constitution doesn’t allow mid-cycle redistricting. 
Only once since the current constitution was written have lawmakers altered congressional districts between censuses, and that was in the 1960s when a U.S. Supreme Court decision forced a national reexamination of districts to balance populations.
The redistricting provision of the constitution says that after receiving census data, lawmakers “shall by law divide the state into districts corresponding with the number of representatives to which it is entitled…”
The section is silent on the power to do it at any other time and that, the new lawsuit contends, means it is prohibited.
“The General Assembly ignored the state constitution’s procedural limitation authorizing congressional redistricting to take place only when new decennial census results are certified to the governor,” the lawsuit states.

(Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Supreme Court sided Friday with a woman who lost a job offer when she refused to get a COVID-19 vaccine, rejecting the employer’s arguments that federal law supersedes a state law restriction on questioning the sincerity of religious beliefs.
Katlin Keeran, an occupational therapist who lived in Johnson County, initially cited concerns about the use of fetal cells in the development of COVID-19 vaccines. But under questioning by Powerback Rehabilitation, she said she had previously gotten the flu vaccine but didn’t want to get the COVID-19 vaccine because “I am not familiar with it.” The company rescinded its employment offer.
Keeran filed a complaint with the Kansas Department of Labor, saying the company violated a law passed by the Legislature during a 2021 special session that allowed individuals to opt out of a federal vaccine mandate and made it illegal for employers to question the sincerity of religious beliefs.
Because Powerback receives Medicare and Medicaid funding, it was subject to the vaccine mandate as a condition for receiving those dollars. Federal law empowers employers to question the sincerity of a religious belief.
Powerback argued it was impossible to comply with both federal and state laws, and that federal law should prevail.
Justice Caleb Stegall, who was appointed by Gov. Sam Brownback, wrote the opinion for a 4-2 majority. He said the company’s argument was “simple and alluring at first blush” but “incorporates a deft sleight-of-hand.”
Federal law allows, but doesn’t require, an inquiry, Stegall wrote, and the state has an interest in preserving religious liberty.
“Prohibiting an inquiry by an employer into the sincerity of a religious belief is clearly rationally related to protecting cherished liberty interests,” Stegall wrote.
The court reversed a Johnson County District Court ruling that found the state law unconstitutional.
Justice Melissa Standridge, who was appointed by Gov. Laura Kelly, wrote a dissent that was joined by Justice Eric Rosen, who was appointed  by Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.
Standridge wrote that Kansas law “stands as an obstacle” to federal objectives. An employer should be justified, she wrote, in seeking supporting information about an prospective employee’s religious accommodation.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/4F5A1686-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-09-29 13:58:27.649840

The FBI is also hoping to mine tips from the public as it continues its investigation into the incident in which authorities say the suspect, Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, also set the building ablaze before being shot and killed by law enforcement.
A total of 12 people were shot in the attack, police said, with five fatalities, including the alleged shooter.
It’s unclear exactly why Sanford chose the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the target for his attack.

On Monday, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered all U.S. and Michigan flags on all public and state government buildings to be lowered to half-staff to honor the victims through Friday.
Whitmer, in a statement, said her heart is breaking for the community known commonly as the Mormon church.
“Violence anywhere, especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable,” Whitmer said. “I am grateful to the first responders who took action quickly. To honor those we have lost, I am ordering flags to be lowered across Michigan. Our state is in mourning alongside the victims, their families, and the entire community in Grand Blanc Township.”
Whitmer also spoke at press conference Monday afternoon in Grand Blanc Township.
“I know that this community is reeling right now, and I want you to know that the state of Michigan has your back. You’re grief is our grief,” Whitmer said. “There’s one thing I know about Michigan is that we get through hard things together, and that’s who we are.”

Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, a candidate for the governor’s office in 2026, said he was also devastated by the shooting.
“Such a horrific act of violence – towards anyone, anywhere – is unjustified,” Gilchrist said. “I’m grateful to the local police officers, fire, and EMS for their quick response. Let’s keep holding each other close.”
State Rep. David Martin (R-Davison), whose district covers Grand Blanc in Genesee County, called the incident a “cowardly attack” on the community.
“On a Sunday, in a sacred house of worship, families should feel nothing but peace and safety. That was stolen from them today in the most horrific and evil way,” Martin said. “My heart breaks for the victims, their families, and everyone in the community who has been shaken by this senseless violence.”
Martin also thanked what he said was a swift and “courageous” response from local law enforcement, as well as an officer from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, who responded in addition to emergency medical personnel.
State Sen. John Cherry (D-Flint), who represents a large portion of Genesee County, including Grand Blanc, said the incident was a tragic act of violence.
“To terrorize people in a place of worship, where their hopes are highest and their faith strongest, is particularly sickening and has rocked our entire community,” Cherry said in a statement. “The congregation, the people of Grand Blanc, and our Genesee County community as a whole will need to heal and rebuild emotionally and physically, and I hope we can all come together to support them and one another during these trying and terrifying times.”
U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) said she was praying for the Mormon community, the victims’ and their families, calling violence in a place of worship “despicable.”
U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) was quick to offer her support and prayers for the Grand Blanc and Mormon community, while also pushing the brake pedal on snap judgments regarding the shooter’s motives, which remain unknown.
“We will know more in the coming days and weeks. And there will be more to say,” Slotkin said in a statement. “But today, we send our strength to those involved who must now try and pick up the pieces and grieve.”
Little is known about Sanford and why he chose the Mormon church as a target for his attack. The FBI Detroit Field Office on late Sunday evening used social media to request any person with information that could assist the investigation to call its tip line or visit its online tip exchange.

UPDATE: Regarding the critical incident in Grand Blanc, Michigan, the FBI is asking that members of the public share any information that would assist in this investigation. We encourage them to please report that to 1-800-CALL-FBI or https://t.co/1WDK57FdRt. pic.twitter.com/Fw3wOUZb3I

What is known is that Sanford was a Burton resident who fought in the Iraq War, and the license plate of his truck, which officials say he used to ram into the building before opening fire on congregants, indicated that he was a veteran of the Iraq War.
Bridge Michigan reported that Google Maps images of Sanford’s home address in Burton, captured in June of this year, show that he had a campaign sign for President Donald Trump affixed to a fence surrounding the small brick house. Bridge also reported that records show Sanford signed two recent ballot proposal petitions.
The first was for the Unlock Michigan proposal that sought to repeal Michigan’s statutory allowance for sweeping gubernatorial powers during a state of emergency, which was wielded by Whitmer in the worst days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The other was supporting Right to Life Michigan’s attempt to keep the state’s abortion ban in place after the fall of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade precedent that protected abortion rights and access to reproductive health care nationwide.
Other reports have noted that his son had a rare pancreatic disease.

(Hughes campaign photo)Missy Hughes, Wisconsin’s former top economic development official, announced her campaign for governor Monday, positioning herself as an effective non-politician with a strong economic track record.
Hughes served as Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. (WEDC) CEO and secretary from Oct. 1, 2019, until this past Sept. 19. She becomes the seventh Democrat to join the field for the party’s nomination after Gov. Tony Evers announced in July that he will not seek a third term in 2026.
“Listen, I’m not a politician. I’m different than other folks you’ve seen run for governor. That’s the point,” Hughes says in her launch video released Monday morning.
An executive for 17 years at Organic Valley before Evers appointed her to lead the WEDC, Hughes says in the video that the cooperative, which markets organic dairy products sourced from more than 1,800 farms across the U.S., topped $1 billion in revenue during her tenure.
At the WEDC, Hughes headed Wisconsin’s negotiations with major employers expanding their operations or relocating to the state. During her tenure, “major companies like Milwaukee Tool, Microsoft, Eli Lilly, Kikkoman and more committed to invest over $10 billion and create 45,000 good-paying jobs across Wisconsin,” the Hughes campaign stated in a debut email.
Hughes also raised the department’s profile in small business and local community economic development. The WEDC oversaw many of the state’s COVID-19 relief programs, which focused heavily on small business recovery from the short but sharp economic hit brought on by the pandemic.
Among the highest profile efforts was the Main Street Bounceback, which directed $10,000 grants to more than 9,500 small businesses across Wisconsin.
The WEDC is also the lead state agency involved in Wisconsin’s successful application for federal support to establish a technology hub centered on the state’s biohealth sector.
Hughes’ launch video pitches her campaign as focused on the economy but also nods to issues of personal freedom that have been part of Democrats’ messaging ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
“As governor, I’ll create a Main Street economy that includes you, and works for you,” Hughes says in the video. “Where we strengthen our Main Streets, make sure Wisconsinites have higher wages and housing they can afford, our families have child care and health care that doesn’t break the bank, and our public schools prepare our kids for the future.”
Over shots of the White House and then a gleaming urban office tower, she adds, “I’m not going to go looking for a fight, but I’ll stand up to anyone, from the White House to Wall Street, who comes after your rights or tries to make your life harder.”
Hughes is the second Democrat with an Evers administration background to seek the party’s nomination in the August 2026 primary. Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez was the first to enter the race, declaring her candidacy less than 24 hours after Evers announced he was not running.
Other declared hopefuls are Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison). Milwaukee factory worker and baseball stadium beer vendor Ryan Strnad and former state Rep. Brett Hulsey are also seeking the nomination.

A Mississippi infant recently died from pertussis, or whooping cough, the State Department of Health announced Monday. 
It is the first whooping cough death reported in Mississippi since 2012 and the third since 2008. 
Whooping cough cases in Mississippi are the highest they have been in at least a decade.
The infant was not eligible to be vaccinated against the disease due to his or her age, the agency said in a statement. 
State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney has repeatedly said that vaccines are the best defense against diseases like pertussis.
Because infants are not eligible for the pertussis vaccination until they are two months old, the health department recommends that pregnant women, grandparents and family or friends who may come in close contact with an infant get booster shots to ensure they do not pass the illness to children.
This year, 115 pertussis cases have been reported to the health department, compared to 49 total last year. 
Over 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported across the U.S. this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The highly contagious respiratory illness is named for the “whooping” sound people make when gasping for air after a coughing fit. It may begin like a common cold but can last for weeks or months and make it difficult to breathe. Babies younger than 1 year are at greatest risk for getting whooping cough, and can have severe complications that often require hospitalization. 
Mississippi for many years had the highest child vaccination rates in the nation. But rates have fallen since 2023, when a federal judge ruled that parents can opt out of vaccinating their children for school with a religious exemption.  
The pertussis vaccination is administered in a five-dose series for children under 7 and booster doses for older children and adults. 
Immunity from pertussis vaccination wanes over time, and there is not a routine recommendation for boosters. 
The Mississippi Health Department offers vaccinations to children and uninsured or underinsured adults at county health departments.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/01135248/3X0A5127.jpg,,,2025-09-29 13:58:27.649840

From left: Commissioners Kim Lowe of Kearney, Bruce Bailey of Lincoln (chair) and J. Michael Coffey of Omaha. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The last two members of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission who served with a former director who faces federal charges alleging public corruption are resigning at the governor’s request.
Liquor Commissioner Bruce Bailey of Lincoln, who served as commission chair, confirmed to the Nebraska Examiner on Monday that Gov. Jim Pillen had personally asked for his resignation as well as that of Commissioner Kim Lowe of Kearney. Neither commissioner is implicated in the federal indictment.
Bailey said Pillen personally called Thursday. Bailey submitted his resignation Monday morning and said Lowe was on her way in to resign at the time of the call. The Governor’s Office confirmed both resignations had been received.
“They’re moving on,” Bailey said.
Pillen’s office will accept applications to succeed Bailey and Lowe on the governor-appointed board by 5 p.m. on Oct. 17. Applicants must reside in either the 1st or 3rd Congressional Districts for the seats, respectively, and can apply online at https://governor.nebraska.gov/boards-commissions-open-positions or mail applications to the Governor’s Office.
“I appreciate the willingness of Bruce and Kim to serve, and I thank them for the time they have been on the commission,” Pillen said in a statement.
Pillen’s latest calls for resignations from the board came Thursday, Bailey said, a day after federal charges were unsealed against former Liquor Commission Executive Director Hobert “Hobie” Rupe. Rupe has pleaded not guilty to seven federal charges.
The calls also came the same day Pillen rejected all proposed rule changes by the commission that were still pending, including one the governor said would “effectively provide government permission for customers to touch the dancers at a strip club,” which he said was “particularly troubling” in light of Rupe’s indictment. 
Ex-Nebraska Liquor Commission director charged with taking cash, sexual favors in strip club probe

Federal prosecutors, who worked alongside the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office that had employed Rupe decades ago, allege Rupe solicited cash, lap dances, sexual favors and free drinks from two Lincoln strip clubs while also turning a “blind eye” to liquor license violations that Rupe should have reported. Rupe also allegedly used his position to investigate and target competitor venues.
Bailey and Lowe voted 2-0 in May to suspend Rupe, without pay, pending the investigation. Rupe resigned the following month, ending his service that began January 2004, ending his service that began January 2004.
Like Rupe, Brent Zywiec, a partial owner of The Office Gentleman’s Club and The Night Before Lounge who also is named in the federal indictment, has pleaded not guilty.
The other Liquor Commission member is retired Judge J. Michael Coffey, whom Pillen appointed in June. Coffey succeeded Harry Hoch. Jr., who had served on the commission since 2019. Hoch had 40 years of industry knowledge in liquor and told the Examiner his resignation came as Pillen sought “more cannabis experience” on the board.
Medical cannabis impacts
One reason: Voters in November approved creating the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission and placed the three members of the Liquor Control Commission on it, along with up to two at-large appointments.
Bailey said he felt Pillen also sought his resignation due to his more permissive view of medical cannabis in light of voters’ wishes. He said some in the executive branch viewed him as a “roadblock.” 
At recent meetings, Bailey had been vocal when he felt the commission was being too restrictive, mainly at the lead of Pillen’s at-large appointees, who prefer a stricter system. Among those positions, Bailey had called to allow smoking or vaping medical cannabis and to increase the number of cultivator licenses to boost the supply chain.

Michael Coffey of Omaha. At right is Bo Botelho, general counsel for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services contracted to work with the commission. Sept. 2, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Members of the public attending the meetings had also praised Bailey for meeting with them one-on-one and raising their concerns.
The Medical Cannabis Commission was set to meet Tuesday but appears unlikely to approve any cultivator licenses ahead of a voter-set Oct. 1 deadline to begin issuing the first licenses. Dr. Monica Oldenburg, commission chair, had been designated to review and evaluate any applications received by last Tuesday, alongside Lowe and Bailey.
The Liquor Control Commission had been set to meet on Wednesday but will no longer meet due to a lack of members. Bailey said the commission has a “great staff” in its stead. Lowe described the staff as “rock stars.”
Oldenburg did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment.
The resignations mean that, once replaced, Pillen will have appointed all three members to oversee liquor and the two others to oversee medical cannabis. Members serve staggered six-year terms.
Pillen has said the new appointments will follow his example with Coffey, whom he said “Nebraskans can trust to restore strong leadership and governance to this troubled independent agency.” Pillen’s office has said he has no intention of retooling and moving the agency under the governor’s direct control.
Reflecting on commission service
In Bailey’s 11 years on the Liquor Commission, he reflected on the group’s work to implement new software for license holders and to create a new education program for bartenders and others that is set to start soon and he said is “99% complete.”
“We’ve accomplished some good things,” Bailey said.
Bailey’s service also coincided with the 2017 vote to end liquor licenses in Whiteclay, Nebraska, establishments that were criticized for years of having contributed to alcohol-related problems on the adjacent Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where alcohol possession and sales were legally prohibited.

Lowe, who joined the Liquor Commission in 2021, said serving on the board was a great opportunity. She also highlighted the move to a new software system and said she was “very proud” of what had been accomplished in her tenure.
On the Rupe situation, Bailey said he is still surprised by the allegations, reeling and second-guessing himself and wondering, “Should I have seen something?”
“The governor said we should have known. I don’t know how we could have. We certainly don’t keep track what people do in their off time,” Bailey said.
Bailey said he partly wishes he had known and had an opportunity to intervene and at least say, “Hey, dumb s—, don’t do it.”
“I liked him a lot as a friend,” Bailey said of Rupe, “and I’m sorry that he just simply went off the deep end.”
Lowe said she had no knowledge of what Rupe is accused of doing. Hoch did not immediately return a call seeking comment Monday.
Asked her thoughts on the Liquor Commission moving forward, Lowe said: “I just hope the best for this organization.”

But while we celebrate, it’s important to remember that the biggest threats to Nevada’s public lands aren’t behind us. They’re moving through Congress right now, and if passed, they could forever reshape our landscapes.
Two pieces of legislation in particular deserve Nevadans’ attention: the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act (SNEDCA), which was scheduled to be heard in Congress on October 1 but has since been postponed, and the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, which is advancing rapidly on Capitol Hill, having just passed out of House Natural Resources on September 17. Together, these bills would sell off and industrialize Nevada’s public lands on a scale we haven’t seen in years.
SNEDCA is being promoted as a balanced bill that conserves lands while allowing for development. Supporters point to provisions that designate certain areas as protected. But Nevadans should look closely. At its core, this bill is a sweeping public lands sell-off.
SNEDCA would open tens of thousands of acres in Clark County for disposal, turning our desert into a land bank for real estate developers. SNEDCA doubles down on a sprawl approach to development at a time when we desperately need smarter planning, water conservation, and genuine climate resilience. We know that sprawl raises costs for working class folks, both directly and indirectly, and detracts from mass transportation services. This bill fails to guarantee any of the land proposed for disposal would actually be used for affordable housing.
The consequences are not abstract. Development on this scale fragments wildlife habitat, threatens desert tortoise populations, and paves over landscapes that recharge groundwater and absorb carbon. Once developed, these lands cannot be restored. We lose them forever.
This is exactly the type of land sell-off Nevadans pushed back against during the federal reconciliation process, when proposals to liquidate Nevada’s deserts raised alarm bells statewide, and indeed, across the country.
At the same time, another bill moving through Congress threatens Nevada’s lands in a different way. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would fundamentally change how mining companies are allowed to operate on public lands.
Under current law, mining companies must demonstrate a valid mineral discovery before they can use federal land for waste dumps or processing. This safeguard ensures that sensitive lands are not simply commandeered for industrial use without scrutiny. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would gut that requirement, allowing companies to dump toxic mine waste on public lands without ever proving that valuable minerals exist.
For Nevada, home to more mining activity than any other state, the impact would be staggering. The result would be more toxic pollution on public land, more scarred landscapes, and less accountability for corporations.
Taken together, SNEDCA and the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act represent a one-two punch: one bill sells off Nevada’s lands to developers, while the other makes it easier for mining companies to pollute what’s left. Both bills prioritize corporate profits over community well-being, over Tribal sovereignty, and over the conservation values Nevadans have fought to uphold for decades.
We know what happens when we fail to protect public lands. Red Rock Canyon, Avi Kwa Ame, and Gold Butte did not gain protections by accident. They were defended through years of community organizing, advocacy, and public outcry. Tribes, conservationists, recreationists, and everyday residents came together to demand that these landscapes be safeguarded for future generations. If Congress approves SNEDCA or the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, we risk unraveling decades of progress in a matter of months.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Nevada can pursue genuine conservation and responsible economic development without selling out our public lands. We should be expanding access to parks and trails, supporting Tribal stewardship of ancestral lands, and protecting biodiversity in the face of climate change. We should not be doubling down on extractive and short-sighted policies.
The choice before us is clear. We can allow corporations and their lobbyists to dictate the future of Nevada’s open spaces, or we can stand up for the values that make our state unique.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uscapitoljune302025ashleymurray-scaled-e1759166037351-1024x612.jpg,,,2025-09-29 13:58:27.649840

General Manager Rich Benton said Sikorsky will get years' worth of work.,"Stratford-based Sikorsky has won a $10 billion contract to build helicopters for the U.S. Marine Corps.
The recently-renamed U.S. Department of War announced the contract late Friday afternoon.
The contract calls for the company to make almost a hundred CH-53K transport helicopters.
Sikorsky General Manager Rich Benton said the company will get years’ worth of work.
“We’re gonna be building 53K’s at least from now to 2033,” Benton said. “So pretty big deal for workforce, here, pretty big deal for Sikorsky, but also a pretty big deal for Connecticut. We invested heavily in the Connecticut supply chain.”
Many other companies that make parts and supplies for Sikorsky also employ Connecticut residents.
“It really is a foundational element, when we think about the number of aircraft we’re gonna build, the hours that go into this aircraft, and the number of jobs,” Benton said. “It’s really gonna lay the foundation for the entire Sikorsky enterprise, really for the next five to 10 years.”
Sikorsky is a major employer in Connecticut, with more than 7,000 workers in the state. It has locations in Bridgeport, Stratford, Trumbull and Shelton. An additional 3,000 Sikorsky employees work outside the state.
The CH-53K helicopters are used to move troops and supplies.

The rollout comes more than a month after Virginia’s colleges and universities, as well as others around the country, opened for the 2026-2027 school year. The launch also follows a lengthy overhaul, which the agency said will “simplify” and “modernize” the application process. The department has also made changes to the formulas used to determine aid eligibility.
The deadline to publish the revamped FAFSA form was set for October 1 by Congress and then-President Joe Biden.
Virginia braces for changes to student aid programs

The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, the coordinating body for the state’s colleges and universities, stated it has already begun promoting it to students and their families.
“We’re happy about the release of FAFSA and that things are going smoothly so far,” said Erin McGrath, SCHEV Associate Director of college access and PK12 Outreach, in a statement to The Mercury.
Virginia Community Colleges, which represents 23 colleges in the commonwealth, added that it is “pleased” about the release. The delay with the application process created uncertainty for  Virginia’s higher education institutions.
“After a few challenging years, the VCCS is pleased about the early release of the FAFSA for Aid Year 2026-2027,” said Laurie Owens, director of financial aid for VCCS. “We look forward to a more streamlined process for our students and families through the simplified contributor invite process as well as the real-time identity verification process. Financial aid will never be simple, but enhancements such as these will certainly help.” 
On Aug. 27, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon certified to Congress that the 2026–27 FAFSA form would launch “on time” in the fall after a “successful” beta test with education leaders, students and families took place in Florida in the same month.
The agency said 97% of respondents reported “satisfaction” with the form, and 90% said it took a “reasonable time” to complete it.
The number of 2026-2027 FAFSA applications has increased from 43,531 on Sept. 24 to 183,752 as of Sept. 25.
Out of a total of 183,752 applications, the agency reported that 53% had been submitted as of Sept. 25. A total of 31% had been processed, and 29% had been processed without rejection.
“I am extremely proud to announce the earliest launch of the FAFSA form in history, which ensures American students and families have access to critical resources as they begin or continue their postsecondary education journey,” McMahon said in a statement on Wednesday.

,DC,2025-09-29 17:00:58+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump asks US Supreme Court to take birthright citizenship case,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-asks-us-supreme-court-take-birthright-citizenship-case,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has again petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court regarding birthright citizenship, this time on the merits of the administration’s effort to rewrite the constitutional right afforded to children born on U.S. soil. In two cases brought to the high court, lower courts kept in place a preliminary injunction against President Donald Trump’s executive order that ended birthright citizenship. U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer petitioned the court Friday to reverse those decisions. The high court case was docketed Monday. Responses from both parties are due by Oct. 29.Sauer is asking the justices to revisit the 14th amendment, arguing that it was meant to grant citizenship to newly freed Black people after the Civil War, not for the children of immigrants with temporary visas or in the country without legal authorization. “The mistaken view that birth on U.S. territory confers citizenship on anyone subject to the regulatory reach of U.S. law became pervasive, with destructive consequences,” Sauer wrote.Sauer did not ask the court to fast-track the petition, so if the justices decide to take up the case the earliest they would do so would be the summer of next year. One case is from Washington state on behalf of attorneys general in that state, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon. The other case is from New Hampshire, where a national of Honduras is due to give birth in October and fears her child will not be granted U.S. citizenship.Immigration policy stymiedSauer said the president’s executive order aimed to advance his immigration policy and that lower courts' decisions to block that agenda harms the U.S.“The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that American citizenship—the privilege that allows us to choose our political leaders—is granted only to those who are lawfully entitled to it. The lower court’s decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the President and his Administration in a manner that undermines our border security,” he wrote. “Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”The Trump administration in March brought the issue to the high court on an emergency basis, but did not ask the justices to determine the constitutionality of birthright citizenship. Instead, the administration asked the court to address the issue of nationwide injunctions from the lower courts. In June, the Supreme Court reined in nationwide injunctions by some lower courts that had blocked the executive order rewriting birthright citizenship.Executive order rewrote 14th AmendmentThe order Trump signed in January directs the federal government to not recognize or issue citizenship documentation to any child born after Feb. 19 to parents who are in the country without proper authorization, or if the parent is in the United States on a temporary visa and the other parent is a noncitizen or green card holder. Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the U.S. are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status, except for the children born to foreign diplomats. The administration interprets that phrase in the 14th Amendment that confers birthright citizenship to people “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” to exclude people in the U.S. without legal status or temporary legal status. Those people are subject to the laws of their home country, the administration argues.The Supreme Court has ruled on birthright citizenship many times, including a 1898 decision in which the justices upheld birthright citizenship in United States v. Wong Kim Ark.Ark was born in San Francisco to parents who were citizens of the Republic of China, but had visas giving them legal authority to be in the country. Ark’s citizenship was not recognized when he left the U.S. and he was denied reentry due to the Chinese Exclusion Act — a racist law designed to restrict and limit nearly all immigration of Chinese nationals.The high court ruled in Ark’s case that children born in the U.S. to parents who were not citizens automatically become citizens at birth.",,,,2025-09-29 13:58:27.649840
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-29 16:58:35+00:00,CT Mirror,Yale New Haven will pay $45M to end dispute with Prospect Medical over hospitals sale,Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/29/prospect-medical-holdings-yale-new-haven-health-435-million-deal-settlement/,The settlement ends a contentious saga over a 2022 deal in which Yale agreed to acquire now-bankrupt Prospect's 3 CT hospitals for $435M.,"Yale New Haven Health will pay Prospect Medical Holdings $45 million to settle dueling lawsuits in state court, ending a contentious saga over the proposed sale of Prospect’s three Connecticut hospitals — with Yale acquiring none of them.
The 50-page settlement agreement, filed in the bankruptcy court Friday, asks the judge to approve the settlement between Prospect and Yale by Oct. 10. 
In the filing, Thomas Califano, an attorney for Prospect, wrote “everybody’s pretty satisfied” with the outcome, although “I don’t think anybody’s happy with it.” 
Prospect signed a deal in 2022 to sell Waterbury Hospital, Manchester Hospital and Rockville General Hospital to Yale for $435 million. But that agreement hit snags and both parties sued each other. 
This January, Prospect Medical filed for bankruptcy. Less than a month after the bankruptcy filing, Yale announced it was pulling out of the deal completely stating the bankruptcy filing was “proof of their disinvestment and mismanagement.”
At an August hearing in the bankruptcy case, in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas, the judge encouraged Prospect and Yale to settle their dispute through mediation. 
The two sides, along with Prospect’s landlord Medical Properties Trust, met for an in-person mediation session in mid-September with Judge Harlin D. Hale to work out the settlement.
“The settlement agreement is the result of good-faith negotiations among the debtors, MPT, and YNHH, during which the Committee was present and informed,” Califano wrote.
Yale New Haven Health spokeswoman Dana Marnane said Monday the “settlement will officially end all pending litigation between our Health System and Prospect allowing both parties to move forward and focus on the future.”
The two parties had been at odds since Yale sued to have the $435 million purchase price lowered after a cyberattack struck the three Prospect Hospitals two years ago, crippling some of their operations for months.
Yale officials said it would cost as much as $80 million for Yale to repair the damages to the hospital’s computer security systems because of the cyberattack. It also claimed Prospect had failed to pay some of its vendors for years and also owed the state of Connecticut at least $67 million in taxes.
Prospect then countersued, arguing Yale was trying to renege on the agreement and cited the stalled sale as part of the reason it needed to file for bankruptcy. Both lawsuits will be dismissed as part of the settlement agreement.
Meanwhile the fate of Prospect’s three Connecticut hospitals remains in bankruptcy court. Yale is no longer a player, but its main competitor Hartford HealthCare has stepped into the fray.
Hartford HealthCare has offered $86.1 million to purchase two of the three hospitals — Manchester Memorial and Rockville General.
ECHN Holdings Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartford HealthCare, will serve as the “stalking horse bidder” for the two hospitals in the court-supervised sale auction, according to court documents. The “stalking horse” serves as the first bidder in a bankruptcy auction whose offer serves as the minimum bid. 
Meanwhile, state officials are in high-level discussions regarding a deal in which the University of Connecticut Health Center would purchase the third Prospect facility, Waterbury Hospital, along with the independently owned Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals. Officials are considering a total for the deal that could reach nearly $400 million, sources said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DayKimball_Putnam_YK_file-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-29 13:58:27.649840

WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Shahrzad Rasekh to discuss her article, “This Ukrainian family fled war in Odesa and found a foothold in CT,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Shahrzad’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Shahrzad. How did you come across the Natsevych family, and why did you think their story would make such a compelling photo essay?
SR: Yeah, so I realized that Ukraine had just fallen out of the news cycle, and I was looking for local ways to be able to cover this issue, given that it still exists; we’re just not hearing about it as much. And so I wanted to find a personal angle that could tell the story that we know through numbers, but this time through a personal perspective, and kind of follow one family’s journey from Ukraine to Connecticut, and kind of see how the war is affecting people in Ukraine, but also what services they were able to benefit from, and what their experience was like as a Ukrainian family in Connecticut.
And so I connected with them through this one woman that my colleague Laura Tillman had met at a different event, who happened just to be Ukrainian, she works at Yale, and just by nature of being Ukrainian and being connected with the community, she happened to know this family and gave me their number, and I called her out of the blue, and she was gracious enough to be open about the idea, and we just clicked. And from there, it made it much easier to kind of follow them through this process of resettlement.
WSHU: Was the fact that she had these Instagram posts of what was happening in Odesa when the war came helpful to you?
SR: I actually didn’t know her Instagram or hadn’t seen her Instagram before reaching out to her. It did help that she had already been open about her experience. Some people don’t want to think about it or don’t want to process what they’ve experienced yet, but because she had a disposition to share this information, it made it easier to dig deeper and ask questions that might have been intrusive to some. She just wanted to be able to share this experience, and she just had fewer barriers than most people.
WSHU: Wow. Let’s discuss their experience a bit. What was the experience like?
SR: Sure. So Evgenia and her husband Vitalii were living in Odesa. They were from Ukraine. They’ve lived there their whole lives, and their whole families are there. That’s their home. And Odesa happens to be right on the Black Sea, relatively close to Crimea. It’s the largest city that’s that close to Crimea.
WSHU: It also has the largest port for Ukraine right now, correct?
SR: Correct. And so, I mean, since 2014, when Crimea was annexed, it was kind of in this fragile position geographically. And Evgenia and her husband’s home happened to be near a military outpost that they worried would be a target. On February 24, when they first saw these missiles flying overhead, they decided, in that instant, to try to go somewhere safer. It was kind of a shot in the dark where they went. They went to Vitalii’s parents’ home, which unfortunately happened to be even closer to the front lines. The battle for Kyiv was happening as they were sheltering underground. Eventually, they were able to make it out to Germany, and after a while, they found their way to the U.S. They actually connected while they were in Germany with a man in Arkansas who wanted to sponsor people coming in on U4U.
WSHU: So U4U is a special visa that was created by the Biden administration for Ukrainian refugees.
SR: Correct. So, U4U was a program that existed that was created for these Ukrainians who were caught in the heart of this war, and that was recently paused in January 2025 along with a set of other statuses, like TPS, temporary protective status, which is relevant to this story, because people who have come on you for you, on the earlier side, who were no longer eligible to renew U4U, are now trying to resort to TPS to be able to stay here. Those individuals are also in a fragile position, as most of the programs available to them in the past have been paused, leaving them in a state of uncertainty.

WSHU: And you use this family to illustrate the type of assistance that refugee families were getting that they no longer had access to.
SR: Yeah, so organizations like CIRI and IRIS here in Connecticut have seen major cuts to funding and programs and services that they’re able to offer. This family was lucky enough to be part of the last group of people who were able to receive these services, but Ukrainians who have similar life experiences to this family, who are only now trying to leave, will not be able to reach the same places that this family was able to reach, because all of the services that were available to them along the way have now been impacted by either cuts or just not existing anymore.
WSHU: Now, how is the family itself? How have they adjusted to being in America, and are they still in Connecticut?
SR: The first year or two were particularly difficult for the family. It was a shock in many ways, both in terms of culture, but also in terms of the professions that were available to them. This is a young couple, and they were pretty career forward in terms of their outlook on life, and they arrived in this country where one of them doesn’t really speak the language, and he had been a manager in a food company, regional manager, and so jumping from that to changing tires and coming home and smelling like this burnt plastic was a huge change. It would have been a huge change, even if they had just stayed in Ukraine. So that alone, and then not being able to speak the language, not knowing how to access certain services, all of that was a huge change for them. And once they reached Connecticut, and Vitalii had this job that was similar to what he had in Ukraine, then they kind of started to find their footing. And one thing that Evgenia particularly credited and that I mentioned in the piece is that Connecticut’s social services and the different organizations that exist within the state kind of reduce these barriers.
WSHU: You specifically mentioned the children being able to get onto HUSKY and being able to get some medical treatment that they hadn’t been able to for quite a while.
SR: Yeah, so during the first few days of the war, or even before it started, Angelina, who is Evgenia’s youngest daughter, had started to experience tooth pain. Obviously, they were caught in the whirlwinds of war and were unable to seek proper medical attention safely. This treatment was delayed, and they reached Arkansas, then they reached Florida and tried to seek medical treatment there, but the barrier of not having insurance was just too big, and so they had to wait until Connecticut. Fortunately for them, Connecticut’s immigrant insurance programs and the barriers that are reduced compared to other states were very helpful in allowing them to seek the treatment that they needed, and Angelina has been able to follow through and complete the medical treatment that she had needed since leaving Ukraine.
WSHU: Well, that’s fantastic. In the meantime, the services that were made available to them are no longer available. So what’s the situation with that going forward? Will we be able to preserve any of these services? Or they’re just gone?
SR: Well, in the case of IRIS, for example, they’ve had to close an entire office. So it seems like the future, I mean, some of these services just no longer exist. Entire portions of staff have been laid off in the past few months, and so it seems like we’re in a pretty bleak position. Individual funding can’t necessarily make up for all of the government funding that these organizations have lost. So I wish I had a better answer, but so far, the future of these organizations seems rather dire.
WSHU: However, this particular family has been able to tie into the local Ukrainian community, and that has been a lot of help to them.
SR: That’s correct. So I mean, even just the way that I was able to connect with this family was through the Ukrainian community, by nature of just getting breakfast with one Ukrainian woman based in New Haven and chatting about the Ukrainian community that exists within Connecticut, I was able to connect with this family.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0814_SR_EastHavenBeach_113-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 14:56:56.014178

Delaware’s 38th annual Coastal Cleanup drew more than 950 volunteers to over 45 sites on Sept. 13, clearing 5,121 pounds of debris from beaches, wetlands, and waterways from Fenwick Island to Battery Park, according to the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).
Participation held steady from 2024, but this year’s haul was 3,000 pounds heavier. Cigarette butts, food wrappers, and bottle caps topped the list of most-collected items, while larger finds included a car exhaust, other car parts, and a bean bag chair. 
“This annual event brings together neighbors and visitors willing to put a few hours into protecting our beautiful coastline, with all those individual acts adding up to a significant result,” said DNREC Secretary Greg Patterson, who joined Senator Kyra Hoffner, Senator Stephanie Hansen and other volunteers for the cleanup at Big Stone Beach. “Taking more than 2 tons of trash off the beach – much of it one bit of plastic at a time – shows the true power of collective action.”

DNREC noted that the data recorded by volunteers helps the state understand what’s washing up on Delaware’s shores and informs efforts to reduce litter. The results are also submitted to the International Ocean Conservancy’s Coastal Cleanup database to contribute to global trends and solutions for cleaner oceans and waterways.
“It has been a wonderful experience to be involved with coastal cleanup for 20 years,” said Jennifer Pongratz, DNREC Division of Watershed Stewardship environmental scientist, and longtime Coastal Cleanup committee member. “I love getting to see the same volunteers year after year that return to their favorite spots to give back in their community, as well as newcomers to the cleanup who get to experience the joy of this act of service for the first time.”
DNREC emphasized that keeping beaches and waterways clean is a year-round effort.

(Photo courtesy of the National Weather Service)COLUMBIA — Warnings to brace for the worst have subsided after incoming Tropical Storm Imelda’s predicted path turned out to sea, according to the National Weather Service.
Coastal residents should prepare for about 1 inch of rain from scattered storms Tuesday, followed by drier weather with temperatures in the 70s and 80s over the following days. Flooding is still possible in some areas, but not more than during a typical storm, the National Weather Service said in briefings Monday.
SC under state of emergency as possible tropical storm approaches

With the risks diminished, the state Emergency Management Division returned to normal operations Monday, according to a news release. But a state of emergency, which allows officials to more easily mobilize response teams and apply for federal disaster aid, remained in effect as of noon Monday.
Tropical Storm Imelda, which formed from an unnamed tropical disturbance over the weekend, could have made landfall in the Carolinas or parked just off the coast. Either option could have caused major flooding, and high winds could have knocked down trees and powerlines, the National Weather Service said previously.
Instead, meteorologists expect the storm to take a sharp right turn early Tuesday, away from the Carolinas and further east in the Atlantic Ocean, largely following the path of the much larger Hurricane Humberto, according to the weather service.
Swimmers and boaters should stay wary this week, and those with little experience should stay out of the water altogether.

(Leah Romero for Source NM)When David Gutierrez of Laguna had surgery to remove his gallbladder earlier this year, he and his wife of 45 years Rebecca Gutierrez thought his recovery would be simple and straightforward. Instead, several complications left the couple worrying about his care and their rapidly shrinking funds.
Rebecca Gutierrez previously worked at her local senior center in Laguna, where she interacted with many people who, she told Source New Mexico, worried about being unable to afford to leave their jobs or care for aging parents on their own. Then she attended one of the New Mexico Aging and Long-Term Services Department’s annual Conference of Aging and learned about New MexiCare, a program that helps fill the gaps for seniors who have cognitive or physical limitations and don’t qualify for Medicaid, but have limited financial means.
 After receiving funding during the 2024 legislative session, the program rolled out as a pilot that year, but only in limited counties and not in Cibola County, where the couple lived. NewMexiCare later expanded to 31 of the state’s 33 counties — everywhere but Bernalillo and Doña Ana counties —and, as of this month, became available statewide
According to a Sept. 16 news release from the ALTSD, 285 New Mexicans have been enrolled in New MexiCare since its official launch in October 2024, and over $1.2 million in financial assistance has been distributed.
While at the 2025 Annual Conference on Aging in Glorieta last week, Aging Secretary Emily Kaltenbach told Source that enrollment numbers have tripled since she took over the department last fall.
“The challenge ahead of us is money,” she said. “People get on the program, but attrition is not at the same rate as people coming on. And so, that’s going to be something we’re going to have to tackle at a legislative level.  We have to show how impactful it is so that we can get additional funding.”
The Gutierrezes were two of more than 1,400 senior New Mexicans and caregivers who attended the conference this week, and made a point to share their story with Kaltenbach.
After David Gutierrez became sick with gallstones in April 2025, he underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder and Rebecca became his primary caregiver. But he didn’t improve after the surgery.
“We went home and he’s not getting any better,” she told Source. “He still hurts and doctors would say, ‘You know, he’s older. He’s 71 years old, it takes longer [to heal].’” 
David ended up back in the emergency room and doctors discovered that fluid had formed where his gallbladder had been, and he had developed an abscess on his liver. The medical team asked if the couple could travel 45 minutes from their home to Albuquerque frequently for treatment, but the travel costs would have compounded their financial situation. “I’ve already used my resources taking care of him,” Rebecca said. 
She called New MexiCare and arranged an appointment for organizers to interview the two of them in their home to assess their needs. During the two-week wait, David’s situation remained complicated. “One week he had seven doctor’s appointments,” she said.
And because of the toll the surgery and subsequent complications took on his body, David was weaker than he had ever been and had trouble getting around. He had to use a walker for the first time in his life. After the assessment, he was approved for New MexiCare, including 17 hours a week for in-home care and four-and-a-half hours of transportation. The couple told Source that before they received a check from New MexiCare, their savings were almost completely used up. They said they were worried about how they would pay for the copays for all of David’s appointments.
“I’ve always advocated for the caregivers, but to become one was totally different,” Rebecca said. 
With help and financial assistance from New MexiCare and Social Security, the couple have been able to focus on David’s recovery. And Rebecca said she recently became the president of the advisory group in Laguna for seniors. 
“I told them, ‘I’m going to educate you guys how to take advantage of this opportunity that we finally have,’” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/New-MexiCare-1024x683.png,,,2025-09-29 12:57:13.149655

A proposed state constitutional amendment would increase Florida's homestead exemption for property taxes. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Although the specifics of such a proposal are still unknown, a majority of Floridians say that, if given the chance, they would vote for some form of property tax reform. That’s according to a public opinion survey commissioned by the James Madison Institute (JMI) released on Monday.
If a constitutional amendment to significantly reduce or eliminate property taxes were on the ballot, 65% would support that. Only 15% oppose it, with 20% unsure.
Constitutional amendments in Florida must win 60% support to go into effect.
Gov. Ron DeSantis has been campaigning for months on the idea that Floridians want and need property tax relief, and has floated the idea that Florida could become the first state in the nation to completely eliminate them.
But property taxes pay for crucial local services like police, fire departments, and schools. A study by the Florida Policy Institute concluded that eliminating property taxes for homesteaded properties would cost $18.5 billion.
As a way to preempt those arguments by local government officials, Florida’s recently appointed chief financial officer, Blaise Ingoglia, has been making appearances around the state calling out local governments for alleged “wasteful spending” (without specifying what reaches that definition).
Florida Speaker of the House Daniel Perez formed a select committee to study the issue earlier this year, and that group met twice last week in Tallahassee to determine how such a proposal could be written. It’s expected that the Florida Legislature will approve a resolution for a constitutional amendment sometime during the 2026 legislative session, which begins in January, with the measure to appear on the November 2026 ballot.
On the philosophy of property taxes, 39% of those surveyed said they are a “valid” revenue source but should be limited. Another 33% said property taxes should be eliminated outright. Only 20% said they were critical for funding local government services and should be preserved. Another 8% weren’t sure.
Sixty-six percent of Floridians worry they may not be able to afford to continue living in their homes or communities due to rising property taxes or other housing costs.
There were plenty of other nuggets in the JMI survey, including that 62% of Florida voters oppose a DeSantis administration proposal to eliminate vaccine requirements.
Jolly competitive in one-on-one matchups with top Republicans
Nearly one in three registered voters (30%) describe themselves as “politically homeless,” feeling unrepresented by either the Democratic or Republican parties.
Regarding the 2026 gubernatorial race, in a hypothetical matchup between Republican Byron Donalds, Democrat David Jolly, and independent candidate state Sen. Jason Pizzo, Donalds leads Jolly, 36%-32%, with Pizzo at 4%.
In a three-way race with former House Speaker Paul Renner as the GOP candidate, Renner leads Jolly, 34%-33%, with Pizzo at 5%.
In a GOP race between Donalds and Renner, Donalds leads, 29%-9%.
But when Republican voters were asked for whom they would vote among “announced and potential candidates,” it’s First Lady Casey DeSantis who gets the most support. She leads Donalds 26%-23%, with Renner at 7%, Lt. Gov. Jay Collins at 2%, and Agriculture Commission Wilton Simpson at 2%.
The survey’s questions did not refer to the fact that Donalds has been endorsed by Donald Trump for president.
The survey of 1,200 registered voters in Florida was conducted by Targoz Market Research for the James Madison Institute between Sept. 16 and Sept. 18, with a margin for error +/- 2.77%.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-29 15:54:13+00:00,CT Mirror,A federal government shutdown is nearing. Here’s a guide for what to expect.,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler, Ariana Figueroa and Shauneen Miranda | States Newsroom",,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/29/federal-shutdown-explainer-health-immigration-politics/,Nearly every corner of the federal government will feel the pain in some way if a compromise isn’t reached by Oct. 1.,"WASHINGTON — Congress’ failure to pass a short-term government funding bill before midnight Tuesday will lead to the first shutdown in nearly seven years and give President Donald Trump broad authority to determine what federal operations keep running — which will have a huge impact on the government, its employees, states and Americans. 
A funding lapse this year would have a considerably wider effect than the 35-day one that took place during Trump’s first term and could last longer, given heightened political tensions. 
The last shutdown didn’t affect the departments of Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor and Veterans Affairs, since Congress had approved those agencies’ full-year funding bills.
Lawmakers had also enacted the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, exempting Capitol Hill from any repercussions. 
[RELATED: As government shutdown looms, CT Dems push for ACA subsidies]
That isn’t the case this time around since none of the dozen government spending bills have become law. That means nearly every corner of the federal government will feel the pain in some way if a compromise isn’t reached by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. 
States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. Bureau offers you a quick guide to what could happen if Republicans and Democrats don’t broker an agreement in time.
How does the White House budget office determine what government operations are essential during a shutdown?
Generally, federal programs that include the preservation of life or property as well as those addressing national security continue during a shutdown, while all other activities are supposed to cease until a funding bill becomes law. 
But the president holds expansive power to determine what activities within the executive branch are essential and which aren’t, making the effects of a shutdown hard to pinpoint unless the Trump administration shares that information publicly. 
Presidential administrations have traditionally posted contingency plans on the White House budget office’s website, detailing how each agency would shut down — explaining which employees are exempt and need to keep working, and which are furloughed. 
That appears to have changed this year. The web page that would normally host dozens of contingency plans remained blank until late September, when the White House budget office posted that a 940-page document released in August calls for the plans to be “hosted solely on each agency’s website.”
Only a few departments had plans from this year posted on their websites as of Friday afternoon.
The White House budget office expects agencies to develop Reduction in Force plans as part of their shutdown preparation, signaling a prolonged funding lapse will include mass firings and layoffs.
While the two-page memo doesn’t detail which agencies would be most affected, it says layoffs will apply to programs, projects, or activities that are “not consistent with the President’s priorities.”
Trump will be paid during a shutdown since Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 of the Constitution prevents the president’s salary from being increased or decreased during the current term.
No one else in the executive branch — including Cabinet secretaries, more than 2 million civilian employees and over 1 million active duty military personnel — will receive their paycheck until after the shutdown ends. 
Are federal courts exempt from a shutdown since they’re a separate branch of government?
The Supreme Court will continue to conduct normal operations in the event of a shutdown, according to its Public Information Office. 
The office said the court “will rely on permanent funds not subject to annual approval, as it has in the past, to maintain operations through the duration of short-term lapses of annual appropriations,” in a statement shared with States Newsroom. 
As for any impact on lower federal courts, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said the federal judiciary was still assessing the fiscal 2026 outlook and had no comment. 
The office serves as the central support arm of the federal judiciary. 
During the last government shutdown from late 2018 into early 2019, federal courts remained open using court fee balances and “no-year” funds, which are available for an indefinite period. 
The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has said that if those funds run out, they would operate under the terms of the Anti-Deficiency Act, which “allows work to continue during a lapse in appropriations if it is necessary to support the exercise of Article III judicial powers.” 
Supreme Court justices and appointed federal judges continue to get paid during a government shutdown, as Article III of the Constitution says the judges’ compensation “shall not be diminished” during their term.
What happens to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid?
The three programs exist largely outside of the annual appropriations process, since lawmakers categorized them as “mandatory spending.” 
This means Social Security checks as well as reimbursements to health care providers for Medicare and Medicaid services should continue as normal.
One possible hitch is the salaries for people who run those programs are covered by annual appropriations bills, so there could be some staffing problems for the Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, depending on their contingency plans. 
The first Trump administration’s shutdown guidance for the Social Security Administration showed 54,000 of 63,000 employees at that agency would have kept working. The CMS plan from 2020 shows that it intended to keep about 50% of its employees working in the event of a shutdown. Neither had a current plan as of Friday.
Will the Department of Veterans Affairs be able to keep providing health care and benefits?
Veterans can expect health care to continue uninterrupted at VA medical centers and outpatient clinics in the event of a shutdown. Vets would also continue to receive benefits, including compensation, pension, education and housing, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs contingency planning for a funding lapse that is currently published on the department’s website. It’s unclear if the plan will be the one the Trump administration puts into action.
But a shutdown would affect other VA services. For example, the GI Bill hotline would close, and all in-person and virtual career counseling and transition assistance services would be unavailable.
Additionally, all regional VA benefits offices would shutter until Congress agreed to fund the government. The closures would include the Manila Regional Office in the Philippines that serves veterans in the Pacific region.
All department public outreach to veterans would also cease.
Will Hubbard, spokesperson for Veterans Education Success, said his advocacy organization is bracing for increased phone calls and emails from veterans who would normally call the GI Bill hotline.
“Questions are going to come up, veterans are going to be looking for answers, and they’re not going to be able to call like they would be able to normally, that’s going to be a big problem,” Hubbard said.
“Most of the benefits that people are going to be most concerned about will not be affected, but the ones that do get affected, for the people that that hits, I mean, it’s going to matter a lot to them. It’s going to change the direction of their planning, and potentially the direction of their life,” Hubbard said.
The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for current VA shutdown guidance.
What happens to immigration enforcement and immigration courts? 
As the Trump administration continues with its aggressive immigration tactics in cities with high immigrant populations, that enforcement is likely to continue during a government shutdown, according to the Department of Homeland Security’s March guidance for operating in a government shutdown.
Immigration-related fees will continue, such as for processing visas and applications from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. 
And DHS expects nearly all of its U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees to be exempt — 17,500 out of 20,500 — and continue working without pay amid a government shutdown. 
That means that ICE officers will continue to arrest, detain and remove from the country immigrants without legal status. DHS is currently concentrating immigration enforcement efforts in Chicago, known as “Operation Midway Blitz.”
Other employees within DHS, such as those in Transportation Security Administration, will also be retained during a government shutdown. There are about 58,000 TSA employees that would be exempt and continue to work without pay in airports across the country.  
DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for a contingency plan if there is a government shutdown.
Separately, a shutdown would also burden the overwhelmed immigration court system that is housed within the Department of Justice. It would lead to canceling or rescheduling court cases, when there is already a backlog of 3.4 million cases.
The only exceptions are immigration courts that are located within Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, detention centers, but most cases would need to be rescheduled. The partial government shutdown that began in December 2018 caused nearly 43,000 court cases to be canceled, according to a report by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC.
And 28 states have an immigration court, requiring some immigrants to travel hundreds, or thousands, of miles for their appointment. 
States that do not have an immigration court include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
Will people be able to visit national parks or use public lands during a shutdown? 
Probably, but that may be bad for parks’ long-term health.
During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the first Trump administration kept parks open, with skeleton staffs across the country struggling to maintain National Park Service facilities.
Theresa Pierno, the president and CEO of the advocacy group National Parks Conservation Association, said in a Sept. 23 statement the last shutdown devastated areas of some parks.
“Americans watched helplessly as Joshua Trees were cut down, park buildings were vandalized, prehistoric petroglyphs were defaced, trash overflowed leading to wildlife impacts, and human waste piled up,” she wrote. “Visitor safety and irreplaceable natural and cultural resources were put at serious risk. We cannot allow this to happen again.”
The National Park Service’s latest contingency plan was published in March 2024, during President Joe Biden’s administration. It calls for at least some closures during a shutdown, though the document says the response will differ from park to park. 
Restricting access to parks is difficult due to their physical characteristics, the document said, adding that staffing would generally be maintained at a minimum to allow visitors. However, some areas that are regularly closed could be locked up for the duration of a shutdown.
But that contingency plan is likely to change before Tuesday, spokespeople for the Park Service and the Interior Department, which oversees NPS, said Sept. 25.
“The lapse in funding plans on our website are from 2024,” an email from the NPS office of public affairs said. “They are currently being reviewed and updated.”
Hunters and others seeking to use public lands maintained by Interior’s Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service, which is overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, will likely be able to continue to do so, though they may have to make alternative plans if they’d planned to use facilities such as campgrounds. 
Land Tawney, the co-chair of the advocacy group American Hunters and Anglers, said campgrounds, toilets and facilities that require staffing would be inaccessible, but most public lands would remain available.
“Those lands are kind of open and they’re just unmanned, I would say, and that’s not really gonna change much,” he said. “If you’re staying in a campground, you’ve got to figure something else out.”
As with national parks, access to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refuges and other hunting and fishing sites will differ from site to site, Tawney said. The Fish and Wildlife Service doesn’t require permits for hunting on its lands, but access to some refuges is determined by a staff-run lottery drawing. If those drawings can’t be held, access to those sites will be limited, Tawney said.
What happens to the Internal Revenue Service?
How the Internal Revenue Service would operate during a government shutdown remains unclear. 
When Congress teetered on letting funding run out in March, the nation’s revenue collection agency released a contingency plan to continue full operations during the height of tax filing season. 
The IRS planned to use funds allocated in the 2022 budget reconciliation law to keep its roughly 95,000 employees processing returns and refunds, answering the phones, and pursuing audits. 
Ultimately Congress agreed on a stopgap funding bill to avoid a March shutdown, but much has changed since then.
The new tax and spending law, signed by Trump on July 4 and often referred to as the “one big beautiful bill,” made major changes to the U.S. tax code. 
Additionally, the agency, which processes roughly 180 million income tax returns per year, has lost about a quarter of its workforce since January. Top leadership has also turned over six times in 2025.
Rachel Snyderman, of the Bipartisan Policy Center, said workforce reductions combined with a string of leadership changes could factor into how the agency would operate during a funding lapse.
“It’s really difficult to understand both what the status of the agency would be if the government were to shut down in less than a week, and also the impacts that a prolonged shutdown could have on taxpayer services and taxpayers at large,” said Snyderman, the think tank’s managing director of economic policy.
Do federal employees get back pay after a shutdown ends?
According to the Office of Personnel Management — the executive branch’s chief human resources agency — “after the lapse in appropriations has ended, employees who were furloughed as the result of the lapse will receive retroactive pay for those furlough periods.” 
The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 requires furloughed government employees to receive back pay as a result of a government shutdown. 
That law does not apply to federal contractors, who face uncertainty in getting paid during a shutdown. 
What role does Congress have during a shutdown?
The House and Senate must approve a stopgap spending bill or all dozen full-year appropriations bills to end a shutdown, a feat that requires the support of at least some Democrats to get past the upper chamber’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. 
Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., control their respective chambers’ calendars as well as the floor schedule, so they could keep holding votes on the stopgap bill Democrats have already rejected or try to pass individual bills to alleviate the impacts on certain agencies.   
Neither Johnson nor Thune has yet to suggest bipartisan negotiations with Democratic leaders about funding the government. And while they are open to discussions about extending the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, they don’t want that decision connected to the funding debate.  
Democratic leaders have said repeatedly that Republicans shouldn’t expect them to vote for legislation they had no say in drafting, especially with a health care cliff for millions of Americans coming at the end of the year. 
Members of Congress will receive their paychecks regardless of how long a shutdown lasts, but the people who work for them would only receive their salaries after it ends. 
Lawmakers must be paid under language in Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 of the Constitution as well as the 27th Amendment, which bars members of Congress from changing their salaries during the current session. 
Lawmakers have discretion to decide which of their staff members continue working during a shutdown and which are furloughed.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Capitol Police, which is tasked with protecting members amid a sharp rise in political violence, said a shutdown “would not affect the security of the Capitol Complex.” 
“Our officers, and the professional staff who perform or support emergency functions, would still report to work,” the spokesperson said. “Employees who are not required for emergency functions would be furloughed until funding is available.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
BETA Technologies filed for an initial public offering on Monday morning, after reports of the move circulated last week. 
The South Burlington-based company plans to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange “as soon as practicable” under the symbol “BETA,” according to Monday’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The electric and hybrid aircraft company has raised over $1.5 billion in capital through private equity investment and development contracts since its founding in 2017. The company opened a 188,500-square-foot production facility in South Burlington in 2023, and also runs a battery testing site in St. Albans.
“Electric aviation is inevitable,” wrote founding CEO Kyle Clark in a letter within the filing. “We believe it will lower the cost of flight, improve safety, expand aviation’s utility, and do so in balance with our environment.”
Monday’s filing comes just weeks after the company announced a high-profile partnership with GE Aerospace, which plans to make a $300 million equity investment in BETA.
The filing’s primary underwriters, taking on the financial risk of the offering, are Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.
BETA is in an enforced “quiet period” following its filing Monday and declined to comment.
This story will be updated.

Jared Golden. 
A political organization titled “Dunlap for Congress” was established on Thursday, as Bloomberg News first reported on Friday. Dunlap, who previously served as Maine’s Secretary of State for seven terms, first floated the idea of his potential run for Congress in District 2 in May and previously said he’d planned to make a decision by Oct. 1.
Golden is in his fourth term representing District 2, which comprises the majority of the state geographically north of Augusta. Voters in that district have routinely split tickets, reelecting Golden while going for President Donald Trump each time he’s run for president. 
Dunlap, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, made a national name for himself during Trump’s first term when serving on the president’s voter fraud commission. 
Dunlap refused to hand over sensitive Maine voter information that the commission requested (which current Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows cited when defending her decision to do the same). He also won a lawsuit against the group after its Republican leadership intentionally excluded him from deliberations. And, after it was disbanded, Dunlap chalked up the commission to being set up to validate Trump’s voter fraud claims. 
Dunlap is seen as more progressive than Golden, who often breaks with his party on votes. Golden did so recently as the only House Democrat to back a Republican stopgap spending proposal that did not include an extension of a health care tax credit. 
The IRS filing provides some insight into those behind Dunlap’s potential run for higher office. 
Brandon Philipczyk is listed as the custodian of records and contact person. He happens to be the same person named on the form establishing the political organization for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner, who is challenging long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. 
Philipczyk is also listed on those forms for other progressive challengers running for Congress, including Morgan Coghill in Illinois, Eric Descheenie in Arizona and Joey Mendoza Atkins in Florida.

Bob Menendez and his wife Nadine at one of several dinners he and his friends treated the couple to during what prosecutors say was a wide-ranging bribery scheme that started in 2018. (Photo courtesy of the U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York)Attorneys for a failed insurance broker who testified that he bribed former Sen. Bob Menendez are asking a federal court for a lenient sentence, arguing their client was instrumental in securing the senator’s corruption conviction.
They said Jose Uribe, who gave the senator’s wife a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for Menendez’s intercession in a state insurance fraud case against a friend, testified despite fears of harassment and intimidation, and that his role in the trial justified a non-custodial sentence.
“Jose has learned the hardest of lessons by accepting responsibility for his crimes and by doing one of the most difficult, scary and grueling things imaginable — cooperating and being the government’s star witness in a historic, ultra-high-profile trial of one of the most powerful politicians at that time in America,” Uribe’s attorneys said in a court filing.
Uribe is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 9.
Ex-senator’s wife gets 4.5 years in prison for global bribery scheme

Uribe in March 2024 pleaded guilty to seven counts of bribery, obstruction, wire fraud, tax evasion, and conspiracy as part of an agreement to exchange his testimony for prosecutors’ recommendation of a lenient sentence. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 95 years behind bars.
He served as a star witness during the Menendez prosecution, testifying for two days on how he bribed the senator.
Uribe’s attorneys said he faced risks testifying against Menendez, who was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when charged.
They said two men stopped his ex-wife outside a bank in April 2024 before being scared away by a bank clerk, and that a “strange man” appeared unannounced and uninvited in Uribe’s office to arrange a meeting with Nadine Menendez, the senator’s wife, so the two could agree on a lie about why Uribe was making her car payments.
“In this case, he was only delivering a message … however, in that harrowing moment, Jose realized that if — instead of wanting to avoid prosecution by making up a false story — someone had wanted to silence him through violence, he was vulnerable,” Uribe’s attorneys said.
Nadine Menendez was also convicted as part of the bribery scheme, and earlier this month was sentenced to nearly five years in prison. Bob Menendez is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence.
Uribe’s testimony also helped lead to convictions for co-defendants Wael Hana, a halal meat exporter, and real estate developer Fred Daibes.
Along with the sentencing memo, Uribe’s attorneys submitted numerous letters from friends, colleagues, and family members who urged leniency.
Osvaldo Lopez, a longtime friend, said Uribe housed him and his family in an Elizabeth apartment after Lopez immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 2002.
“I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.  I had only recently met Jose — he barely knew me — yet he was doing something truly generous and life-changing for me and my family. That moment told me everything I needed to know about the kind of man he is, someone who helps others without hesitation and never expects anything in return,” Lopez said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)At a moment of Republican soul‐searching about the state’s role in economic development, Bill Even says the choice is clear.
“The choice should be to grow, and being thoughtful about doing that,” he said. “Because the alternative — and I’ve seen it with farms and over the course of my career — when they stop growing, when they stop innovating, when they stop buying new equipment, when they stop building things, those farms wither up and they go away. And I think as a state, we don’t want that. We don’t look backward for inspiration. We look forward.”
South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden appointed Even in April to lead the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. Even previously led the office from 2006 to 2007.
Rhoden hasn’t officially declared himself a candidate to keep his job yet, while at least three other people are already running, including U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota. The other two candidates have been vocal in their criticism of the state’s economic development efforts. Gubernatorial candidate and current Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, has criticized Even’s office and pledged to end what Hansen calls “corporate welfare,” while Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden has said the state should focus on helping existing businesses thrive instead of recruiting new ones.
Even’s roots run deep in the state. He is a fifth-generation family farmer from rural Humboldt, where his ancestors homesteaded in Dakota Territory in 1884. His career has included stints as state secretary of agriculture, state energy policy director and CEO of the National Pork Board.
The following interview with Even has been edited for length and clarity.
What is your economic development philosophy? 
Everything grows, right? So as a farmer, we grow crops, and we grow livestock, and we as people, we also grow. We grow, not only physically, but we should also be growing in our knowledge, wisdom and faith. 
Governor race exposes divergent paths on economic development among South Dakota Republicans

I kind of bring that same mindset to the question of “what does growth look like for the state of South Dakota,” knowing that we all grow, because the opposite choice is stasis, which leads to decline. 
Recognizing that we’re living in a competitive environment — both in the United States amongst the states, as well as globally — I want to make sure that we bring that idea that we’re frugal, but not cheap. So, when we do build things, we’re going to build them and do it well and do it right. 
And then also I think a key point is that we’re bold but not reckless. You’ve got to be bold enough to take a leap of faith in business and to build things and do things. You’ve got to take some risks. But you don’t want to be reckless about it either. 
I think that’s where a lot of these conversations tend to land: Where’s that appropriate sweet spot, so that we are looking at expansion of businesses in South Dakota, retention of businesses in South Dakota, as well as any recruitment we want to do. We want to make sure it’s the right place and the right fit with the right business model. 
What is your message to Republicans calling the state’s incentive-based approach “corporate welfare?”
At a really high level, South Dakota is a conservative state. I reflect that as a person. And I completely understand that as a taxpayer in South Dakota. 
But I think it comes back to the question of, “Do we want to grow the pie here in South Dakota or look at everything as a fixed pie?” That’s this idea that everything grows. And if we want to grow our economy and grow our tax base, well, we’re operating in a highly competitive environment. I don’t think it would be wise for South Dakota to unilaterally disarm in this space. 
Number one, it starts with the retention of businesses in the state. Number two, then you move on to focus on what can be done to help them expand and make sure that they are successful here. And then third on the list are the businesses looking around the world and saying, “You know what? South Dakota’s got the business climate. It’s got the accessibility of its leadership. And they’re hard workers. This is a place where I would like to have my business located.”
We all came here from somewhere at some point in time, and I think we also need to acknowledge the fact that if businesses want to come to South Dakota, we want to make sure that we are open for that opportunity. 
How competitive is the recruitment and retention of businesses?
When states are looking to grow and expand, they’re always looking to recruit workers and businesses into their states to help grow their economies. They know that it’s not a zero-sum game and that by growing the pie, there are benefits. 
I worked in sales with Pioneer Seed. For three years, I ran their commercial business here in the Upper Midwest, and had 350 people on the sales team. And you’re in a competitive environment where there are other people trying to get to your customers. Our job was to be on their farm and be their provider of choice.

I kind of look at South Dakota as being in a similar position, where we’re in a highly competitive environment with other states. Instead of other brands that may be selling against you, it’s other states that are talking about their quality of life, their workforce, the tools they have available, like low-interest loans and the like. And so we operate in that space, whether we like it or not. 
We can choose to be in the game, and be in the game smart, or we can choose to be out of the game and sit on the sidelines. Those are choices. 
What do you say to those who feel economic development incentives are undermining the concept of a free market?
There are the rules of the game and the playing field. And if there were no incentives with any state, anywhere, anytime — if there were no partnership programs and no low-interest loan programs — then that would be the playing field that you were on and those are the rules you would follow. 
The way that the reality works in economic development and business is that there are 50 different U.S. states, and they are all in the business of looking to attract people, attract businesses and workers. I think South Dakota is merely playing by the same rules of the game and the way the field is set up today, nationally. 
I truly do appreciate the sentiment. But the reality is, on the ground, if we choose not to play and everybody else is still playing, I know how that’ll turn out. Sitting at the bench on the sideline doesn’t give you a chance. 
Are you looking to introduce any measures to alleviate the frustrations of some Republicans regarding economic development?
I said in front of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee right after I started, “Look, the question you always ask people is are you here to help fix the problem, or are you here to affix blame?” And I’m here to help fix problems, to the extent that there are any problems. And at the end of the day, if you are doing good work with good companies, you’re going to have a good track record.
For example, the default rate on the REDI [Revolving Economic Development and Initiative] loan program over 38 years is like two-tenths of 1%. It’s incredibly solid. Across the 38 years of just the Future Fund alone, 1,687 grants have gone out. Over $630 million adjusted for inflation. The successful track record here is incredible.
At the end of the day, we also know this is an election year. So, there’s a lot more talk and discussion, but my intent here, as a public servant, is to fix any problems. 
My pickup’s got a huge windshield. It’s got a small rearview mirror. You need to look in it from time to time to kind of see where you’ve been and what’s worked and what’s not, but I’m looking forward. 
How do you ensure your office’s return on investment is adequate?
We have a team whose job it is to track South Dakota’s status nationally, track what other states are doing, what our competitors are doing, and how the competitive landscape is changing. But they also do a return on investment analysis in conjunction with our finance and loan team and the Board of Economic Development. 
A lot of people call here, a lot of people talk to GOED, but only projects that are deemed viable are the ones that we bring forward. I think the public should rest assured that there’s a team and there’s a process in place that evaluates all of these things. 
Ultimately, out in the free market, you never know what will happen. Something may change. Circumstances may change. But at the end of the day, we try to tee up the ones that are best positioned for success, and that’s what we put in front of the Board of Economic Development for their evaluation. And they evaluate things separately and independently from us. They’re bankers and business owners in the state that are very experienced. 
There is a lot of anxiety regarding economic development opportunities like wind and solar energy, data centers, small nuclear reactors. How do you think about those developments?
As a businessperson, you evaluate every opportunity on its merits when it arises, right? 
We take a look at the project and say, “Is this project viable? Is this something that could fit in South Dakota? And if so, where would it be a good fit in South Dakota?” And then you take a look at the alternatives.
In many cases, if the alternative is carte blanche saying, “Well, I don’t want this particular business, I don’t want this type of business,” the marginal tax revenue is zero, because the business was never built, the people were never here, the money was never invested. That’s stasis. 
Versus saying, “There’s an opportunity to build something or do something, and well, let’s evaluate it. What’s the credibility of the business? Where might it be a good fit?” And when you do that, it should have a marginal increase to the gross domestic product in South Dakota. It brings jobs, it brings property tax revenue, and it brings sales tax revenue. 
It doesn’t mean that things don’t cost money, that roads don’t need to be built, and power lines don’t need to be built, and water lines don’t need to be built. But at the end of the day, you have a choice between stasis or taking a chance on something after you’ve had the opportunity to vet it.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0724-1-scaled-e1759155364582-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 10:57:41.625749

The Maine Department of Health and Human Services will mail more than 67,000 letters to Maine residents who qualify for the Maine Public Utilities Commission’s Low-Income Assistance Program, also known as LIAP. The program helps homeowners and renters reduce monthly electricity costs through bill credits.
“Programs like LIAP can make a real difference for those struggling to afford their electric bill,” said Public Advocate Heather Sanborn. “If you receive a letter, show it to your utility. This simple step could mean a real savings on your electric bill.” 
Credits vary based on income, household size and electricity usage. 
To be eligible for LIAP, a household must be eligible for the federal utility assistance program or participate in another income-based DHHS assistance program with a household income at or less than 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. That would be between roughly $23,000 and $48,000 for households with one to four people. 
Households who are already enrolled in the federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, also referred to as LIHEAP, will be automatically enrolled in the state’s LIAP program. 
To receive the LIAP benefits, Mainers who receive a letter only need to present it to their utility company, according to a news release from the Office of the Public Advocate. Contact information for the utility company should be included as part of the letter. 
The release from Sanborn’s office urged residents to keep an eye out for these letters and apply for aid as soon as possible. Mainers who do not receive a letter but believe they may qualify to receive assistance should contact their electricity utility or local Community Action Agency.

The $10 billion behemoth will be as big as 70 football fields.","HOLLY RIDGE, La. — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.
The colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, about 50 miles west of Vicksburg, Mississippi. But not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.
Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.
Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.
“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.
Private deals for public power supply
Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.
Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.
Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.
Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.
Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.
“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.
Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.
Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.
Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.
But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”
How is this tackled in other states?
Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.
Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.
And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a “kill switch” law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.
Locals have mixed feelings
Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.
“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.
In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.
But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.
“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

(Photo by Roman Dial/Alaska Pacific University)When scientists Patrick Sullivan and Roman Dial were heading to a remote area in the Brooks Range in 2019 to map the spread of woody plants there, they were looking forward to seeing a celebrated river that author John McPhee described decades ago as having the “clearest, purest water I have ever seen flowing over rocks.”
What they found in the Salmon River, a waterway that flows through Northwest Alaska’s Kobuk Valley National Park, was much different than what McPhee described in his landmark 1976 Alaska book “Coming Into the Country.” The waters Sullivan and Dial found were reddish-orange and murky from loads of minerals flowing into them.
The Salmon River and its tributaries had become transformed into “rusting rivers,” a phenomenon caused by climate change in permafrost regions.
“The permafrost is thawing, and it’s essentially acid rock drainage that’s occurring. These sulfite minerals are being exposed to oxygen and water for the first time in thousands of years and it’s releasing acid which is leaching metals out of the rocks to the streams,” said Sullivan, who heads the Environment and Natural Resource Institute at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
The problem goes beyond aesthetics, according to further research by Sullivan, Dial, who is at Alaska Pacific University, and their colleagues.
The Salmon River, a designated wild and scenic river, and its tributaries are so tainted by acid-rock drainage that their concentration of metals is considered toxic to chronically exposed aquatic life, they found.
Water samples taken in the summers of 2022 and 2023 found that the river and almost all of its tributaries were carrying metals at levels above U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state of Alaska standards, according to a recently published study by Sullivan and his colleagues. A variety of metals were showing up in amounts dangerous to aquatic life: iron, cadmium, aluminum, nickel, zinc and copper, their study found.
The “rusting rivers” pollution is similar to the kind of pollution that can happen from hardrock metals mining. But unlike the case with mining, it is happening in the absence of human development, and it is happening over diffuse spots, whereas a single point source at a mine that could potentially be controlled.
“This wild and scenic river in the heart of Kobuk Valley National Park, it’s about as protected as you can get and as remote as you can get. And it’s kind of falling apart,” Sullivan said.
The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, summarized the situation in its title: “Wild, scenic, and toxic.”
There are places around the Arctic where rust-red rivers have been that way for centuries, like Canada’s Arctic Red River, also known in the Gwich’in language as Tsiigehnjik, meaning “iron river.”
But for the Salmon River, the change was abrupt.
The Bush pilot who ferried Sullivan and Dial to the site in 2019, who described the river’s appearance as similar to sewage, said it had just happened that year.
The toxicity findings are potentially ominous for fish health.
The timing of the change suggests that thaw-induced acid rock drainage could be one of the many factors depressing western Alaska salmon runs, the study found.

	Salmon runs have been disastrously low in the region for the past few years, sometimes precluding even traditional subsistence harvests that are relatively small in scale but hugely important to culture and food security.
At the very least, the timing is a coincidence, Sullivan said. “It’s identical to what you would expect if these degrading streams were impacting spawning success,” he said, pointing out that most of the chum salmon that returns to the Kotzebue Sound area do so at the ages of four of five years, after emerging from the spawning rivers and swimming around in the ocean.
There is too little evidence for now to definitely link the rust-tinted waters of the Salmon River to poor salmon runs, Sullivan said. That is largely because there is too little known about that river’s fish populations, though the name suggests that the river was important to salmon in the past, he said.
It appears to have been that way in the 1970s, when McPhee was there boating there, fishing, camping and collecting information for his book.
At that time, the water was so clear that the riverbed was “as distinct as if the water were not there,” McPhee wrote. Those clear waters chock-full of oval-shaped salmon swimming upstream to spawn, he wrote. “Looking over the side of the canoe is like staring down into a sky full of zeppelins,” he wrote.
The recent proliferation of rusting rivers is not limited to Alaska and other parts of the Arctic. There are affected high-altitude areas that have permafrost, glaciers or both, including Switzerland and neighboring parts of the Alps, Peru and parts of Colorado.
In Alaska, the rusting rivers phenomenon is more pronounced in the western part of the North Slope than in the eastern part, Sullivan and Dial have found. Their past studies linked the vegetation changes in the northwest to more pronounced warming on the Chukchi Sea side of Alaska’s Arctic than on the Beaufort Sea. That spread of woody plants is detrimental to tundra caribou that eat lichen and moss, and could help explain the decline in the Western Arctic caribou herd, which has a habitat that is changing more quickly than that of the Porcupine caribou herd on the eastern North Slope, they found.
After Sullivan and Dial encountered multiple rusting rivers during their plant studies, they felt compelled to alert fellow Alaskans about the situation.
They penned a 2022 column for the Anchorage Daily News. And they embarked on their further studies, which wound up generating a small National Science Foundation grant, creating partnerships with scientists at other universities who are experts in biochemistry and, ultimately, the newly published study on toxicity.
But before then, when they were expecting to see the same conditions that McPhee did in the 1970s, Sullivan packed a fishing rod with the gear he took on the trip to the Salmon River.
His attempts to fish in the murky, opaque water proved futile, however. “I think I tried for, like, five minutes and then I quickly realized that I was wasting my time,” he said.
That experience suggests that there might be further ecological impacts of the cloudy, rusted waters, he said.
“I think it would be very hard, for instance, for a bear to fish for a salmon just because of the turbidity. Raptors would have a really hard time catching a fish if they were fishing there,” he said, citing the suspended solids that make the water opaque.
For now, Sullivan and other scientists are using satellite imagery to spot other rivers and streams that might be similarly affected. The imagery is useful not just for spotting acid-tinted streams but the point sources in the tundra, he said.
It would be helpful to have more research on the region’s fish to explore whether they are carrying metals in their bodies, he said. Another topic of study could be the response of chum salmon in the region, as the species does show the some ability to shift habitats, he said.

“It’s possible that this will kind of run its course over some period of time.

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Larry Lessig, Harvard law professor and activist 







THE LATEST NEW ENGLAND effort to limit money in politics looks from a distance like a doomed project, betting on a conservative high court’s appetite to revisit the landmark Citizens United ruling that opened the floodgates to unlimited fundraising and spending. But backers of a Maine ballot measure believe the Roberts court might want a chance to clarify how much influence the wealthy can flex in US elections.  
Efforts to restrict money flowing into super political action committees (PACs), which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on campaigns as long as they don’t coordinate with the candidates they back, keep bumping up against the same issue: lower courts consistently declare that under Citizens United, that is simply unconstitutional.  
The landmark US Supreme Court decision in 2010 declared that political spending is protected speech and, unless there is a risk of quid-pro-quo corruption, that restricting the independent spending of corporations, unions, and nonprofit groups violates the First Amendment. 
In his concurring opinion in Citizens United, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that “the First Amendment protects more than just the individual on a soapbox and the lonely pamphleteer.”  
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith talks with Harvard law professor and political activist Larry Lessig about an ill-fated attempt to restrict PAC contributions in Massachusetts and the successful ballot effort in Maine. A coalition spearheaded by Lessig thinks it has a shot at convincing higher courts to embrace their legal theory – not to overturn Citizens United, but to embrace an originalist argument that might clarify its boundaries. 
“Though there are Republican super PACs and there are Democratic super PACs, what we’re worried about is there are no working class super PACS versus the rich person super PACs,” Lessig said. “All these super PACs are basically funded by the super super wealthy in America.”  
While individuals can only contribute $3,500 to a federal candidate during an election cycle, Lessig noted that the last cycle puts a somewhat absurd point on the role of super PAC contributions. Elon Musk’s PAC spent about $200 million to help elect Donald Trump, largely funded through Musk’s own contribution of $239 million, and the world’s richest man contributed millions to other PACs backing Republican Senate candidates and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” message. 
“The idea that the risk of corruption from a $3,300 contribution,” which is where the limit stood in the 2023-2024 cycle, “is greater than the risk of corruption from a $277 million contribution is just crazy talk,” Lessig said. “It’s not any opinion that the Supreme Court has ever uttered.” 
Then-Attorney General Maura Healey’s office rejected a ballot measure in 2022 in Massachusetts that would have capped super PAC contributions to $5,000, arguing that it would violate free speech rights. The matter died without the state’s high court ever getting into the merits, so Lessig turned to the northernmost New England state. 
Maine voters in 2024 overwhelmingly passed a ballot measure limiting Super PAC contributions to $5,000. Super PACs sued and won in the US District Court for the District of Maine. Lessig said an appeal will be filed in October with the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.  
The law’s backers say they not only expected the lawsuit, but climbing the courts was the plan.  
It was “designed to force the legal question,” agreed on by lower courts but never by the US Supreme Court, on whether Citizens United means that someone has the constitutional right to contribute unlimited amounts of money to PACs.  
Spending from all partisan PACs is soaring, Lessig said. 
“There’s no partisan reason to like PACs anymore,” he said, “and I think this Supreme Court would look at the world they’re in right now, where money in politics, Pew reports, is the number one issue Americans’ care about, that we have to fix this if we’re going to fix everything else, and they would look at the kind of corruption that’s in very plain sight right now with the president and everything else going on, and find it very hard to uphold a rule that would continue to fuel all of that corruption.” 
On the podcast, Lessig discusses the intent of the Maine ballot effort (1:40), super PAC use in both parties (8:35), and how he hopes the US Supreme Court would rule (29:30).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-29 09:58:51.010590

WILMINGTON — Aternium marked its two-year anniversary on Thursday, September 25, with the announcement of a $1 million investment from the State of Delaware to support the company’s next phase of engineering toward producing industrial clean hydrogen.
Nearly 100 community leaders attended the event, where Lt. Governor Kyle Evans Gay and Delaware Division of Small Business (DSB) Director CJ Bell presented a ceremonial check to Aternium founder Dr. Andrew Cottone.
The state’s $1 million investment comes from the Delaware Accelerator & Seed Capital Program (DASCP), one of four initiatives funded through the U.S. Treasury Department’s State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). Delaware is administering $60.9 million in SSBCI funds to expand access to capital for start-up and early-stage businesses.
Governor Matt Meyer praised Aternium’s work as an example of the innovation shaping Delaware’s future.
 “Aternium’s work represents the kind of forward-thinking innovation that will shape a healthier and more sustainable future for all of us,” Meyer said. “By investing in clean hydrogen, we’re not only supporting a Delaware company with incredible potential, but we’re also taking real steps to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment for generations to come.”

DSB Director CJ Bell emphasized the broader economic impact.
 “We are continuing to make significant investments in high-impact, high-growth companies to position Delaware as the Mid-Atlantic hub for innovation,” Bell said. “Supporting companies like Aternium is good for our state’s economy and our environment.”
Cottone said the funding validates Aternium’s mission and accelerates its progress. 
“We are grateful to the State of Delaware for this critical funding, which underscores the state’s commitment to innovation and clean energy,” he said. “This support accelerates our efforts to sustainably scale clean hydrogen production, strengthen our partnerships, and bring lasting economic and environmental benefits to Delaware.”
The anniversary event gathered strategic partners, elected officials, stakeholders, and members of the media to recognize Aternium’s achievements.

Wes Moore’s team is being promoted as part of a reorganization of the governor’s staff.
Emmanuel “Manny” Welsh will become principal deputy chief of staff and chief administrative officer. The move is part of a reorganization of the second floor offices of the State House by Lester Davis, Moore’s incoming chief of staff.
“Manny is a proven public servant with a deep well of expertise in the operations of government that’s vital to guiding Maryland through this unprecedented time,” Moore said in a statement.
“This moment is generationally defining for our state. We have a solid foundation to grow from as we diversify our economy to become less reliant on the federal government, but as that relationship changes, we need to ensure Marylanders continue to receive a high level of service from their state government,” Moore said. “His new leadership role will help ensure our agencies do just that.”
The changes announced this morning could be the first as Davis takes the reins as Moore’s new chief of staff.
“This will be an iterative process,” said David Turner, a Moore spokesman. “As Chief Davis integrates further with the team, roles and processes will adjust to ensure the administration better delivers at a high level for the people of Maryland.”

Welsh’s promotion takes effect Oct 15. Davis joins the governor’s office the same day. Welsh’s salary will be $202,000.
The model the office is moving to is relatively new to Maryland, though more than a dozen other states have similar organizational structures.
“Chief Davis brings his own experience and expertise to the role,” Turner said. “The model comes from his management experience in the City of Baltimore and at CareFirst.
“The Chief of Staff focuses on the most pressing strategic and political issues, orchestrates communications and political strategy, and manages upward to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor,” Turner’s statement said.
Davis, in his role, will serve as a gatekeeper to Moore — a traditional job for a chief of staff. Welsh, as second in command, will provide “executive-level oversight of state government operations,” Turner said.
“The Chief of Staff is responsible for the management, operations, strategy, policy, and external affairs of the Office of the Governor and the Moore–Miller Administration,” Turner said. “As the Governor’s highest-ranking aide and closest advisor, the Chief of Staff controls access and flow of information to the Governor, sets priorities, and ensures directives are executed across the Administration. All Deputy Chiefs of Staff will report directly to the Chief of Staff.”
Davis and Welsh take over at a time when advocacy groups, lobbyists, and others have complained over the last year that the second floor staff is unresponsive.
“The office of the governor takes seriously any critiques and suggestions for improvement,” Turner said. “Serving the state is a privilege, and during this unprecedented change in federal policy it’s vital the office adapts to the new environment. We’ll always look for ways to improve, as we have over the first two and a half years.”
Welsh’s promotion comes two weeks before Davis takes over as chief of staff.
Moore named Davis this month to succeed departing Chief of Staff Fagan Harris, who is leaving to become the president and CEO of the Abell Foundation in Baltimore.

Welsh will serve as “second-in-command” to Davis within Moore’s office. Welsh was one of several internal candidates for the chief of staff job.
He will also be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the office. As chief administrative officer, Welsh will work with Moore’s Cabinet and senior staff members. And he will continue overseeing Moore’s procurement policy and the Board of Public Works.
“This is a smart and timely decision as Maryland navigates changing dynamics with the federal government. By strengthening the Governor’s office with added structure, the administration will be able to respond more quickly and help agencies deliver critical services that meet Marylanders’ needs,” Kathy Hollinger, CEO of the Greater Washington Partnership, said in a statement provided by Moore’s office.
“Just as important, this model creates new opportunities to engage leading employers as partners — alongside government agencies — to ensure Maryland’s communities and economy remain strong,” her statement said. “This reflects the kind of forward-looking leadership this moment calls for.”
Moore, fresh off his 2022 election win, named Welsh as his liaison to the Board of Public Works.
Prior to that, Welsh worked for then-Comptroller Peter Franchot (D). Welsh, who was born in the Philippines, joined Franchot’s communication staff in 2015 and within a year, he was assisting the comptroller with the Board of Public Works. By 2020, Welsh was named Franchot’s chief of staff.

The low score was based in part on Evergy's decision to delay retirement of its coal power plant in Lawrence. (Jill Hummels/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Big utility companies nationwide lost ground this year in their plans to meet minimum climate targets, and Kansas’ Evergy received an F for a “multi-year backslide” from renewable investments, a Sierra Club report said. 
Evergy received 9 points out of 100 this year, dropping from 12 last year. The company earned a spotlight because of its move toward delaying the closure of a coal-burning plant and plans to build new gas-burning plants, the Dirty Truth about Utility Climate Pledges report said.  
The report grades 75 utilities across the country on plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035 and transition to clean energy through 2035, a press release said. 
“I think this is the worst year since we started doing the report five years ago,” said Ty Gorman, a Kansas organizing strategist for the Sierra Club. “The average score was 15. The purpose of the report was to inspire utilities to move us forward towards a livable future. We didn’t expect to see it go backwards.”
Gorman said Evergy’s decisions about natural gas plants and delaying closure of coal plants is part of a national trend. The stress of data centers and other large-load users on utility grids is being used as an “excuse” to move quickly, he said. 
Planning for a clean energy transition requires that utilities shift to running everything off of clean electricity, he said.
“There’s a good reason to increase load, but that’s at a steady pace that brings a lot of other benefits to the economy, to jobs, to ratepayers,” he said.
Data centers, though, offer a different kind of economic risk than other electric load growth types, Gorman said. The Kansas Sierra Club was part of the work at the Kansas Corporation Commission recently to determine how utilities like Evergy should make sure costs associated with new customers, like data centers, aren’t borne by other customers, he said.
“Evergy is courting data centers to come to the territory, and even with the changes, some of those costs shift to customers,” Gorman said. “I’d say that Evergy customers need to hold these large loads, these data centers, accountable to keep our bills low and lower our pollution by demanding that they use renewable energy.”
Gina Penzig, Evergy spokeswoman, said the company is delaying its expectations of a 70% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030.
“The reasons for this include growing demand growth because of the record economic growth in our service area and the need for new dispatchable generation, which is generation that can be turned on and off when our customers need it,” Penzig said. “The only sources of that would be natural gas, coal and potentially nuclear.”
Evergy announced last week that it is partnering with TerraPower to explore the possibility of building a nuclear power plant in Kansas, using advanced technology designed by TerraPower.
Penzig said Sierra Club has a narrow mission of retiring all fossil-fuel generation as soon as possible.
“At Evergy, we have to first ensure that it’s reliable, so it’s there when our customers need it. And what is the least cost combination of resources that we can use to get there,” she said. “If you look at our long-term plan, it has a considerable amount of renewables also being added to serve customers. The only reason we can do that is by combining it with traditional energy sources so that we can ensure we have reliable service.”
Penzig said the new generation of natural gas plants has advanced technology that makes them more efficient and cleaner than older plants.
Gorman said focusing on decreasing fossil fuel use is critical because of the effects of the climate crisis.
“We see them all across the country, the extreme weather, extreme heat, extreme cold,” he said. “They’re causing utility infrastructure to fall apart, especially gas and fossil fuel infrastructure. In response, these utilities in order to increase their profits are doubling down on that same gas and coal infrastructure that’s the most expensive.”
Gorman said it’s clear the utilities are going in the wrong direction. 
“(Evergy CEO) David Campbell is taking Evergy backwards, trying to increase fossil fuel product pollution and shareholder profits by spending as much as they can on expensive fossil fuel infrastructure, as much as the Kansas Corporation Commission will allow them to,” he said. That’s making our climate crisis worse. It’s making our bills higher, and it’s making our health worse.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Evergy-Lawrence-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 09:58:51.010590

Mike Braun denied clemency to death row inmate Roy Lee Ward in an announcement early Monday morning.
“After carefully reviewing the unanimous recommendation from the State Parole Board, I have decided to allow the execution of Roy Lee Ward to proceed as planned for October 10,” he said.
Unless a court intervenes, Ward will be the third person executed since Indiana resumed capital punishment in December 2024, after more than a decade-long pause. Braun denied clemency for another death row inmate, Benjamin Ritchie, earlier this year.
The Indiana Parole Board last week recommended against granting clemency to Ward.
The five-member panel cited the “brutal nature” of Ward’s 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne, emphasizing that Payne was conscious during the attack and her “final hours living with the injuries that Roy Lee Ward inflicted on her.”
“Candidly, this Board reviews thousands of cases a year, many with gruesome facts, but the victimization of Stacy Payne stood out to us,” wrote parole board chairperson Gwen Horth.
Ward clemency hearing: Victim’s family asks for ‘no mercy,’ defense cites autism diagnosis, remorse

Ward’s legal team has argued in court that Indiana’s current protocol creates a constitutionally unacceptable risk of pain and suffering, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
The inmate’s legal team continues to challenge the use of the drug pentobarbital, citing evidence that it can cause flash pulmonary edema and sensations of drowning. They point to Ritchie’s execution in May, when witnesses reportedly saw the inmate “lurch upward, as if to sit up, in a spasm” after the injection, a reaction they say is “inconsistent with the normal effects of unadulterated pentobarbital.”
In pending federal litigation brought by Ward, the Indiana Attorney General’s office confirmed last week that the Department of Correction has obtained “three sets” of pentobarbital.
Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal said in a sworn declaration submitted to the Northern District judge that two of those sets will expire at the end of October and the third set expires in March 2026.
The governor previously disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent by former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
State officials have not responded to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s questions about the amount paid for the latest three doses.
The state’s court filings also stressed that DOC is using “manufactured injectable pentobarbital” — not a compounded version — to carry out executions. Manufactured pentobarbital is produced in sterile facilities under federal quality controls, with longer shelf lives and stricter oversight than compounded alternatives, according to court filings.
Ward’s attorneys proposed that executions could be carried out more humanely if DOC administered a “pre-dose” of fentanyl or another opioid before pentobarbital, but Neal said in his declaration that the department “does not intend to use fentanyl as part of carrying out the death sentence” and that it is not included in the prison’s directives.

Filthy bathrooms. It’s among the things retired law enforcement park ranger John Lauretig remembers about the last government shutdown. National Parks staff were furloughed, but the parks remained open from December 2018 through January 2019, leading to a human waste problem: There was a half-ton of human waste alone at Death Valley outside the restrooms when parks staff returned. 
That crummy situation may be a sign of what awaits many Californians soon if the government shutdown takes hold Wednesday, writes CalMatters’ reporters.
A shutdown occurs when Congress and the president fail to agree over how to keep funding the government’s discretionary spending, which includes bridge repairs, disease detection and more. The White House says to check an agency’s website to see how programs would be affected during a shutdown. Some workers are deemed “essential” and continue to work.
Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare are mandatory programs that are excluded from the annual discretionary budget process, and, for the most part, should be unaffected by a shutdown. 
Congressional lawmakers must make a deal by Tuesday, 11:59 p.m. Democratic leaders want Republicans to undo the Medicaid cuts they implemented in President Donald Trump’s tax bill this summer and extend the federal subsidies for Affordable Care Act enrollees initially enacted under former President Joe Biden.
Meanwhile, Trump is floating the prospect of firing federal workers en masse should the shutdown occur. California is home to roughly 150,000 federal employees.
The National Park Service has lost nearly a quarter of its permanent staff since Trump’s return to the White House, according to an estimate by the National Parks Conservation Association. 
Read more about other government spending programs that could be affected in California during a shutdown, including air travel, disaster readiness and financial support for low-income families.

Protecting abortion providers

From CalMatters health reporter Kristen Hwang:
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a measure into law Friday that safeguards the identity of abortion providers in California. The law allows doctors, pharmacists and other authorized medical staff to prescribe abortion pills without putting their names or the patient’s name on the prescription label. It goes into effect immediately. 
Doctors in California and New York have been sued for providing abortion medication to residents in states where the procedure is not allowed.
The new law heightens the contrast between California’s abortion protections and laws in states like Texas, which heavily restrict or ban abortion, and allow their residents to sue out-of-state abortion providers.
Newsom said he was proud to sign the bill “in the face of amplified attacks on the fundamental right to reproductive freedom.”
The new law also requires state health insurance plans to cover the abortion pill even if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration yanks its approval.



Feds end tracking for food insecurity

From CalMatters’ health editor Molly Peterson:
California is showing alarm after the U.S. Department of Agriculture said that it would terminate the nationwide Household Food Security Report. Nearly one in eight households statewide are food insecure, according to the Public Policy Institute of California, meaning that they lack the resources to ensure that everyone has enough to eat to support active, healthy lives. 
The survey is a “gold standard,” said Barbara Laraia, professor and chair of the UC Berkeley’s Food Nutrition and Population Health Program. Without it, policymakers, researchers and nonprofits relying on the 30-year-old report’s annual data to track hunger trends and allocate resources will be “flying blind,” said Mauricio Torres Jr., a spokesman for the Sacramento-based nonpartisan California Budget & Policy Center.  
State-level data efforts still can inform some local responses to hunger. UCLA’s California Health Interview Survey has tracked food insecurity for more than 20 years, identifying greater needs among low-income households, communities of color and immigrants.
But the USDA’s decision comes as county public health departments report to CalMatters that even the threat of losing federal funding is starving food stamp education and nutrition programs that could help Californians in need.



Tribal regalia for CA high school grads

From CalMatters K-12 education reporter Carolyn Jones:
Native American students will face fewer obstacles if they want to wear tribal regalia at high school graduations, thanks to a bill Gov. Newsom signed Friday.
Assembly Bill 1369 allows students to wear eagle feathers, abalone necklaces, stoles and other regalia to graduation ceremonies without needing approval from the school district in advance. California already allowed students to wear tribal regalia, but at least half of school districts had pre-approval processes that some students said were overly cumbersome and arbitrary.

Assemblymember James Ramos, a San Bernardino Democrat and the bill’s author, in a statement: “Just acknowledging — once again — a student’s right to wear tribal regalia at high school graduation ceremonies is a far cry from early statehood, when California’s first governor called for a ‘War of Extermination’ against the tribes.”

Schools had said they need the pre-approval process to ensure that graduation adornments are respectful and appropriate. The process applied to all students, not just Native American students, although Native American students were more likely to wear regalia.
Regalia, which is often bestowed by a tribal elder or family member, is a way to celebrate the accomplishments of Native American students and raise awareness of the culture, Ramos said.

Brown’s home is elevated, so the water hasn’t reached the interior. Not yet. But she’s deeply worried about what the future will bring.
“If the water continues rising the way it is, I don’t want to be here,” said Brown, 58, who works as a medical driver. “… I love my area. But I think my life is more important.”
Just a half mile to the south, a massive new development — expected to bring stores, offices and 4,000 homes — is springing up. Brown fears that all the new concrete and pavement will only make flooding where she lives worse.
Charleston is one of the nation’s fastest-growing cities — and one of the most flood-prone. As climate change prompts sea levels to rise and storms to grow more intense, this historic city has become a warning bell for what’s to come along America’s coasts: Some neighborhoods will retreat and others will be protected, and still others — often lower-income communities — may be left behind.

In Charleston, those futures are colliding. The city and the federal government are planning a $1.3 billion seawall to defend the iconic downtown peninsula with its regal, pre-Civil War mansions and majestic moss-covered live oak trees.
On Sept. 9, the City Council approved spending $2.5 million for continued design work and authorized an agreement between the city and Army Corps of Engineers. The city’s share of the total price tag is $455 million, reported The Post and Courier.
But under the current plans, the wall would not extend to lower-income neighborhoods like Rosemont, a historically Black community bordered by a freeway and hemmed in by industrial sites. That could leave those families more exposed than ever.
“I’ve seen how all those floodwaters demolish people’s houses,” Brown said. “I don’t think I want to be part of that.”
What’s happening in Charleston is playing out in dozens of coastal cities from New York to California.
Driven largely by sea level rise, flooding in the coastal United States is projected to occur 10 times more often over the next 25 years, according to a recent analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central.
An estimated 2.5 million Americans could be forced to relocate over the next 25 years, the group found.
The increasing floods are prompting insurance companies to raise premiums and decline policy renewals. In fact, ZIP codes in coastal South Carolina are among those with the highest insurance nonrenewal rates, according to a Brookings Institution analysis. All of that is likely to push some residents to higher, or drier, ground.
To understand how Charleston reached this tipping point — and what makes it especially vulnerable — you have to start with its geography.

Rising water, growing crisis
Built along the confluence of three rivers and the Atlantic Ocean, the city was founded on marshland and mud flats. Flooding there was once far less frequent.
But now, even an afternoon thunderstorm or an unusually high tide can overwhelm drainage systems and submerge streets.
The problem isn’t just more rain — it’s higher water. The sea level in Charleston rose about 13 inches over the past century. But by 2050, scientists project it will accelerate, rising an additional 1.2 feet. And by the end of the century, the water is expected to be about 4 feet higher than it is today.
The ground is sinking, too.
Charleston is one of the most rapidly subsiding cities in the United States, mainly because of groundwater pumping and the settling of natural sediments and filled marsh areas. That double threat — rising seas and sinking land — leaves the city increasingly exposed to flooding.
According to Climate Central’s Coastal Risk Finder, more than 8,000 people and 4,700 homes in Charleston County will be at risk of annual flooding by 2050, even under moderate climate action scenarios. By 2100, more than 60,000 people could be affected.
The Lowcountry, as this region is known, was always low. But now, it’s getting lower, wetter and harder to protect.
Rapid development, meanwhile, is paving over forests and wetlands that once soaked up stormwater. Every new subdivision and strip mall replaces absorbent ground with impervious surfaces — asphalt, rooftops, parking lots — that send rainwater rushing into neighborhoods like Rosemont.
The uneven fight against the sea
After Hurricane Matthew sent water surging over Charleston’s iconic Battery wall in 2016, then-Mayor John Tecklenburg and other officials consulted with Dutch flood experts, seeking to tap the know-how of a country renowned for its expertise in holding back the sea.

Charleston developed a comprehensive city water plan to protect itself while promoting resilient growth. Federal officials proposed an 8-mile-long, $1.3 billion seawall to shield the city’s historic peninsula from future storm surges and sea level rise.
The city’s share will likely be more than $450 million. Tecklenburg said that won’t be an easy sell. But to the former mayor, the choice is clear.
He told Floodlight, “If you give up the peninsula, you might as well head for the hills.”
But neighborhoods like Rosemont — just beyond the wall’s reach — will remain exposed. Parts of the neighborhood are projected to be underwater by the end of the century. And some fear the wall could actually make flooding worse in unprotected areas.
Skip Mikell, a longtime community leader in Union Heights, a historically Black neighborhood, stood at the end of Peace Street in Rosemont, looking out over a nearby marsh.
“In 70 years, where we’re standing, if nothing’s done, it’s going to be water,” Mikell said, adding: “The gentry of Charleston have connections, they have money, they have a voice. These communities are voiceless.”
The long road to retreat

 
About 12 miles northwest of downtown Charleston, a tranquil expanse of weeds, marsh grasses and black-eyed Susans stretches across what used to be a neighborhood. Bridge Pointe was once a compact community of 32 townhomes.
The site was returned to nature after the city and federal government bought out its flood-weary residents. But like many buyouts across the country, the process was slow and bureaucratic.
SC is buying out more than 200 repeatedly flooded homes. Here’s how the effort has gone.

John Knipper was among those displaced. Newly retired, he moved from New York to Charleston in early 2015, buying a three-bedroom townhome in Bridge Pointe for $172,000.
But just six months after he moved in, an August thunderstorm turned a nearby creek into a river. Several inches of water crept into his living room. Then in October 2015, a stalled weather system dumped more than 15 inches of rain on the region. His first floor was submerged under 2 ½ feet of water.
Over the next few years, the storms and floods kept coming. In 2017, FEMA authorized $10 million to buy out Bridge Pointe residents and their neighbors. By then, it had flooded four times, making the homes, Knipper said, “really unsellable.”
It took nearly four years after buyout discussions began for residents to get money for relocation. A typical buyout can take more than five years, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The U.S. Government Accountability Office, meanwhile, found that there’s no national strategy for relocating people from flood-prone areas.
Building toward disaster
Just a mile away, many more homes are on the way.

Long Savannah, a massive new development, is expected to bring up to 4,500 homes. It’s one of several high-profile projects rising in flood-prone areas across Charleston County.
Like other mega developments planned for Charleston, Long Savannah will likely destroy wetlands, which work like nature’s sponges, soaking up rain and slowly releasing it to keep flooding in check.
Other massive developments on the books include Magnolia Landing, the 4,000-home project underway near the Rosemont community, and Cainhoy, a 9,000-home development that would fill wetlands on a low-lying peninsula near Charleston where flooding is already a growing threat.
“Charleston has a history of building in repetitively flooded areas,” said Robby Maynor, a climate campaign associate with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which sued to save some of the wetlands in the Long Savannah project. “We absolutely must stop building in low-lying and flood-prone areas to avoid making an already difficult situation even worse.”
Charleston city officials say they now require flood protections — such as higher elevation standards and better stormwater systems — for new buildings in flood-prone areas. But scientists and residents question whether those measures are enough, or whether building in risky areas simply shifts the danger to others.
“A similar story is playing out in cities all across the United States,” reports NASA’s Earth Observatory, “but the Charleston area stands out in one critical way — much of the new development has happened on low-lying land that is especially vulnerable to sea level rise and flooding.”
When leaving isn’t a choice
Ana Zimmerman and her husband bought their modest, one-story house on Shoreham Road — part of a close-knit neighborhood where neighbors looked after each other’s kids — in 2005.

The first sign of trouble came early one morning in October 2015. It was still dark when she put her feet to the bedroom floor, water lapping at her ankles. A powerful storm had overwhelmed the street.
Zimmerman rushed to save photo albums and the family cats, but the house suffered more than $80,000 in damages.
With the insurance payout and their own labor, the Zimmermans repaired the home.
But when Tropical Storm Irma hit two years later, Zimmerman remembers hearing neighbors screaming as 7 inches of floodwaters poured into her home — causing it to be declared a total loss.
Ultimately the couple abandoned the flood-damaged home and let it go into foreclosure, walking away from 12 years of equity.
They now live nearby in a house on an elevated foundation. Zimmerman, who calls herself an “unintentional flood activist,” has pressed public officials for stricter building rules and clearer flood-risk disclosures.
She says her experience is a “canary in a coal mine” for other low-lying coastal communities.
“Entire neighborhoods will have to move,” said Zimmerman, a college biology professor. “But the vulnerable among us, there will be no one there to help them, save them, and they will not be able to save themselves.”

It would also provide legal and symbolic support to researchers who have been mostly fighting on their own.,"Guest Commentary written by

Blake Emerson
Blake Emerson is a law professor at UCLA.


The Trump administration’s assault on American higher education has recently been fixated on UCLA, where I teach administrative law and executive power. 
The White House has moved to cut off $584 million in federal funds for the university’s supposed failure to prevent antisemitism on its campus. It has demanded a penalty of almost $1.2 billion dollars, insisted that the university not admit “anti-Western” students, publicly disavow recognition of the transgender community, and end gender-affirming care at the university’s hospitals.
This a moment to stand up and fight. The University of California Regents must challenge the Trump administration in federal court. At the same time, Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state legislature must provide the UC system with the financial support it needs to stand for the rule of law and academic freedom.
The university has the law on its side. My colleagues and I drafted an open letter to the UC Regents explaining why the funding terminations were unlawful. Over 170 professors at UC law schools have signed it. The Trump administration has ignored the clear procedural requirements of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 — such as the requirement that it provide for a hearing before an impartial decisionmaker before terminating funds, report to Congress and offer substantial evidence for its charges.
Last week, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating UCLA’s funds. However, the Supreme Court has created jurisdictional doubts about this and other lawsuits, suggesting that some claims may need to proceed in the obscure federal Court of Claims. 
A suit by the regents in the Court of Claims would help to fill any gaps created by the Supreme Court’s unclear and evolving jurisprudence. It would also provide legal and symbolic support to researchers who have so far been fighting the university’s legal battle on their own.
These days the law is not always enough. Since the government has failed to provide due process, universities reasonably fear that failure to comply will only bring on more deadly funding cut-offs, and perhaps other forms punishment, such as loss of nonprofit status.
Given this climate of fear, the university and the state will need to partner to challenge the government’s illegal persecution. Newsom has already urged the regents to fight back against the Trump administration, asking, “How could you possibly accept this fine. Fine for what?” 
He’s right. But the university receives over $17 billion a year in federal funding, including $5.7 billion for research and program support. It would struggle to survive, much less maintain its status as a world-class research and educational institution, if all of those funds were withdrawn. 
Newsom and the state can help. Democratic lawmakers in California have proposed a ballot measure that would provide for $23 billion in funding for state grants for research. The proposal would leverage California’s unparalleled economic strength to check the Trump administration’s lawlessness. 
Faculty, staff and students know that we will bare serious burdens in a protracted legal battle with the Trump administration. But we cannot do it alone. We need the support of our state and of our fellow Californians.
California holds a unique place in the American mind — above and beyond the output of Hollywood. America would not be the same without that western boundary, where the endless and often destructive quest for imperial expansion once reached its limit.
If California succeeds, then the history of the United States can move forward on broad, sunlit beaches. If we fail, we may slip into a night made darker by the dimming of scientific light.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/040825_UCLA-Funding-Cuts_JH_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-29 08:57:11.086397

Social Security and Medicare benefits will keep flowing in a government shutdown, but federal employees will be working without pay and delays likely will occur across many services.


John Lauretig remembers the filthy bathrooms, the overflowing trash cans and the community of people who rallied to clean up Joshua Tree National Park the last time the U.S. Government shut down. 
For more than a month from December 2018 through January 2019, thousands of National Park Service employees were furloughed nationwide — but the Trump administration kept many national parks open.
Unsupervised, visitors drove through wilderness and historic sites, camped where they weren’t supposed to, and vandalized plants and buildings at parks across California. The trash — and the feces — piled up. In the days after the shutdown ended, park staff found at least 1,665 clumps of toilet paper littering Death Valley alone, where an estimated half-ton of human waste had been left outside the restrooms. 
“It was insane to leave the gates open and tell the staff not to show up in the park — for our public lands, and all of our special places in this country, to be unprotected,” said Lauretig, a retired law enforcement park ranger and president of the Friends of Joshua Tree nonprofit.
Now, facing the prospect of another imminent shutdown, conservation groups and retired park service employees including Lauretig are calling to keep the gates locked at national parks and historic landmarks. 
They’re among many Californians bracing for the shutdown, which is expected to begin Wednesday unless Democrats and Republicans can make a deal by 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday.   
As of now, the parties appear far apart, although President Donald Trump and congressional leaders are expected to meet today. Democratic leaders in Congress are demanding that Republicans reverse Medicaid cuts made in Trump’s signature tax and spending bill earlier this year and extend Biden-era subsidies used by a majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees. 
In response, the Trump administration has floated firing federal workers en masse if the shutdown occurs. 
“Democrats are hoping to use the one bit of leverage that they have left in Washington at this time to make it clear what they stand for,” said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at UC San Diego. “And the question is: Can they hold out against the political and policy pain that Donald Trump is hoping to impose by threatening more layoffs of government employees?”
The federal government shut down three times during the Obama and Trump presidencies. Each one presents a hardship for government employees, who are either furloughed or obliged to work without pay. 
About 150,000 federal employees work in California, not counting the military service members who also will go without pay during a shutdown.
In the past when facing possible federal shutdowns, the state had a contingency plan to try to avoid disruptions in certain services. In late 2023, it planned to pay one month’s worth of federal food assistance early to advance aid to families in the event of a shutdown.
But this year there’s no such commitment yet from the Department of Finance, as Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration weighs the possibility of a lengthy shutdown. 
“There isn’t an open-ended long-term line of credit where the state’s general fund can be assumed to make up for any federal fund shortfall,” finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer said.
Here’s a look at what Californians can expect to happen if a shutdown occurs this week. 
Social Security and health care
Most Californians shouldn’t worry about a federal shutdown impacting their Social Security benefits or their health care access in the near term. 
About 6.5 million Californians receive benefits through the Social Security Administration and those checks are expected to continue going out during a shutdown. 
But, customer service could suffer depending on how many employees are told to stay home, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. 
That includes “benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards. The level of disruption will depend on how many (Social Security Administration) employees the Trump administration deems ‘essential’ and ‘non-essential’ during the shutdown,” Max Richtman, the organization’s president, said in a written statement. 
Medicaid and Medicare, which pay for health care for low-income individuals, people with disabilities and seniors, are mandatory programs that are exempt from the annual appropriations process.
Jan Emerson-Shea, spokesperson for the California Hospital Association, said “essential services” like insurance payments to hospitals and doctors will continue. 
Some discretionary programs, however, like food stamps and benefits for women, infants and children may be impacted by a shutdown.
One group that could be disproportionately affected by even a brief federal shutdown are native and indigenous populations. Many of the 723,000 American Indians living in California get health care at clinics that are funded through federal grants. The clinics are often small and may have very little reserves to weather a funding pause, said Nanette Star, policy director for the California Consortium for Urban Indian Health. 
“Even a short shutdown can mean staff furloughs, service cuts, patient service delays,” Star said. 
Airports and travel
You’ll be able to fly and take rides during a government shutdown, but you might experience more delays. 
That’s because air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents are among the government employees who would be expected to show up for work without getting paid. The longer a shutdown drags out, the more likely it is that the system will strain and workers will call in sick. 
The U.S. Travel Association, which advocates for the industry, released a statement last week that included a survey showing many people would cancel or postpone travel during a shutdown, which it argued would ripple through the economy. 
“A shutdown is a wholly preventable blow to America’s travel economy—costing $1 billion every week—and affecting millions of travelers and businesses while placing unnecessary strain on an already overextended federal travel workforce,” said Geoff Freeman, the organization’s president. 
Wildfires and disasters
A federal shutdown won’t ground firefighters, but could slow the money that pays for future disaster prep. 
Nick Schuler, a spokesperson for Cal Fire, said the agency does not expect a shutdown to affect its “ability to respond to and aggressively attack fires” and will continue to operate as normal. In past shutdowns, he said, U.S. Forest Service firefighters have still been available for emergency response and pointed to California’s “robust Master Mutual Aid System,” which ensures resources respond regardless of jurisdiction.

Still, he cautioned that what keeps engines running today might not pay for the prevention work of tomorrow: “Any disruption to grant funding that supports fire prevention and wildfire resiliency could have negative impacts,” he said.
Newsom’s office said the Federal Emergency Management Agency would keep “core life-saving operations” going during a shutdown but that payments to states would stall and recovery efforts would be put on hold. That means Californians could see first responders in action but face delays in reimbursement or recovery projects.
Other science agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey could face interruptions that affect California’s disaster readiness, the governor’s spokesperson said.
National parks
National parks supporters are worried that the Trump administration again would send home workers but leave open the gates. 
That’s “a recipe for even more disaster,” said Kate Groetzinger, communications manager at the Center for Western Priorities, an environmental advocacy group. “It will be worse this time than it was last time around, simply because the parks are already struggling.”
She was referring to federal staffing cuts the Trump administration carried out earlier this year. The National Parks Conservation Association estimates that the National Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff since Trump’s second term began, and left thousands of seasonal positions unfilled. 
If a shutdown does occur, the association projects daily losses of $1 million in fee revenue for the parks, and $77 million for the gateway communities that surround them. 
Morale among National Park workers is bad already — and a shutdown would make it worse, said Bernadette Johnson, a former superintendent of Manzanar National Historic Site, where during World War II the U.S. Government incarcerated thousands of Japanese Americans. 
“The attack has just been so furious. And I think that federal employees are being demonized, as these lazy bureaucrats that we are not … It breaks my heart to watch,” Johnson said. “The people left behind are holding all of that work now, because the work didn’t go away.”
A spokesperson for the The National Park Service said the agency is reviewing and updating plans for a lapse in funding.
However a shutdown may play out, Lauretig over at Joshua Tree said he’s ready.

Gov. Gavin Newsom will have to decide soon if renters can fight eviction if their Social Security checks are disrupted during President Trump’s second term


With the Trump administration again threatening mass firings of federal employees, Gov. Gavin Newsom must soon decide whether California landlords must accept Social Security benefit delays as an excuse not to evict tenants who fall behind on rent.
Earlier this month, the California Legislature passed Culver City Democratic Assemblymember Isaac Bryan’s Assembly Bill 246. The measure would give tenants legal protections in eviction proceedings if their Social Security benefits are “terminated, delayed, or reduced due to no fault of the tenant” and the federal problems caused them to miss rent.
Bryan introduced the bill this spring in the middle of the uproar over President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency campaign to slash the federal workforce and fears that Republicans would cut Social Security payments, which they ultimately didn’t do.
“It’s an assurance that if President Trump does come for our aunties and our granddads and our disabled brothers and sisters that California will be there to protect them and won’t let them slide into homelessness because their Social Security was cut off,” Bryan told the Senate Judiciary Committee in July.
Newsom hasn’t indicated whether he’ll sign the measure. Newsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos declined to comment. He has until Oct. 13 to make a decision. 
Recent developments in Washington, D.C.could put fresh pressure on Newsom to sign the legislation. Trump’s top federal budget official, Russ Vought, sent a memo last week to the heads of federal agencies telling them to begin more mass firings of federal workers if the government shuts down because Congress can’t pass a spending bill. It’s not clear what Vought’s proposed cuts would mean for Social Security Administration staffing.
Democratic and Republican members of Congress are at an impasse on the government funding bill. Democrats are demanding Republicans restore billions of dollars of federal health care funding Republicans cut earlier this year. The federal government could shut down on Wednesday if they don’t reach an agreement.  Social Security payments haven’t been interrupted during previous government shutdowns. 
But the administration’s threat of more staffing cuts could pose a separate threat. 
This year, DOGE cut roughly 12% of the Social Security Administration workforce, contributing to backlogs at field offices around the country. Customer service problems at Social Security offices are still happening, The New York Times reported last week. 
What the bill means for California renters 
Roughly 6.5 million Californians receive Social Security benefits. It’s not clear how many of California’s estimated 17 million renters rely on the payments for rent. 
But older people eligible for Social Security benefits are an increasing share of renters. One rental market research company estimated that the number of seniors renting in the U.S. has climbed by 30% over the past decade, including a 31% increase in the Los Angeles area and a 24% spike in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The pending law would give renters in a court eviction proceeding the right to cite delays in Social Security payments to avoid being kicked out of their home or apartment. 
If a renter could prove the federal government was at fault for delaying benefits they use to pay rent, the court would be required to pause the eviction for up to six months. Within 14 days of the Social Security benefits being restored, a tenant would have to pay all past due rent or come up with “a mutually agreed upon payment plan” with their landlord. 
The pending law would be in effect until Jan. 20, 2029, the day Trump leaves office from his second term. 
Supporters include organizations advocating for the poor and disabled, such as California Council of the Blind and Disability Rights California.
“Due to recent actions by federal officials, including deep staffing cuts and office closures, any government program is at risk,” including Social Security, Eric Harris of Disability Rights California told lawmakers. 
The influential labor organizations Service Employees International Union and the California Teachers Association, which donate heavily to legislators, also support the bill. The two labor groups and their affiliate unions have donated at least $27.9 million to legislators since 2015, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.

Opponents included the California apartment and building industries’ associations and the California Chamber of Commerce. In total, those three groups have donated at least $13.6 million to legislators since 2015, according to Digital Democracy.
Republicans and some Democrats oppose
Debra Carlton of the California Apartment Association told the Senate Judiciary Committee in July that any delays in rent prevent “senior mom and pop landlords” from paying their mortgages on time.
Sen. Roger Niello, a Republican representing the Sacramento suburbs, shared those worries with his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. He also noted that “President Trump, both in his first term, as well as in this term, has repeatedly said he doesn’t want to touch Social Security.”
“If the president is good to his word, this bill will do absolutely nothing,” Bryan replied. “But … Californians can’t afford to trust this president. He’s shown several times early in this administration that he is not good to his word.”
No Republicans voted for the bill as it made its way through both chambers. Two Democrats also were apparently leery of it and voted against their colleague’s measure – a rarity in the California Legislature. As CalMatters has reported, Democrats vote “no” on average less than 1% of the time.
Norwalk Democratic Sen. Bob Archuleta cast the lone Democratic “no” vote for the measure on the Senate floor earlier this month. He didn’t explain his vote at the time, and a spokesperson didn’t return a message from CalMatters.
In the Assembly, Democratic member Anamarie Ávila Farías of Concord also joined Republicans in voting against it when it was before her chamber the final time.

This latest evidence of the opioid epidemic’s ongoing impact in New Mexico comes as the state ranks poorly on transparency in disclosing how it will use more than $850 million in opioid settlement funds, according to a OpioidSettlementTracker.com, a clearinghouse and accountability tracker for opioid settlement information created in 2019 by public health advocate and attorney Christine Minhee.

According to New Mexico state law, settlement funds must be primarily used to address the damage the drugs have done and to prevent future harms. But agreements the state made in the settlements do not require public reporting on how the money is spent or public input in spending decisions. According to the Opioid Settlement Tracker, New Mexico stands among a minority of states that earned a “0%” on its Expenditure Report Tracker, indicating the state has not committed to any public reporting of settlement fund spending. The data is based on research that included calls to the state and ongoing investigations of publicly available documents related to the settlements.
The Tracker notes that settlement fund spending is subject to examination by the New Mexico State Auditor’s office, but that the results of those audits are not made public.

By comparison, Colorado makes 100% of its opioid fund spending public through its Colorado Opioid Settlement Dashboard. Arizona likewise posts its state settlement allocations online. Wyoming, California, Georgia, Iowa, Wisconsin and several other states have committed to making at least some state opioid spending public.  
Patrick M. Brenner, president of nonprofit think tank Southwest Public Policy Institute, pointed to the importance of public understanding of the settlement funds’ purpose in creating an environment of accountability. 
“The state has not done a decent enough job of educating the public about the success story of holding these pharmaceutical companies accountable,” he said, “so not as many people know to ask questions.”
The opioid settlements, which total more than $50 billion nationally, rank historically among the country’s highest-dollar public health settlements. Because states must use the settlement money for opioid remediation, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health calls the settlements “an unprecedented opportunity” to address the decades-long opioid epidemic. States are receiving funds over 20 years from corporations including Johnson & Johnson, CVS and Walmart for their roles in creating, exacerbating and perpetuating the epidemic. 











“The state has not done a decent enough job of educating the public about the success story of holding these pharmaceutical companies accountable, so not as many people know to ask questions.”

New Mexico has been especially hard hit by the opioid crisis. In 2023, the most recent data available, the state had the seventh highest overdose rate in the U.S. While overdoses overall in the state have been declining since 2021, a recent state legislative analysis notes lack of evidence “that use of fentanyl or other opioids has also decreased.” Rather, the decline is attributable to increased use of harm-reduction medication such as Narcan to counter overdoses.
In 2023, Santa Fe County Community Services Department rolled out a public awareness campaign related to fentanyl that included “Never Use Alone” messaging. The New Mexico Health Department recently reported a surge of overdoses in Santa Fe, Rio Arriba and Taos counties, possibly linked to increased amounts of fentanyl in the supply in the three counties.
“I’ve had a lot of conversations with people who just felt so blindsided [by opioid addiction]. They didn’t see it coming,” said Claire Carmony, a social worker and program manager with the New Mexico Crisis and Access Line, which receives nearly 40 calls and texts a day from people across the state seeking help with addiction. “We get a lot of calls from concerned family members, loved ones, friends and community members that are impacted,” she said. “So opioid use disorder really has a big impact on our community as a whole, and people really struggle.” 
Accountability
New Mexico’s management of opioid funds has been called into question before. A brief published last year by the state’s Legislative Finance Committee called attention to contingent-fee legal contracts that wiped out nearly $250 million from awards the state won against pharmacies. The brief also pointed out the relatively short period the state has to pay those fees. 
“The lawyers received their money a lot faster than the state or local governments will ever get their money in,” Felix Chavez, a financial analyst and former LFC staff member who worked on the brief, told Source NM. “If [New Mexico] were to have the same payout structure that these attorneys did, a lot more could be done” to mitigate the crisis, he said. 
The LFC brief followed a 2023 opinion by the New Mexico State Ethics Commission after the Walgreens judgement, from which lawyers were paid $159 million of the state’s $500 million award. The SEC wrote that “several public bodies” were illegally sidestepping the state’s procurement code in making deals with outside law firms. In a 2023 statement, New Mexico Department of Justice Chief of Staff Lauren Rodriguez said the Walgreens legal agreements “contained no limit on fees.” She added that Attorney General Raúl Torrez had “instituted a new policy that sets strict limits on contingency fee cases,” though she did not provide further details about what those limits were. She also noted that even with lawyers’ fees, “New Mexico ranks third nationally compared to other states’ total settlements (including their attorney’s fees).”
Brenner said that while the state is required to spend the settlement money on addiction prevention and treatment, safeguards to ensure that happens are lacking. 
“Even if people are well-intentioned in handling these funds, they’ve got this relatively large infusion of money,” making accountability loopholes risky, he said. 
This summer, another LFC report showed that state programs for medication-assisted treatment, or MAT, which are funded by opioid settlement money, were underused and lacked outcome data. MAT, in which people with opioid and other substance use disorders are treated with medication, is among the most effective ways to treat addiction. 
Making a dent

Accountability notwithstanding, Josh Swatek, policy and performance director with the New Mexico Department of Health, calls the settlement funds “a game-changer.” He told Source NM that the funds allow for systemic advances in addiction prevention and treatment, including medications for incarcerated people; education in schools; harm reduction resources; and behavioral health services.
“Without the settlement funds we would have a much smaller scope,” Swatek said. “We wouldn’t have the link to harm reduction, and we would have less staff.” 
Brenner pointed out that despite the state’s failure to safeguard accountability in spending, cities and counties have worked to ensure the money is allocated properly. 
At a September meeting of the Legislative Health and Human Services Committee, Dona Ana County Health and Human Services Director Jamie Michael told legislators funds were being used for prevention and treatment, including ensuring availability of MAT in doctors’ offices and purchasing Narcan for first responders, state health offices and emergency departments to have on hand. She noted that in just the past month, four people had overdosed in the county, two of them fatally. “This seems like a lot of money over a long period of time,” she told lawmakers. “With all the needs, it’s not necessarily a lot of money.” 
Last year, Bernalillo County and the City of Albuquerque teamed up with global health nonprofit Vital Strategies to create a strategic plan for dealing with the crisis, which includes bringing prevention education to middle school students. “People are dying from drug overdoses,” said Dr. Wayne Lindstrom, Bernalillo County’s deputy manager of behavioral health, who echoed Michael’s emphasis on harm reduction to save lives. “How many deaths is too many?”  
Claire Carmony, a social worker and program manager with the New Mexico Crisis and Access Line, says the organization receives numerous calls from people whose lives have been impacted by opioid use. (Courtesy photo)
Like Michael, Lindstrom emphasized how important it is to be “laser focused” when allocating settlement funds. “People hear about these large sums of money and they get the perception that this is really a significant investment,” Lindstrom said. “Bottom line is that $2.2 million is not going to make a significant difference relative to the scale and scope of the problem overall,” he said. 
With the Trump administration’s Medicaid cuts, poor transparency could make opioid funds vulnerable to diversion to other uses, said Brenner. Even if the state is well intentioned, “the absolute top level right thing is to make sure that these monies are only spent on what they are meant for—not plugging Medicaid budgets.”
Nationally, the final chapter in the opioid lawsuits is underway. In June, states across the U.S., including New Mexico, agreed to a $7.4 billion settlement with Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family.
The Purdue settlement will likely infuse the state with additional resources for prevention, treatment and recovery. Rodgriguez declined to comment on New Mexico’s likely share, but states with similar populations like Nevada and West Virginia have announced expected funds in excess of $50 million over 15 years. The funds’ impact remains to be seen. “We never seem to have the resources that approach equivalency relative to the extent of the problem,” Lindstrom said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/douglassachagettyopioid-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-29 08:57:11.086397

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)To mark “10 years of impact,” the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute has issued a report highlighting key research on a wide range of Utah issues over the last decade. 
The report commemorates the 10-year anniversary since the institute’s doors first opened in September 2015. 
The man that the institute was named after — prominent business man and community leader Kem Gardner — said these words 10 years ago at an event celebrating its launch:
“I believe firmly that this policy institute can make life better for our state and for our children,” the Deseret News reported at the time.

From data on the COVID-19 pandemic, to research on housing affordability and the shrinking Great Salt Lake, Kem C. Gardner researchers have “emerged as Utah’s premier source for economic, demographic, and public policy research that guides community leaders and helps policy makers” make informed decisions, the institute said in a news release announcing the report Thursday. 
“Over the last 10 years, the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute has proven to be indispensable to achieving the University of Utah’s goal of creating positive impact,” University of Utah President Taylor Randall said. “The Institute provides trusted data, rigorous analysis, and forums for sharing ideas, contributing significantly to our mission of generating unsurpassed societal impact.”
The 10-year report includes key findings on some of the biggest issues that Utah has — and continues — to face. They include: 

Data and analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic
Long-term economic and demographic projections informing the state’s population growth and resulting changes.
Challenges with housing affordability and how Utah compares to other states.
Economic impacts of the 2034 Olympics and how Utah must prepare.
Research on the adverse effects of the shrinking Great Salt Lake and data to inform water management decisions.

While it highlights past research, the report also looks ahead. It lists seven reasons — what researchers described as the “magnificent seven” — that make up a “constellation of economic achievements that sets it apart from the rest of the nation.” 
Those include, according to the report, economic diversity, high household income and low poverty, high upward mobility opportunities, a “relatively equal distribution of income,” a well-trained and educated workforce, a fast-growing and young population, and high levels of social capital and strong community bonds. 
Researchers, however, also listed what they called “Utah’s troubling seven,” or challenges that could spell trouble if they go unaddressed. 
They included: 

Housing affordability and homelessness: “Utah’s housing market has become increasingly unaffordable, leading to a rise in homelessness and limiting access to homeownership for many,” researchers wrote. With a median sales price of a single-family home hitting more than $548,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024, Utah ranked as the ninth most expensive housing market in the U.S., according to the report.


Traffic congestion: The state’s growing population has “strained Utah’s transportation infrastructure,” the report says, “resulting in significant traffic congestion and reduced quality of life.” 


Public education: A “concerning number” of Utah third graders are not proficient in reading, researchers wrote, with only 46.7% of Utah third graders scoring proficiently on the RISE test, a state-mandated standardized test. 
Higher education: Compared to other states, Utah’s college and university enrollment and graduation rates lag behind other states, “limiting the potential of its workforce and economy,” the report says. 





Great Salt Lake: The lake’s declining water levels continue to “pose significant environmental, economic and health risks to the state,” researchers warned. 


Energy supply: Due to growing energy demand, constraints on supply and the need to transition to cleaner energy sources, Utah “faces potential energy deficits,” the report says.
Behavioral health: Like the rest of the nation, Utah is seeing a “growing behavioral health crisis, requiring a greater access to mental health and substance abuse services,” researchers wrote. 

To address those issues, researchers also listed the “starting seven,” or ideas to “serve as a conservation starter for a statewide dialogue” on the state’s biggest challenges. 

For housing affordability, they recommended the creation of a “statewide community land trust.” 
For traffic congestion, they urged prioritization of “connected autonomous vehicles.” 
To increase third grade reading proficiency, they encouraged education leaders to “place a reading pro in K-3 classrooms.” 
To improve higher education graduation rates, they recommended the expansion of “catalyst centers” into Salt Lake City. 
For the Great Salt Lake, they recommended the conservation of 250 kilometer acre feet (KAF) to 500 KAF each year. The KAF measurement refers to a thousand acre-foot, or a unit of volume representing 1,000 acre-feet of water. It’s commonly used to measure water in reservoirs, rivers or snow pack. 
For energy, they encouraged investment in the state energy research fund. 
For behavioral health, they said to “align behavioral health efforts and investments with Utah’s strategic plan.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Sentencing Commission said Friday that Alabama’s already overcrowded prisons could see inmate populations rise by nearly a third by 2030 due to new punitive laws passed by the Legislature.
The commission, working with Applied Research Services, a research firm that studies criminal justice, estimated the population in custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections could grow from 21,753 to between 24,000 and 28,000 inmates, depending on the number of people that the ADOC admits each month on average.
Those numbers, if reached, would come near or exceed DOC’s record inmate population, set 16 years ago. They would also further strain the state’s General Fund; the state’s prisons have taken up an ever-larger share of the budget over the past two decades.

“The system, even before all the changes that happened, was already trending up,” said Bennet Wright, executive director of the Alabama Sentencing Commission, on Friday. “All the things that I discussed, and that is not to say they are good or bad, but they are going to adjust the track up more.”
Wright said the projections factor  several changes implemented by the Alabama Legislature, from increasing the number of judges assigned to oversee cases to changes in statute related to split sentences, to a law passed in 2023 that further restricted the use of good behavior to reduce incarceration time.
Wright and the researchers said there are some uncertainties that are embedded within the simulations.
The long overcrowding crisis
Alabama has struggled with prison overcrowding for decades, and the crisis has been a major contributor to violence in correctional facilities. The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state in 2020, saying the conditions in men’s prisons violated inmates’ Eighth Amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishment.
The state’s prison population fell after 2015 after the Legislature approved a series of sentencing reforms, dropping from about 26,300 in 2013 to 20,200 in 2018. It fell still further during the COVID outbreak in 2020, when Corrections temporarily barred the admission of new prisoners. The population was about 18,300 in 2021. Since then, the number of people in ADOC has steadily increased, going to 20,500 in 2022, 21,000 in 2024, and is currently at 21,753 for the year.
But the simulations run by the commission projected that the population would increase.
Even the lowest figure generated by the simulation estimates the population of people in custody of ADOC in 2030 would increase by 31% from a 2021 baseline of 18,300. The highest projected population, 28,000, by the end of the decade means that the prison would increase by more than 50% from the baseline.
Many of the estimates from the simulations predicted the prison population to be higher than the 26,500 in 2009, the highest number of people ever incarcerated in Alabama’s prisons.
Multiple estimates
The Sentencing Commission provided people who attended the presentation with multiple estimates instead of a single measure incorporating all the factors because of the uncertainty inherent in the model. One element that was not incorporated into the simulations to provide the estimate was the average number of people admitted into ADOC each month.
“The idea about the number of people coming in the front door has to be an independent determination,” Wright said.
One reason is that the number can fluctuate dramatically. The rate was more than 800 in 2018, but it is currently about 450.
“I know what you are thinking,” Wright said. “Well Bennet, look to the past. Well, that is the past, what part of the past do you want me to use?”
The composition of the ADOC admissions could also change depending on the laws enacted by the Legislature. When lawmakers enacted into law a rule that made the sentencing guidelines presumptive, fewer judges sent people to prison.
So instead of incorporating the admission rates for ADOC into the model, researchers calculated a population estimate by assuming a given rate for the number of people admitted into ADOC custody.
The lower estimate of 24,000 assumed that about 400 people were admitted into ADOC custody each month. The higher estimate of 28,000 assumed that 500 people were admitted into ADOC custody each month.
Contributing factors
Wright highlighted several changes that were factored into the model. One was that the Legislature increased funding to provide the judicial system with more judges, allowing more cases to be processed, which potentially adds to the number of people sentenced to prison.
Another factor is changes to statute enacted by the Legislature for split sentences. In the past, most cases in the criminal justice system required judges to apply split sentences once defendants were convicted.
“You either had to get probation or a split sentence,” Wright changed. “So now, everything is back on the table.”
The split sentence law was also changed.
“So even if someone is split, the split sentence law is amended to allow for longer sentences on splits,” Wright said.
The Legislature in 2023 reduced the amount of credit people in prison could receive on their prison sentences for good behavior. Prior to passing the law, people classified in the second tier could receive up to 40 days of credit for every 30 days served. SB 1, sponsored by April Weaver, R-Brierfield, reduced it to 15 days for every 30 days served.
“They reduced general good time and they reduced access to maximum good time as well,” Wright said.
Along with that, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles updated the guidelines they used to determine whether to grant an applicant parole.
All those changes factor into the prison population. Wright and researchers provided two numbers for every rate that people are admitted into ADOC custody. Wright said the three factors that drive the trend between the high estimate, and the low estimate are the percentage of people who will receive a split sentence, the parole rate, the number of people in prison who will be subject to the updated correctional incentive time laws versus the previous set of rules.
“With a high percentage of splits, high parole and a higher percentage of people coming in on good time, you would expect a prison population in five years of about 24,000,” Wright said.
The complement of that, with low numbers on split sentences, parole and good time allocation, that figure increases to about 26,000 if ADOC admits an average monthly rate of 400 people into the prisons.
“Look at what we historically do in Alabama,” Wright said. “Policy-wise, we do not have sustainable, slow growth, or slow decline. We typically have very accelerated growth, or very accelerated decline.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-Flag-2019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 08:57:11.086397

NapierAt the University of Michigan, seven more charges were handed down last week against pro-Palestine students and alumni.
These latest disciplinary charges represent a decision by University of Michigan (UM) leadership to double-down on its strategy of seeking to repress campus pro-Palestine activism. Beginning in November 2023, when former University President Santa Ono called in police from multiple jurisdictions to barricade his office building against students seeking to meet with him, the University has sought to repress students calling for divestment from Israel rather than engaging with them. 
This strategy of muscle over mediation was on full display in May 2024 during the forceful early morning police clearing of UM’s Gaza Solidarity Encampment, when students were sprayed with chemical irritants and their tents were ploughed by heavy machinery. In addition to being dragged through University disciplinary proceedings, student activists have been surveilled, banned from entering classroom buildings, followed off campus, and smeared in various all-university communications. 
University of Michigan denounced for using private investigators to surveil student protesters

Most recently, the art exhibit organized by pro-Palestine UM student activists as part of a weeklong “Freedom School” was kicked off of University grounds by the University’s Division of Public Safety and Security.  
Revealingly, some of those charged in recent months through the University of Michigan’s Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR) and the new Office of Student Accountability (OSA) are members of the Encampment 11. These UM students and alumni successfully defeated Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s political charges in May, but they are now facing disciplinary probation, suspension, and re-enrollment bans for actions that Nessel declined to prosecute. These actions by University of Michigan leadership not only chill expressions of dissent on campus, but discourage the moral conviction to call out a genocide that is unfolding before the entire world.

Yet even as the University sinks to new lows in its repression of pro-Palestine student activism, resistance is spreading on campus in subtle yet new and important ways. 
Just last week, on September 19, University of Michigan faculty, staff, students, alumni, parents, and community members organized a vigil to honor the lives of Palestinian health workers. Standing across from the University’s Central Campus, vigil participants read the names, ages, and occupations of over 1,200 Palestinian health workers killed during the genocide in Gaza. Those reading names during the 4-hour vigil included a renowned poet and literary journal editor, a children’s book author, a senior faculty member in computer science and engineering, and the director of a local arts institution, among others. 
Standing with the readers were faculty and staff who are active in a variety of campus labor unions and in faculty government. Representatives of local faith communities joined in solidarity with multi-religious prayer offerings.  
And this spirit of resistance – against institutional efforts to direct public attention away from the genocide in Gaza – expanded and gained momentum on the University’s Ann Arbor campus over the weekend of September 20 and 21, when Doctors Against Genocide (DAG) convened its Second Annual Conference at the University of Michigan Medical School. 
Throughout the two days of conference sessions, several hundred participating doctors and medical students explored strategies for anti-genocide awareness raising within medical institutions, discussed their own experiences of practicing medicine under conditions of genocide, and heard the live-streamed testimony of doctors providing medical care in Gaza amidst the massive Israeli military assault now underway. 
Participants and visitors entering the lobby of the Biomedical Sciences Research Building encountered a massive three-dimensional model that visualized the destruction of all aspects of civilian life in Gaza. And alongside this cartography of genocide stood a wall of posters prepared by medical students that detailed the timeline of attacks on Gaza’s shelters, hospitals, universities, schools, cemeteries, archaeological sites, mosques and churches, fields and orchards, greenhouses, water wells, bakeries, and aid distribution sites.

A key message of the conference was that the systematic destruction of Gaza’s healthcare sector has critical consequences for the population and is itself an instrument of genocide.
Medical doctors are generally not known for being overtly political. But Doctors Against Genocide has been on the forefront of raising public awareness about genocides in Palestine, Sudan, Congo, Tigray, and elsewhere. For two days, UM’s medical campus was invigorated by the presence of physicians wearing white coats with DAG’s red logo printed across the back, who had come together to share best practices in medical care and public advocacy for those suffering the catastrophic health consequences of the ongoing genocide in Gaza.
Equally significant is the fact that organizers of the vigil and organizers of the DAG conference worked together to plan their events. Medical faculty and medical students participated in the Friday evening vigil. Likewise, UM faculty and students from outside the Medical School participated in the DAG conference that took place over the days that followed.

This intentional effort to bridge the divide between the medical side of the University and the traditional faculties of literature, arts, sciences, as well as other professional schools is important, because it builds on the critical vote by the UM Faculty Senate in May 2023 to unite faculty governance across campuses, including the Medical campus, where Michigan Medicine employs a large share of clinical professors.
With the already-urgent situation in Gaza worsening and a U.N. Commission confirming that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians, UM faculty are coming together in an effort to remind the entire University of Michigan community, including its top-tier hospital and Medical School, that we must act with intention and with courage before there are no more Palestinians in Gaza to protect. 
This is not to suggest that UM faculty in the past have been silent. Over the past two years, UM faculty and staff have found various ways to criticize the University’s heavy-handed efforts to silence pro-Palestine student activists’ calls for university divestment. 
For example, the University’s proposed “Disruptive Activities Policy” was widely condemned by faculty in March 2024, who criticized it for targeting student activism and curtailing First Amendment rights. The following semester, more than 1,300 faculty voted in November 2024 to pass a Faculty Senate motion censuring the University of Michigan Regents and calling on them to “cease the use of surveillance, policing, physical violence, and legal power as mechanisms to silence speech.” 
Over the past two years, the UM Ann Arbor Chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has repeatedly issued statements critical of the University’s actions to curtail pro-Palestine student activism on campus. Moreover, as State Attorney General Nessel’s office moved forward with prosecuting student activists, faculty and staff participated individually in court support. And University of Michigan Faculty & Staff for Justice in Palestine (FSJP) was established with the explicit aim of providing support to pro-Palestine student activists facing repression.

Yet at the beginning of this academic year, something different is happening. The jointly organized vigil and DAG conference indicate a growing awareness among UM faculty that their role need not be confined to supporting students. Indeed, UM scholars and clinicians alike are coming to understand that they have their own role to play beyond supporting students. Faculty feel empowered in a new way to channel their own skills and training towards the task of calling out the University’s silence – and thus its complicity – concerning the ongoing genocide in Gaza. 
This represents a new approach for faculty in terms of how they understand their roles, both professionally and as citizens, in relation to the genocide in Gaza. It suggests that the sort of faculty-led resistance that took place earlier this year in leading opposition to the closure of the University’s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion might be spreading into new areas. In both of these examples, faculty mobilized around their vision of what the University’s mission entails, regardless of what central administration asserts it to be. 
Prayers and a solemn reading of names may not be what people initially think of as resistance. However, at a time when violence and repression seem to be worsening, and even the mention of Palestine or genocide draws ire, creating the discursive space on campus to collectively bear witness to the sacrifice of doctors saving Palestinian lives is momentous. In the present moment of unprecedented attacks on higher education, insisting on a set of values for the university community to uphold and then putting those values into practice is at its core an act of resistance. We need more of this kind of resistance.

The Legislature approved funding for reading coaches in schools. They established summer camps for students who need to get their reading scores up.
Granted, they also threaten to hold children back if they don’t hit key benchmarks by third grade. Making reading resources available should be enough. But still, the investments have shown enough promise that state education officials want to extend them to older students.

As someone whose paycheck depends on widespread reading, I approve this.
But I’m not sure the people overseeing Alabama’s libraries like it very much. And I think it’s because they’re frightened of literacy.
Literacy is much more than the ability to read. Literacy is what results from repeatedly exercising that skill with a wide range of books. Learning. Empathy. A broader understanding of the world and the people in it.
The Alabama Public Library Service Board does not seem to like that.
I can’t think of another explanation for why the state board keeps dragging members of Fairhope Public Library’s governing board to Montgomery. A handful of belligerent cranks are wasting the library’s time whining about books, mostly those with LGBTQ+ characters in them.
The Alabama Public Library Service considers this a priority.
Board member Amy Minton, who also happens to be running as a Republican state Senate candidate, introduced a resolution over the summer to classify as inappropriate “any material that promotes, engages, or positively depicts transgender procedures, gender ideology, or the concept of more than two biological genders.”
Quick aside: Gender-affirming care leads to better lives for people with gender dysphoria. I’m putting that here in case the state board prevents you from reading it in a library.
But zealots don’t want to have a reasoned discussion about care options and outcomes. They want fear and silence.
Gender ideology is so important that library board members earlier this month decided they would personally review the handful of outstanding complaints about books on Fairhope’s library shelves.
Which brings us to “gender ideology.” And this question: What the heck is “gender ideology?”
Is it affirming the dignity of transgender people? Acknowledging their existence?
Is it showing curiosity about the nature of gender — how much is innate and how much is societal?
Or is it the understanding that people of all genders are inherently equal and deserving of equal opportunities to live their lives as they see fit?
It could be one of those things. It could be all of those things. The Alabama Public Library Service, in constant terror of ambush by fictional LGBTQ+ characters, gets to decide.
And forgive me if I expect the worst possible outcome from that.
Remember that book-banning advocates started in Prattville by conflating books acknowledging the existence of transgender people with sexually explicit material. That was patently false. But it gave Alabama politicians leashed to the far-right the chance to pretend there was a problem where none existed.
And once they got that inch, they went for the mile. Librarians, of all people, must now carry out their duties knowing they could be served up as fuel for the far-right outrage machine.
To its credit, Fairhope fought back. When the board cut the library’s funding, private donors stepped up to support it. City leaders have expressed support for their library. Fairhope voters largely rejected a slate of pro-censorship city council candidates last month.
I hope the rest of the state is paying attention. Fairhope’s fight is a fight for dignity, curiosity and common decency. Three values that the Alabama Public Library Service and many state leaders appear to consider dangerous and illegitimate.
It’s a fight for actual literacy.
Not just the ability to read basic words, take orders and pass a test. But the process of consuming and processing rational ideas. Of encountering new ways of seeing the world and one another.
Some of the hardest work we do is understanding another person. It’s almost impossible without the narratives that books provide. Without broad access to those stories, society becomes static. Hidebound. Hateful.
And sure, teachers need resources to teach kids to read. But we all need libraries where trained professionals can stock diverse, rational and challenging books. Once you start tying their hands, you give Alabamians a limited, counterfeit version of reality.
It’s like restricting a musician to performances in C major. Or ordering a painter to use a single color palette. Or requiring football teams to run just three plays. You’re cutting off a world of possibility.
That’s what our state library board is trying to do. Make sure that children growing into reading get a stunted and deeply prejudiced view of the world. Where the only aspirations are conformity and obedience.
And that’s the opposite of literacy.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250918_141510-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-29 08:57:11.086397

Falls are the leading cause of death for Americans 65 years of age and older, and are responsible for more than 30,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The Nevada Health Care Association represents assisted living and skilled nursing facilities. It did not respond to requests for comment on the report’s findings.
Nationally, 43% of nursing home falls involving Medicare patients are not being reported, according to the report. In Nevada, 60% of nursing home falls were not reported. The rates for failure to report ranged from a low of 21% in South Dakota to a high of 64% in Washington, DC., followed by California with 61%. 
The data, which is supposed to be provided to the government by nursing homes, is used for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Care Compare website, which is intended to provide consumers with quality of care information. 
Failing to report “leads to inaccurate fall rates on Care Compare,” the report says. Facilities with the lowest fall rates on the government website were the least likely to report, suggesting that “low fall rates for nursing homes on Care Compare are likely driven by nursing homes’ failure to report falls, rather than an actual low incidence of falls.”
A large, nonprofit nursing home with more than 200 beds in New York had a 5-star overall rating on Care Compare, the highest possible, and reported three falls with major injuries that required hospitalization. The Office of Inspector General, which wrote the report, found the nursing home had 13 falls.
“Providers may have a disincentive to report events, such as falls, that could result in lower scores on quality measures,” says the report. “Previous analyses by OIG and others have identified under-reporting by providers.”
The report is based on data from falls reported to have occurred between July 2022 and June 2023. The OIG found: 

For-profit, chain nursing homes, and larger facilities failed to report falls most often;
Nursing homes failed more often to report falls of younger residents, male residents, short-stay residents, and residents with only Medicare coverage; 
Reporting of falls was worse in “nonrural” nursing homes; 
Most falls involved the oldest residents, and the percentage of unreported falls (38%) was lowest among those 85 years and older;
The percentage of unreported falls was highest (55%) among those younger than 65 years, who qualified for Medicare because of disability or end-stage kidney disease.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/long-term-care-getty-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 07:58:47.292917

Here's a look at how candidates are chosen and how challengers qualify for a primary.","Connecticut’s Democratic primary election in 2026 could become uncharacteristically competitive, with several well-known incumbents drawing potential challengers for their seats. 
Gov. Ned Lamont, who is expected to launch his run for a third term as Connecticut’s chief executive, watched this summer as Josh Elliott, a progressive Democratic legislator, announced plans to primary him.
Meanwhile, more than four Democrats — including former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin and state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest — have announced plans to try to unseat U.S. Rep. John Larson, who has represented Connecticut’s 1st Congressional District for nearly three decades.
Many of the would-be challengers are already honing their messages and raising money in preparation for what could become bruising political battles. 
But just because someone announces a campaign on social media doesn’t mean they will be in contention during the primary next August. 
In Connecticut, political candidates — especially those challenging sitting incumbents — need to clear several hurdles just to have their name listed on the ballot.
Here is a look at how parties choose their candidates and the steps challengers need to take to qualify for a primary. 
How do candidates make it onto a primary ballot in Connecticut? 
There are several ways for statewide or congressional candidates from a major party to make it onto a primary ballot in Connecticut.
The two easiest paths run through the political party conventions, which are gatherings of top Democratic or Republican officials.
Anyone seeking a statewide office or a congressional seat will have their name added to the primary ballot if they receive enough support from the convention delegates, who get to vote on which candidates the party should endorse.
The person who wins the party endorsement automatically gets onto the ballot.
But Connecticut’s election laws specify that any candidate who also receives at least 15% of the votes during a round of balloting at the convention will automatically qualify for the primary. That means challengers can make it onto the ballot even if they don’t receive the party’s stamp of approval.
For those who don’t get a spot on the ballot at the conventions, the third way to throw their name into contention is to petition their way into the race by collecting enough signatures from eligible voters to qualify for a primary race. 
When are the conventions and who are the delegates?
The statewide party conventions in Connecticut, where delegates vote to endorse candidates for governor and other statewide offices, are held in the spring ahead of the party primaries in August. 
The same is true for the congressional conventions, which are separate events where party delegates from each of the five congressional districts in Connecticut choose who will serve as the party-endorsed candidates in primaries for the U.S. House.
The delegates at those conventions are made up of Democratic and Republican party members from each of Connecticut’s 169 towns and cities, and it is largely up to the local Democratic and Republican town committees and the local party chairs to determine who those delegates are.
The delegate selection process is one of the reasons that critics argue the system is set up to benefit party insiders and tamp down political upstarts. 
If you succeed at the convention, you can begin to campaign instead of spending money and time collecting signatures.
What happens if candidates fall short at the convention? 
If a political candidate can’t rally enough support from the party insiders at the convention, there is another way to keep their campaign alive. But the road to the primary gets a lot harder for those people.
That’s because candidates who are snubbed at the convention need to gather thousands of signatures from voters who are registered with their political party. 
Connecticut law requires candidates for governor and congress to obtain signatures from at least 2% of registered party members in the state or in their congressional districts in order to qualify for the ballot. 
In a Democratic primary for the 1st Congressional District, for instance, that threshold would currently require candidates to collect roughly 3,700 signatures. And in a Democratic gubernatorial race, it would obligate a petitioning candidate to secure roughly 15,800 signatures from registered voters, based on current voter registration numbers. 
The bigger hurdle, however, is the timing of those signature drives. The law specifies that petitioning candidates have just 42 days to pound the pavement and collect all of the necessary signatures.
What does a petitioning candidate need to do?
Plenty of candidates have shown that it is possible to run a successful primary campaign without the support of their party’s delegates.
Bob Stefanowski, for instance, gathered more than 9,000 signatures from Connecticut Republicans in 2018 in order to qualify for a crowded gubernatorial primary that year. 
Today, the 42-day window would require a potential Democratic gubernatorial challenger to collect more than 370 signatures per day from registered Democrats, based on current voter registration numbers.
State law requires those signatures to be collected in-person by people who are registered in Connecticut with the correct political party.
And when the signature drives are done, the petitions need to be notarized and turned over to the registrars of voters in multiple towns for each signature to be verified.
That means that some signatures can be tossed if the people who signed the petitions are not properly registered with the party, or if there are duplicate signatures. 
All of that sets up a hectic month-and-a-half-long race for petitioning candidates to earn their spot on the primary ballot.
What are the arguments for and against the ballot access laws? 
Supporters of Connecticut’s ballot access laws argue that the current rules enable the two major political parties to vet the candidates who are going to be running for office under their banner. The rules also ensure that anyone who makes it onto the ballot has a least a nominal level of support from party members.
Critics of the system, however, argue the state’s laws only serve to empower party insiders and to protect incumbent politicians from potential challengers.
Each state has their own unique requirements that specify how candidates can place their names onto primary ballots. Many states, for instance, allow people to make it onto the primary ballot simply by paying a filing fee. 
Opponents of the system in Connecticut have argued repeatedly that the state’s rules for ballot access are some of the most restrictive in the country.
Muad Hrezi, who attempted to challenge Larson in a 2022 primary for the 1st Congressional District, made that very argument in state court after he failed to gather enough signatures to advance his campaign that year. 
A state superior court judge overseeing that case, however, rejected the argument that the state’s laws were overly burdensome and unconstitutional. And the judge noted that a Republican candidate in the state’s 4th Congressional District that year was able to collect enough signatures to petition their way onto the ballot. 
To be sure, the state’s laws on ballot access have become slightly easier for challengers to meet due to legislative changes and court rulings in past decades.
Even so, no one has ever qualified for a primary in Connecticut against a sitting member of the U.S. House.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Pelto-petitions.jpg,,,2025-09-29 07:58:47.292917

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The two candidates vying to become New Jersey’s next governor have insisted transparency would be a guiding value in their governing, with Democrat Mikie Sherrill unveiling a “transparency agenda” earlier this month and Republican Jack Ciattarelli bragging in speeches and on social media about how transparent he is.
But criminal justice reformers fear both candidates could slash public reporting on law enforcement, making policing in New Jersey less transparent just as the federal government increasingly expands its policing authority in states and cities.
Jason Williams, a justice studies professor at Montclair State University, noted that neither candidate has offered a detailed plan to expand police transparency.
“Jack Ciattarelli has aligned closely with law enforcement groups and has even suggested narrowing public access to police internal-affairs records, a step community advocates view as moving backward,” Williams said. “Mikie Sherrill, by contrast, has rolled out a broad ‘transparency’ platform, but her proposals focus mainly on fiscal and budgetary disclosure rather than on police discipline or use-of-force records. Both positions ultimately work to uphold the status quo.”
President Donald Trump’s cuts to police transparency — including his January revocation of former President Joe Biden’s executive order mandating body cameras and a misconduct database for federal officers — should spur policymakers to strengthen transparency at the state and local levels, said Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project.
While New Jersey voters have consistently cited the economy and taxes as the primary issues that drive them to the polls, police transparency also should be top of mind for voters, Bonds said.
“Police officers, more so than most other government officials, have incredible power in our society. They can literally kill you on the street before you have a trial, before you’re charged with a crime. They have the authority to take your money without due process. They have the authority to come into your home without due process,” Bonds said. “So even if you aren’t from a community that’s regularly impacted by over-policing or police violence, it’s incredibly important that we know who is doing those things in light of how much power they have.”
Ensuring police transparency is especially important, Bonds said, as Trump has dispatched military troops and federal officers to Democrat-led cities and ordered the hiring of thousands of new officers to enforce his deportation policies.
Ciattarelli and Sherrill are both vying in November to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat.

Sherrill’s spokespeople declined to make her available for an interview.
Sherrill, a congresswoman since 2019, has said little publicly about police transparency. During a recent talk with a police union, a Metuchen police officer asked her to defend her yes vote on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which was aimed at racial discrimination and excessive use of force in law enforcement. Sherrill told him she opposes “any ability for people to go after individual officers,” but supports accountability in police departments.
“So I do believe if there is a systemic problem, whether it’s at the municipal, county, or state level, that there should be accountability there. And I should think — I do think that if there — I think I agree with all of you, that if there are bad police officers, if there are structural problems in police departments which make every police officer look bad, that should be addressed and police should have accountability for that,” she said.
During that talk, she also said she supports civilian review boards as long as they do not have subpoena powers.
Ciattarelli, who recently landed the New Jersey Fraternal Order of Police’s endorsement, told the New Jersey Monitor after a town hall in Pitman earlier this month that he would scale back on reporting of police use of force and require reporting only on incidents in which officers fire a gun. He would not commit to continuing to report on major discipline and the names of officers involved in fatal encounters, transparency measures that then-Attorney General Gurbir Grewal ordered in 2020.
Jack Ciattarelli said he wants to scale back reporting on when police use force. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
“I’m going to go by the way of my attorney general. I’m going to sit and talk with the attorney general about these things,” he said. “But let me say this — we are not going to demoralize these men and women in blue. They’re trained professionals. We’re going to let them do their job.”
He added: “I don’t know how much more transparency you can have when somebody’s wearing a body cam.”
On his campaign website and in social media posts, Ciattarelli has also said he would end the release of internal affairs records, opposes civilian review boards “with or without subpoena power,” would appoint a “pro-police” attorney general, and would protect qualified immunity to shield officers from liability for actions they take on the job.
Williams said New Jersey’s next governor should not weaken police transparency at a time when residents have deep concerns about police brutality and controversial police-involved fatalities.
Citizens should be alarmed at any plan to eliminate use-of-force reporting except when an officer fires a gun, Bonds said.
“That’s an arbitrary distinction. Obviously, we’re aware of so many situations of really extreme brutality that don’t involve the discharge of a firearm,” she said, pointing to George Floyd and Eric Garner. Floyd died after a Minneapolis cop kneeled on his neck for 9 minutes, while Garner died after a New York City cop put him in an illegal chokehold.
Law enforcement agencies should, at a minimum, publicly release officer misconduct records, substantiated and unsubstantiated civilian complaints, departmental policies, and footage captured by body-worn cameras and dashboard cameras, Bonds said.
Keeping those things secret hurts both the public and the police, she added.
“It hurts the public by depriving them of information, by leaving them in the dark about what happened to people they care about. It takes away information they need to advocate for policy changes,” Bonds said. “It’s not beneficial to police agencies to not be transparent either. We see this time and time again: If the public doesn’t have information, they’re going to fill in the gaps with what they know.”

Ingram said in a phone interview on Thursday that the amendment aimed to allow students to practice their religion.
“This is just to give [students] the option to be able to fellowship with other students who are Christians,” he said.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Alabama said in a statement Friday the proposed amendment violates the First Amendment.
“The U.S. Constitution allows for students and school employees to engage in private prayer during the school day, but students and school employees cannot be compelled, coerced, persuaded, or encouraged to join in prayer or other religious activity,” A’Niya Robinson, director of policy and organizing at the ACLU of Alabama said. “HB 43 is not only unconstitutional but also creates a hostile educational environment for students who do not adhere to state-sanctioned religious practices.”
Nik Nartowicz, lead policy counsel for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a non-profit organization based in Washington D.C. that works to defend the right to freedom of religion, said in a statement Friday legislators cannot enforce religion in schools.
“Our Constitution’s promise of church-state separation means that students and their families – not politicians – get to decide if, when and how children engage with religion,” the statement said. “This bill would advance Christian Nationalists’ agenda to impose their religion on public schoolchildren,” Nartowicz said.
The amendment, if passed, would require students to have a signed consent form in order to participate in prayer and the reading of religious texts. If students have not consented to prayer and reading, it cannot be done in class.
Ingram said students who have given consent will be sent to a different classroom to not interfere with teachers’ instructional time.
Schools that have shown a “continued pattern of intentional refusal” will be investigated by the Alabama Department of Education and could have up to 25% of their state funding withheld.
“Some schools may not want to do it or put it to a vote for the students in their school system, so this is just where the school systems have to act on it and the board members have to vote on it,” Ingram said. “Even if it’s voted up or down, a position has to be taken. So if it’s voted down no money is going to be withheld.”
The proposed amendment to the state constitution would also mandate that each public school vote on whether to say the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of the day.
“Right now, it’s in the school policy to where you have to have the pledge, but a lot of schools are not doing the pledge. They’re not complying with the law, and that was a bill that Speaker Ledbetter passed years ago,” Ingram said in a phone interview Friday.
Any school that does not vote on whether they will say the pledge at the start of the school day, or does not say the Pledge of Allegiance after voting to say it, could have up to 25% of their state funding withheld. However, funding can be restored upon complying with the law.
“We don’t want to cut any school funding, but we want to make sure that they comply with the law and that they put it up to a vote of the school board within 60 days,” Ingram said. “If they vote yes, they have to comply and keep doing it every day, and if they vote no, they don’t have to do it.”
Robinson said forcing students to recite the pledge is harmful to their rights.
“Students should have the freedom to recite (or not recite) the pledge, and withholding school funds as enforcement further threatens that freedom that our country defends,” she said in a statement Friday.
According to Ingram, students have a choice on if they want to say the Pledge of Allegiance or not.
“It’s not mandatory for every student to stand up and hold their hand over their heart, especially if they’re not a U.S. citizen. We’re not making them do that, but the teacher has to have it as an option to do,” he said in a phone interview Friday.
Reed filed a similar bill for the 2025 legislative session, but the bill was postponed indefinitely.

Ruwa Romman, a Duluth Democrat, is running to be Georgia’s next governor. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderAt least one more Democrat is jumping into the race to be Georgia’s next governor.
State Rep. Ruwa Romman, a public policy consultant, once made history as the first Muslim woman to serve in the Georgia House of Representatives and the first Palestinian American to be elected to any public office in the state back in 2022.
Now, the Duluth Democrat is entering the race for the highest state office in Georgia, competing against Democrats like Atlanta state Sen. Jason Esteves, former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, former DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond and former Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who was once a Republican.
Romman’s platform includes raising Georgia’s minimum wage, reopening shuttered rural hospitals, ensuring that children have enough to eat, and investing in the state’s small businesses. What sets her apart from the other Democratic candidates, she argues, is her willingness to embrace change and try something different.
“I firmly believe the politics of old aren’t working,” she said in an interview. “The business as usual isn’t working. And if we want to change the power dynamics of our state, we have to do something different.”
Romman, who worked for organizations like the Asian Americans Advancing Justice, the Asian American Advocacy Fund, and the Georgia Muslim Voter Project before running for office, also recently launched a statewide campaign called Project 159 with the goal of recruiting organizers and volunteers in every Georgia county in response to a similar grassroots effort from Republican U.S. Senate candidate and Congressman Mike Collins.
As the Democratic Party of Georgia gears up for the 2026 election cycle, Romman said, she hopes to see the party stick to a set of shared principles, such as advocating for people over corporations.
“We can build a broad coalition while holding on to our values, because they are popular values,” she added. “What Democrats actually believe in are very popular with voters, whether it’s raising the minimum wage, whether it’s expanding Medicaid in our state, whether it’s restoring access to abortions and life-saving care.”
Romman, who is currently the only Palestinian American in the Georgia Legislature, also gained national attention during last year’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago, when she was floated as a potential speaker on behalf of the Uncommitted Movement, which sought an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and an end to U.S. weapons transfers to Israel. The DNC ultimately denied the group’s request for a speaking slot, and Romman delivered her speech at a protest that was held outside the convention. The speech was later published in Rolling Stone.
Throughout her campaign, she said she hopes to carry a message of optimism for voters who are dissatisfied under current political leadership.
“I think right now, the greatest challenge we are having is this pervasive sense of cynicism and nihilism,” she said. “And in order to overcome that, you have to build a vision. You have to work towards big goals.”
While she acknowledges that some may see her bid for governor as a long shot in a Republican-dominated state like Georgia, she argued that an economic-centered campaign can motivate voters to turn out for progressive causes.
“To be clear, yes, this is a state that is predominantly Republican controlled, and has been for over 20 years,” she said. “But I think if you set a high bar, and you build towards a vision, and say, ‘look, let’s work towards this together, let’s build a movement, let’s imagine what’s possible,’ that kind of hope-centered, movement-centered campaign can go a really long way in our state.”
The winner of next May’s Democratic primary will go on to face the Republican nominee in the general election next November. The GOP primary is becoming increasingly crowded too, with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger recently launching a campaign for governor. Other high-profile Republican candidates include Lt. Gov.

[…],"The Washington state Capitol on Nov. 11, 2024. (Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)A contentious new sales tax on services that Democratic state lawmakers relied on to pay for Washington’s latest budget is set to take effect Wednesday. 
Senate Bill 5814 is one of the biggest moneymakers used to bring in an estimated $3.6 billion over the next two years to fill a shortfall in the operating budget. This law is expected to fuel $1.1 billion in the two-year budget that began July 1, and $2.6 billion over four years. Hundreds of millions of dollars will also flow to local governments, as they get a share of state sales tax proceeds.
But a key piece of the new tax law is in question. 
Cable juggernaut Comcast believes the measure’s sales tax on advertising services is illegal and is suing to get it overturned. The state attorney general’s office is expected to respond to the lawsuit in Thurston County Superior Court in the coming weeks. It could be months before a judge weighs in on the provision’s future.
The tax on advertising services is specifically expected to bring in roughly $475 million over the next four years. It’s unclear what would happen to collections made under the new tax if the law is later ruled invalid, a state Department of Revenue spokesperson said.
A block on the tax would throw a major kink into the $77.8 billion budget passed after months of negotiations in the Legislature. The next 60-day legislative session begins in January. 
The law earns the state money by applying the retail sales tax to more services. Beyond advertising, it covers temporary staffing ($833 million over four years), security ($127 million), live presentations ($360 million) and information technology ($189 million), among others. Temporary staffing services hospitals use are exempt.
Over the summer, the Department of Revenue hosted listening sessions with affected businesses. Over 90,000 businesses are expected to pay under the law. Companies complained of a lack of clarity on how the taxes would be implemented and the adverse effects this will have on their bottom line. 
The law also adds taxes on emerging nicotine products, like Zyn pouches, which don’t kick in until Jan. 1. Some other tax increases Democrats approved this year, including to Washington’s primary business and occupation taxes, also take effect on New Year’s. 
Also starting Wednesday, financial institutions with an annual net income above $1 billion will have a business and occupation tax they pay raised from 1.2% to 1.5%. During the session, Democrats estimated this would impact about 200 firms. 
The business and occupation rate for service businesses with a gross income over $5 million is increasing from 1.75% to 2.1%.
Republicans universally opposed this Democratic-backed package of new and increased taxes and fees. 
All of these proceeds go into the state’s operating budget, which funds the bulk of Washington’s state government programs and services. 
The budget for transportation is separate. 
The $15.5 billion two-year transportation budget approved this year also relies on a slate of new and increased taxes and fees, namely a rare gas tax hike implemented in July. 
These transportation funding streams are estimated to bring in $3.2 billion over the next six years to fund Washington State Ferries, highway megaprojects, maintenance of state roads and bridges, Washington State Patrol and public transportation.

A few transportation-centric fee hikes also begin Wednesday. 
The $9 annual fee for driver’s licenses and IDs is going up a dollar, a move expected to bring in $74 million over the next three budget cycles. The 50-cent capital vessel surcharge paid by state ferry riders is also increasing. This is projected to raise $47 million. 
And the latest transportation budget removes an exemption from tolls for public and private transit buses, vans, and rideshare vehicles on bridges. That’s worth $6 million over six years.
Further transportation revenue measures take effect throughout 2026. The taxes and fees respond to a gaping shortfall caused by diminishing gas tax receipts and ballooning costs for the state’s already-expensive road projects.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/washington-state-capitol-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-29 07:58:47.292917

It’s a standard for how institutions should operate when people come forward about sexual assault and exploitation.
Nearly eight years after the #MeToo movement forced a national reckoning — and years after the horrific scope of Jeffrey Epstein’s network came to light — Indiana keeps confronting local headlines that remind us how far we still have to go. From City Hall to the Statehouse to our own workplaces, women continue to report harassment and abuse, only to face doubt, retaliation, or bureaucratic processes that prioritize liability over safety.
Recent investigations into harassment complaints in Indianapolis’ city government made that painfully clear, describing behavior that was “professionally inappropriate” and a culture that must change. That should be a turning point, not a footnote.
The stakes are not abstract. Indiana has some of the highest rates of sexual violence in the country. According to statewide data, about 60% of Hoosier women report experiencing sexual violence in their lifetimes, and roughly one in three have been raped. Those numbers are staggering—and they represent the people we care about most—our coworkers, neighbors, students, parishioners, and friends.
We also sit at the crossroads of human trafficking. Law enforcement data show a growing number of identified cases across our state, underscoring the need for coordinated prevention, survivor services, and prosecution strategies. Host city selection often emphasizes hotel capacity, travel accessibility, and entertainment infrastructure, but rarely prioritizes whether a city is prepared to address concerns related to trafficking. Yet those very characteristics — plentiful lodging, robust transit, and nightlife — are the same that traffickers exploit. Studies show traffickers may also take advantage of travel visas by disguising victims as spectators or luring women and girls with promises of legitimate jobs only to coerce them into
illicit activity once they arrive.
Senate Democrats elect new minority leader after second round of sexual harassment accusations

Believing women is not enough. We must commit to building systems that actually protect them. That starts with Indiana law. Today, our statutes still contain gaps — particularly around consent — that make it harder for survivors to seek justice. Women4Change supports closing loopholes and modernizing definitions so the law reflects lived realities, not outdated
assumptions. This includes addressing forms of sexual assault that exploit coercion, impersonation, and power imbalances.
While policy is important, we can’t dismiss the role of infrastructure to support women when at their most vulnerable moments. The federal Violence Against Women Act provides critical funding for crisis response, shelters, legal assistance, and prevention. We need to ensure those resources reach communities equitably and are paired with trauma-informed practices in schools, universities, workplaces, and public agencies. Survivors should not have to become expert navigators of a fragmented maze to be kept safe at work or school — or to find a counselor, get a protective order, or keep their job while healing.
And we must talk plainly about money. Violence is not only a safety issue; it’s a financial one. Survivors lose wages, housing, jobs, and childcare. That’s why Women4Change uplifts tools that help people rebuild economic security — like FreeFrom’s survivor-centered resources that offer cash assistance, employment protections, and practical steps to stabilize finances and plan for long-term safety. Dignity is hard to sustain without dollars.
Finally, we must recognize that culture change also requires accountability in where we work and how we govern. Public institutions need survivor-centered reporting processes, independent investigations, guaranteed non-retaliation, and transparent timelines. Training for managers and elected leaders on bystander intervention, trauma-informed response, and legal obligations cannot be a one-time event — it must be consistent and ongoing. And when patterns emerge, leadership must act swiftly and publicly. Silence isn’t neutrality; it’s complicity.
But accountability cannot stop at policy; it must also adapt to the realities of a digital age where exploitation is increasingly enabled by new technologies. National data underscore this shift: in 2021, 85% of sex trafficking cases filed in U.S. Federal Courts involved the Internet as the primary method of solicitation. This reflects a longer trend: between 2007 and 2012, the National Human Trafficking Resource Center found that in most pimp-controlled prostitution incidents — one of the most prevalent forms of sex trafficking—the forced sex acts were advertised or facilitated online. These patterns make clear that without vigilance, traffickers will continue to weaponize emerging tools and platforms, exploiting every gap in oversight.
At Women4Change, our commitment is twofold: advancing policies that center on survivors and connecting Hoosiers with concrete help. If you or someone you know needs support, we’ve compiled Indiana-specific information on consent and sexual assault, along with links to statewide partners such as the Indiana Coalition to End Sexual Assault & Human Trafficking, crisis lines, and legal resources.
Indiana can lead. We can be a state where survivors are believed, where laws reflect modern realities, where City Hall and every workplace are safe, and where healing is matched with real economic security. But that will only happen if we demand it —consistently, across party lines, and with the courage to examine our own institutions.
Believe women, and then build the systems that prove it.

Mike Braun, left) and Commerce Secretary David Adams sit during an announcement on Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Secretary of Commerce David Adams remains both CEO and president of Indiana’s controversial Economic Development Corp. — five months after lawmakers directed Gov. Mike Braun to split the roles across two appointees.
But that’s expected to change next month, according to the Commerce Office.
“We have been evaluating the role of president and anticipate an announcement by the end of October,” a spokesperson told the Capital Chronicle.
The changes were tucked into Senate Enrolled Act 516, an economic development law that also created an entrepreneurship office on Braun’s behalf, plus established land notification and other transparency requirements for the IEDC.
Immigration cooperation, IEDC limits and more nab concurrence votes, head to governor

Until Braun’s May 1 signature, the secretary of commerce was required to be the agency’s CEO and president. But legislators crossed “and president” out of Indiana Code.
They added: “The governor shall appoint the president of the (IEDC), who shall serve at the pleasure of the governor. The president shall report to the secretary of commerce.” The edits were effective immediately.
Throughout the summer, however, Braun’s administration didn’t name an appointee to serve alongside Adams or offer specifics on a timeline, despite the Capital Chronicle’s repeated requests for information.
The Commerce Office’s Thursday statement didn’t include responses to questions of whether the administration was aware of the changes, the reasoning behind them or about the delay in compliance.
The law’s author — Sen. Brian Buchanan, R-Lebanon — said the idea came out of collaboration with Braun’s fledgling administration. The governor took office in January after former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s eight-year tenure.
“We worked with Secretary Adams and his staff, the governor’s office and the Legislature,” Buchanan said. “We all worked cooperatively, essentially, to come up to try to set up the best structure for IEDC to be successful.”
Splitting the roles, he said, allows “a little more focus,” to “build on our strengths and improve our weaknesses, and really dedicate the time it needs in order to to make sure we’re successful.”
The changes reset the provision to its original form.

Indiana had a traditional commerce department until 2005. That’s when, under former Gov. Mitch Daniels, lawmakers created the IEDC: “a body politic and corporate, not a state agency but an independent instrumentality exercising essential public functions,” per Indiana Code.
IEDC was established with two leaders, according to the 2005 law, House Enrolled Act 1003. They were merged in a 2021 law, House Enrolled Act 1418, under former Gov. Eric Holcomb. Under Braun, the roles are going back to the original design.
“I did ask that question about, ‘Does it need to be statute, or can it be administratively done?'” Buchanan recalled. “And I was told it is something that needs to be statute.”
The appointment will come within weeks of the release of a report about the IEDC and its partners.
Braun launched the investigation in May, after Indiana Legislative Insight’s April publication of allegations like self-dealing and side gigs.
The troubled agency, its foundation arm and several frequent collaborators were each dubbed an “entity of interest.” The analysis, conducted by Washington, D.C.-based FTI Consulting, took about four months — less than the year allotted in the $800,000 contract.
Braun led IEDC’s board in a unanimous approval of the report’s release at a Wednesday meeting. It’s undergoing legal review for redactions but is already driving new policies on investment, board voting and beyond.
That was the board’s second gathering in its new form. Braun remade it in June, replacing Holcomb’s eight selections with nine new appointees.
He has vowed to reform the quasi-public agency to increase transparency.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)The headlines over the past few weeks have been unrelenting. The Trump administration is activating the full power of the federal government against perceived enemies, from liberal groups to elections officials to the former FBI director.
Meanwhile, autocratic powers like China and Russia are running influence campaigns and cyber attacks to pit Americans against Americans. China currently has the ability to track Americans’ locations and unencrypted communications on American telecom networks, as well as movements and communications abroad, the Wall Street Journal recently reported. Russia has been perfecting the art of social media influence, with apparently great success in the case of President Donald Trump’s first election.
China and Russia want to crack the idea that we are a rainbow of many colors, a multiracial, multi-faith, representative democracy where we respect each other and celebrate our diversity in all its joys. They know America is weaker domestically and on the world stage when we are fighting against each other, both online and in the streets. 
The more we hate each other, the more our fabric of American government pulls apart and frays. While I strongly disagree with Charlie Kirk’s message and its impact on marginalized groups, political violence is always wrong and is a dynamo that is hard to stop.
Here in Minnesota, we had one our toughest summers since 2020. House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, her husband Mark, and their beloved golden retriever Gilbert were assassinated. It’s only by luck that State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette survived the assassin’s bullets, and that the killer failed to harm the dozens of other leaders on the kill list.
One of my closest friends was on the first page of the kill list. It’s scary. It’s easy to be anxious and paranoid. I have been threatened at my own home.
The only way to defeat us if the Trump administration and the movement that undergirds it manages to divide us. We can’t let that happen. To win as a majority coalition, we must always invite everybody who believes in civil liberties and human rights.
In a time when the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, labor allies, and the left needs to be organized, there is an ongoing rift between factions of the DFL Party. 
In Minneapolis, the party convention’s endorsement for mayor of state Sen. Omar Fateh was appealed to the state party and invalidated. This did not end the question. If anything, it made each intra-party faction feel ever more strongly that the opposing side was corrupt and self-dealing at the expense of the greater Democratic project.
Minnesota has been a shining eight-pointed North Star, strong on civil liberties, human rights, and economic opportunity. Gov. Tim Walz recently announced that he is running for a third term. There is an open U.S. Senate contest with U.S. Senator Tina Smith retiring from public service next year. This is a real opportunity to earn back a DFL trifecta with two legislative majorities and the governor’s signature pen. The stakes are high.
Keeping a big tent party unified in these times is incredibly difficult. I know first-hand as the former chair of the DFL local party unit that trained the most volunteers and raised the most funds of any DFL local party unit statewide. But this commentary isn’t about water under the bridge.
This November, voters in Minneapolis and Saint Paul will elect city leaders for the next four years. The first Tuesday of next February, thousands of DFL members will gather in the cold night for precinct caucuses. We will host yet more intra-party contests at in-person conventions across the state of Minnesota. It will get nasty. There will be hurtful language that threatens the inclusiveness of our party. How we react and lead will decide the path forward.
Words matter. Actions matter more. We on the left side of the spectrum — from moderate Democrats to liberals to leftists — have a role to play to invite Minnesotans into the greater Democratic project. You can invite your friends to a virtual training. You can attend the “No Kings” protests across Minnesota on October 18. You can register your family to vote where they live so they can vote in elections that affect the community they call home. 
And you can give family, friends and random people online a little grace. There are plenty of bots trying to gin up conflict, and real humans like us don’t have to add to that.
We are in the real fight against fascism now, here, in America. If you thought Joe Biden was using rhetorical hyperbole when he said in 2019 that there was a battle for the soul of this country, well, we are here now. 
The words we use and the actions we take will have significant consequences over the next months and beyond. Majorities are only built with addition, not subtraction. To help make it happen, you can get involved, bring your friends, make calls, knock doors, write postcards, protest, and exercise our First Amendment rights to protect the Fourth Amendment rights and all the rest they are coming for. 
We can do this, but only if we do it together.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2237397769.jpg,,,2025-09-29 07:58:47.292917

“It's a big deal that this is happening,” said state Sen. Ruth Hardy, while adding “I don't think it's going to solve the entire problem.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
When Rita Munro settled in Middlebury in 2016 to start a family, friends sent her spreadsheets of contacts for child care facilities across the county and encouraged her to get on waitlists as soon as she became pregnant. 
“It takes an incredible amount of executive function,” said Munro, 37, who works as a therapist. 
The word-of-mouth culture stemming from competition, particularly for home child care facilities, could be challenging for newcomers, she said, and the Covid-19 pandemic only intensified the situation. Eventually, she managed to find spots that worked for her kids.
In the coming months, Munro’s 2-year-old daughter and newborn twins are planning to attend the newly expanded and renovated Otter Creek Child Center in Middlebury. The organization’s $12 million transformation has been in the works since 2017.
“I think everybody’s excited,” said Linda January, the center’s executive director. “We’re ready to be in the building.”
The expansion will nearly double the program’s capacity, making it one of the largest child care providers in the state. The construction is expected to end by mid-November, January said, and comes during a period of growth for child care in Addison County. Local leaders said increased offerings in the area come none too soon, as a recent influx of public money to child care provides an opportunity for recovery from Covid-era hardship.
The new facility at Otter Creek Child Center is set to include a spacious, multistory addition to the original building, as well as a new expanded parking lot, several playgrounds, an elevator and a full commercial kitchen, January said. Though unfinished, the new rooms were beginning to bear hints of their future purpose on Friday, with cubbies taking shape in some spaces and miniature bathroom amenities in others.

The center plans to add up to 15 new teachers by next fall, in addition to several other operational positions.
“During the pandemic, Addison County lost more child care slots than any county in the state,” said Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison.
A 2022 analysis by the Burlington child care nonprofit Let’s Grow Kids found nearly 70% of infants likely to need care in Addison County did not have access to any regulated child care programs. Fifty-four percent of toddlers were in the same predicament, the report estimated.
Although Otter Creek will experience a huge jump in available slots — from its current daily maximum of 70 across two temporary locations to 139 in the single renovated building on Weybridge Street by next fall — there are currently 250 people on the waitlist, January said.
“It’s a big deal that this is happening,” said Hardy. “I don’t think it’s going to solve the entire problem.”

‘We fixed the business model, to an extent’
The two largest sources of funding for the expansion project were capital and land gifts from Middlebury College, the county’s largest employer and the project’s “biggest partner,” according to January, and congressionally directed spending from the office of former U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. Middlebury College’s contributions add up to more than $5 million, and Leahy’s office earmarked more than $3.5 million via Let’s Grow Kids. 
The child care center is still actively raising funds, January said, but does not anticipate any substantial, lingering debts. New levels of public support, in combination with her organization’s new structure, have given January confidence in the center’s financial outlook. 
According to Aly Richards, CEO of Let’s Grow Kids, the heart of Vermont’s child care problem historically lay not in initial capital for projects but rather in their long-term sustainability.

Act 76, which passed in 2023 via a veto override in the Vermont Legislature, commits $125 million annually to the state’s child care system in part via a .44% payroll tax. Families making up to 575% of the federal poverty level were newly eligible for tuition subsidies that year, and the state began paying out those subsidies at higher weekly rates.
“We fixed the business model, to an extent,” Richards said. “The money goes specifically to parents, who now can … better afford child care, and to early educators, who can have more resources to actually run their program.”
The state has seen 1,700 new child care slots and more than 100 new providers open since the act passed two years ago. Previously, more programs were closing than opening each quarter, and low pay combined with poor benefits made retention and hiring difficult, Richards said.
Under the new funding system and with a larger organizational scale, January said she has been able to increase the center’s salary floor to $20 per hour and add a retirement plan. Staff also now have vision and dental insurance, but health insurance coverage, while “more feasible,” is still a future goal.
January said the majority of the families she serves receive some tuition coverage, which can be equally transformative.
Without the subsidies Munro stands to receive, her cost for child care would exceed her take-home pay each month. While her husband, David, also works as a professor at Middlebury College, Munro may have needed to quit her job without tuition assistance.

“Our taxes are high,” Munro said. “We invest a lot into our school systems, so it makes sense to be investing a lot into early early child care.”
The impact of well-funded child care on the health of the state’s workforce should not be understated, Richards said. 
“There’s a massive return on investment for our economy and for businesses,” she said.
Otter Creek Child Center is not the only recent expansion to the Addison County child care landscape. The Red Clover Child Center in Middlebury’s congregational church, The Growing Tree in Addison and other providers have sprung up in the area over the past two years.
Michelle Bishop, who runs The Growing Tree, previously worked for the state’s federally funded Head Start program and observed the intense demand for child care providers through that job. Her program opened last month with a capacity of 20 and is still on a shoestring budget to some extent, she said. 
Bishop said it would not have been financially possible to open the center without public assistance from Act 76. Roughly 80% of her attendees receive tuition assistance through the program, which gives the organization some stability.
“It’s not a profitable thing,” she said. “That’s not the point, but it will keep itself alive.”
Hardy said projects like Bishop’s and January’s are a huge step forward for the county, as both a public service and a driver for the local economy. She said Vermont’s new funding provisions make the state a national leader for child care. 
“We’re very much on the cutting edge,” Hardy said.

On Tuesday, voters in Arizona elected Adelita Grijvala to Congress to fill a seat vacant following the death of her father, Raúl Grijalva. Both Grijvala, a Democrat, and her Republican opponent had said they would sign a discharge petition to force the House vote.
The petition needs 218 signatures — a majority of the House — to bring a resolution sponsored by U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, to the floor. The resolution would lead to a vote on a bill requiring the Department of Justice to “publicly disclose all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in its possession that relate to Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell,” Epstein’s longtime associate now being held in federal prison.
So far the petition, which Massie co-sponsored with U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, has 217 signatures — every Democrat in the House, including U.S. Reps. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City and Wesley Bell of St. Louis — and four Republicans.
Rep. Mark Alford, right, introduces himself to Douglas Walther, left, before the town hall on Wednesday at the Lions Club in Harrisburg. An NPR tally reported that around 37 of the 219 U.S. House Republicans held town halls during the August recess (Aiyana Massie/Missourian).
Only U.S. Rep. Mark Alford of Raymore among Missouri’s six Republicans told The Independent how he would vote for the measure if it makes it to the House floor. While he opposes the discharge petition, he said, if the bill it seeks to advance comes up for a vote, he will support it.
“The Epstein case has cast a long shadow over our institutions, fueling distrust among Americans,” Alford said in a statement sent by email. “By releasing the files, we can begin to ensure justice for the victims and restore faith in our criminal justice system. Transparency is not a partisan issue; it’s a moral one.”
Alford said he was opposed to the discharge petition because it doesn’t allow for measured consideration of legislation.
“The discharge petition process bypasses regular order, skips the committee process, and prevents the people’s elected representatives from having a say until an up or down floor vote—that’s wrong and is not how our legislature should operate,” Alford said.
The only other Republican member of the Missouri delegation to respond to an inquiry about the discharge petition was U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner of Ballwin. Her emailed statement did not say whether she would vote for the measure if it reaches the floor or why she had not signed the petition.
“As I have strongly stated previously, Jeffrey Epstein was evil and I hope he rots in hell for what he did to so many innocent children,” Wagner said. “I have called for total transparency, to the extent the courts will allow, and ensuring victims are always protected.”
Wagner said she has voted in favor of investigations by the House Oversight Committee and that has already resulted in the release of thousands of documents.
“Any criminal activity must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Wagner said.
Seven days after the 218th signature is recorded on the discharge petition, any member who signed can call for House Speaker Mike Johnson to schedule a vote on the petition, which must come within two days.
The tumult over releasing records related to the Epstein investigation has created turmoil in Congress all summer. His death in 2019 in a New York City jail cell while awaiting trial on federal charges for sex trafficking minors has become the focus of many of the questions surrounding the case.
In 2007, a plea deal with then-federal prosecutor Alexander Acosta, who went on to be secretary of labor in the first Trump administration, ended an FBI investigation into Epstein. He was accused, the Miami Herald reported in 2018, “of assembling a large, cult-like network of underage girls — with the help of young female recruiters — to coerce into having sex acts behind the walls of his opulent waterfront mansion.”
Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 in Florida for procuring and soliciting minors for sex, and served about 13 months in jail under a work release arrangement.
President Donald Trump and his supporters, including some now working in his administration, dealt in conspiracy theories for years on the information surrounding the Epstein case, including whose names turned up during the investigation and the circumstances of his death.
The clamor for more transparency in the case, especially about Trump’s friendship with Epstein, has resulted in various attempts by Republican leaders in Congress to keep a lid on rebellious members.
In July, Johnson, the house speaker, sent members home early for their August break because of the pressure to release the files. 
And at home in Kentucky, Massie told reporters he and the other three Republicans who signed the discharge petition are being pressured to remove their names following the election of Grijvala.
Johnson and “some of the powers that be in DC are in full panic right now” about it, Massie said, according to reporting by Semafor.
The other Republicans who have signed are U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.
“They asked some of my colleagues who are co-signers,” Massie said. “And they actually threatened them politically, not physically.”
Among the Missouri delegation, The Independent did not receive responses from the offices of U.S. Reps. Sam Graves of Tarkio, Jason Smith of Cape Girardeau, Bob Onder of Lake St. Louis or Eric Burlison of Springfield.
The Independent could not find any sources for statements by Graves at any time on the Epstein files.

Smith, in a statement reported by KRCG in July, said more documents should be unsealed.
“The more transparency we can have the better,” Smith said.
In a July panel discussion on right-wing news outlet Real America’s Voice, Onder said the delays in releasing full details of the Epstein investigation are a symptom of “this idea that ‘deep state’ insiders control the levers of power.” 
Epstein used influence to escape justice, Onder said.
“I think it’s very much the question of whether, if you’re wealthy enough, powerful enough, well-connected enough, you can get away with anything,” Onder said.
In an interview with Missourinet in July, Burlison said the American people are “sick and tired of being lied to by their government or the government holding these secrets that they deserve to know the truth on.”

A lawsuit filed Friday in Cole County Circuit Court alleges state lawmakers unconstitutionally split residential property into different classes, choosing which counties would get a cap, and how much, on “simply the whim of individual legislators.” 
The bill was passed by lawmakers during a special session in June.
The bill’s funding for sports stadiums — up to $1.5 billion intended to keep the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals in Missouri — was already in court. A hearing is scheduled Tuesday morning on a motion by the state to dismiss that challenge, filed by state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Gove, and others, alleging the bill violated procedural rules of the constitution.
Plaintiffs in the new case include a taxpayer from St. Louis County, which will not have taxes subject to the law’s caps and one from Warren County, which will have a cap that allows no growth in tax bills. The taxing districts listed in the petition are the Ozark Fire Protection District, along with school districts Warren County R-III in Warrenton, Crawford R-I in Bourbon, Ozark R-VI, Meramec Valley R-III in Pacific, Grandview R-II in Dittmer and Doniphan R-I.
The law requires each county subject to a possible cap to hold an election asking voters if they want to enact it.
Within two weeks of passing the legislation, House Speaker Jon Patterson had established an interim committee to study property taxes amid questions about the property tax provision’s constitutionality.
In 75 counties, voters could prevent property taxes from rising more than 5% per year from a base amount, or the rate of inflation, whichever is greater. In 22 other counties, voters could freeze their homes’ property taxes with exceptions for newly voted levies and additional value from improvements.
Lawmakers opted their counties into the legislation, deciding what level of relief they wanted for their area. Many legislators from the state’s largest counties asked to be excluded, leaving Boone, Greene, Jackson, St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis out of the law.
“No rational basis was used to categorize counties between those where the credit could result in a freeze on property tax revenue growth, a 5% cap on property tax revenue growth, or neither,” plaintiffs wrote in their initial filing.

Some of the school districts joining the lawsuit cover multiple counties that, if approved by voters, would have different levels of tax relief.
Their attorneys argue that this would violate Article X of the Missouri Constitution, which requires uniformity in taxation and limits state lawmakers’ power to divide real property into subclasses, among other things.
“As applied, (the law) may result in disparate treatment of otherwise similarly situated taxpayers because certain taxpayers for a single district may reside in political subdivisions that cover multiple counties — counties that may be subject to different property tax credit schemes.”
The lawsuit also challenges the statute under the state’s equal protection clause because the law only gives some taxpayers the right to vote on tax relief. 
The law “mandates varying levels of tax relief — either a cap of a five percent increase or no increase — denying all other similarly situated taxpayers the same level of tax relief thereby violating their equal rights and opportunity under the law,” plaintiffs wrote.
Plaintiffs’ attorneys further label the law unconstitutional for violating a section of the state’s constitution that restricts certain local or special laws.
“A law may not include less than all who are similarly situated,” plaintiffs wrote, saying the counties are grouped without a “conceivable state of facts that connect” them.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_colecountycourt2-scaled-e1757967844893-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-29 06:56:30.226729

Mike Parson to fund voter-approved Medicaid expansion (Photo by Tessa Weinberg/Missouri Independent).In the special session that ended Sept. 12, lawmakers approved measures that would block the ballot process that delivered medical marijuana, Medicaid expansion, reproductive care, and paid sick leave
Over the past two decades, Missouri’s broadest health reforms have come from the ballot box, not the Capitol. When the General Assembly did not act, voters legalized medical marijuana, expanded Medicaid, protected reproductive rights, and approved paid sick leave for workers who previously lacked it.
Each reform faced legislative resistance and saw its impact delayed or narrowed through lawsuits, refusals, and repeals. 
In 2018, after years of inaction in Jefferson City, voters approved medical marijuana. Opponents immediately filed lawsuits, and the state slowed implementation by tightly restricting licenses. By 2020, only a small number of dispensaries were operational statewide, showing how legal delays restricted access even after voter approval. Only after the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the measure did the program move forward, illustrating the limits of voter-led policy without strong legislative follow-through.
Missouri voters approved Medicaid expansion for low-income adults in 2020, ending more than a decade of legislative resistance. Implementation did not begin until 2021, after the Missouri Supreme Court ordered the state to comply. Governor Parson and budget chair Cody Smith contended expansion would cost hundreds of millions annually and force cuts elsewhere. 
They were wrong. Uncompensated hospital costs fell, patients paid less out-of-pocket, and federal matching funds eased pressure on the state budget. By 2022, emergency department visits covered by Medicaid rose about 15%, while visits by uninsured patients fell roughly 14%. The uninsured rate has dropped sharply over the past decade, with Medicaid expansion playing a major role once it took effect in 2021. Yet rural Missouri still lags behind, with higher uninsured rates and heavier reliance on Medicaid coverage than urban areas.
In 2024, a coalition led by Missourians for Healthy Families & Fair Wages gathered signatures for Proposition A. Voters approved the measure overwhelmingly, guaranteeing paid sick leave and a higher minimum wage for roughly 728,000 workers. Proposition A was upheld by the Missouri Supreme Court when business groups challenged it, but the legislature repealed the law in 2025, immediately leaving many workers vulnerable to lost wages and increased public health risks.
The same year, voters passed Amendment 3, restoring constitutional protections for abortion, contraception, and miscarriage care after Missouri’s near total ban in 2022. 
Missouri is one of the most dangerous states in the nation to give birth. Over 40% of Missouri counties are maternity care deserts, and Black women die at four times the rate of white women. In a 2018 state mortality review, 82% of pregnancy-related deaths were found to be preventable, with Medicaid patients dying at four times the rate of mothers with private insurance — all before Missouri expanded Medicaid in 2021.
These numbers reflect lethal systemic inequities across Missouri, making timely prenatal and miscarriage care difficult to access. Amendment 3 removed legal barriers, allowing care earlier and reducing some of the risks created by limited local access. 
In 2026, Missouri voters will be asked to repeal those protections while the state seeks to delay and complicate implementation.
Even with extensions to postpartum Medicaid coverage and modest increases to dental and provider reimbursement rates, many Missourians still face gaps in access. These are lawmaker-led reforms, incremental changes that improve some services but leave large portions of the population without meaningful coverage. 
Voter-led initiatives, by contrast, have reshaped the state’s health landscape—expanding Medicaid, protecting reproductive rights, legalizing medical marijuana, and guaranteeing paid sick leave—delivering broad and tangible impacts that the legislature alone has repeatedly failed to achieve.
Missouri has repeatedly shown that voter-led reforms, paired with stronger transparency, accurate fiscal notes, and safeguards such as sunset clauses or dedicated revenue, can deliver real benefit. 
The two measures passed in the special session would dismantle the process Missourians have relied on for two decades to pass reforms their representatives repeatedly blocked.
HJR 3 would require citizen-led initiatives to win not only a statewide majority but also in each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts, giving a single district the power to veto a measure for the entire state. This rule applies only to voter initiatives, not to measures lawmakers place on the ballot. HB 1 adds a new tactic by authorizing mid-decade redistricting, a rare move critics warn would allow politicians to redraw maps after seeing which areas supported or opposed a measure.
Together, these changes would have nullified past voter-approved reforms at the ballot box and made it far easier for lawmakers to overturn future initiatives, leaving Missourians without the protections and expanded access that citizen-led reforms have historically delivered.
In 2025, The Fairness Project tracked roughly 150 bills across 15 state legislatures that aimed to weaken ballot initiatives, nearly double the volume from two years earlier. In Missouri, the legislative majority has already added hurdles by stretching lawsuit timelines, titling ballot summaries, tightening donor rules, and even delaying an abortion measure under the former Attorney General’s office.
For Missourians, closing the ballot means shutting down the only proven path to major health reform in the past 20 years. Supporters of redistricting initiatives argue the process can be influenced by outside interests or lead to costly programs, but the record in Missouri shows otherwise: citizen-led reforms have consistently improved health in communities and strengthened the state. 
The real risk is not in letting voters decide, but in silencing them.

The excess application of fertilizer poses serious risks to public health, raises costs for people who get their water from public utilities or private wells and increases costs for farmers, the report found. 
Throughout the report, the environmental groups included input from residents who have had their health and wallets affected by nitrate pollution. 
“I own a daycare center, and the mental toll of just staying in business because I did not cause the contamination of my well and yet am expected to solve the problem is exhausting…” Kewaunee County resident Lisa Cochart says in the report. “This could put me out of business. I work hard to provide my community with a service that assures that each child is receiving the best care and it can be shut down because of a nitrate test that I cannot control.”
The report makes a number of recommendations to better track the amount of nitrogen spread on Wisconsin’s fields and in Wisconsin’s water systems while better enforcing regulations meant to protect drinking water. But agricultural industry representatives have said the report places too much burden on farmers — even though agriculture produces up to 90% of the nitrogen in the state’s groundwater. 
“Wisconsin cannot afford to delay. The cost of inaction — both financial and human — is rising,” the report states. “A coordinated, science-based policy response is essential to reduce nitrate pollution at its source, protect public health and ecosystems, and ensure clean, safe drinking water for future generations.”
The report recommends tougher state standards for nitrates, improved enforcement of nutrient management plans on individual farms, creating a statewide registration system for manure haulers and requiring regular groundwater monitoring for factory farms. It also proposes collecting data on the cost of nitrogen contamination to public water systems, expanding the state’s existing private well compensation program and increasing the state’s nitrogen fertilizer tonnage fees.
While the report’s recommendations are aimed at a wide range of policy areas and farming is the major source of nitrogen contamination, dairy industry representatives have pushed back on its findings. Tim Trotter, CEO of the Dairy Business Association, told Wisconsin Public Radio farmers are already doing enough voluntarily to address the problem. 
“Our work with solutions-minded environmental groups and other stakeholders through a statewide clean water initiative has resulted in tailored changes to programs and policies that open up more opportunities for on-farm innovation that addresses this important issue,” Trotter said. “Reports like this one do little to bring practical, achievable solutions to water quality challenges, and can be counterproductive to progress.”
In the past, the Dairy Business Association has sued state regulators to weaken the state’s ability to regulate pollution sources such as runoff. 
The report states that the state Legislature and the courts have limited the authorities of state agencies, including the Department of Natural Resources and Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, preventing them from doing all that is necessary to manage the contamination. 
“Because Wisconsin administrative agencies have been severely limited in their ability to establish new regulations, they have relied heavily on voluntary incentives, such as cost-sharing and price supports to incentivize farmers to implement conservation measures,” the report states. “However, it is clear that these voluntary incentives alone aren’t enough to solve Wisconsin’s nitrate problems.”
The report also found that in applying more nitrogen fertilizer than necessary, Wisconsin’s farmers are spending $8-$11 million more each year than they need to — “dollars that could be saved with more precise application.” 
More than one-third of the state’s residents get their drinking water from private wells, which are especially susceptible to nitrate contamination. The report recommends expanding the well compensation program, but adds that is just a band-aid solution. 
The program also limits participation to residents making less than $60,000 per year and includes a number of requirements that further restrict who is eligible, even if their wells exceed the state’s nitrate standard of 10 milligrams per liter, according to the report.  
Instead, the report argues, the state needs to better work to keep nitrates out of the groundwater in the first place. 
“Well compensation programs, while vital for near-term relief, are ultimately a stopgap,” the report states. “They do not address the root cause of nitrate pollution. Without stronger upstream controls on nitrate pollution, more families will face the high cost and growing scarcity of access to safe drinking water.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) is pursuing upgrades to technology used to track phones during investigations. Known as cell site simulators, the formerly murky equipment tracks phones by mimicking cell towers. Once connected to a targeted phone, cell site simulators are able to track the signal, allowing police to locate people. According to city purchasing division records, MPD aims to upgrade and acquire new components and extend a contract for the phone tracking gear by three years. 
The city’s contract with Tactical Support Equipment will be extended until 2028 and increase by $165,000 to $1.45 million. “MPD operating funds will be used,” according to records obtained by the Examiner explaining the purpose for amending the contract. The amendments will cover funds and coverage for two cell site simulators purchased in 2022, the records state. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
A separate section of the purchasing division records explains “this equipment is used on a regular basis to locate suspects and in exigent situations such as critical missing incidents.” It also states, “MPD used this equipment to help support other law enforcement agencies in Wisconsin, law enforcement in other states such as Texas, Ohio, and Michigan, and federal agencies such as FBI and DEA. At this time, MPD is seeking to upgrade the existing equipment, add additional equipment, and add warranty, support and maintenance for the new and upgraded equipment beyond what the department currently has in place. Tactical Support Equipment, Inc. is the only vendor that can support the equipment as the equipment and software is proprietary.”
MPD has used cell site simulators since at least 2010, according to logs the department uses to catalog its use of the gear. For years, the technology was used by MPD’s Fusion Center, an intelligence unit originally created for Homeland Security operations. A group of officers known as the Confidential Source Team – or CS Team – operates the cell site simulators. Logs of the technology’s use show that it’s mostly used to investigate crimes including homicides and shootings and for investigations related to overdoses or firearms. The logs also show the technology is used to locate material witnesses, kidnapping victims, but also for vague reasons like “drugs”, “long term”, or are redacted entirely.
By 2022, when Wisconsin Examiner first interviewed a member of the CS Team, both the team and its gear had been moved from the Fusion Center to MPD’s Special Investigations Division (SID), which focuses on fugitives, felonies and violent crimes. The team’s name invokes the technology’s secretive history. 
The Milwaukee department once signed non-disclosure agreements in order to acquire the technology leading to controversies in 2016, when MPD was accused of hiding use of Stingray-type devices from judges during court proceedings. When asked during a trial about how a person was located, officers used “oddly vague language,” the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin said, even stating that they “obtained information from an unknown source.” Things have changed over time, however. Today, the Milwaukee Police Foundation, which funnels private donations to MPD, publicly lists cell site simulators as among the technologies it helps MPD to purchase.
Like many other law enforcement agencies nationwide, for years MPD utilized phone tracking equipment produced by the Harris Corporation, a multi-billion dollar defense contractor. Harris’ devices were so common that one of its brand names, Stingray, became a common shorthand for all cell site simulators, which are also sometimes called “IMSI catchers.”

In 2019, MPD purchased a new model from Tactical Support Equipment, a North Carolina-based veteran-owned company which sells everything from K9 camera systems to cables and night-vision cameras. The company does not appear to advertise its cell phone tracking systems on its website. 
Tactical Support Equipment, which did not respond to requests for comment for this story, sold MPD a single cell site simulator in 2019 for $498,900, according to purchasing division records from the time. Later that same year, MPD purchased a C-Hostile Emitter Angle Tracker (C-HEATR), which is a remote handheld mapping device that works together with the cell site simulator. 
Three years later in 2022, MPD upgraded the cell tracking gear by adding a four-channel “5G enabler solution” for $328,700, and a 12-channel portable base station with full 5G coverage (as well as insurance, training, and supporting equipment) for $951,750. 
Responding to questions from Wisconsin Examiner, MPD said that the most recent upgrades will be to “support devices operating in 5G.” The department added that “MPD is the only agency in the area that has a [cell site simulator]. When an agency needs assistance with an investigation and their request falls in line with our operating best practices, we try to provide that agency with assistance.” 
Although cell site simulators are less of an enigma than they used to be, many questions still remain. While MPD states that its technology can only track location, cell site simulators as a family of devices are known to be capable of intercepting calls and text messages, and even more exotic abilities like sending fake short messages to a target phone. In Milwaukee, local activists have long reported strange phone malfunctions and service disruptions which they suspect may be caused by law enforcement surveillance.

MPD has repeatedly denied responsibility for the claims, and has said in the past that the department’s cell site simulators do not cause malfunctions to target phones. When the Wisconsin Examiner reached out for this story, however, MPD said for the first time that “the equipment already will disrupt service to the target phone when the target phone is located. That disruption is limited to the time it takes for the operator to narrow down the location of the device.” 
The department has also repeatedly stated that its cell site simulators cannot intercept calls or text messages. A different technology known as PenLink is used by MPD for Title III investigations, which involve intercepting content of communications. In responses to Wisconsin Examiner, MPD cited Department of Justice policies and U.S. law which state that “cell site simulator technology must be configured as pen registers, and may not be used to collect contents of any communication.” Wisconsin Examiner reached out to the Wisconsin Department of Justice for more information and has not received a response. 
From 2021 to 2023, Republicans introduced bills that would have changed  how pen registers are defined in Wisconsin. Supporters of the bills, which did not pass, said that they would allow law enforcement to pursue pen registers for social media. Telecommunications experts, however, warned that the bills could open a “back door” for police to use cell site simulator devices in ways not well understood by judges or the public. 
There have been more calls for more oversight of police surveillance in Milwaukee recently, with local activists pushing for  Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) ordinances. Over two dozen U.S. cities have already passed such ordinances, which provide more transparency about the purchase and use of surveillance technologies by police departments. MPD stresses that it uses cell site simulators in accordance with DOJ policy “and only after a court order is granted in cases that are not exigent,” the department said in a statement. “There is a process in place in which utilization of the equipment is only done with supervisory approval and oversight.”

The latest Clean Jobs America report — published by San Francisco-based business group Environmental Entrepreneurs, or E2 — indicated that clean energy occupations across the United States grew by 2.8% in 2024, adding nearly 100,000 jobs and outpacing broader employment growth of 0.8%.
In Indiana, however, the pace was slower.
The report found that Indiana saw just 0.4% growth in clean energy jobs in 2024, bringing the total to approximately 90,015 Hoosier jobs. That compares to Indiana’s 2023 base of around 89,600 to 90,000 jobs. In 2022, Indiana had about 88,400 clean energy jobs, and 85,298 in 2021.
Story continues below.

Within the clean energy job categories in Indiana, 53,445 jobs jobs were in the energy efficiency subsector; 20,331 jobs were related to clean vehicles; 12,017 jobs were in renewable generation; 3,404 jobs were in storage and grid modernization; and 818 jobs were in biofuels.
Energy efficiency — Indiana’s largest subsector — grew by just 0.1% in 2024, essentially flat compared to the prior year. Renewable generation jobs in the state increased 1.5% year over year, while storage and grid modernization rose 3.2%. Clean vehicles, meanwhile, grew by about 4.2% in Indiana, continuing as the fastest-growing subsector. Biofuels saw no measurable increase.
Regionally, the Midwest added around 13,293 clean energy jobs in 2024, equal to about 1.7% growth.
Though the overall growth was modest, clean-vehicle employment remains one of the stronger performing subsectors in Indiana.
Nationwide, clean-vehicle jobs more than doubled between 2020 and 2024, though 2024 saw a slight year-over-year dip.
Clean vehicle jobs across the U.S. declined by 3% last year — about 12,000 positions — even as Indiana managed a small gain. Energy efficiency nationwide grew by 2.6%, renewable generation grew 5.1%, and storage and grid modernization jumped 7.5%. Biofuels fell 0.4%.
Indiana’s clean vehicle jobs grew from 19,513 in 2023 to 20,331 in 2024 — an increase of 818 positions. That growth put the Hoosier State in the top tier of Midwest states for clean vehicle employment, trailing only Michigan and Ohio.
Indiana’s clean vehicle workforce is also heavily tied to manufacturing, according to the report. More than 70% of the state’s clean vehicle jobs are in making or assembling parts and components, compared to about 56% nationally.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Three weeks after cuts to Oklahoma providers were first reported, the Mental Health Department doesn’t have concrete numbers on how much needs to be cut to right size the agency’s budget.
Maria Chaverri, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, said the agency has not publicly identified a dollar amount for how many cuts are necessary, but knows there was previous overspending that the current administration is working to correct by making strategic cuts.
Nearly 800 contracts for mental health and substance abuse providers have been reviewed, but the agency’s final decisions on cuts are still being finalized, Chaverri said. Until the agency has completed its review process, a solid number of cuts or the total dollar amount saved won’t be provided, she said. 
But Chaverri said as of Thursday, 300 line items, or pieces of provider contracts for specific services, had been identified for cancellation or nonrenewal as part of its process to identify duplicative or unnecessary services. This is being done in an effort to right-size its state appropriated budget of $400 million budget under the direction of Interim Commissioner Gregory Slavonic.

In the tumultuous final weeks of Legislature’s session, deficiencies in the agency’s budget first came to light and led to weeks of investigative hearings, the firing of former Commissioner Allie Friesen and an emergency supplemental appropriation so the agency could make payroll. 
Various reports, including from the State Auditor and Inspector and the Legislative Office for Fiscal Transparency, found a pattern of overspending at the state agency. 
“We know because of those reports, we have to reduce,” Chaverri said. “We’ve been overspending for like 10 years. … It’s a difficult problem to solve. But that’s been the systemic approach. It’s not, ‘Let’s make cuts at random.’ It’s, ‘I’m going to go line by line.’”
No essential services will be cut from any of Oklahoma’s 77 counties, she said. “Essential services” include items like competency restoration, 24/7 crisis care like the 988 mental health hotline, inpatient psychiatric treatment, outpatient mental health and substance use treatment, direct services through state facilities, among others.
The agency has also cut more than 20 executive positions, leading to $3.5 million in annual savings, she said. 
If extra “non-essential” services need to be funded, the Mental Health Department will need additional funding from the Legislature, Chaverri said. 
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, who led a legislative investigative committee into the agency’s finances, said lawmakers knew at the conclusion of session the supplemental appropriation wouldn’t fix the agency’s budgetary issues and it was expected that changes would be made at the Mental Health Department.

Lawson said it’s “appropriate” to not have a number at this point, and he’d rather that the agency be thorough and not put out erroneous numbers, which would sow instability and erode legislative and public trust. 
“In a field where every day is kind of uncertain for folks in crisis, we just want to have a stable and robust network of services to be there for people when they need it,” he said. “And the last thing I think we need across the board is uncertainty or ‘Well, they said it was this number last month, and now they’re saying it’s this number,’ so now there’s no trust.”
Lawson said the Mental Health Department has brought in financial experts to help rectify its budget issues, including the business management company Deloitte. 
Lawmakers from the House and Senate were briefed about potential contract cuts about a month ago and the Mental Health Department had initially identified around $50 million in contracts related to substance use disorder that could be duplicative, Lawson said. This doesn’t necessarily mean all $50 million will be cut. 
While he said there will be some disruption, if the cuts later result in a “glaring gap” in services, his committee will be prepared to deal with revisiting contracts.
He said he’s confident the Legislature will be able to work with the agency to reach an accurate budget for the next fiscal year, but there could be more “bumps in the road.” 
Providers have reached out to him and other lawmakers, Lawson said. He’s heard mixed answers about how they can handle the cuts. Larger providers have told Lawson they can pivot and adapt to the changes, while smaller providers are more concerned. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“You’re not going to find a single provider that says, ‘Hey, you know what? We really don’t provide any value to the state, or we don’t provide good service,’” Lawson said. “They’re not going to say that. They all think that they’re doing great work. And they’re concerned about the folks that they take care of. But then also their business, too, is if some of these proposed cuts are deep enough, it may cause them to have to make some very serious business decisions, including closing their doors.”
Sen. Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, was also briefed on the cuts and said she was surprised by them. Kirt said she asked the agency what the goal of the cuts was. She said she wasn’t provided a dollar amount but was told the agency is aiming to “live within its means.” 
“Yes, look for efficiency,” she said. “Yes, make sure you’re not wasting money. No question, we want them doing that, but automatically cutting a bunch with no clear number in mind concerns me.”
Kirt said she respects the interim commissioner and said he’s a “very honest player trying to do the right thing,” but she’s worried about overly focusing on the budget’s dollar amount rather than the sought-after improved outcomes. 
“The Legislature should not be micromanaging every contract,” she said. “But we do need to understand what the priorities are.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)It’s ironic that a man who built his political career railing passionately about teachers “unions” will soon be running one of his own.
But in a way it’s almost fitting that it will be the next move for Oklahoma education Superintendent Ryan Walters, who has made it his mission to babble bizarre, inflammatory rhetoric and launch random witchhunts against educators and their unions.
Maybe it will help him recenter on who is vitally important to the success of our public schools — the teachers. Because if he truly wants to be successful, the role will require him to collaborate with them and show some empathy toward their needs.
Those are two skillsets that he’s been sorely lacking the past two years and 10 months in his elected position. 
And maybe it will serve as a rude awakening that he’s betrayed the trust of Oklahomans who believed he could turn our schools around. They’ll now find themselves with a politically appointed leader they didn’t get to choose, for the remaining year or so of what should have been Walters’ term.
In case you weren’t randomly tuned into Fox News at 10:43 p.m. Wednesday, Walters was allotted just under 40 seconds on a national conservative talk program to announce he has accepted a new role as CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance. The group bills itself as an “alternative to traditional union membership,” but provides “professional support services and resources” for educators.
The group, which so far boasts a measly 2,800 members nationwide, is a new effort of the Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit “dedicated to fighting government overreach, defending workers’ rights and protecting constitutional freedom.”
“For decades, union bosses have poisoned our schools with politics and propaganda while abandoning parents, students, and good teachers. That ends today. We’re going to expose them, fight them, and take back our classrooms,” Walters said in a statement released by the Freedom Foundation. “At the Teacher Freedom Alliance, we’re giving educators real freedom, freedom from the liberal, woke agenda that has corrupted public education. We will arm teachers with the tools, support, and freedom they need, without forcing them to give up their values.”
The Teacher Freedom Alliance sure sounds like it has the same mission of a teachers union — you know, those groups Walters has loved to hate.
In January, Walters launched a tone deaf tirade attempting to link schools and teachers unions to the deadly truck attack in New Orleans and even used the phrase “terrorist training camps” to describe school classrooms.
This year, he also falsely claimed teachers unions love standardized testing (they don’t).
He pushed the state Board of Education to take away the teaching license of a former Norman High School educator for sharing a QR code to the Brooklyn Public Library’s free online catalog. He is trying to revoke two other educators’ licenses over social media posts related to the 2024 assassination attempt of President Donald Trump.
And most recently, he’s threatened to ban teachers for things they’ve posted on social media about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Now he’s going to be something of a union boss himself? That was not a square on my 2025 bingo card.
While the Teacher Freedom Alliance bills itself as a “viable alternative to unions,” it does appear to share many similarities with Oklahoma’s organizing groups. In Oklahoma, a few of the largest districts do have groups that collectively bargain for educators, but most don’t. However, one thing that makes Oklahoma’s associations different from unions in other states is that they cannot strike. But much like the Teacher Freedom Alliance, Oklahoma’s organizations provide their members liability insurance if they ever get sued as well as professional development training and an “engaged community of educators.”
In light of his new job, it sure appears that Walters has been spewing a whole lot of hyperbole about educators that he actually doesn’t believe. That’s pretty sad for our children and the teachers we’ve entrusted to educate them.
It also appears that Walters never intended to actually help fix our school system. Instead, he used the post that we entrusted him with to try to gain the attention of conservative groups so he could grab a cushy job.
Oklahoma voters — and teachers — deserve better. They deserve a public official who is committed to rolling up their sleeves and working together, and not someone who flees in terror when things get hard. And they need someone who is competent and understands how schools work and who isn’t motivated by grabbing headlines.
Hopefully fellow Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt will choose carefully when it comes time to fill the role. He’ll get to pick Walters’ successor once he officially resigns.
Walters has proven he doesn’t have a lot of respect for the voters who elected and believed in him if last night was any indication.
He couldn’t be bothered to let Oklahomans know he was leaving in a publicly accessible forum. Instead, he chose a late-night, cable talk show slot, which many Oklahomans don’t have access to, to announce he’s washing his hands of us.
Walters was likely a frontrunner in the 2026 gubernatorial race. I say that judging from the multitude of emails in support of him that I’ve received from people all over the state the past two years.
If he still harbored any plans to run for governor, I think he’s shot himself in the foot.
Oklahomans don’t like quitters. And they certainly don’t like hypocrites who preach one thing publicly while secretly believing something else.

The 441-million-ton coal lease that lingered for years for lack of industry interest is now on the selling block.
The post Feds set auction date for first major Wyoming coal lease in a decade appeared first on WyoFile .","The U.S. Bureau of Land Management issued a “record of decision” Thursday, greenlighting the sale of 441 million tons of coal in the Powder River Basin in northeast Wyoming — the first major federal coal lease offering in the region in a decade.
The West Antelope III coal lease will go to competitive auction on Oct. 8, the agency said. 
Though the 3,508-acre tract contains approximately 441 million tons of coal, the estimated “recoverable” volume is about 365 million tons, according to the BLM. “The recoverable coal volume and duration of leased reserves is driven by economics and subject to change,” the agency said.
The tract is associated with Navajo Transitional Energy Company’s Antelope mine and spans areas of Campbell and Converse counties. Navajo Transitional’s predecessor, Cloud Peak Energy, nominated the tract in 2015, kicking off the BLM’s review process. But federal action on the request went idle when Cloud Peak filed for bankruptcy in 2019. The company eventually sold its Powder River Basin mines to Navajo Transitional. The BLM revived the lease sale approval process just days after the One Big Beautiful Bill was signed in July.

“This coal leasing effort directly supports the Trump administration’s goals of reinvigorating the American coal industry, reducing reliance on foreign energy, and creating good-paying jobs in rural communities,” the agency said in a press release. “It also aligns with Secretary [Doug] Burgum’s vision of unleashing domestic energy production while streamlining federal processes and ensuring long-term economic growth.”
The West Antelope III coal lease, along with 14.5 million tons of extra coal reserves included in a pending modification plan for the Antelope mine, would add about 18 years to the life of the mine, according to BLM estimates. The Antelope mine extracts 20-25 million tons annually and employs about 400 workers, according to the company. It’s the third-largest coal mine in the nation in terms of production, federal records show.
The size of the coal lease, as well as the Trump administration’s expedited timeline to put it up for auction, is cause for concern, according to the Sheridan-based Powder River Basin Resource Council, which formed in the 1970s, in part, to watchdog the industry.
“Where’s the market for this lease, and does the lease make sense in the current market?” Resource Council Executive Director Donna Birkholz wants to know.
Though the Powder River Basin coal industry has benefited from a slowdown in coal-burning electric power plant retirements, it’s a long way from recovering from a steep market slide that began 15 years ago, cutting the mining district’s annual production by nearly half.
Lingering uncertainty about the industry’s future underscores concerns about potential environmental impacts if coal companies are unable to make good on reclamation requirements, Birkholz added.
The Resource Council, along with other conservation groups, has also noted that recent cuts to coal royalty rates — by both Wyoming and the federal government — will result in lower revenues to state and federal coffers compared to past coal leases.Visit this BLM website to learn more about the West Antelope III coal lease.

(Photo by Idaho Capital Sun)Getting a COVID vaccine is different this year. 
Under the Trump administration, federal government agencies limited eligibility and, just last week, softened recommendations for who should receive them.
But most people who want to be vaccinated for COVID should still be able to, and their health insurance would probably cover it, said Idaho’s state epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn.
“No one is prohibited from getting the vaccination based on those recommendations,” Hahn told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
Here’s a guide on how to get vaccines for COVID and the flu in the Gem State.
 Am I eligible for the COVID vaccine?

In August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved updated COVID-19 vaccines but limited them to people aged 65 and older and younger people (age six months to age 64) who are at risk for severe illness. 
There’s a long list of things that put people at high risk for severe COVID. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, says that can include mental health conditions, being overweight, not being physically active, being a current or former smoker, cancer, heart conditions, having a weakened immune system and more. 
Most adults can likely identify they have something on the CDC’s list, Hahn said. And even if you aren’t sure the vaccine isn’t licensed for you, she said doctors can still prescribe it.
“If you say, ‘I might not have this condition, but my spouse does. I take care of my spouse who has cancer, and I really want to be protected.’ That is certainly something that can still be done,” Hahn told the Idaho Capital Sun. “It is considered off-label, but this is … the same type of vaccine that you may have received in years past and should be safe for you.”
 Is COVID still spreading?

In Idaho, COVID spread is up, according to the limited public health data still available after officials scaled back reporting after the pandemic ended. 
There’s less COVID-19 data now. But here’s how to track the virus in Idaho.

Idaho’s hospitalizations are rising, and 30 nursing homes in the state recently had patients sick with COVID, Hahn said. 
“When we start hearing that, we know COVID is out there,” she said. 
Idaho’s wastewater levels for COVID are “very high,” according to the CDC’s tracker. 
ER visits for COVID-like illness are also up in Idaho to around 50 to 80 a day in the first couple weeks of this month, compared to around 40 a day in July, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s tracker. 
Flu is seasonal. But COVID isn’t, said Dr. Sky Blue, an infectious disease doctor in Boise. 
“It’s not a wait till October kind of thing if you want your protection,” he told the Sun. “And we know that there’s circulating cases right now.”
Research shows COVID vaccines reduce the risk of death, serious disease, visits to the emergency department and even long-COVID, a chronic condition that persists even after infection ends. 
Hahn said she still gets vaccinated to reduce the risk of getting long-COVID.
 Is the COVID shot recommended for me? 

Last week, the CDC’s top vaccine panel softened recommendations for who should get COVID vaccines.
The recommendations could emphasize the risk of COVID vaccines and stress individual decisionmaking, even though the CDC’s data shows that the vaccines are safe and effective for most people, the Georgia Recorder reported. But the panel didn’t pull back the CDC’s recommendations that younger people, between six months old and 64 years old, get vaccinated.
CDC panel opts against requiring COVID shot prescription, but wants greater emphasis on its risks

To become official, the panel’s recommendations require approval by CDC leaders. 
In a statement, officials for the CDC’s parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the panel’s recommendations include “an emphasis that the risk-benefit of vaccination in individuals under age 65 is most favorable for those who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 and lowest for individuals who are not at an increased risk, according to the CDC list of COVID-19 risk factors.”
“It’s a nuanced recommendation,” Hahn said. “But essentially, for Idahoans, what’s important to know is that if you would like to get the COVID vaccine, it should be available and recommended for you.”
Asked how people should decide if they should get the COVID vaccine, she suggested people assess their own risk — and the risk of people they are around.
As the federal government’s health agencies, led by U.S. health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., restricted vaccine access this year, more than a dozen states protected vaccine access, Stateline reported. 
Idaho wasn’t one of them.
“We felt that what (the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel) came up with last week actually can align with what we would like to do, which is that people 6 months and older who are interested in getting the vaccine, we believe should have access to the vaccine,” Hahn told the Sun. “We’re seeing that pharmacies are carrying it. We know our pharmacists can prescribe it, but if people want to go talk to their doctor about it, that they have that choice as well.”
 Will insurance still cover the COVID vaccines?

Many insurance companies say they’ll keep covering COVID vaccines. 
Before the CDC vaccine advisory panel’s vote, a group representing most major insurers in the U.S. pledged to continue covering COVID vaccines.
“Health plans will continue to cover all … immunizations that were recommended as of September 1, 2025, including updated formulations of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, with no cost-sharing for patients through the end of 2026,” America’s Health Insurance Plans said in a statement. 
In Idaho, at least two major insurers have made similar commitments.
“We continue to cover COVID-19 vaccines for our members, as we have in the past, and are monitoring the regulatory environment,” Blue Cross of Idaho spokesperson Bret Rumbeck told the Sun in a statement. “We encourage members to talk with their healthcare provider about the vaccine.”
Regence BlueShield of Idaho’s parent company issued a similar statement last week, saying “Coverage for COVID-19 vaccinations remains unchanged through the end of 2025.”
But if you wonder whether your insurer will cover a COVID vaccine, Hahn recommends checking with them or your doctor or pharmacist. 
 How will pharmacies give out the COVID vaccine?

How pharmacies interpret the new COVID vaccine eligibility could vary, Blue said. He recommends calling ahead if you want to know what the pharmacy would require from you to get the vaccine. 
 What about the flu vaccine?

Hahn recommends everyone consider getting the flu shot. Earlier this month, a CDC report found that the last flu season was “high-severity.”
“Even if you’re not too worried about getting a severe case, it could keep you from missing work, missing school, missing out on your day-to-day life,” she said. 
Doctors say it’s safe to get the flu vaccine at the same time as the COVID vaccine.
But if you like to get your vaccines separately, Hahn recommended getting the COVID vaccine first because the virus is already circulating. 
Some doctors recommend waiting until late September or early October to get the flu shot. That’s because immunity from flu shots can wear off, but the flu season usually reaches its peak around February each year, and can stretch into the spring.
But Blue said if people are already gearing up to get their COVID vaccines, they can get their flu shot at the same time. 
“I think the chances of missing it are a bigger risk,” he said of the flu shot.

(Photo via Palmyra Fire Rescue Facebook page)The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Under a proposed partnership with federal Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE), the Palmyra Police Department would focus on criminals — not on people simply because they might be immigrants without legal status, the department’s interim police chief told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview last week. 
Interim Police Chief Paul Blount also said that partnering with ICE would allow department officers to get access to databases and resources to better fight serious crimes, such as drug trafficking and human trafficking.
Along with the proposed partnership deal, the Palmyra department has the potential to receive payments for its involvement. According to CBS 58 News, Blount said last week that the agreement might “be the difference in this next year of having officers on the street during the daytime and nighttime.”
Blount spoke with the Wisconsin Examiner for about 40 minutes Thursday about the village’s proposed ICE partnership. The arrangement, under the ICE task force model, would grant officers limited authority to enforce immigration law while performing routine police duties. The department would also receive reimbursements from ICE. 
Task force agreements with ICE were discontinued in 2012, but the government has revived the program in President Donald Trump’s second term, Stateline reported.
The 287(g) program allows participating local law enforcement to enforce certain aspects of U.S. immigration law in partnerships with ICE. While 13 Wisconsin counties have a sheriff’s department partnering with ICE, Palmyra would be the only 287(g) partnership in Wisconsin between a police department and ICE. 
The Palmyra partnership would also be the only 287(g) partnership in Wisconsin using the task force model. Other models focus on people who are already in custody. 
The proposal still awaits approval by the Palmyra village board. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin issued a press release last week criticizing the potential partnership, saying the department is “partnering hand in glove with ICE to carry out this regime’s plan to deport our immigrant neighbors and loved ones.” 
Chief: Little change for police operations
In his interview with the Wisconsin Examiner, Blount said that under the arrangement with ICE, the village police department would not be operating much differently than it does now. 
In addition to cooperating with the federal government, Blount said,  “Obviously the financial incentive that was newly added that goes along with it was another reason why we looked at this program, and said, ‘We’re already doing a majority of what this involves. So why would we not collaborate with them, and then we could have the financial incentive that goes along with it.’” 
The ICE website says officers may also exercise limited immigration authority as active participants on ICE-led task forces. 
In its statement, the ACLU said that the task force model “gives officers the green light to stop people they think might be immigrants on the street, question them about their citizenship status, and even take them into custody.”
Blount said the department will not go door to door to check individuals’ documentation or profile people who they think may lack documentation. Palmyra police will collaborate with ICE when someone is involved in criminal activity, wanted on a warrant or facing criminal charges, he said. 
Blount, who is also the director of public safety for the village, said he is one of three full-time officers in the department, along with five part-time officers. 
Asked whether a Palmyra Police Department officer might ask people about their immigration status if they are pulled over for traffic violations — rather than something that would lead police to take a driver to jail — Blount said he didn’t think that was likely. 
 “For a simple traffic stop, that is something that we would be allowed to do,” Blount said, “and I would say that I haven’t made a final decision on that yet. If it involves criminal traffic, the answer to that would be yes, if it’s criminal traffic. So there are certain things that rise to the element of criminal traffic law…but basic traffic [offenses] like a speeding ticket, probably not.”
Blount said that distinction would potentially be detailed in a policy if the village moves ahead with the partnership.  
In its statement, the ACLU of Wisconsin raised concerns about racial profiling. A 2011 Department of Justice investigation found widespread racial profiling and other discrimination in an Arizona task force. 
The ACLU also called for “a balanced approach to immigration that includes both humane border management and a pathway to citizenship.”
If Palmyra moves forward with the partnership, Blount said he is leaning “towards establishing policies and procedures to prevent any type of profiling that the agreement has the potential for.” 
ICE now lists Palmyra Police Department as a participating 287(g) agency with the task force model, with a signature date of Monday, Sept. 22. Blount said the department received federal approval on Wednesday. 
The department’s application for the task force model is pending review by the village board, Blount said, and the board’s vote will be posted on a meeting agenda before it takes place. 
Officers who will be involved must take 40 hours of training and education, which has not started yet, Blount said.  
A financial boon
Blount said the program would come with significant financial incentives from the federal government. 
At the time of his interview with the Wisconsin Examiner, Blount was unsure of the exact amounts that Palmyra would receive. He later sent the Examiner a press release from the Department of Homeland Security dated Sept. 17, which includes details about reimbursement opportunities that will begin Oct. 1. 
A 287(g) fact sheet on ICE’s website contains a section titled “Task Force Model Reimbursement Plan Benefits,” which include $7,500 for equipment for each trained task force officer, $100,000 for new vehicles, salary and benefits reimbursed per trained task force officer and overtime funds up to 25% of salary.
Agencies will also be able to receive quarterly performance awards, up to $1,000 per eligible task force officer, based on “the successful location of illegal aliens provided by ICE and overall assistance to further ICE’s mission to defend the homeland,” the ICE press release states.
Members of the village board did not respond to interview requests from the Wisconsin Examiner.
In his interview, Blount said he believes he and the board are listening to community questions.
“We’ve had a fair amount of support and a fair amount of, lack of a better term, negativity and pushback for the potential pending agreement,” Blount said. “So we’re listening to both sides and listening to that feedback, and I think obviously the board then will make their decision based on that.”
Blount said he didn’t think the village board would weigh in on the specifics of how he participates in the agreement. 
“They usually don’t get involved in my operations per se,” he said.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner) LINCOLN — Conservative and liberal students at Nebraska colleges say they want to turn down the temperature on the heated political dialogue dominating national conversations in the weeks since the killing of Charlie Kirk.
But they’ve got their work cut out.
The call for a return to civil discourse among young Nebraskans comes against the backdrop of President Donald Trump pledging to use the federal government to investigate political foes on the “radical left.” 
Ethnie Barnhouse, the president of University of Nebraska-Lincoln chapter of Kirk’s political organization Turning Point USA, which was designed to engage college students, said she hopes more young conservatives will “be bold and be courageous” and speak openly with others about their views. 
“They’re going to think you’re some evil person … I want people not to be afraid to have those conversations,” Barnhouse said at a UNL campus vigil honoring Kirk days after he was killed. “Because a lot of the time, when people think that about you, it’s just because they haven’t talked to you, and they don’t actually know what you believe.” 
After the vigil — whose speakers included Nebraska volleyball middle blocker Rebekah Allick and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican – Barnhouse took questions from fellow students and community members who wanted to get more involved with Turning Point. Barnhouse said she was surprised by the turnout and level of interest.

Campus conservatives at some of the state’s largest schools in Lincoln and Omaha credited Kirk for encouraging them to be more open about their political views in what many described as environments hostile  to conservatism. Several said they plan to make sharper efforts to organize young people while also calling for more civil dialogue with people across the political spectrum. 
Young liberals also hope for more civil disagreement, rather than the rhetoric often seen on social media and among politicians. Troy Kallhoff, president of the UNL chapter of the Young Democrats, said he was deeply disturbed that people would try to “resolve political divide and political grievance” with violence. 
“Regardless of how much I disagree with him or any other political activist or politician, I would never wish for them to be murdered or killed,” Kallhoff said.  
Kirk was shot during a Turning Point event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, in early September. The 22-year-old man accused of killing Kirk, Tyler Robinson, had sent text messages to his romantic partner that he had “had enough of [Kirk’s] hatred” and that “some hate can’t be negotiated out,” according to Utah prosecutors, who are seeking the death penalty.
The Kirk shooting was the latest instance of political violence in the U.S. An arsonist burned the Pennsylvania Governor’s Mansion in April. Two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed in Washington, D.C. in May. A Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband were shot and killed in June. A Georgia man was indicted in June for allegedly making threats across state lines against Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Nebraska U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer.

Dona-Gene Barton, a UNL political science professor who studies political behavior, said political violence isn’t new in American history. But she said this political moment is different because of high levels of “affective polarization.” 
“It’s a context where the rhetoric and the effect of polarization among political elites [and] average citizens is [already] at a dangerous [level] to begin with,” Barton said. 
Kirk and Turning Point, which he founded in 2012, were credited with mobilizing younger voters to support Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Trump made gains with young people, a demographic Democrats previously dominated, which helped him win the popular vote. 
But Kirk also appealed to some in the Republican base with his statements directed at minorities. He criticized LGBTQ rights, suggested more women should stay home and not work and criticized the Civil Rights Act of 1964, along with some of Martin Luther King Jr.’s work. 
Among Turning Point’s best-known projects was the “Professor Watchlist,” which published the names of college professors in a searchable format by categories including “anti-Christian views,” “feminism,” “climate alarmist” and “racial ideology.” 
Despite the controversies, many young conservatives, including UNL student Zoey Salem, credited Kirk for engaging students and encouraging them to speak freely.

“Even as a conservative, I didn’t agree with everything he said, but that wasn’t really the point of Charlie Kirk to me,” said Salem. “The point was that he was giving a platform to all people.”
Kallhoff, of the UNL Young Democrats, said he hopes that after Kirk’s assassination people can “come together and have civilized conversations” and understand that “we’re all trying to make the country better.” 
Creighton University students Emma Smith and Hannah Sobczyk said people need to stop hiding behind social media and start having face-to-face conversations again. At the end of the day, Sobczyk said, people need to respect that people have different political beliefs.
“We’re all people,” Smith said. 
Barton, the political scientist, said she hopes politicians will tone down the rhetoric used in response to Kirk’s death, because it “doesn’t do any good for trying to calm the tensions.”
“In the past, political elites, when you had incidents of political violence in this country, they would try to be more unifying,” Barton said. “Some … have responded by trying to weaponize this event.”
At UNL, Barnhouse said she is focused on honoring Kirk’s legacy.
“My life would look very different if it weren’t for Charlie Kirk,” Barnhouse said. 
Kallhoff said the next generation is tired of the political divide and government stagnation
“The only option is for it to get better,” Kallhoff said.

(Getty Images)As health insurance carriers change private plans for Medicare, Idaho officials are encouraging people to review their policies during open enrollment next month.
Open enrollment for Medicare — when people can change their insurance coverage — starts Oct. 15 and ends Dec. 7. But insurers have been changing, and even pulling out of, Medicare Advantage, which are private plans for the federal health insurance program for older Americans and people with disabilities.
“Consumers should use this annual Open Enrollment Period to compare plans, confirm that their doctors and prescriptions are covered, and seek free, objective help …” Idaho Department of Insurance Director Dean Cameron said in a statement. “Taking action early ensures uninterrupted coverage and continued access to quality care. Most importantly, consumers should know they are not alone — our team is ready to help every step of the way.”
He recommended several options to get help: directly from the Idaho Department of Insurance; through the agency’s program for Senior Health Insurance Benefit Advisors, also known as SHIBA; or from a local insurance agent. 
More than half of people eligible for Medicare are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, which tend to cover extra benefits than traditional Medicare. 
 How are Medicare Advantage plans changing?

Because of rising costs, less federal payments and new regulations, some insurers who offer Medicare Advantage Plans are reducing benefits, trimming provider networks and leaving some areas, the Department of Insurance announced in a news release last week. Last year, after many insurers pulled Medicare Advantage plans, more than a million patients needed to find new health insurance, Stateline reported. 
Idaho Department of Insurance officials expect plans to be withdrawn in 2026. But even if plans stay in Idaho, agency officials say benefits or provider networks could change. 
By Oct. 1, all people enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans should receive an explanation of any changes to their plan from the insurance carrier through a letter called an Annual Notice of Change.
Right now, seven insurance carriers offer Medicare Advantage plans in Idaho counties. 
If plans are canceled, people affected may be able to switch plans, through Medicare Advantage or traditional Medicare, if they qualify for a special enrollment period. 
 How can you get help on Medicare in Idaho?

In Idaho, contact the Department of Insurance’s SHIBA program for free assistance to help compare plans, answer questions, review coverage options, help with complaints and enroll in Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug plans.
To contact SHIBA or enroll in the program’s monthly Medicare webinar workshops, call 1-800-247-4422.

Finding caregivers to come to their home has been challenging, so Fabrello has learned to give the care that would ordinarily be performed by a doctor, skilled nurse, or highly trained therapist. (Aaron Marco/KFF Health News)Every day for nearly 18 years, Alessandra Fabrello has been a medical caregiver for her son, on top of being his mom.
“It is almost impossible to explain what it takes to keep a child alive who should be dead,” said Fabrello, whose son, Ysadore Maklakoff, experienced a rare brain condition called acute necrotizing encephalopathy at 9 months old.
Idaho cuts doctor pay rates for Medicaid. More cuts could come, Health and Welfare says.

Through North Carolina’s Medicaid program, Maklakoff qualifies for a large slate of medical care in the family’s home in Chapel Hill. Fabrello said she works with staffing agencies to arrange services. She also learned to give the care ordinarily performed by a doctor, skilled nurse, or highly trained therapist because she often can’t get help.
Now, broad cuts to North Carolina Medicaid will make finding and paying for care even more difficult.
Nationwide, states are scrambling to close budget shortfalls and are eyeing Medicaid, generally one of a state’s biggest costs — even before President Donald Trump’s hulking tax-and-spending law decreases federal spending on Medicaid by about $1 trillion over the next decade.
North Carolina and Idaho have already announced plans to cut Medicaid payments to health care providers, including hospitals, doctors and caregivers.
In Michigan and Pennsylvania — where lawmakers have yet to pass budgets this year — spending on Medicaid is part of those debates. In Washington state, lawmakers approved cuts to the program that will not affect who is eligible, said Hayden Mackley, a spokesperson for the state’s Office of Financial Management.
 What types of health services does Medicaid cover?

Medicaid is government health insurance for people with low incomes or disabilities and both state and federal dollars pay for the program.
North Carolina’s Medicaid agency announced it will institute on Oct. 1 a minimum 3% reduction in pay for all providers who treat Medicaid patients. Primary care doctors face an 8% cut and specialty doctors a 10% drop in payments, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
Fabrello said her son’s dentist already called to say the office will not accept Medicaid patients come November. Fabrello fears dental work will become another service her son qualifies for but can’t get because there aren’t enough providers who accept Medicaid coverage.
Occupational and speech therapy, nursing care, and respite care are all difficult or impossible to get, she said. In a good week, her son will get 50 hours of skilled nursing care out of the 112 hours he qualifies for.
“When you say, ‘We’re just cutting provider rates,’ you’re actually cutting access for him for all his needs,” Fabrello said.
Shannon Dowler, former chief medical officer for North Carolina Medicaid, said that reduced payments to dentists and other providers will lower the number of providers in the state’s Medicaid network and result in “an immediate loss of access to care, worse outcomes, and cause higher downstream costs.”
The imminent cuts in North Carolina “don’t have anything to do” with the new federal law that cuts Medicaid funding, Dowler said.
“This is like the layers of the onion,” she said. “We are hurting ourselves in North Carolina way ahead of the game, way before we need to do this.” North Carolina alone is projected to lose about $23 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over the next decade.
More than 3 million North Carolinians are enrolled in Medicaid. Deadlocked state lawmakers agreed to a mini budget in July to continue funding state programs that gave the Medicaid agency $319 million less than it requested. Lawmakers can choose to reinstate funding for Medicaid this fiscal year, Dowler said.
“We all hope it changes,” Dowler said, adding that if it does not, “you’re going to see practices dropping coverage of Medicaid members.”

Each year since at least 2019, North Carolina’s Medicaid agency has asked for more money than it received from the state legislature. A variety of federal resources, including money provided to states during the covid-19 pandemic, helped bridge the gap.
But those funds are gone this year, leaving the agency with a choice: Eliminate some optional parts of the program or force every provider that accepts the public insurance to take a pay cut. The state opted mostly for the latter.
“It’s a difficult moment for North Carolina,” said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid. The cut in the budget is “absolutely the opposite direction of where we really want to go, need to go, have been headed as a state.”
For Anita Case, who leads a small group of health clinics in North Carolina, the cuts make it harder to take care of the “most vulnerable in our community.”
Western North Carolina Community Health Services’ three clinics serve about 15,000 patients in and around Asheville, including many non-English-speaking tourism workers. Case said she will look at staffing, services, and contracts to find places to trim.
 Medicaid cuts in Idaho met with backlash from health providers, operators and advocacy groups

Idaho has about 350,000 people enrolled in Medicaid. This month, state leaders there responded to an $80 million state budget shortfall by cutting Medicaid pay rates 4% across the board.
The broad cuts have raised backlash from nursing home operators and patient advocacy groups. Leaders of one nursing home company wrote in a recent op-ed in the Idaho Statesman newspaper that 75% to 100% of the funding at their facilities comes from Medicaid and the cuts will force them to “to reduce staff or accept fewer residents.”
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said the state faced tough choices. It forecasted 19% growth in Medicaid spending this year.
The Idaho Hospital Association’s Toni Lawson said the financial strain will be greatest at about two dozen small hospitals — ones with 25 or fewer beds — that dot the state. Lawson, the organization’s chief advocacy officer, said one hospital leader reported they had less than two days’ cash on hand to make payroll. Others reported 30 days’ cash or less, she said.
“Hopefully, none of them will close,” Lawson said, adding that she expects labor and delivery and behavioral health units, which often lose money, to be the first to go because of this latest state reduction in payments. Several hospitals in mostly rural areas of the state closed their labor and delivery units last year, she said.
Nationwide, Medicaid makes up an average of 19% of a state’s general fund spending, second only to K-12 spending, said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies for the National Association of State Budget Officers.
States generally had strong revenue growth in 2021 and 2022 because of economic growth, which included federal aid to stimulate the economy. Revenue growth has since slowed, and some states have cut income and property taxes.
Meanwhile, spending on Medicaid, housing, education, and disaster response has increased, Sigritz said.

In North Carolina, Fabrello has been unable to work outside of caring for her son. Her savings are almost exhausted, Fabrello said, and she was on the brink of financial ruin until North Carolina began allowing parents to be compensated for caregiving duties. She’s received that income for about a year, she said. Without it, she worried about losing her home.
Now, if the state reductions go through, she faces a salary cut.
“As parents, we are indispensable lifelines to our children, and we are struggling to fight for our own survival on top of it,” Fabrello said.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for the Tennessee Lookout)Residents of Memphis are expecting to see a surge in federal and state law enforcement officers in their city as early as today to carry out President Donald Trump’s order for “large-scale saturation of besieged neighborhoods with law enforcement personnel.”
More than a dozen federal law enforcement agencies, an unspecified number of National Guard members and 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol officers will be part of a “sustained” presence to fight crime in one of the nation’s largest majority Black cities beginning this week, There is no specific end date to the operation, Gov. Bill Lee said Friday. 
National Guard troops will be deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service to support local law enforcement and will not be armed nor make arrests, Lee said.
The federal show of force includes immigration enforcement officers; the Tennessee Highway Patrol, under an agreement entered earlier this year, also has immigration enforcement powers.

Local faith leaders, community groups, elected officials and legal rights organizations opposed to hundreds of outside personnel authorized by the so-called Memphis Safe Task Force initiated a series of actions last week in response. 
On Saturday, protestors gathered separately in Memphis and at the state capitol in Nashville to formally launch the “Free the 901” campaign, a coalition formed by local and state nonprofit organizations after Trump issued his executive order Sept. 15 to “restore law and order” to Memphis.
The group has set up a text alert system and said it intends to provide training to residents and coordinate rapid volunteer response to law enforcement actions while advocating for policies to address root causes of violence.
Cardell Orrin, Tennessee director of Stand for Children, said the group’s goal is to find ways to “limit the harm” of the federal presence and identify and provide support to Memphians impacted. 
On Wednesday, the ACLU Tennessee sent a letter to Memphis Mayor Paul Young and Memphis Police Chief C.J. Davis detailing the city’s obligations to comply with a long-running consent decree that protects the First Amendment rights of Memphians.
The Kendrick Consent decree was enacted in 1978 in response to revelations that Memphis police had used a domestic intelligence unit to surveille and target civil rights leaders. The decree was updated in 2020 to include safeguards against police use of modern surveillance technology. 
The agreement between the ACLU and Memphis specifically bars cooperation by Memphis police with federal and state agencies in activities that violate First Amendment rights, including sharing information such as photographs, recordings and social media posts of individuals engaged in lawful protests, absent a legitimate law enforcement reason, according to Stella Yarbrough, ACLU-TN Legal Director 
“The Kendrick Consent Decree represents nearly five decades of protection for Memphis residents’ First Amendment rights,” she said.
Tennessee National Guard set for Memphis deployment next week

“Federal and National Guard involvement in local law enforcement doesn’t diminish these protections. In fact, it makes strict compliance more critical than ever. Memphis police cannot use federal coordination as a backdoor to conduct the very surveillance activities this decree was designed to prevent,” Yarbrough said. 
Memphis officials responded late last week with a request to a meeting with lawyers for the ACLU Tennessee, a spokesperson for the organization confirmed Friday. 
Some city officials in Memphis have also individually taken steps to prepare residents for a surge in law enforcement.
Shelby County General Sessions Clerk Tami Sawyer, who has expressed concerns about the potential impact of the law enforcement influx on already-overcrowded detention centers, issued a public “preventative maintenance checklist” for individuals to protect themselves. 
The list advises individuals to check for or clear outstanding warrants, memorize phone numbers of family or trusted friends and make an emergency plan for children and pets if detained.
Shelby County Commissioner Erica Sugarman, in Washington, DC last week, said she was also sharing information gleaned from advocates in the nation’s capitol after the National Guard deployment there.
Her deepest concern, Sugarman said, is “educating the people how to react and not to react,” particularly young people.

“We’ve got 12th graders who are driving around,” she said. “I want to make sure they know their headlights are working and understand their legal rights, that law enforcement isn’t the judge, jury and prosecutor.”
Appearing alongside the Tennessee governor last week, Memphis’s Democratic Mayor Paul Young, who previously said he had not asked for the federal presence, appeared more conciliatory. The mayor has noted that crime has fallen in Memphis by double digit percentage since January 2024. 
Not all Memphis leaders are opposed to the surge to fight crime in the city. Last week, a resolution to block the deployment and a resolution to set parameters, including a 90-day limit, on a federal law enforcement presence failed to pass at the Shelby County Commission.
“I know there are a lot of questions in our community. There’s a lot of feelings, passionate emotions, whether you’re for it or against it. But as the leader of our city, my goal is to make sure that as resources come into our community, we find ways to use them effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city,” Young said.
Last week, the city of Memphis launched a website to provide updates and information on the federal surge and provide residents with a contact number to lodge complaints. 
“This is our moment to show the world the truth about Memphis,” read a message from Young on the site. “We are a city that rises, a city that leads, and a city that defines itself not by challenges, but by our culture, innovation, and hope.”

Adrian Smith cruised to victory last year.,"Democrat Becky Stille is banking on her moderate approach. (Courtesy of Stille campaign)LINCOLN — Democrat Becky Stille is running for Congress against a 10-term incumbent House Republican in one of the nation’s most conservative districts. 
Nebraska’s 3rd Congressional District includes central and western Nebraska and much of the state’s northeastern and southeastern edges. The district is currently represented by U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith of Gering, who, as is typical in Nebraska’s reddest red district, faces a GOP challenger to his right. 
Stille, who lives in South Sioux City, said she decided to run after one of her farmer neighbors had to put up one of his plots of land for auction. While she doesn’t know precisely why that triggered her bid, she felt it “was enough.” 
Another reason, she said, is that she knows President Donald Trump’s budget and tax bill that passed earlier this summer will hurt friends and family members. Stille said she feels the district hasn’t had effective representation in D.C. for a “long time.”
The district currently has 268,246 registered Republicans compared to 70,368 registered Democrats. Including nonpartisans and third-party members, it has 418,138 eligible voters, according to the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office.

Stille says she considers herself a moderate Democrat. 
“I’m hoping that it’ll appeal to some of the Republicans … especially like the farmers that have had a bad taste in their mouth,” Stille said, pointing to the impact of Trump’s tariffs and trade disputes on agriculture. 
Stille’s top issues, according to her campaign website, range from supporting labor unions to securing the border and upholding the Second Amendment while having an “equally strong commitment to prevent violence” and  “support a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions privately with her own doctor.” 
She said she would listen to district constituents, which is something she argues Smith isn’t doing. 
The Smith campaign had no immediate comment on the Stille bid. Smith cruised to victory in 2024, winning by 61 percentage points against Democrat Dan Ebers. 
While traveling between work as an agricultural lab tech and campaigning, Stille says she is grateful for the help she is getting from the state party for her campaign. 
Stille acknowledges she is new to the inner workings of politics but said she hopes to help narrow the nation’s political divide. 
“Just because we have different opinions doesn’t mean we can’t work together to get things done,” Stille said.

(Photo: Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg)Livestock producers in nearly two-thirds of Tennessee counties who incurred extra feed costs in 2024 due to flooding brought by Hurricane Helene may be eligible for federal funding through the Emergency Livestock Relief Program.
The program, meant to help offset increased feed costs due to flood and wildfire disasters throughout the country in 2023 and 2024, is expected to pay out about $1 billion, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brook L. Rollins announced earlier this month.
Tennessee had no qualifying flood or fire events in 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency. But 59 Tennessee counties — including all of West Tennessee and multiple East Tennessee counties — are pre-determined as eligible for flood events in 2024.

Eligible livestock include beef and dairy cattle, buffalo, bison, beefalo (a bison-cattle hybrid), alpacas, llamas, deer, elk, reindeer, ostriches, emus, equine, goats and sheep.
Producers can receive up to 60% of three months of feed costs for a qualifying flood, according to the USDA. The program has a cap of $125,000 per producer for each program year, though. Producers who already received the maximum payment from the Emergency Livestock Relief Program for Drought and Wildfire, a program announced in May, are not eligible for additional flood relief payments.
The funding comes from the American Relief Act of 2025, which allotted about $940 million to flood and wildfire assistance. Should national demand for relief exceed that amount, the USDA will apply a “national payment factor” based on the number of eligible applicants, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.
Applications for assistance opened on Sept. 15 and will close on Oct. 31. Livestock producers in eligible counties are not required to submit supporting documentation for floods or wildfires. Producers outside of the counties identified by the FSA can apply for aid, but need to include documentation of a qualifying flood or wildfire in the county where livestock were kept, according to the USDA.
Cattle and calves are Tennessee’s number one agricultural commodity in terms of cash receipts, according to the USDA Tennessee Field Office.
Hurricane Helene dumped between 3 and 10 inches of rain in some areas of the state between Sept. 26 and Sept. 30, 2024, flooding some fields and interrupting the harvest. Floodwaters knocked out bridges and major infrastructure, most acutely in Northeast Tennessee.
“For livestock producers, the economic consequences were swift and severe,” the American Farm Bureau Federation stated in a Sept. 16 news release. “Transportation costs soared as washed-out infrastructure delayed feed shipments. Replacement feed was more expensive and harder to find, with crop failures adding to shortages.”
Tennessee Department of Agriculture representatives visited upper East Tennessee in June to survey ongoing recovery efforts. Hurricane Helene’s impact on Tennessee farmers and forestland owners is estimated at up to $1.8 billion, according to the state’s agriculture department.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)Families in Cass and Grand Forks counties may soon have different options for college courses for high school students. 
The State Board of Higher Education last week approved a policy change that allows high school students in those counties to take dual-credit courses — earning both high school and college credit — through the University of North Dakota and North Dakota State University. 
Students in Cass and Grand Forks counties had previously been required to take dual-credit classes through one of North Dakota’s smaller public colleges, with the college getting the tuition revenue. Those students could only take a dual-credit course from UND or NDSU if it was not offered at a smaller college. 
Leaders of those smaller colleges have resisted the change in part because of the tuition revenue they get from students taking introductory college courses while they are still in high school.
Those colleges include North Dakota State College of Science in Wahpeton, Valley City State University, Mayville State University and Lake Region State College in Devils Lake. 
North Dakota State College of Science President Rod Flanigan (Provided by North Dakota University System)
Rod Flanigan, president of North Dakota State College of Science, a two-year school, said the change could cost his school millions of dollars in revenue annually. 
The college in Wahpeton in Richland County has about 1,500 dual-credit students this semester, most of them from Cass County, the neighboring county to the north. 
“It will have an impact on us,” Flanigan told the State Board of Higher Education when it met Tuesday at Minot State University. “We will compete as best we can.”
Advocates for the change said the policy should be about choice for students, not the financial health of the small colleges. 
State Board of Higher Education member Curtis Biller said during a Sept. 4 committee meeting that if there are financial implications for the small colleges, “we can deal with it as we move forward.” 
It will be up to NDSU and UND to work with high schools on which courses to make available through dual credit. 
NDSU Provost David Bertolini said the university will reach out to high schools in Cass County to understand what the schools, parents and students want for dual-credit offerings. 
“We get requests from students who want to do dual credit with us, and historically, we have to say ‘no,’” Bertolini said in an interview. “From the perspective of what families and students might want for themselves, their hopes and dreams for college or whatever their careers might be, student choice is paramount.”
Board appoints former lieutenant governor to lead North Dakota University System

Historically, the university system has encouraged campuses to operate in their own region.
Another college that could be significantly impacted is Lake Region, which has about 250 dual credit students from nearby Grand Forks County, home to UND. 
UND President Andy Armacost said it would work with Lake Region to minimize the impact on the two-year school.   
“We need to sit down and figure out how this is going to work,” Armacost said at Tuesday’s meeting. He acknowledged that there would be pressure from Grand Forks residents who would prefer to use UND for dual credit over Lake Region. 
Carmen Simone, who was appointed Lake Region president earlier in the meeting after serving as interim over the summer, said the college would work with UND. “I’m not afraid of this change,” Simone said. 
How dual credit works 
Lisa Johnson, deputy commissioner for the North Dakota University System, said in an interview that students generally take a dual-credit course one of two ways — either in person within their  high school or as an online course. 
In-person classes at the high school are taught by a high school instructor who has the required credentials, such as a master’s degree and a certain number of college credit hours in the subject area. 
For online courses, Johnson said those are typically taught by a college instructor. She said that option, while more expensive, is popular in rural school districts that won’t have enough students to justify an in-person class. Students from several schools can be grouped together for an online class, which can still take place during regular school hours. 
The North Dakota University System has targeted dual-credit offerings to high-demand classes, such as English 101 and college algebra that can help fulfill general education requirements and are easily transferable through North Dakota’s colleges.

Johnson said earning college credit through NDSU or UND, the state’s two research colleges, would carry no more weight than through a smaller college, though that perception might exist. 
“I think the extent to which they no longer enroll in community colleges and four-year regionals and gravitate to research institutions remains to be seen,” she said. 
Johnson said a high school can partner with more than one college on dual-credit classes. 
If two colleges were offering the same course, Johnson said the high school would select which institution to partner with. 
Growth in dual credit
Johnson said dual credit has evolved over the decades. She said it started with the two-year colleges such as Lake Region and the State College of Science back in the 1980s. 
Four-year colleges eventually began offering dual credit courses, and online courses have greatly expanded dual-credit opportunities. 
“We actually have hundreds and hundreds of online courses,” Johnson said. 
Enrollment up nearly 4% at North Dakota public colleges, universities

Johnson said growth also was spurred when the state Legislature approved funding for a scholarship program in 2021. The scholarship provides $250 per course, up to three courses. 
“We really saw a marked increase in students participating in dual credit after the announcement of that dual credit scholarship,” Johnson said. 
There also is a program through the Bank of North Dakota to cover dual-credit tuition for families who qualify for free and reduced school meals. 
Johnson said a goal of Brent Sanford, who was just named the University System’s commissioner, to expand dual-credit offerings at high schools with career and technical education centers. 
High school students have other options for earning college credit. Under early entry, a high school can take a college course that may not count toward high school graduation. Students also can take advanced placement classes, which may provide college credit depending on the student’s score on a standardized test. 
Bertolini  said an average student coming to NDSU already has 12 college credits, typically through dual credit, and he expects that to keep growing.  
“It’s one way to lower college expenses, reduce your time to degree,” Bertolini said. “It also allows them, in an earlier framework, to figure out what they want to do for the rest of their lives.”

Propositions LL and MM were referred to the ballot by the Colorado General Assembly earlier this year. Together, they aim to shore up funding for the Healthy School Meals For All program, which was authorized by Colorado voters in 2022 but has exceeded cost projections in its first years of operation.
Without additional funding, program administrators have said they will have to take steps to restrict eligibility to only low-income students and schools. Additional efforts to purchase locally-grown produce, increase wages for cafeteria workers and offset federal food stamp cuts would also go without funding.

Keep Kids Fed Colorado, an issue committee registered in support of Propositions LL and MM, has reported $152,000 in contributions, mostly from the nonprofit Hunger Free Colorado. The campaign touts a long list of endorsements from organizations including Children’s Hospital Colorado, Great Education Colorado, Mi Familia Vota, Rocky Mountain Farmers Union and Save the Children Action Network.
 Proposition LL
Three years ago, Colorado voters approved a ballot measure to create the school meals program, which provides free breakfast and lunch to all students regardless of their family’s income level. It was funded by limiting income tax deductions for filers earning over $300,000 per year.
The program’s funding mechanism raised more than expected in the 2023-2024 fiscal year. Proposition LL would allow the state to keep the $12.4 million in excess revenue that would otherwise be returned to voters under the 1992 state constitutional amendment known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights.
That money has already been collected by the state. If Proposition LL is approved, the state would keep it and spend it on the school meals program.
If Proposition LL is rejected, the money would be refunded to Colorado households making at least $300,000 a year. Roughly 200,000 filers in Colorado, representing the richest 6% of households, would receive an average refund of $62.
 Proposition MM
While Healthy School Meals For All initially raised more revenue than projected, the program’s costs also exceeded projections, resulting in a budget gap that rose to roughly $50 million this year.
Proposition MM aims to permanently fund the full program by further limiting tax deductions for filers earning over $300,000 a year, raising an additional $95 million annually for the program. Households in that high-income category would pay an average of $486 more in income taxes yearly, according to nonpartisan state fiscal analysts.
The program’s budget gap has led to delays in implementing two supplementary programs that were also included in the 2022 ballot measure: grants for purchasing locally grown food from Colorado farmers and increased wages for cafeteria workers. If Proposition MM is approved, those provisions would be implemented.
During a special legislative session in August, Colorado lawmakers also tweaked Proposition MM to allow the additional revenue to be spent on broader efforts to reduce food insecurity, once the Healthy School Meals For All program’s costs are covered. That would help the state partially offset the impact — estimated at up to $170 million annually — of reduced funding and higher administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as a result of cuts passed by congressional Republicans in July.
 Colorado voting basics
Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold certified the 2025 ballot on Sept. 8. In addition to the two statewide measures, the coordinated 2025 election will see voters decide on numerous candidates and issues at the local level, including municipal elections in Aurora, Pueblo and Fort Collins, and school board races in Denver, Aurora, Douglas County and many other districts across the state.
Election Day is Nov. 4. Eligible Coloradans can register to vote or update their registration at GoVoteColorado.com.
Mail ballots will be sent to all active registered voters in Colorado beginning Oct. 10, and any eligible voter who registers to vote before Oct. 27 will receive a ballot in the mail. After Oct. 27, eligible voters can still register and vote in-person at a polling location until 7 p.m. on Election Day.
Voters who receive a mail ballot can return it through the mail, deposit it in a secure ballot drop box, or drop it off at an in-person polling location. Information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites.

(Photo courtesy of Executive Office of the Maryland Governor)COLUMBIA — Older teens and adults don’t need a prescription to get a COVID-19 vaccine in South Carolina, a state committee clarified this month.
The decision came days before a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel rejected a proposal that would have required anyone getting the vaccine first go to their doctor for a prescription.
The CDC committee still wants people to consult a health care provider about the vaccine’s risks and benefits. Following guidance for “shared clinical decision-making” could involve calling a primary care physician. People could also simply talk to the pharmacist on duty when they go get their shot, NPR reported.
However, the committee’s recommendations await formal approved by the acting CDC director.
South Carolina’s protocol for administering vaccines, updated by the Board of Medical Examiners during a Sept. 15 meeting, takes other medical groups’ recommendations into account. So, a change in CDC recommendations wouldn’t automatically change South Carolina protocol.
For children, the state board followed the American Academy of Pediatrics in recommending at least one dose of the vaccine for children older than 6 months.
It followed the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in recommending the vaccine for pregnant women.
State protocol calls for the vaccine to be available for all adults and recommends two booster shots for people 65 and older.
In South Carolina, children younger than 16 need a doctor’s note and parental permission to get the COVID-19 vaccine at a pharmacy. The same is true for most immunizations. An exception is the flu vaccine, as per state law.
However, confusion persists over who can get the vaccine. Despite the updated protocols from the Board of Medical Examiners, effective Sept. 17, whether a shot is available will depend on the pharmacy. CVS is offering COVID-19 shots at its South Carolina pharmacies without a prescription, a spokesman said. Walgreens is not, according to its website.
Part of that confusion may come from the CDC committee’s recommendations differing from U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
In August, the FDA approved a new round of COVID-19 vaccines, but limited eligibility for the updated shots to only those who are 65 or older, as well as younger people with high-risk health issues. While the FDA regulates vaccines, the CDC recommends how to use them.
Most insurance plans should cover the COVID-19 shot, though major pharmacies’ websites recommend double checking before coming in for an appointment.
Medicaid and Medicare will cover the cost of the vaccines, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Many private health insurance companies promised to keep all CDC-recommended vaccines free for people on their plans through the end of 2026, according to a statement from American Health Insurance Plans, which includes major health insurance providers.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/stkw5017-1-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 06:56:30.226729

(Photo courtesy of KNOE-TV)The monitor that had been tracking Mearl Hodge’s heartbeat started to show an abnormal rhythm. A technician at Glenwood Regional Medical Center in West Monroe, Louisiana, alerted nurses that the electrodes that should have been affixed to Hodge’s chest seemed to have popped loose. No one checked. It was a granddaughter, arriving for a visit 20 minutes later, who discovered that her grandmother no longer had a pulse.
The circumstance of Hodge’s death is among more than 650 documented instances of deficient care at nearly three dozen hospitals across eight states that were owned by Steward Health Care before the entire system collapsed last year in a spectacular bankruptcy. 
Hodge’s death, four days after she was admitted to Glenwood with COVID-19 in the winter of 2022, triggered an inquiry by the Louisiana Department of Health. Beyond the unattached heart monitor leads and the granddaughter’s discovery, state records from the investigation show the mask helping Hodge, 90, to breathe was sitting useless on her stomach. And though her medical chart made clear she wanted to be resuscitated in any emergency, the staff hadn’t tried, the records indicate.
For these mistakes, other state documents show, the health department fined Glenwood $1,750. What is uncommon about the case is that the hospital was fined at all. The scarcity of sanctions when some Steward facilities made even grave errors is part of a pattern in government regulation of America’s hospitals. 
Steward Health Care’s collapse has attracted considerable attention, largely depicted as an object lesson in the perils of for-profit hospital owners financed by private equity. However, a close examination of the Steward system points to a less obvious culprit: Across the country, oversight of hospitals by states and the federal government is inadequate – at times weakly enforced, at times absent.
This portrait of the feeble regulation of a troubled health system emerges from a new data analysis of Steward’s hospitals by the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank. The multi-prong analysis reveals substantial flaws in how states and the federal government oversee hospitals. 
On the one hand, main ways that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services require U.S. hospitals to publicly report on their finances and their quality failed to point to Steward’s deepening fragility. 
On the other hand, information that regulators do not routinely track makes clear that the company’s hospitals were increasingly in trouble. One is a roster of nearly 130 lawsuits that mounted as the bankruptcy neared, because vendors – from suppliers of medical devices to air-conditioning – went to court, alleging Steward neglected to pay its bills. The other is a growing pile of hospital deficiencies – flaws, including in Mearl Hodge’s care, of varying severity that states examined in response to complaints.
This combination – public data that didn’t show the problems, revealing trends that regulators didn’t watch – does not suggest that many hospitals across the nation are poised to fail. Evidence of whether for-profit hospitals have lower quality is mixed, though a small body of research into the more than 450 with private-equity financing indicates they tend to be more problem-prone. Still, the lax regulatory climate means that state and federal early warning systems for troubled hospitals are largely absent.
“We need to build some sentinels … to catch things before a crash happens,” said Jonathan Blum, who held senior roles at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the Biden and Obama administrations. 
In the meantime, certain hospitals and communities that rely on them can be vulnerable, especially as looming cuts to Medicaid and other federal health funds are widely predicted to erode the financial underpinnings of rural and other already-strapped hospitals. Some may hunt for new, deep-pocketed owners.
“Unless states dramatically increase their oversight, I would certainly expect more Stewards to happen,” said Erin Fuse Brown, a health law and policy specialist at the Brown University School of Public Health.
Prospect Medical Holdings, another private equity-affiliated system with 16 hospitals in four states declared bankruptcy in January. 
“I do not think it will be the last,” Fuse Brown said.
Steward’s rise and fall 
Massachusetts, a hub of academic medical centers, had never been home to a for-profit hospital backed by private equity – an arrangement that was gaining traction in U.S. health care in which investors look for large, often-quick profits outside the stock market. But a local Roman Catholic health system called Caritas Christi was faltering after a priest sex-abuse scandal financially drained the Archdiocese of Boston. Caritas began looking for a buyer, and Massachusetts officials joined the search. They were having little luck, especially finding one open to Caritas’s no-abortion policy and other Catholic values.

So, Massachusetts officials viewed it as good fortune when Ralph de la Torre, a prominent cardiac surgeon who recently had become Caritas’s chief executive, proposed what he said would be a new model of care. In 2010, the system affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management, an established private equity firm. They pledged to solidify Caritas’s pension system, strengthen its half-dozen hospitals and, for the first five years, be monitored by Massachusetts’ attorney general. The system would be renamed Steward Health Care. The attorney general and a judge approved the deal.
Though the fledgling system made some hospital improvements, Steward didn’t always adhere to the deal’s terms and, under de la Torre’s leadership, was aggressive from the start, health officials and other hospital executives recall. In 2011, the fledgling system took over four more Massachusetts hospitals and another in 2012. 
But Steward’s big growth spurt started in 2016, just after the monitoring ended, when it affiliated with Medical Properties Trust, a major real estate investment trust which is a type of company that pools money from many investors to buy and own income-producing real property. Medical Properties Trust bought all of the hospitals’ buildings and land in a “sale-leaseback,” offering cash in exchange for escalating rents. Steward, together with Medical Properties Trust and Cerberus, went on a buying spree. Less than a year later, it owned 36 hospitals in 10 states.
In none of the states into which Steward spread did regulators have a role reviewing the purchases, according to the Brookings analysis of health care “transaction” laws compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
In some of the states, such as Arizona, an attorney general reviews only sales of non-profit hospitals; Steward grew almost entirely by acquiring hospitals that already were for-profit. Other states, such as Florida, review sales of nursing homes, but not hospitals. Still others, such as Texas, do not oversee any health facility sales.
Financial troubles, staff and supply shortages and de la Torre’s spending on luxuries, including a $30 million yacht, eventually spilled into view. Steward sold seven hospitals in Ohio, Colorado and Utah. 
In January of last year, the Boston Globe broke the story of a 39-year-old woman who died of profuse bleeding from her liver the day after giving birth at Steward’s St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Boston; an unpaid vendor had repossessed common metal coils that doctors use to stem internal bleeding. In a statement to the Globe, Steward said it did its best to keep needed supplies on hand and noted that its surgical care had been “consistently recognized among the best in the nation and state by the likes of highly credible ratings organizations.”
Weeks after the Globe story, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said she wanted Steward, which had long balked at reporting financial information required there, to leave the state.
Less than three months later, in May, the whole Steward system filed for bankruptcy in Texas, where the company headquarters had moved several years before.  This summer, the remnants of Steward sued de la Torre, who resigned last fall, and three others, accusing them of “greed and bad faith misconduct” that had sunk the company. A spokeswoman for de la Torre, Rebecca Kral, said he “will vigorously defend himself” against the lawsuit. Lawyers for the former CEO have not yet filed a response to the suit in court. 
Attorneys for the Steward bankruptcy did not respond to repeated requests for comment. 
The bankruptcy set off a scramble for new owners of Steward’s by-then 31 hospitals. Amid protests, two in Massachusetts closed outright. Most of the company’s hospitals, including Glenwood and the others mentioned in this story, have new owners.
 The limits of government data 

Even as Steward’s layered troubles became more evident, main types of public data that federal health officials collect from hospitals – about their finances and their quality – didn’t reveal them.
Every hospital that treats patients on Medicare must give federal regulators an annual “cost report” containing assorted financial information. Brookings analyzed these reports, looking at operating profit margins and three other common financial indicators, comparing Steward hospitals against U.S. hospitals overall. 
Over the years, the analysis found, Steward’s hospitals looked similar on average to all U.S. hospitals through 2022, the most recent data available. However, audited financial statements for the whole Steward system, available in separate public records, show the company struggling from early on, the analysis found.
The discrepancies reflect that Steward shifted many expenses to the central office – a common practice among health systems that Steward took to an extreme, according to Steward and other health care experts. As a result, “It’s not a valid data set for analyzing the financial condition of the hospitals,” said Nancy Kane, a retired professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
A report last year by KFF, a health information nonprofit, on gaps in hospital financial information noted that the data submitted in cost reports for individual hospitals is not standardized or rigorously scrutinized – and doesn’t reflect the financial condition of their parent health systems. Kane said Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service uses the cost reports to help ensure that Medicare is paying hospitals correctly, not to monitor their financial health.
Meanwhile, of the 10 states where Steward operated, seven require hospitals to report at least some financial data and make it publicly available, according to a canvas of state transparency laws. But just three – Colorado, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania – say they currently analyze the data for hospitals’ expenditures or financial condition.
The Brookings analysis, focused on information reported to Medicare about the Steward hospitals’ quality of care, found that, like the financial data, these quality measures failed to reveal the actual trouble occurring at many of the facilities. Looking at Medicare’s Hospital Care Compare data, their average was little different than hospitals nationally on seven quality indicators, including serious complications, patients’ length of time in emergency rooms and readmissions.
Asked for a response to the findings, a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid spokesman, Alexx Pons, said “The agency does not comment on external analysis.”
In January, days before the Biden administration ended, federal officials issued a report on health industry consolidation, including hospitals such as Steward’s with private equity backing. The report by the departments of Health and Human Services and Justice and the Federal Trade Commission said the agencies had repeatedly heard complaints that “HHS should do more to improve the quality of the data” it collects about health facilities’ owners, prices, staff levels and patient care.
Steward’s collapse has helped prompt a few states to increase oversight of health care transactions, though most merely require notification to a state, not giving power to approve or reject a hospital sale. In January, Massachusetts passed a health care law that does not prevent private-equity firms from affiliating with health care companies but says hospitals may not be licensed if their main campus begins an affiliation with a real-estate investment trust, as Steward did.
Still, Fuse Brown, the health law and policy professor, said, “There’s no one state body or federal body that is sitting there and saying, ‘Things are going off the rails at this hospital.’”
A reason for the scant oversight is that “the points of leverage are health law, and health law is very narrow,” said Rosemary Batt, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, who has studied private equity in health care, including Steward. “There’s no law that says [hospitals] need to maintain their infrastructure,” Batt said. “There’s no law that says you can’t sell your land.”
Even as two important types of federal data – on hospitals’ finances and quality – didn’t warn of Steward’s troubles, other loud hints could have revealed the escalating crisis.
One of those hints, unwatched by regulators, lies in a soaring number of lawsuits by vendors, alleging Steward and its individual hospitals hadn’t paid bills for services, according to Brookings’ analysis, based on records in bankruptcy court and elsewhere. The cases add up to $139 million in allegedly unpaid bills. 
One small company, Eklund Refrigeration, sued Steward for $32,640 in March 2023, contending it had sent 37 invoices for air-conditioning service to two Arizona hospitals since it had last been paid in 2021. Seventeen months after the suit’s filing, Arizona health officials shut down one, a Phoenix psychiatric hospital, when the broken air conditioning caused the temperature inside to reach 99 degrees in the August heat.

In a number of the lawsuits, vendors were notified of the bankruptcy before their cases advanced. However, in one case, a lawsuit was filed in Massachusetts in February 2024 by OsteoRemedies, which provides medical supplies to support orthopedic surgery, alleging that Steward owed it about $176,500 for services provided in several of its hospitals in five states. In a court filing the following month, Steward lawyers denied every allegation and asked that the case be dismissed.
Instances of deficient care also were becoming more frequent. These are verified by state health department surveyors, who work on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid to investigate complaints from patients, families or employees. Altogether, hospitals owned by Steward had nearly 680 deficiencies, federal and state records show. They climbed from 13 in 2020 to 108 last year, about 3 ½ times as many deficiencies per hospital, on average, as in U.S. hospitals overall the year before. Federal health officials define three deficiency levels. The worst, “immediate jeopardy,” is a problem that caused death or easily could have.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are not empowered to fine hospitals for deficiencies – only to ban them from receiving payment for services. Such a ban would be draconian and rarely happens because depriving a hospital of revenue from the two huge public insurance programs would threaten its existence. More typically, federal health officials or state regulators warn hospitals that they face being dropped from the programs unless they correct deficiencies – and then accept the hospitals’ correction plans.
Of the five states, besides Louisiana, that marked any deficiencies in the worst category, Massachusetts has no system of hospital financial penalties. According to the Pennsylvania and Utah health departments, they prefer to nudge hospitals to improve and issued no fines in these cases, including a 2023 incident at a Salt Lake City hospital in which a patient who objected to her discharge died just afterwards at a frigid bus stop.
The Texas Health and Human Services Commission issued a fine, totaling $7,200, for just one of 21 “immediate jeopardy” deficiencies involving Steward hospitals, records show, after finding a malfunctioning emergency room call system, dirt and debris on food carts and other spots, and leaks through ceiling tiles. After listing these and other flaws, however, the state’s May 2024 notice told the hospital the fine “was not a demand for payment,” if it was in bankruptcy. By then, Steward was.
Trouble at Glenwood 
Glenwood, the company’s only Louisiana hospital, racked up 47 deficiencies after Steward bought it in 2017, including four designated “immediate jeopardy.” Patients had started avoiding the hospital, according to local officials and former employees. Unpaid bills prompted vendors to cut off supplies needed to insert pacemakers and perform endoscopies, state records show. A vendor cut off the coffee supply.
Louisiana law allows penalties against hospitals that violate standards. In the months before the bankruptcy, state records show, the health department levied two fines, for $5,000 and $7,000, and said Glenwood would be banned from Medicare if conditions didn’t improve. 
Mearl Hodge’s death came before those fines. Called Meme by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, her obituary would say, Hodge was born and lived her life in Farmerville, a town of about 30 miles northwest of West Monroe with a summertime watermelon festival. She loved to cook chicken and dressing and to share afternoon coffees with her friends and family, including her husband of 76 years. She prayed for her family daily.
As a one-time “class A” violation resulting in death or serious harm, and an “immediate jeopardy” deficiency, state law permitted up to a $2,500 penalty after Hodge’s death.
On May 31, 2022, the state health department fined Glenwood $1,750. Three months later, the department dispatched a second notice. The check Steward sent, the notice said, had bounced.

(Photo courtesy of First Choice Services)By the time Beth Roach reached out to West Virginia’s Problem Gambling Help Network last year, her gambling addiction had already cost her relationships, her job, her vehicle and her house. It nearly cost her her life. 
“I knew that I had two choices: I could either get help or I was going to end my life,” Roach said. 
When she messaged the 1-800-Gambler helpline, Roach was connected to counseling and other resources for her addiction. 
“I’ll never forget — I chatted in on a Friday afternoon and I saw my counselor on Saturday morning,” she said. “They got me in that quick.”
This year marks the 25th anniversary for the Problem Gambling Help Network, which runs the state’s 24-hour 1-800-Gambler helpline. The network is operated by First Choice Services and funded through the West Virginia Lottery.
Last year the program helped connect about 1,500 people with help for their gambling addiction, said Sheila Moran, marketing and communications director for First Choice Services.
“….Every state has a 1-800-Gambler,” Moran said. “What we do is a little different than other states — we have a pretty comprehensive treatment program.”
Helpline employees offer caller crisis counseling and connect them to an array of treatment services, ranging from podcasts, self-help books and apps, on up to more formal mental health help, Moran said. 
“Some people are ready for serious treatment, and so in that case, we link them with one of our counselors who are trained in treating gambling addiction, and we pay for that treatment,” she said. “And they can go up to 20 times to see them.”
The network also offers occasional retreats where people interested in gambling addiction recovery can gather in person for two days at a state park or another venue to connect with others and with treatment counselors. 
A retreat was where Roach’s treatment really took off, she said.
“[The retreat was] where I really started doing better in my recovery,” she said. “Because at that point, when I went to that retreat, I was just barely getting through every day.”
The network’s website has information and a quiz to help people determine whether their gambling is a problem. The best indication, Moran said, is if people continue to gamble even though it has negative consequences, she said.
“We’ll get calls from people who say, ‘how can I have a gambling problem? I’m well off. I’m wealthy.’ Well, it’s really not about the money,” she said. “If you keep gambling, even though your wife is mad at you and you’ve lost your job, that’s a problem. So that’s kind of a global definition of addiction.”
At least one in 50 West Virginians struggle with problem gambling, according to the network. 
Often, people will start with safer gambling — setting rules and limits for themselves. Then they’ll break those limits, lose money they never intended to, and start gambling more to make up for that loss, she said. 
“That’s when it first starts to cross over, when people go from recreational gambling to maybe problematic gambling, especially when they start seeing it as a way to make money,” she said. 
Roach started gambling in 2017 after visiting a casino. The casino became something for her and her husband, then empty nesters, to do on weekends. But the weekend trips turned into every weekend. 
Then, she’d go throughout the week and she started going on her own, spending more and more money. 
“I would say within four months, it had become a problem, and not to the point of the problem that it was when I stopped gambling,” Roach said. “But it was a problem because I was going more than just recreation. I was spending a little bit more, and it was just too much time… it was more of a time thing.”
In Roach’s case, a medication she was prescribed for restless leg syndrome has been linked to compulsive behavior, including gambling. She only learned of the connection afterwards in counseling.
The most common types of gambling have changed through the years, Moran said. When the network first started in 2000, most people were calling about slot machines, then video poker parlors, she said. Nowadays, callers are mostly betting online. 
In the last few years, the helpline’s call volume has doubled, mostly because of young men calling about online sports betting, she said. 
“We’re getting a whole lot of calls from young men who, frankly, I never thought would call us, because I thought, ‘Oh, they’re not going to call a helpline,’” Moran said. “I was wrong. So now they’re making up a lot of our calls.”
Last year the program had about 1,500 intakes, which are actually people seeking help for their gambling problem. She distinguishes between intakes and calls because a lot of callers are mistakenly trying to reach customer service for whatever gambling organization they’re using. 
The number of intakes is up from 1,200 last year, and has doubled in the last five years because of online gambling, she said.
“It’s not only more access but of course there’s a lot of advertising,” she said of online gambling. “Years ago, there was some stigma, maybe, attached to the idea of going to a casino and gambling. I think that’s completely gone now, especially among young folks. So we’ll just see more and more of them gambling on a regular basis.”
Moran said a significant number of calls — 20 or 30% — come from the loved ones of people struggling with a gambling addiction. Sometimes spouses will find out their wives or husbands have cashed the couple’s retirement funds, or taken out a second mortgage, or racked up a bunch of credit card debt without their knowledge. 
“You can imagine how upset they are when they call us,” Moran said. “And so a lot of what our counselors do is probably some marriage therapy in addition to gambling addiction therapy. But we can help them as well, because sometimes they need a bunch of emotional protection, but some solid steps to take to protect themselves financially. 
“So we have financial counseling available to them as well as the gambler,” she said. 
Short of the telltale signs of losing their homes and 401Ks, Moran said lying is one sign a person may have a problem with gambling addiction. But it can be very difficult to tell, she said. 
“If you are with someone, and they do gamble on a regular basis, it’s worth having a financial conversation and maybe even looking into some of these accounts, as far as where the money is going,” Moran said. “If someone’s deceptive about it, it can be very hard. They may be stealing money from work or embezzling or who knows what to get the money to gamble, and you may not be aware of it until you’re also in debt along with them.”
About a year into treatment, Roach, 52, is still working to get her life back on track. She attends a support group, meets with a sponsor and still gets counseling regularly. 
She now works as a helpline coordinator at the same helpline that helped pull her out of her addiction. 
“I tell [Program Director Maricel Bernardoall] the time, how thankful I am for her for taking a chance on me, because I’m still kind of early in my recovery. But it’s helped me,” Roach said. “I mean, I’ve put in work in other areas, but it helps me. It helps me just as much as I help others.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-29 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Without COVID waiver for licensure exams, teachers in ‘critical shortage areas’ are struggling again to get certified",By  Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/29/teachers-in-critical-shortage-areas-struggle-to-get-certified/,"Mississippi university education departments, school district officials and teachers are struggling to re-adjust to a more rigid path to teacher licensure.","Jennifer Allen has wanted to be a teacher since high school. She admired her social studies and English teachers especially. After four years studying elementary education at Delta State University and a full-time teaching position in a local district her senior year, she felt she had cleared all the important hurdles to becoming a certified teacher in Mississippi.

But then came PRAXIS, a series of tests that nearly every teacher in Mississippi must take to become a certified teacher. 
“It made me second guess a career that I fell in love with,” she said. “Much of what I learned over the four years of college is not in the practice material.”
She’s not alone. In roughly half of public and private universities with education programs, 50% or more of students do not pass at least one section of the PRAXIS exam on their first try.
Some students even opted for more classes at school to bypass having to take the test, which would mean an additional $1,200 for Allen.
Nearly a quarter of the 1,892 Mississippi test takers walked away after flunking on the first attempt of the most commonly taken PRAXIS Elementary Education exam from 2015 to 2018, leaving fewer teachers to fill a growing list of teacher vacancies in critical shortage areas.
The Board of Education implemented a waiver during the pandemic to allow students to be certified without taking the PRAXIS, but that waiver ended in December 2021. Students graduating as late as December 2023 took advantage of the waiver.
Now university education departments, school district officials and teachers are struggling to re-adjust to a more rigid path to teacher licensure.
“It’s outrageous that effective educators are dismissed by the profession for not passing PRAXIS,” said Clayton Barksdale, a former public school principal in Greenville and executive director of the West Mississippi Education Consortium. “Many prove their impact while on emergency licenses, only to be fired then immediately rehired as a long-term substitute – doing the same work for a fraction of the pay, with no benefits or retirement.”
“We must do better.”
Shortage areas

Didriquez Smith has taken the PRAXIS content test three times and spent nearly a thousand dollars. He coaches football at Clarksdale High School and teaches physical education on an emergency license.
He failed just one of the three tests in his past two attempts: Foundations of Reading, which covers reading comprehension and teaching reading.
The Praxis exam has several parts. The content knowledge test covers the subject aspiring teachers want to teach, like biology or elementary English. The Principles of Learning test covers how teachers should prepare lesson plans and approach classroom instruction for different subjects. Students who don’t have at least a 3.0 GPA must also take an Academic Skills for Educators test, which is also called PRAXIS Core.
Per try, the elementary education exam costs $209, and the PRAXIS core test $90. Some of the content tests such as art instruction cost $130.
Smith had to travel nearly 300 miles to Birmingham to take his third attempt at the test because the test wasn’t offered closer at the end of the school year. He is currently saving up enough money to take it again.
He loves his job, particularly informing his community about the importance of healthy habits. 
He hopes he can continue to keep students healthy and active at school. In the Mississippi Delta, the obesity rate among children is 29%.
However, if he can’t pass each required PRAXIS test in the next year, he may be out of a job. As much as his boss in the principal’s office may want to keep him in his role, state regulations penalize schools in their annual accountability scores if they have faculty teaching without a license. Schools can also lose accreditation.
Since childhood, Skylar Ball had planned on becoming a kindergarten teacher. She followed her mother into education, even attending the same alma mater of Blue Mountain Christian University. 
“Teaching elementary school is like Disney World,” she said. “Elementary students, you can do so much with them. You can make an early impact.”
However, one and a half years after graduation, she remains an assistant teacher, making several thousand less a month than she budgeted for while she saves enough money to take the PRAXIS exam for the third time. 
She was two questions shy of passing on her latest attempt.
“I was so blessed to educate 20 amazing kindergartners last school year under an emergency license … I am currently a paraprofessional in an amazing district, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t upset about not being able to lead a classroom of my own,” Ball said.
She struggled with the Elementary Education exam, a PRAXIS test with the lowest pass rate in the state. Although she was aiming to become a kindergarten English teacher, her test covered kindergarten through sixth grade instruction as well as science, math, art, English, and social studies, among other subjects.
In an analysis conducted by the National Teacher Quality Association, the nonprofit found that Mississippi’s Elementary Education content test has a subpar job measuring whether would-be teachers have the knowledge and skills needed for a career in their classrooms.
“Does this test tell districts if they are prepared to lead an elementary school classroom in this content area? It does not,” said Hannah Putman, managing director of research at the National Council of Teacher Quality.
The university’s role
Universities in Mississippi play an important role in filling teacher vacancies with fresh talent. Pass rates on PRAXIS exams vary among universities with Alcorn State University posting the lowest first-time pass rates, according to the most recent data from 2022-2023 school year. Mississippi Valley State University posted that none of its students took two of the three main PRAXIS exams for the same year.
This data has a smaller sample size of teachers as a majority gained licensure under the  COVID waiver.
Mississippi College posted the best results with over 93% of students passing the pedagogy section test and 100% of students passing both the content test and the Foundations of Reading test. Over 90% of University of Southern Mississippi students passed their three PRAXIS exams.

Timolin Howard, a Mississippi Valley State graduate, doesn’t regret enrolling in the school’s masters in teaching program. She believes instructors have given her the tools to succeed in the classroom.
After finding out her test scores were insufficient for licensure, she had a stroke. She also says she received mixed messaging from the state licensure board regarding cut-off scores.
“I found that, while I was well-prepared for real-world teaching, I wasn’t fully prepared for the demands of the certification exams,” she said.
She said she can manage students, build lesson plans and come up with classroom activities that help students master common core competencies. But Howard realized she had gaps in her foundational knowledge when it came to studying for the PRAXIS exams. She reached out to her school for help.
The university cancelled a workshop taught on campus, which was preparing students for the Foundations of Reading exam. It wasn’t the first a PRAXIS preparation workshop was cancelled, Howard said.
“It left me feeling overwhelmed as I tried to catch up, and it significantly impacted my confidence, academic performance and health,” she said.
This year, her Delta school district released her from her contract because she lacked the right licensure.
Mississippi Valley State University’s education department did not respond to comment despite repeated attempts to reach representatives.
Grow Your Own
For eight years, Adrienne Hudson has led the nonprofit organization RISE, which helps recruit and retain new teachers in Mississippi Delta school districts.
Hudson had already been informally mentoring and tutoring teachers who struggled with the PRAXIS exam and other technical aspects of licensure in her Clarksdale school. She founded RISE to help more.
Hudson takes pride in the start of performance-based licensure in her district. Letting teachers become certified teachers through improving test scores in state-tested subjects will help schools retain talented teachers, said Hudson of the new path to teacher certification.
“Some of the responsibilities are on the university and some are the systems that require the test to be the measuring stick for becoming a teacher,” she said. “We have students getting dean’s list, who can’t pass the test.”
More would-be teachers are going back to school later in life than ever before. Fewer teachers are entering the traditional route, which involves majoring in education as an undergraduate as opposed to the alternate route through a masters. In the 2018-2019 school year, 27% of students getting an education degree went the alternate route in 2022-2023, 45% did.
Tony Latiker, dean of Jackson State University’s school of education, saw a similar trend. He theorizes the reason so many students are going the alternative route is because of the many requirements that await undergraduates at the end of their four years. Alternative route students have fewer testing requirements to meet.
One solution he has found is to have traditional route students take exams closer to when they finish coursework that corresponds. For example, he encourages students to take the Foundations of Reading exam after they complete their early literacy courses, which are offered in some form at all Mississippi universities with an education program.
Jackson State also offers an elective that prepares students for the PRAXIS tests and other technical requirements of licensure. Professors and visiting instructors also host workshops on campus.
“We really should be questioning the exams,” Latiker told Mississippi Today. “I’m not against the exams and testing, but I’m against them being the high stakes tests they are. It should be a part of a more holistic process, incorporating district personnel and university faculty input in classrooms, assessing pre-service teachers and interns at the end of lessons, to see if they’re actually effective.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05170616/makeshift-ESL-classroom-Flowood.jpg,,,2025-09-29 06:56:30.226729

UofL athletics director Josh Heird told the Kentucky Lantern he has been in contact with NCAA President Charlie Baker about revisiting the Cardinals’ vacated title and been encouraged by indications the NCAA is open to reconciling inconsistencies in its penalty structure.
The source of Heird’s newfound optimism are penalties imposed last month on the University of Michigan’s football program, which did not include any vacated victories despite scouting and signal-stealing violations far more likely to affect games than did the stripper scandal that invalidated Louisville’s title.

“I think the Michigan case is the first case where we can really point to the precedent and say we’ve been treated unfairly,” UofL’s Heird said. “You have an institution that actively put a scheme together to gain a competitive advantage by cheating, but they (the NCAA) didn’t take their championship banner away. That seems very unfair.”
The chair of the hearing panel in the Michigan case said no Wolverines victories, including the 2024 College Football Playoff championship, were vacated because NCAA rules preclude such penalties in cases where infractions did not result in athletes being ruled ineligible. 
“That was not a factor present in this case,” said the chair, attorney Norman Bay, in explaining the sanctions. “So it was not a penalty, in other words, that could be considered. And we did not impose it.”
Still, to the extent that distinction fails to account for the competitive impact of Michigan’s extensive and impermissible scouting and sign-stealing versus the sexual shenanigans in Louisville’s basketball dorm, the two cases reinforce long-standing complaints about the consistency of NCAA justice. 
Moreover, though the Committee on Infractions acknowledged a postseason ban was required in the Michigan case due to the severity of the infractions, the school’s lack of cooperation and its repeat offender status, a financial penalty was substituted for that sanction because “a postseason ban would unfairly penalize student-athletes for the actions of coaches and staff who are no longer associated with the Michigan football program.”
“Ultimately, Michigan was accused of some pretty egregious violations,” said attorney Jason Setchen, who has represented numerous athletes in NCAA cases, notably former Louisville basketball recruit Brian Bowen. “And what was different about (Michigan’s) violations was there were a lot of allegations about on-field advantages. It has been argued by some that it affected their getting to the championship game and winning it.
“I don’t believe that those were the same allegations in the Louisville case.”
Though Baker, the NCAA president, initially insisted, “No one believes at this point that Michigan didn’t win the national title fair and square,”  the Committee on Infractions found evidence of 52 games involving future opponents Michigan had improperly scouted and concluded those efforts “likely provided a competitive advantage” and that “the true scope and scale of the scheme – including the competitive advantage it conferred – will never be known due to individuals’ intentional destruction of materials and information.”

By contrast, Louisville loyalists have long argued that providing strippers and prostitutes to players and recruits (many of them underage) was clearly tawdry but not tactical; that it had no bearing on basketball games and provided no discernible recruiting advantage. 
“They had strippers in the dorm room,” Heird said. “From a morality standpoint, all those things, not a good look. From an extra benefits standpoint, from directly impacting a game, irrelevant. So you’re going to tell me that a program can devise a plan to actively find ways to get a competitive advantage and that’s not going to be punished as much as what we were?”
The NCAA did not respond to multiple interview requests for Baker or another executive to speak to UofL’s concerns. In response to an open records request for recent correspondence related to the vacated 2013 title, Sherri Pawson, UofL’s senior compliance officer, reported, “We have not identified any responsive records.”
Given the disparity in punishments between Michigan and Louisville and the open wound UofL’s vacated title represents to many Cardinal fans, the lack of a formal response to the Michigan sanctions more than a month later was curious. Heird explained that he prefers to make his case by telephone rather than by creating a paper trail and, more importantly, that his calls have found a receptive ear in Baker.
“I think the leadership of the NCAA right now is very reasonable,” he said. “I think they understand that college athletics has changed dramatically. And so, do I think there’s an opening? Yes, I do.”
An NCAA panel denied Louisville’s appeal of its 2017 sanctions on Feb. 20, 2018, which would normally be the last word on the subject. Yet NCAA bylaw 19.14.4 allows any institution or involved individual to initiate a review by submitting a brief to the Committee on Infractions hearing panel. The NCAA manual makes no mention of a statute of limitations regarding this approach.
Litigation is also an option. Three years after the NCAA vacated 112 of Penn State’s football victories among its sanctions for the Jerry Sandusky sex scandal, a lawsuit filed by Joe Paterno’s family led to a settlement that restored Paterno’s status as major college football’s winningest coach.
When it last did battle in an NCAA infractions case, U of L spared few expenses, paying star attorney Neal Katyal $2,465 per hour to successfully defend the university against allegations concerning Brian Bowen’s recruitment. Heird is reluctant to take Louisville’s case to court, however, fearful that doing so might result in retribution that limits the city’s opportunities to host major NCAA events such as last year’s women’s volleyball finals and the 2027 men’s basketball first and second rounds at the KFC Yum Center. 
“Let’s ask the appropriate questions before we get into full – I guess I’ll call it ‘Whatever It Takes’ mode,’ ” Heird said. “I’ve never been an advocate of we’ll just sue our way to getting what we want. It doesn’t feel like that’s the right way to go. I want to have all of the appropriate conversations and see if we can get to a place where we can all agree.”

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)A Philadelphia man’s conviction for openly carrying a gun has led Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court to reexamine a state law that treats firearm owners in the state’s largest city differently than in other parts of the commonwealth.
To carry a gun in Philadelphia, a person must have a concealed carry license, regardless of whether they carry it openly or not. That’s not a requirement in the state’s 66 other counties, where it’s legal to carry a gun without a permit as long as it’s plainly visible.
Listen to Peter and Emily’s audio recap here: 

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/29epphUFA-web-audio.mp3
 
Lawyers for Zaire Livingston have argued the state Uniform Firearms Act’s exception for Philadelphia violates the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions. 
Livingstone was arrested after Philadelphia police saw him selling drugs to another person in a dark alley. He was charged with drug possession and possession with intent to distribute. He was also charged with violating the Uniform Firearms Act because he had a handgun tucked in his waistband. He pleaded guilty to drug possession and the gun charge.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A panel of three Superior Court judges rejected that argument in Livingston’s initial appeal last December, upholding his convictions on other grounds. But scarcely six months later, a different three-judge panel reached the opposite conclusion in another case from Philadelphia.
Police arrested Riyaadh Sumpter after officers spotted him walking on a street with the grip of a handgun visibly protruding from his waistband. He was charged with and convicted of violating Section 6108 of the Uniform Firearms Act.
On appeal, the panel found the law unconstitutional on an equal protection basis, because it places people in Philadelphia at a “special disadvantage in the exercise of their Second Amendment right.” Prosecutors failed to show a compelling interest that was served by the restriction that would justify the infringement of Sumpter’s right to bear arms, the decision said.
The disagreement within the Superior Court, the commonwealth’s frontline appeals court, would be reason enough for the Supreme Court to review the cases, Craig Storrs, executive director of Pennsylvania Gun Rights, said. 
But he and Adam Garber, executive director of CeaseFirePA, said there has been a wave of litigation around the country in the wake of U.S. Supreme Court decisions that limited the scope of tougher gun laws in recent years.
“This is the court saying we’re taking a much closer look at these gun control laws and these carve outs, these special exemptions, we have,” Storrs said.
The Uniform Firearms Act has been on the books since 1972 and the restriction on openly carrying guns in Philadelphia has not been successfully challenged, Garber said.
And although the U.S. Supreme Court has issued two major opinions in the last 20 years that struck down state-level restrictions on gun ownership, Garber noted the justices have taken pains to make clear that they didn’t open the door to invalidate all local gun safety efforts.
Most recently in 2022, when a 6-3 majority struck down New York’s law requiring people applying for handgun permits to show a special need to defend themselves, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the decision would not bar states from imposing objective requirements for gun licensing.
In his concurring opinion, Kavanaugh cited the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s opinion in the court’s 2008 decision striking down the District of Columbia’s ban on handgun ownership.
“Maybe they’re trying to say there are reasonable restrictions under the Constitution and they’re thinking it’s time to define them properly,” Garber said.

The Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office, led by District Attorney Larry Krasner, is in the position of defending the state law in the appeal, but Garber noted it’s possible the city itself could join in support of the law. 
A spokesperson for Krasner said in a statement that unlicensed open carrying of firearms in public should be a violation in every Pennsylvania county.
“This matter could be resolved by new legislation, rather than the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, if Republicans in the state legislature applied violations of [Section 6108 of the Uniform Firearms Act] to all counties across the state rather than unjustly singling out Philadelphia,” Krasner said.
While the state House is set to pass a suite of bills to tighten Pennsylvania gun laws this week, they don’t include an expansion of the concealed carry licence requirement to cover open carry. And in past sessions, when the GOP controlled both chambers, efforts to eliminate the concealed carry permit requirement altogether made it to former Gov. Tom Wolf’s desk, only to be vetoed.
In the Livingston case now before the state Supreme Court, the justices limited the question to whether the license requirement in Philadelphia violates Article 1 of the state constitution and the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, both of which guarantee equal protection under the law.
In upholding Livingston’s conviction, the Superior Court judges said they were bound by a 2014 decision of the Superior Court that found the right of people in Philadelphia to openly carry firearms on the street without a license was not fundamental. Controlling the “staggeringly disproportionate” incidence of gun violence in Philadelphia was a legitimate state interest that justifies any infringement on rights, the court said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0843-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-29 05:56:26.837228

It sits idle in a mostly low-income, historic part of town whose prosperous edges are dotted with expensive, modern apartments and homes.

Not too far from the empty Walgreen’s, the former Heritage Square Shopping Center is also idle. All stores are shuttered. The former retail center is surrounded by chain-linked fencing, wrapped tight even as potential customers fill hundreds of new apartments and condos nearby.
Residents in the area depended on the eclectic Food World and a Family Dollar store that operated in the shopping center.  When they closed more than a year ago along with the drug store, it created an improbable food desert near a part of Durham that has experienced unrivaled growth and unprecedented prosperity.  The store closures combined with federal cuts to safety net programs to ensure low income, elderly people don’t go hungry, has local organizations looking for community solutions to keep them fed.
At the 79-unit Veranda at Whitted School on East Umstead Street, the aging residents felt the loss of the stores immediately. The senior housing facility is in a repurposed school that once served Durham’s black children. It’s a short walk from the Walgreens and the shopping center. Now, the closest grocery store is a mile away, a Compare Foods on University Drive. The next closest option is a Food Lion on Fayetteville Street, nearly two miles away.
Both are long hikes for seniors, many of who do not own cars and some who use walkers. For some tenants, catching a city bus can present a challenge.
This month, The Integral Group, the Atlanta-based developer and owner of the Veranda at Whitted School, partnered with the Durham Housing Authority, CenterWell Primary Care Anywhere and Feed My Sheep of Durham Inc., to create an onsite food pantry to keep residents from having to “choose between a lengthy bus ride and a healthy meal.”

“We have some seniors who have more energy than you and me, but we do have some seniors who don’t drive, that have health conditions and the easier we can make things for them, the better,” Kimberly Williams, a project adviser for the Integral Group, told a reporter on a recent visit.
The food pantry is also a response to federal budget cuts that might impact tenants’ ability to feed themselves, Williams said.
“Even if some people might not need the food now, at some point they might,” Williams said. “With all of the cuts that are happening with food stamps and Medicaid and possibly SSI [Supplemental Security Income] benefits, I just want them [tenants] to know that it’s [food] available.”
Meals on Wheels and other agencies deliver food to tenants, Williams said, but those meals are perishable and sometimes go bad before tenants can finish them. It’s good to have the food pantry as an option to help sustain residents through the month, she said.
Williams got the idea for the food pantry after seeing a Facebook post about a pantry at J.J. Henderson Towers, a senior housing community operated by Durham Housing Authority.

“At some point, I want to do it [provide food] for the entire community, where if someone off the street needs food, we would set up something on a Saturday in that circle [in front of the building] and allow people to eat,” Williams said. “This world is getting tough.”
Williams is still working out the details about how food will be distributed with Feed My Sheep of Durham, but tenants told NC Newsline that they welcome the  food pantry.
‘We help each other’
“Oh, it means a lot,” said long-time tenant Regina Royster when asked about the pantry. “I’ve seen people and you can tell they need a little something [food] here and there and we help each other.”
The pantry is in an small room that wasn’t being used. Several shelving units are filled with cereal, pasta, dried beans and various canned goods. A refrigerator in the corner is nearly empty except for a few bottles of Gatorade and two cases of Ensure that a tenant donated during a reporter’s tour of the pantry.
“When I get my nourishments from the VA [Veterans Administration], they can kind of go overboard sometimes,” said James Mitchell, 72, an Army veteran. “This [the pantry] gives me an opportunity to share it with the residents.”

Mitchell has lived in the Veranda at Whitted School since it opened in 2017, and believes the apartment he occupies was his science classroom when he attended the school in the 1960s. He has a car and can travel to grocery stores but said some of his neighbors cannot.
“It [the closing of the stores] created an inconvenience for most people in my age bracket because we now have to travel,” Mitchell said. “We have some who don’t have transportation and some who do and we have to travel further out.”
Senior hunger a growing problem
Food insecurity among senior citizens is a growing concern for many organizations, particularly as the U.S. population aged 65 and older grows rapidly. The growth is driven by the the Baby Boomer generation. According to Population Reference Bureau, the number of Americans age 65 and older is projected to increase to 82 million by 2050.  There are currently more than 61 million people in the U.S. aged 65 or older, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
As the population ages, they will need more health care services and assistance for government agencies and nonprofits that provide food and other necessities to help sustain them.
Amy Akroyd, director of development and communications for Meals on Wheels Wake County, noted that a report released by Feeding America a few years ago found that the Raleigh metropolitan area ranked high among the nation’s other metropolitan areas for senior hunger.
“So, we know that the constituency that we serve has certainly seen an increase in that need because of the way that things are going right now with food prices increasing, with fuel prices increasing,” Akroyd said. “Everyone’s just stretching their budgets to meet a greater and greater need every day.”

Meals on Wheels is 50% funded by the federal government. Program operators across the country were disappointed there was no funding increase to meet growing demand, Akroyd said.
“We were fortunate in that we were continued to be funded, but it was flat funded, so that extra push that we really needed to continue to meet the growing need is not quite there anymore,” Akroyd said. “We’re relying on our private community of donors, volunteers, supporters to continue to make sure that we can pay for the meals that are so desperately needed by our seniors.”
Determining the extent of hunger in America could become more difficult in the wake of a Trump administration decision to end the federal government’s annual report on hunger in America.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently announced that it is terminating future Household Food Security Reports, calling them “redundant, costly, politicized” that do “nothing more than fear monger.”
The 2024 report is scheduled for release Oct. 22. It will be the last under the Trump administration.
The decision to halt the annual hunger report follows the passage of the Trump administration tax cut and spending bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimates will kick 3 million people off of food stamps, which is also known as SNAP benefits.
“When you look at some of the things that are being cut in terms of certain entitlement  programs, SNAP has been cut, Medicare, Medicaid, they’re [seniors] are facing some tough choices,” Akroyd said. “Those are all services that our seniors rely on, so the less services that seniors have in their own day-to-day lives the more they’re going to find a need [for food] that we’re going to hopefully be able to fill.”

Green International Airport has been on display in the terminal since its opening in 1996. Renovation plans mean it will soon have to leave its spot near the baggage claim. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)One of the first sights to greet travelers waiting to collect their bags at Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport is a symbol for the Ocean State: A fully rigged sailboat, its hull and sails sporting the names of regional maritime companies.
Welcoming travelers is a replica of a Whitbread 30, a mainstay near the baggage claim exit since the terminal named for former Gov. Bruce Sundlun opened in 1996. Getting the boat inside the building during construction was hardly smooth sailing.
“We had to get it in there before they put the doors on,” recalled Tom Rich, former co-owner of New England Boatworks, now Safe Harbor New England Boatworks, in Portsmouth, which built the model. “To get it through the frame, we had to turn it on a 45-degree angle and then had to refinish it inside because it got scratched up coming through.”
Never meant to be seaworthy, the Whitbread is purely decorative. The same goes for a public art installation that for more than two decades has been a fixture at the gate entryway after passing through the airport’s security checkpoint. Titled “Islands,” it consists of two sets of laminated wooden arches in a ribcage shape, adorned by rows of wire-mounted acrylic pods that resemble mussels, petals, or lacquered fingernails.
But now “Islands” and the Whitbread must be moved in order to make way for a $64 million renovation planned at the Warwick airport. So too will a small, Depression-era dinghy built by one of the state’s historic shipwrights and installed underneath the replica sailboat. 
Only the dinghy will survive the move.
Letting go
Public art has a tendency to fade away, said Peter Stempel, the artist behind “Islands,” in a recent phone interview. So he never expected his art to live in T.F. Green forever.  
“Even incredibly famous artists like [Alexander] Calder and Picasso, their pieces get moved,” Stempel said. “Things have a way of either getting put into a back hallway or an odd corner, or disappearing.”
Stempel’s overhead, cresting sculptures have blue pods on one variation, and red on the other. From a distance, their shapes gather like a tiny grove of trees on the horizon. Since being installed in 2002, three years after the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts (RISCA) awarded Stempel the $99,000 commission, “Islands” has provided a canopy and rendezvous point for travelers. Stempel said he often heard people say of the work, “That’s where I meet up with my family.”
“Islands” is scheduled to sink out of public view once renovations begin, as the walls near the artwork are going to be demolished. 
“I think the fact that that space has not been renovated in over 20 years is pretty remarkable,” Stempel said. “So it was always a possibility…There are very few buildings that change as much as airports.”
Boatmaker Rich, meanwhile, said his understanding had always been that the boat replica would forever be a part of the terminal. 
“People come to Rhode Island and think it’s an impressive thing — it kind of says who we are,” he said. “I don’t know how they’d get that thing out of there, I guess they could just cut it up.”
A 60-foot-tall water feature is going to be installed near baggage claim, right where the information desk and the Whitbread and a 13-foot “Amphicraft” dinghy next to it  are on display.
Other plans call for new flooring to replace the existing carpet in the atrium, new ticket counters and seating, and lighting intended to “create a sense of place,” according to a July 11 memo from airport CEO Iftikhar Ahmad to Rhode Island Airport Corporation’s board of directors. Terminal renovations are set to be completed by late 2027.
The idea, Ahmad wrote, is to build upon other cosmetic upgrades and amenities added to the airport in recent years, such as $10 million marble-lined bathrooms, automated coffee machines, new restaurants and colossal welcome signs off Interstate 95.
“I’m fully committed to transforming this place,” Ahmad told reporters after a recent board meeting.
The boat will likely need to be relocated, airport spokesperson Bill Fischer said in an emailed statement. But where exactly it will go is still up in the air.
“Discussions related to the sailboat’s future remain ongoing,” Fischer said. “Once material submittals from the contractor come back to us for review, we will have more details on the final aesthetic.”
The overall goal of the renovations, Fischer said, is to borrow aesthetics from notable buildings in Newport and Providence.
Ahmad told reporters the decorative sailboat could be relocated, but it’s not a top priority for airport officials.
“There is no compulsion for us to do this right now,” he said. “Maybe we just see things differently as to what’s important to us.”

The last of the Herreshoffs
The Whitbread is just for show, but the Amphicraft dinghy constructed in the 1930s by the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company — the Bristol boatbuilder that dominated the state’s marine industry from the 1870s through the 1940s — can sail the sea.
You wouldn’t immediately know from looking at the small Depression-era craft tucked behind the welcome desk, but it’s an important piece of sailing history, said Bill Lynn, president of the Herreshoff Marine Museum in Bristol.
“It’s sort of the first shot at a boat you could actually tow behind your car and take somewhere, set it up, throw it in the water,” Lynn explained. “It’s a pretty cool little boat — it’s this kind of LEGO kit.”
The Amphicraft dinghy is also extremely rare. Only 15 were ever made, according to the museum.
There actually used to be three Herreshoff boats within the terminal, Lynn said.
The first to leave the terminal was a 15-foot wooden racing boat commissioned by the Watch Hill Yacht Club in Westerly during the early 1920s. It was pulled from the terminal by the museum in order to get refurbished for its 100th birthday at the yacht club, Lynn said. Airport officials never asked for it back.
“Now it’s parked in Connecticut waiting for what happens next,” Lynn said.
Then in May, Lynn said he was informed by airport officials he would need to move a steam launch built in 1902 and originally commissioned by railroad tycoon Henry Clay Pierce to make way for the planned renovations.
That boat has since returned to the museum on Bristol’s Burnside Street. Lynn said he remains hopeful all Herreshoffs can come back to the terminal.
“We’re sort of twiddling our thumbs waiting to find out whether we can bring any of these boats back,” he said. “I sort of worry that’s not going to happen, which would be too bad.”

Out of the airport, into memory
The state arts council voted unanimously on Sept. 15 to OK the removal of Stempel’s “Islands” so the airport corporation can carry out its plans. 
Stempel, now an associate professor of landscape architecture at Penn State University, was a Rhode Island School of Design graduate living and working in Providence in 1998 when he won the approval of a RISCA panel charged with choosing artworks to accompany T.F. Green’s gate expansion. State law dictates that at least 1% of funding be devoted toward public artworks for state-invested capital projects whose budgets exceed $250,000.  
According to Providence Journal coverage from 1998, Stempel’s sculpture — whose shapes reference “grape arbors…[and] shaded patios” and “upside-down boats” — was chosen by a 6-4 vote over a set of eight hanging shell-shaped sculptures. The panel debated its final choice at length, with some finding Stempel’s sculpture overly bold. 
“Those colors are just too shocking,” one RISCA board member lamented at the time.










I’m fully committed to transforming this place.


– Rhode Island Airport Corporation CEO Iftikhar Ahmad


The artwork is site-specific, meaning it was designed and fabricated to accommodate the precise location where it would be installed. The airport’s challenge to Stempel was to fill the slots atop a wall that had once been occupied by planters, but staff found upkeep of the live plants too demanding, Stempel said.
“They also didn’t want you to disrupt the advertising that was in the terminal — part of the terminal revenue,” Stempel said. “These are all the things that public artists deal with all the time.”
Stempel eventually noticed the “lens of space” between the install site and the surrounding advertising. A canopy, he decided, could elegantly fill the space and look sufficiently different from the ads that it couldn’t be mistaken for one. So Stempel installed the colorful arcs and bulbs from 2 to 5 a.m. on a morning in 2002, when post-Sept. 11 security measures were still fresh. 
“Every single piece of it went through a metal detector,” Stempel recalled. 
Stempel wonders how many people saw his sculpture over the years, although he estimates it’s a “tremendous number” given the high foot traffic in the area. The artist praised RISCA for its commitment to public art and said that “Islands” formed a milestone in his career.
“The difference between doing a $20,000 sculpture and doing a $100,000 sculpture in those years was incredibly significant,” Stempel said. “It’s really what allowed me to transition to being much more professional.”
But Stempel does not want the sculpture back as a “souvenir.” After RISCA informed him of the deaccession, Stempel waived his contractual right of recovery to the state-owned “Islands.” 
His preference is that the work would be destroyed. “It’s really very difficult to recover it in a meaningful way,” he said.
The removal process can begin once renovation permits have been obtained. 
“With site specific artwork such as ‘Islands,’ this typically means deconstructing and disposing of the artwork outside of public view so the public memory of the piece as a complete artwork is maintained,” Todd Trebour, RISCA’s executive director wrote in a Sept. 23 email.
“Remove it and demolish it with dignity,” Stempel said. “And then it will go into memory and history.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The University of Kentucky’s demographic data paints a stark picture of Eastern Kentucky’s future. Letcher, Knott, Perry, and Harlan counties are among the fastest shrinking in Appalachia. Across the border in Virginia, Buchanan County is projected to lose nearly half its population by 2050, but the pattern in Kentucky’s coal counties is identical: Young people leave, older residents remain, and the math no longer supports schools, clinics, or small businesses. 
As one observer put it, “There are more hearses headed to the cemetery than moving vans pulling into the driveway.”
Yet buried in the demographic projections was a crucial caveat: Their forecasts could prove “too dire if people start moving into the region.” In other words, decline is not destiny. The question is how to reverse the exodus and transform Eastern Kentucky from a region people leave into one they choose to call home.
Recent floods underscore the urgency. In July 2022, torrential rain killed 45 people and forced families from their homes in Knott, Breathitt, and Perry counties — part of a pattern of repeated disasters that make rebuilding in the hollows increasingly untenable. Despite billions of dollars in federal investment since the 1960s, from highways to retraining programs, the region continues bleeding people and opportunity.
A Homestead Act for Eastern Kentucky

The problem runs deeper than jobs. It’s about land — who controls it, where homes can safely be built, and whether working families have secure, affordable ground beneath their feet.
A framework already in place
For years, I’ve advocated for a modern Homestead Act for Central Appalachia — not as nostalgia for the Homestead Act of 1862 but as a practical strategy built on existing legal and institutional frameworks. The tools for transformative land reform already exist; what’s missing is the political will to coordinate them at scale.
Kentucky passed land bank legislation that allows localities to create public land banks that can acquire tax-delinquent or abandoned properties and prepare them for productive reuse. Louisville has already pioneered one of the nation’s largest and most active land banks, demonstrating how city governments can move neglected properties back into productive use. 
Community Land Trusts (CLTs), pioneered in Georgia and operating successfully in rural Tennessee since the 1970s, keep land affordable while preventing speculation. 
Federal brownfields law shields new property owners from environmental liability when proper cleanup protocols are followed. Most importantly, billions in federal funding for mine reclamation, infrastructure development, and climate-resilient housing are already flowing through existing programs.
The legal infrastructure exists. The funding mechanisms are operational. What we need now is a comprehensive implementation plan.
The blueprint: 3 million acres across Appalachia
Here’s how a regional Homestead Act could work in practice, focusing initially on Eastern Kentucky while coordinating with similar efforts across the broader Appalachian coalfields.
A federal-state partnership administered through the Appalachian Regional Commission would target three categories of property for acquisition. Thousands of acres of reclaimed surface-mined land, already reforested under federal reclamation requirements, could be developed for housing, renewable energy or agroforestry systems.  Secondly, corporate-owned undisturbed land, much of it controlled by coal and timber companies, includes rich soils and abundant water resources; with companies facing bankruptcy or divestment pressures, prime tracts could be secured at below-market prices. 
Finally, underused federal holdings such as portions of national forests could be designated for homestead development, especially on higher ground suitable for climate-resilient communities.
Initial capitalization of $100 million from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act would support land acquisition, supplemented by state contributions and private partnerships. Funding could be raised through several methods. Strategic auctions at bankruptcy sales of distressed coal company assets would allow large tracts to be secured cheaply by government agencies and conservation groups. Negotiated sales with struggling corporations could provide tax benefits and structured payments in exchange for below-market land transfers. Land swaps would allow governments to trade less desirable holdings for prime private land needed for homestead development. Green bonds, issued by states or municipalities and backed by federal guarantees, would finance large-scale land acquisition and infrastructure expansion.

The program would offer 10- to 40-acre plots to eligible participants at nominal cost, in some cases as little as $100 to $500 per acre for reclaimed mining land, with higher prices for greenfield properties. To encourage long-term settlement, families would receive 10-year property tax exemptions, giving them time to establish farms and businesses before local taxes phased in.
 Development incentives would include relocation grants, low-interest loans for housing and agriculture, and five-year income tax exemptions for those committing to stay a decade or more. Each community would also be guaranteed modern infrastructure: improved roads, stormwater management and reliable broadband access.
If divided conservatively into 30-acre parcels, Kentucky’s potential 1.3 million acres could support over 43,000 homesteads — enough to stabilize population decline and lay the foundation for renewal.
Eligibility and priority systems
Three categories of participants would be eligible for the homestead program. The first would be families already living in Appalachia but seeking safer, more affordable housing or land for small-scale farming and business development. The second would be returning members of the Appalachian diaspora who left the region for work but could now return thanks to remote employment and homestead incentives. The third would be newcomers from outside Appalachia prepared to commit long-term to farming, renewable energy, health care education, or small business.
Priority would be given to applicants who pledge at least 15 years of residency, to families with children who would stabilize rural schools, and to those with agricultural or entrepreneurial skills most likely to contribute to long-term community development.
Infrastructure as foundation
Modern homesteading requires 21st century infrastructure. Every homestead community would be developed above the 100-year floodplain, ensuring safety while saving taxpayers from repeated disaster recovery costs. High-ground development would be paired with advanced stormwater systems using retention ponds, permeable surfaces, and native landscaping.
 Universal broadband would connect each home with fiber-optic service capable of supporting remote work, online learning and e-commerce. Cooperative service networks, rooted in Appalachian traditions of mutual aid, would allow communities to pool resources for equipment, purchasing, marketing, child care, and elder care — lowering costs and strengthening resilience.
Economic development through land use
Economic growth would be driven by land use tailored to the region’s landscape.
 Specialty agriculture such as orchards and vineyards could revive Eastern Kentucky’s fruit-growing heritage and expand into grape production for wine and juice. Agroforestry systems would combine tree crops with pasture, providing multiple income streams while restoring ecosystems. Controlled-environment agriculture — greenhouses and high vertical structures — would allow year-round vegetable and herb production. Non-timber forest products, from ginseng to mushrooms, could build on traditional mountain practices. 
Carbon forestry, replanting blight-resistant chestnuts and native hardwoods, would generate steady revenue through carbon credit markets. Value-added processing in food plants, sawmills and craft workshops would ensure local producers capture more of the wealth they create. Finally, tourism and recreation — from farm stays to outdoor adventure — would capitalize on the region’s natural beauty and cultural heritage.
Governance through democratic land trusts
Community land trusts would be the foundation of governance. Families would own their homes and improvements, but the trust would retain ownership of the land to prevent speculation. Resale formulas would ensure housing remained affordable across generations, while community assemblies would make decisions on infrastructure, land use, and cooperative ventures.
The role of educational institutions
Kentucky’s universities and colleges must serve as technical assistance and training hubs. The University of Kentucky and Eastern Kentucky University could lead mine land reclamation, agriculture, and engineering. Berea College could provide civic, cultural and organizational leadership, consistent with its historic mission to serve Appalachia. Together, they would create a research and training network to support homesteaders.
Learning from precedent
Gov. Andy Beshear’s response to Eastern Kentucky’s devastating 2022 floods demonstrates climate-resilient relocation in practice. Eight new high-ground communities are being built across the coalfields, including the Skyview neighborhood in Hazard. “We cannot keep putting people back in the same places and expect a different outcome,” Beshear said at one groundbreaking.

This model — relocating families to safer ground while building modern infrastructure — could be replicated across Appalachia. Other examples, from Valmeyer, Illinois, to Scotland’s Isle of Eigg, show how coordinated relocation and community ownership can create vibrant new settlements.
Economic impact and fiscal benefits
A comprehensive homestead program would generate significant economic activity throughout Eastern Kentucky. Initial infrastructure development — roads, broadband, water systems and housing — would create thousands of construction jobs in the first decade. Using conservative estimates of $150,000 per homestead for housing and infrastructure, 43,000 Kentucky homesteads would generate over $6 billion in construction activity.
Small business development would follow. If half of all homesteads created enterprises averaging $25,000 annually, that would represent more than $500 million in new economic activity. The property tax base would expand as reclaimed land bought for $500 an acre and improved with housing, barns and orchards reached assessed values of $3,000 to $5,000 per acre within a decade. Meanwhile, stronger employment and population growth would reduce demands on social services, stabilizing schools, clinics, and local governments.
Implementation timeline
The program would roll out in phases. Pilot projects in two or three Eastern Kentucky counties during the first two years would establish proof of concept. Regional expansion in years three through five would scale the model to thousands of homesteads. Full implementation in a decade would integrate Kentucky’s coalfields into a broader multi-state homestead strategy.
Monitoring and accountability
A modern homestead initiative must be accountable. Annual monitoring would measure job creation, business formation, income growth and rising property values. Demographic trends such as school enrollment, age distribution and family formation would show whether the program is attracting and retaining young residents. Environmental monitoring would track soil restoration, water quality, biodiversity and carbon sequestration to ensure development improves rather than degrades ecosystems. 
Community development indicators — participation in cooperatives, civic organizations and cultural programs — would reveal whether homesteads are building stronger, more resilient communities.
Beyond economic development: proving ground for democracy
The homestead program’s value extends beyond economics. By returning land and decision-making power to families, it strengthens the democratic foundations of rural life. It offers a path to renewal based on ownership, responsibility and cooperation.
Conclusion: from decline to renewal
Decline is not destiny if people start moving back to the region. A modern Homestead Act provides the framework, incentives, and community structures to make that migration not just possible but attractive.
The total new investment dollars I am proposing are small compared to the amounts the country has spent on other relief projects. The Appalachian Regional Commission’s designation of Central Appalachia is 60 mainly coalfield counties in four states: Southwest Virginia, Southern West Virginia, Eastern Kentucky and Eastern Tennessee. The 2020 census showed a population of 1,852,312 but declining. 
ARC designates 80% of those 60 counties as economically “distressed” out of the 118 distressed counties in all of Appalachia. Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the U.S. spent $120.5 billion restoring New Orleans and the Gulf region. The total population there was 1.4 million. The total benefit to the nation in restoring the Appalachian coalfields far outweighs the projected costs.
The tools exist. The funding streams are available. The communities are ready. What’s needed now is the political will to coordinate these resources at the scale the challenge demands.
Eastern Kentucky stands at a crossroads. One path leads to continued decline, aging communities and economic stagnation. The other leads to renewal, sustainable prosperity, and communities that can weather any storm.
The choice is ours. The time is now. The land is waiting.

Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery (left), faces a rematch with Democrat Lily Franklin in the 41st House of Delegates District. (Photos courtesy of campaigns)Two years after a nail-biting finish, Democrat Lily Franklin and Del. Chris Obenshain, the Republican incumbent, are locked in a rematch in Virginia’s House of Delegates District 41 — a contest that could again turn on handfuls of ballots in a district that blends the university-anchored towns of Blacksburg and Christiansburg with more rural and suburban precincts of Roanoke and Montgomery counties. In 2023, Obenshain edged Franklin by just 183 votes.
As the campaign intensifies, both candidates cast themselves as uniquely suited to serve a district in flux — Franklin promising generational change and connection to working-class struggles, Obenshain touting continuity, legislative experience and a record of concrete wins. 
House District 41 is one of the state’s more demographically dynamic districts. It has a comparatively low median age, a substantial proportion of renter-occupied housing, and a mix of precincts that swing between college-town and exurban voters. The district also leans slightly toward competitive balance in recent elections — a swing seat more often than not — making it a bellwether for broader trends in Southwest Virginia politics.
According to data from the Virginia Public Access Project, money underscores the high stakes of this year’s election cycle. Obenshain had raised $490,440 through Aug. 31 and booked $782,602 in political ads set to run through the week of Nov. 3. 
Franklin had raised $893,914 and booked $573,599 in ads for the same period. VPAP also ranks Franklin among the top five Democratic House fundraisers as of the Aug. 31 reporting period. 
 Lily Franklin

A former teacher and legislative aide who grew up in a five-generation Southwest Virginia family, Franklin, 31, pitches herself as the candidate most closely tied to the district’s daily realities. 
“I’ve had lived experiences that are very similar to folks in this district. … I worked multiple jobs to make ends meet,” she said in a recent phone interview, adding that having lived paycheck to paycheck shapes how she approaches policy. Her campaign biography highlights work for Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, and a political science degree from Longwood University.
After losing by fewer than 200 votes in 2023, Franklin said her operation this cycle started earlier and is broader. 
“We’ve been talking to folks on the ground and knocking on doors since April. We have been connecting with students on campus all year round,” she said. What’s different, in her view, is an electorate “ready for new leadership and a change,” and a campaign that offers a future “we’re fighting for, not just voting against another candidate.”
Franklin’s read on the district is pointedly non-ideological. “People want their elected officials to deliver on everyday solutions, they just want their lives to be less chaotic. … ‘I just need my electric bill to be 20% less.’” 
That message is calibrated for a district she says is among the youngest in the state — with a median age of 29 — but also includes rural and suburban neighborhoods. 
“I connect deeply on the community values that unite us,” she said, adding that she’s felt the region’s housing crunch personally after being priced out of Blacksburg into Christiansburg.
On housing, Franklin backs a mix of renter relief and ownership incentives — a state tax credit for renters spending more than 30% of income on housing, stronger legal protections against unjust evictions, and public-private partnerships to help first-time buyers. 
She also favors curbing large-scale investor purchases.
“We should be banning hedge funds from buying out our homes and really trying to incentivize people who live here locally to take a little bit more ownership,” Franklin said. That position tracks with a growing debate in Richmond over investor activity in tight markets such as Blacksburg, where Virginia Tech enrollment has strained supply.
Transportation is another pillar of the Democrat’s campaign. 
Franklin said much of the Interstate 81 work through the New River and Roanoke valleys is underway and should be “wrapped up” as planned. She supports the Christiansburg Amtrak station as an economic catalyst and doesn’t approve of adding tolls, arguing Virginia should prioritize existing surplus dollars before new fees. 
Franklin’s economic blueprint leans on translating Virginia Tech’s research strength into local jobs: targeted incentives for firms that spin out of campus, stronger workforce training and a caution that budget cuts can reverberate through already fragile regional employers. 
On data centers, she favors local control over siting, with regional coordination on shared resources like the electric grid — a question Montgomery County leaders have pressed in recent months. 
On public education, Franklin argues Virginia’s funding formula is outdated and should be refocused on student needs. She supports raising teacher pay and incentives for hard-to-staff divisions and says the state’s surplus shows Virginia has a “priorities” problem, not a revenue problem.
Franklin draws a sharp contrast on reproductive rights, pledging to vote for the constitutional amendment to protect reproductive freedom, including access to contraception and IVF. She links the policy to access challenges on the ground, noting a “year-long wait list to see an OBGYN” in Montgomery County. The proposed amendment is expected to go before voters after clearing two successive General Assembly sessions.
On guns, Franklin frames her position as “Second Amendment, with safeguards,” backing safe-storage standards, background checks and restrictions for domestic-violence offenders — measures that have polled well in a range of Virginia communities.
Franklin also made campaign-finance reform part of her closing argument, promising an opening-day bill to ban donations from public service corporations and to create a faster, state-backed disaster-relief/resilience fund after storms — citing long waits for federal help after Hurricane Helene. 
Her bottom line: With Democrats favored to gain ground this year, HD-41 should send a member “within the majority party” who knows “how to pass legislation and get money back to the district.”
 Chris Obenshain

Obenshain, 47, counters with a record-and-relationships pitch. A Montgomery County prosecutor and Army Reserve officer who grew up in Roanoke County, he won the open seat in 2023 and says constituent service and concrete wins define his first term. His campaign biography cites stints in local, state and federal roles and deep family ties in the region.
In a phone interview with The Mercury, the Republican pointed first to passenger rail as one of his most significant accomplishments during his first term. 
“Getting passenger rail back to the New River Valley for the first time in decades” — with trains slated to roll into Christiansburg “very soon” — was a top promise, he said, crediting coordination across “local, state, (and) federal” partners. 
Obenshain called his locality a “very balanced … competitive district” and said that’s why “an experienced and effective voice” matters. Day to day, he said, the job is listening and solving problems — from unemployment benefits to paving requests — and coming prepared when session moves fast.
On housing, Obenshain said the state’s role is to speed supply by reducing “excess mandates and regulations that drive up the cost of housing,” and to help localities move projects “through the pipeline” faster because “time is money.” 
He also supports “guardrails” on large outside investors who buy and hold local homes, arguing the state should ensure first responders and new graduates can afford to live where they work.
I-81 remains his marquee infrastructure focus. Obenshain emphasized that he helped secure an extra $70 million in the budget to accelerate projects and wants to prioritize widening the backup-plagued stretch between Christiansburg and Salem, with expanded passenger rail also relieving pressure. He favors continuing to steer surplus dollars into the corridor rather than relying on tolls or new revenue until current plans are funded.
Obenshain leans heavily into workforce development to tie Virginia Tech innovation to jobs — expanding apprenticeships and career and technical education, with earlier exposure in K-12. 
He praised a new Career and Technical Education Center in Roanoke and growing offerings in Montgomery County, adding that community colleges are vital “to meet the jobs of the future.”
Like Franklin, he said data center siting should be a local decision, with regional collaboration on water and electricity but “no state veto from another part of Virginia.” On education policy, he backs “parents’ rights” and education savings accounts to broaden school choice, while emphasizing that “it’s always a team effort” with teachers.
On abortion, he opposes the constitutional amendment, arguing it would “overturn decades of existing law, require taxpayers to fund even elective abortions up to 40 weeks” and undo parental-consent rules — claims Democrats dispute. 
But he also renewed his support of exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother and said voters should scrutinize what the amendment would actually do. 
On gun policy, Obenshain said enforcement should target violent offenders and repeat gun crimes, not “law-abiding gun owners,” noting Democrats didn’t docket his bill to increase penalties for using a firearm in a violent felony. 
Environmental stewardship, he said, is about enforcing existing laws to protect places like the New River, McAfee Knob and the Appalachian Trail.
Obenshain touted two bipartisan proposals as examples for his willingness to work with lawmakers from across the aisle: He backed a regulated retail cannabis market, where he said public-safety concerns unite both parties, and anti-Semitic threat legislation he introduced that a Democrat carried and the governor signed.
His closing argument centers on continuity. “I’ve been an effective voice for Southwest Virginia, reducing costs on energy, healthcare and housing, fighting costly mandates, and investing in public education and public safety. … I hope people see the progress that’s being made and my passion for continuing that work.”

(Photo by Evan Visconti/Virginia Mercury) Approximately 60% of Virginia is located inside the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and those communities now have access to an updated map that shows precisely how their landscapes are changing over time. 
The Chesapeake Bay Program’s land use and land cover change mapping project compares the landscape across three different snapshots in time, offering a detailed view of the watershed up to as recently as 2021. 
The research shows Virginia has lost nearly 50,000 acres of tree canopy in its portion of the watershed to development over just seven years. 
The publically-available mapping project “empowers people with information that they can use to make longer term and more sustainable land-use decisions,” said Peter Claggett, research geographer with the U.S. Geological Survey and lead for the Chesapeake Bay Program land data team. 
“Overall, it enables you, down to a community level, to identify opportunities for restoration and conservation and for everyone to gain a perspective about how their community is changing over time,” Claggett said. 
The most significant change to the landscape between 2014 and 2021 that researchers hope to highlight with the data was a rapid loss of tree canopy and forests due to human development. 
Tree cover status and change fact sheets were created as part of the project to provide  county or municipality-level analysis of tree canopy and a summary of the local benefits those trees provide. 
Experts quantified several of the benefits trees provide with a tool called iTree Landscape, which estimates how much air pollution, stormwater runoff and carbon are removed from the environment by the trees in communities. 
The estimates provide a more concrete way for people to understand what tree canopy is worth, because “talking about acres of tree canopy between time periods is a little abstract in some ways,” said Elliott Kurtz, geospatial data engineer for the Chesapeake Conservancy’s Conservation Innovation Center, a contributor to the mapping project.
The iTree estimates show that “we’re not just doing this to protect the trees for the trees’ own sake; this is also providing real benefits to people in the community,” said Kurtz. 
In addition to the watershed-wide mapping project, the Virginia Department of Forestry (DOF) is currently working on creating its own map as part of a 2024 General Assembly bill that requires the agency to create a “Forestland and Urban Tree Canopy Conservation Plan” for the entire state by November 2026. 
The statewide data mapping project will compare how the landscape has changed between 2018 and 2023 through the use of aerial imagery and DOF’s “boots on the ground” knowledge of every timber harvest operation in the Commonwealth, Johnson said. 
This will ideally provide an even more accurate look at how Virginia’s landscape is changing, and identify precisely which tree canopy losses are temporary as a result of rotational timber harvests and which are permanent as a result of development. 
“The concern from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation is that when the land use changes completely to something other than forest, pasture or agriculture, then you lose the infiltration ability of the land,” said Ann Jurczyk, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s Virginia manager of urban restoration. 
“Generally, that’s when you have increased storm water runoff and increased heat and the other things that are detrimental to both the people and the critters that live in the Bay,” Jurczyk said. 
Claggett said one of the major benefits of landscape mapping is that it allows communities to zoom in or out and ask, “‘are we on a trajectory that we want to continue, or are we headed to become a place that we don’t want to become?’”
 Emerging threats to tree canopy

The watershed as a whole lost just over 100,000 acres of tree cover to development over the seven-year course of the study so far, with nearly half of those losses occurring in Virginia, according to data from the project. 
Researchers also analyzed losses of what they termed forested extent. These are lands that not only contained tree canopy with an unmanaged, natural understory when the images were taken, but also lands that were in the early stages of regenerating back into natural forest after being logged prior to imaging. 
Taking these lands into account, data shows the watershed as a whole lost about 177,000 acres of forested extent to development, with Virginia contributing a loss of over 70,000 acres.

The research uncovered several emerging threats to tree canopy in Virginia, which include the construction of utility scale solar arrays, warehouses, road expansions and electrical transmission lines. 
Landscape changes like these are considered permanent, whereas harvesting land for timber and then allowing it to regenerate, an industry that statewide adds over $20 billion to Virginia’s economy annually, is viewed as a temporary change to tree canopy and the forest structure.
Virginia’s portion of the watershed is seeing more development as a result of its emerging land uses, “and it’s very much along these sort of growth corridors from D.C. southward to Richmond and then from Richmond east to Hampton Roads,” said Jurczyk. “We’re growing by leaps and bounds; Charlottesville, Staunton, Harrisonburg all lost tree canopy as well.”
The timing of the mapping project allowed researchers to capture “the initiation of utility scale solar in the region,” said Claggett. The growing source of energy has major implications on how communities are making use of their land, particularly in Virginia where 54% of all solar panels that the project mapped throughout the watershed were found.
Between 2014 and 2018, the project mapped just over 600 acres of solar panel arrays in the Commonwealth. Then between 2018 and 2021, that number jumped to over 3,200 acres of solar panel arrays mapped.
“Unlike other states, in Virginia for the first time period, 74% of (land containing solar arrays) came from forested extent, and the second time period saw 68% come from forested extent,” Claggett said.
These percentages signify yet another competing land use in Virginia’s forestlands.
“Ideally, we’d like to see solar on reclaimed mine lands, on rooftops, on landfills, on land that can’t be used for agriculture or forestry,” Claggett said.  
The biggest solar operations currently in Virginia were installed shortly after the 2021 mapping imagery was captured. Claggett said he expects the next round of imagery to pick up between roughly 10,000 to 15,000 more acres of solar arrays in Virginia. 
The next update to the Chesapeake Bay Program’s land cover mapping project will analyze imagery from 2025 and 2026. Researchers expect to publish that data before 2029.
 A closer look at our streams 

The project also released new high-resolution hydrography data, or mapping of how water moves throughout the landscape, to provide the most comprehensive inventory of the watershed’s stream and ditch network to date, according to researchers.
Without updated mapping, if streams are modified or buried over, then we “lose track of how the landscape drains,” said Matt Baker, professor of geography and environmental systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. 
The hydrography data has the ability to pick up tiny streams and channels that exist in the headwaters of large rivers that eventually drain into the Chesapeake Bay. 
“It’s quite important for us to know about them in our mapping efforts because they are conduits for both the water, nutrients and other pollutants that might move across the landscape,” said Baker. “So in the context of the Chesapeake Bay Program, it’s really important to understand where the water is flowing and what it might be carrying on its way to the Bay.”
Mapping waterways improves researchers’ understanding of where aquatic habitats may exist and what is restricting the natural movements and migration of different species.

Possible blockades such as culverts, the drainage pipes beneath roads and other infrastructure, can create a barrier to threatened migratory species such as river herring and American shad that depend on making it upstream to spawn.
Updated mapping also allows researchers to identify streams that are missing from existing maps but could be providing aquatic habitat.

“We’re finding this data shows a lot more streams that hold fish populations,” especially for species found in the colder headwater streams that the research homed in on, said Mike Evans, deputy director of the Chesapeake Conservancy Conservation Innovation Center. 
 Community tree planting efforts

Despite the significant loss of tree canopy and forested extent to development, communities throughout the watershed still managed to plant a historic number of trees. 
“I know there is some discussion of loss, but we also have hit record numbers of new trees in the ground,” said Lara Johnson, the Virginia Department of Forestry’s urban and community forestry program manager. 
In 2024, there were about 5,700 acres of community trees planted throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the highest total reported since tracking began in 2014, according to community tree planting data compiled by the Chesapeake Bay Program.
“We’re so proud of our partner Bay states and also all of our partners in Virginia,” said Johnson, highlighting several of the “grassroots” community planting programs that DOF supports.

The Virginia Trees for Clean Water Grant Program is available to communities looking to fund tree-planting efforts that raise public awareness of the benefits of trees and their impacts on water quality. The Throwing Shade VA Program provides a discount on native trees purchased from a Virginia nursery. 
“Both of those programs have planted more than 70,000 trees just last year in Virginia,”  Johnson said. 
Riparian buffers, a major contributor to the overall health of the Chesapeake Bay, are strips of forest that border waterways and act as a natural filter to remove pollutants from runoff before they enter a stream or river. 
The Riparian Forests for Landowners (RFFL) program is unique in that it “establishes buffers on landscapes that we probably wouldn’t typically be able to,” said Patti Nylander, the Virginia Department of Forestry’s watershed program coordinator. 
The program is open to small, private landowners, a demographic which normally misses out on riparian buffer funding that typically targets large agricultural lands. The program has already added 110 acres of riparian forest buffer in Virginia, said Nylander.
The James River Buffer Program is also making progress on riparian buffer planting. Since its launch in 2019, the collaboration has installed about 1,300 acres of riparian buffer, equal to over 400,000 native trees.

In addition to planting new trees, Jurczyk said communities need to “put more emphasis on preservation of existing tree canopy and less emphasis on what we replace.” 
“Part of that is just understanding at the locality level just how hamstrung we are on enforcing tree canopy replacement,” said Jurczyk. 
In Virginia, localities can only require that up to 10% of trees be replaced after removal for developing a commercial or industrial site and 20% or 30%, depending on the district, be replaced after removal for developing a residential site. 
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has argued year after year that the replacement percentage should be “a floor, not a ceiling” on the amount of trees that a locality can require to be replaced after removal for a development, said Jurczyk.
Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, was chief patron of a bill in this year’s General Assembly session that would have given localities statewide the option to enforce higher tree canopy replacement percentages that are currently available only to Planning District 8 in Northeastern Virginia. 
After approval by both the House and Senate, Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed the bill.
“The current law on tree canopy ordinances strikes a balance between the ability of a locality to hinder residential and commercial development with increased costs and the ability of a locality to preserve tree canopy,” Youngkin wrote in his veto statement.

(Photo courtesy of Kenda Sutton-El/Birth in Color)Seven years ago, Congress’ Preventing Maternal Deaths Act was signed into law by President Donald Trump — but the funding it provides to states to address maternal health disparities is set to expire at the end of this month. This year, its renewal was left out of Trump’s budget proposal. 
While competing priorities are at play as Congress deliberates continuing resolutions to avoid a government shutdown by Oct. 1., the funding has bolstered data collection that informs policies to help prevent pregnancy-related deaths in Virginia and nationwide. 
Dubbed the Enhancing Reviews and Surveillance to Eliminate Maternal Mortality, or ERASE MM, nearly $90 million has gone towards state committees around the country that review maternal deaths and analyze the causes. The committees’ findings have helped spur protocols aimed at preventing hemorrhage, sepsis or suicide. 
Virginia’s Maternal Mortality Review Team, for instance, collects data and the Virginia Department of Health also posts a data dashboard.
The data collection is in line with a broader effort to address maternal health disparities and underlying causes in maternal mortality. Data shows that deaths have decreased in recent years while collected data has also informed state policies, such as Virginia’s “Momnibus” packages that were signed into law this year.  Those measures enabled Medicaid reimbursement rates for midwives and pilot programs for remote monitoring for hypertension.
Not every proposal prevailed, such as a mutli-year effort to require unconscious bias training for license renewals — a measure to target one facet of why Black women are more likely to die in childbirth, but others have addressed support for maternal health workforces and Medicaid enrollment timelines for pregnant people. 
Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, said lawmakers will reintroduce failed or vetoed legislation again next year. She’s particularly hopeful about the unconscious bias bill, as it has consistently had bipartisan patrons. She also hopes a bill that would support businesses providing childcare to workers can pass. 
“You can’t talk about moms without talking about babies,” she said. 
Though Youngkin and some Republicans have noted support for addressing maternal health disparities and improving outcomes, Democrats have largely led on the issue. In an interview with The Mercury, Mundon King took a moment to stump for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger, who she believes will get the other Momnibus bills across the finish line. 
Be it Spanberger, or Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, either woman will be responsible for signing off on the state’s next budget — one that will likely need to address several federal funding losses. 
Not extending the ERASE MM program in Trump’s budget plans is what U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, called part of a larger push to “shrink the federal government willy nilly.” 
Throughout the summer she has cautioned that federal funding cuts will put more burden on states, and said some states will forgo certain services altogether. 
“Rather than looking at what are the important problems to solve,” she said, the cuts have culminated in a lot of health care infrastructure taking hits or bracing for them.
McClellan and Democratic state lawmakers have said throughout the spring and the summer the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is expected to negatively affect the public health landscape with its changes to hospital funding mechanisms and Medicaid. So far, three clinics have closed in Virginia — citing the act as part of the reason — while hospital administrators have spoken out as well. 
On maternal health specifically, McClellan said letting ERASE MM lapse essentially erases the good intentions Republicans in Congress and the president have espoused with regards to both maternal health and the “Make America Healthy Again” movement.  
She juxtaposed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. MAHA initiatives against the different federal funding cuts to public health like the OBBBA, the tax credits that help people purchase health insurance which have yet to be renewed, and funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health. 
“It’s just a huge disconnect that I don’t think they see,” she said. 
Previous efforts to extend the ERASE MM funding have been unsuccessful — like a stopgap funding measure in December 2024 that failed with Republican opposition. The program was also missing from Trump’s budget proposals for next year. Legislation to extend the program introduced this year has not advanced so far. As Congress stares down a potential government shutdown before Oct. 1, it may not be included yet again. 
With the 2026 fiscal year beginning on that date, Congress needs to have resolved its appropriations bills or agree on a continuing resolution in the interim. Such resolutions have become par for the course in recent years for the nation’s legislative body. 
If McClellan and other federal lawmakers can’t extend the program in its current form this year, she plans to “absolutely” work on reauthorization in the future. 
North Carolina Central University nursing department chair Yolanda VanRiel is also watching closely. As a nursing professor, she helps oversee the education of future health care workers. She noted how programs like ERASE MM are an example of federal funding that helps states across the country.
“Maternal health is one of the most urgent equity issues of our time,” she said. “We know that solutions like community-based programs, culturally responsive care (and) consistent monitoring works, but we need the will to sustain them.” 
North Carolina is among the states to have maternal health data dashboards that help inform policy and has also its own Momnibus package in the works, but it has not passed yet. 
“Momnibus (legislation) shows what is possible when states lead boldly, but states cannot do this alone,” VanRiel said. “Federal and state partnerships ground the belief that every mother’s life matters.”

In 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin and lawmakers sought to build a new system with “rigorous standards” for students, “best-in-class assessments, and a transparent and meaningful accountability and support system,” according to a Jan. 9 report. 
The agency suggested in a statement to The Mercury that lawmakers could have avoided delays by including ”mandatory carry forward language” when appropriating  $500,000 for the project, which would have allowed officials to begin soliciting proposals from qualified vendors immediately. 
“No General Assembly deadlines have been missed, and the General Assembly has been steadily updated,” said Kenita Matthews, a VDOE spokeswoman, in a statement last week. 
The response came after Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor and chair of the Senate Committee on Education and Health, raised concerns about delays and risks in a letter to Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera and Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Guillickson.
In her Sept. 22 letter, Hashmi noted that no Request for Proposals (RFP) had been issued following the legislature’s authorization for the agency to extend the existing Standards of Learning assessment contract with Pearson, an educational publishing company, through Dec. 31, 2027. The intent was to ensure “continuity of testing” while a new contract is secured. 
Hashmi added that lawmakers appropriated $500,000 for VDOE to hire a vendor to analyze options for an innovative new assessment system and to craft a competitive RFP with input from a work group of superintendents, teachers, principals, and assessment experts.
Under the budget language, a report with cost options and recommendations is due to the House and Senate education and appropriations committees by Nov. 1.
Hashmi wrote that the education committees were told the RFP would be issued by Sept. 1, but that deadline was missed and monthly updates had not been submitted.  
Without a vendor and a project plan underway, she warned, the timeline for releasing an RFP next year “cannot be met.” 
“The absence of market analysis and cost estimates will force the 2026 General Assembly to appropriate funds for a new multi-year assessment contract without the benefit of informed estimates or competitive bids, risking either underfunding the program or committing tens of millions of dollars beyond what is necessary,” Hashmi wrote. “Inaction now jeopardizes both fiscal responsibility and the quality of assessments for our students. The stakes are significant.”
Matthews countered that because the budget did not allow the funds  to carry over from fiscal year 2025 to 2026, the agency needed approval before moving forward. She said there was not enough time to properly hire a consultant before June, when the governor approved VDOE’s expedited discretionary carryover request on Aug. 25.
Typically, the governor must approve leftover funding for the following year in the fall, Matthews said.
“To ensure compliance with procurement policies and procedures the department had to ensure that the carryover request was approved, and carryover funding was allotted prior to posting an RFP and approved funding/appropriation was available to support the awarding of a contract to an assessment consultant,” she wrote.
Matthews said VDOE is now finalizing the procurement process for the mandated assessment vendor and expects to issue the RFP no later than October 6.
She added that VDOE will resume providing monthly updates to lawmakers. The work group also has six meetings scheduled before the end of the year, two of them ahead of the Nov. 1 reporting deadline.
Hashmi received a response letter from Gullickson, which she is currently reviewing.

“This is a substantial undertaking by the commonwealth that will impact our school districts, educators, and students for years to come, and we have a condensed time frame to act,” Hashmi said in a statement to the Mercury. “It is time to get serious with the Request for Proposal (RFP) process, continue a transparent process with stakeholders, and ensure our students are well-positioned for success in 2026.”

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Construction of Revolution Wind has been allowed to resume by a court, at least for now. But federal funding for renewables remains uncertain, perhaps signaling more trouble ahead for large infrastructure projects. What is the path forward to ensure Rhode Island, and New England more broadly, stay on track with the energy transition despite federal backtracking?
An energy transition away from fossil fuels must prioritize policy mixes that invest heavily in distributed and local mechanisms for energy production, such as rooftop and community solar, and give the state greater influence in the decision-making process. A robust public finance plan is needed to distribute funding and incentivize adoption for households and local businesses, even as the costs of renewables have dramatically fallen.
The relative success of solar photovoltaic (PV) incentive policies in Connecticut and New York shows that households at all income levels have started adopting solar though gaps persist in low-income neighborhoods. Such programs make solar a reliable and affordable tool for decarbonizing energy production and a way to deliver significant savings for households.
Rhode Island had at least 65 large-scale solar PV projects with nearly 400 MW of capacity by late 2024, potentially generating enough electricity to match the annual consumption of 50,000 to 80,000 households, with additional projects continuing to come online. Among the newest is the Exeter Mail Solar Field, the largest of three facilities commissioned by a collaboration of the state’s public housing authorities to offset their costs and reduce their energy bills.
The Exeter Mail project, dedicated on Sept. 12, would fit the definition of community solar, which are shared solar farms that let multiple households access solar power even if they can’t install panels on their own property. Participants receive cheaper electricity, reducing their overall energy costs. These projects are particularly valuable because not all households have suitable rooftops or the means to cover upfront installation costs. 
But there were only seven other community solar projects as of 2024, with most located around Providence and Bristol. These projects show that there is enough appetite for such infrastructure projects in Rhode Island. For example, neighboring Connecticut has 69 large-scale projects but with a combined capacity of only 300 MW. Despite these positive trends, there is a clear gap between the benefits provided by renewables and large-scale adoption. 










A robust public finance plan is needed to distribute funding and incentivize adoption for households and local businesses, even as the costs of renewables have dramatically fallen.


A study from NREL highlighted that Rhode Island has an upper-bound technical electricity generation potential of more than 3 million MWh from rooftop solar, out of which 1.3 million MWh are in low and medium-income areas alone. That would cover a large portion of electricity consumption in the state. However, technical potential doesn’t fully translate into real capacity due to economic, political and social factors. To get close to even a fraction of this capacity, governments need to emphasize robust pre- and post-purchase incentive programs that make households willing to adopt.
Evidence from California, where a policy reducing payments for excess electricity was established in 2022, before being recently overturned, shows how quickly solar markets can collapse if policy signals change. Similarly, the cancellation of Revolution Wind created uncertainty, and the state must step up to provide stability. For solar, the federal Residential Clean Energy Credit, which has lowered the costs of systems by 30% is due to end early at the end of this year, leaving a gap in the incentive structure for this technology.
Despite this uncertainty, one thing is clear: renewable energy projects can reduce the cost for the end consumer by stabilizing electricity prices, making it a winning message for policymakers. This is especially the case in Rhode Island as electricity prices for residential consumers have increased 65% since 2010, with transmission costs making up a great deal of the bill. One of the most consequential behavioral modifiers for households is rising prices. Reports have linked high electricity costs to fossil fuel production, a hotly debated issue and a significant burden for many households. The volatility in the price of natural gas and Rhode Island’s heavy reliance on it to power the grid is a recipe for continued uncertainty in electricity markets.
Policymakers in the local government need to see local renewable projects as a way to ensure energy independence and accelerate investment in them in the short term. The focus needs to be on making it attractive for communities to adopt renewables. Solar, especially, has become an economical way of producing electricity and with increasing capacity comes the benefit of lowering emissions for a sector that accounts for a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions.
After all, everybody loves cheap, guilt-free electricity.

ODH’s Services for Homeless Youth and Homeless Pregnant Youth Grant operates on a two-year cycle, with the previous cycle ending June 30. The department gave Kaleidoscope $227,247 ($113,623 per year) in fiscal years 2024 and 2025. 
“This grant has been a significant source of funding for our housing program since 2021,” Kaleidoscope said in a statement. “Notably, this information was received approximately 45 days past the start date of July 1st, and we are now left with a pending deficit and the need to quickly relocate 10 young people without resources.” 
ODH received 18 applications for funding for the 2025-26 cycle and had $2.2 million to be awarded, ODH spokesperson Ken Gordon said. 
“Kaleidoscope Youth Center’s application was scored, and based on its low score compared to other applicants, the center was not one of the 15 applicants that were awarded the limited amount of funds available in the current grant cycle,” he said in an email. 
Kaleidoscope scored 120 out of 205 points, according to Gordon. 
“The executive summary section includes information about the target audience for the project, but without local data, it makes it difficult to understand why this population was picked,” ODH wrote in an Aug. 19 letter to Kaleidoscope. “… Overall, this application was missing important key requirements throughout the narrative, making it difficult to understand how each deliverable would be carried out.”
Kaleidoscope is able to re-apply for the next grant cycle, which starts July 1, 2027. 
KYC housing program  
Kaleidoscope, which serves LGBTQ+ youth ages 12-24, started the housing program in 2019 and informed current participants in the program about the closure on Sept. 8, Kaleidoscope said in a statement. 
“Although we do not have a current date by which they will need to move, the soonest would be early to mid-November,” Kaleidoscope said in a statement. 
Kaleidoscope’s goal is to maintain the housing program through July 2026 when the final lease ends. 
“This would provide the resources and time to safely and humanely transition current participants while decreasing the threat of returning to homelessness,” according to the statement. “Our youth are scared, and so are we. It is not okay that they are facing the threat of returning to homelessness.” 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine used his veto power to nix a provision in the state’s two-year budget that would have prohibited giving funds to youth homeless shelters that house transgender youth, even if they also serve youth who are not transgender. 
Nearly a quarter of LGBTQ youth reported experiencing homelessness or housing instability at some point in their lives, according to a 2022 report by the Trevor Project. Those who experiences homelessness or housing instability were also two to four times more likely to report depression, anxiety and self-harm, along with considering or attempting suicide, the report found.
LGBTQ+ youth are 120% more likely to experience homelessness than non-LGBTQ youth, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — A transplant from Miami, Anallive Calle learned her way around Kansas City from behind the wheel of a big yellow school bus.
The tablet near the dash provides turn-by-turn directions to every stop and checks each kid on and off the bus throughout her route. It’s helped her navigate the narrow roads and one-ways that stretch through one of the city’s oldest neighborhoods.
And from her phone, she can check on the status of her own son and whether he made the bus each morning and afternoon.
“So it’s transparent all the way,” she said. “You know when your child is picked up and where they’re at every moment.”
Last school year, Kansas City Public Schools started a new transportation contract with Zum, a company that provides busing services for districts across the country.
With the new vendor, drivers welcomed updates like air conditioning and tinted windows that keep the new fleet comfortable. But they also were given a suite of new technology — a main driver of the 15,000-student urban school district’s decision to ink a $100 million, 5-year contract with Zum.
Aside from navigation, the buses are loaded with live cameras inside and out. Checking in at the tablet allows parents to track their kids and schools to get a headcount on that day’s breakfast and lunch. From the bus barn’s dispatch office, a large screen shows the location of each bus, its exact speed, whether it’s running on time — and even the driver’s rating from parents.
Derrick Gines, a Zum driver and safety trainer with 10 years of experience, said the technology built into today’s buses make drivers and students safer.
“Versus yesteryear, they were designed for freight — human freight,” he said. “But now, there’s so much safety wrapped around this thing.”
While the iconic yellow buses might look like those of yore, school systems big and small are increasingly investing in a new wave of on-board technology.
New software programs monitor engine components, alerting transportation departments to maintenance needs. Other tools create the most optimal routes, saving on fuel, staff and bus costs. Turn-by-turn navigation and student manifests help ensure that no driver is lost and no kid is left behind. And live video feeds can help with student behavior issues — even allowing a school principal to speak to students on the bus in real time, in some cases.
This newfangled technology is a stark contrast to the machinery and aesthetics of the yellow bus, which have remained largely unchanged for decades, said Ryan Gray, editor-in-chief of School Transportation News, which covers the industry.
“Even when you walk onto a school bus, it still looks the same,” he said. “But the inner workings have just completely changed. All of the advanced electronics in it — the wiring to make all of this technology work, whether it be the hardware or the software — it’s grown by leaps and bounds.”
More states guarantee students the right to school-day religious instruction off campus

Schools see some of these technologies as intuitive progress: Technology has reshaped many other facets of public education, while many bus drivers were stuck with paper maps and CB radios. But with the rise of new technology comes new risks, and some advocates are cautious about the security of all the data flowing through yellow buses.
A booming market of vendors and limited regulations on bus tech has given more responsibility to school IT and transportation departments. But Gray said most school districts are embracing these new tools — if they can afford them.
“It always comes down to money,” he said. “I think that if they think they have the money, they’re going to want to buy this stuff.
School systems and tech companies say these tools can improve student safety, create efficiencies and help alleviate the chronic shortage of bus drivers.
“It’s a huge recruiting tool,” said Jason Salmons, transportation director for Bentonville Schools in northwest Arkansas.
Bentonville contracts with Transportant, a Kansas-based company, to equip its buses with new camera and tracking technology. Salmons said the navigation and student tracking provide peace of mind to drivers, who can easily traverse new neighborhoods. The seven live cameras on each bus also provide security if an incident arises.
About 13,000 of the district’s 20,000 students ride buses across 135 daily routes. In addition to an upfront cost, he said the school system pays a subscription of about $90,000 per year.
The software tracks not only every bus, but also every student’s boarding and disembarkment, even taking photos of the kids. If something happens, law enforcement can see where a child was and what they were wearing at dropoff — providing a “priceless” service, Salmons said.
With real-time tracking — much like a rideshare customer would see on their screen — parents and students view buses as more reliable, he said. With more precise pickup times, students don’t wait outside in the cold as long and older kids can even get a few more minutes of sleep, Salmons said.
“High schoolers use the app as their bible,” he said.
Data privacy
Given the national driver shortage and parents’ focus on reliability, Cassie Creswell understands the appeal of the new bus technology. But she has concerns about the growing loads of data being collected.
“It’s a mixed bag on this stuff,” said Creswell, the co-chair of the national Parent Coalition for Student Privacy, which advocates to protect student data.
That group has pushed to keep cameras out of classrooms, but hasn’t taken a formal position on school buses, she said. Creswell, a parent of a Chicago Public Schools student, said the more data that is collected — such as GPS locations and video footage — the more opportunities for that data to be sold or illicitly breached.
“Are we actually clearing away stuff that you really shouldn’t hold on to forever?” she asked. “We’re so careless with student data — even very sensitive data — and we’re very careless about the long-term protection of that data.”
More than half the states have issued AI guidance for schools

School systems interviewed by Stateline said their bus data is being securely stored separately from other student records and that data such as videos are routinely deleted.
Alan Fairless, a founder and chief technology officer of the tech provider Transportant, previously worked in building encrypted tech products.
He said the company doesn’t sell any student data and encrypts the memory of each device — so, someone stealing a tablet off a bus would have no access to its memory. The company was created in 2018 to tackle parent and school concerns about bus reliability and delays.
Fairless said he quickly learned many districts struggle with high driver turnover because of student behavior issues on board.
By providing multiple cameras that can be accessed live, he said, the company’s product provides a new layer of support to drivers.
“Now, when something happens, they push a button and a dispatcher or principal is going to watch that bus in real time,” he said.
Fairless said one school district has what it calls a seven-minute rule: When a driver alerts of an incident, a dispatcher aims to watch the video, figure out what happened and notify parents over text or phone call within seven minutes.
“The effect is, that video arrives to the parents, and now they know the real problem, and they know that before the student comes home and creates some other version of the story,” he said. “So now, it’s like the parents and the school district are working together to solve the problem.”

Since launching, the company has contracted with 88 school systems in 19 states to provide its all-inclusive tech suite that includes the app for families, on-board Wi-Fi, camera systems and routing services.
While prices can vary, school districts typically pay about $3,600 per bus up front and an annual subscription cost of about $69 per bus, said Jeff Shackelford, vice president of sales.
Changing parent demands
The addition of Transportant has helped keep parents informed in Oregon’s Estacada School District, which sprawls across 750 square miles southeast of Portland.
“It’s been great customer service for our families to just see, just like when someone orders an Uber, they can keep track of where their kid is at,” said Maggie Kelly, a spokesperson for the school system of about 2,000 students.
Kelly said the district expects to make up some of its initial investment in the technology as it realizes savings from more efficient bus routes.
Parents are demanding more real-time information on bus times and locations, said Rick D’Errico, a spokesperson for Transfinder, whose products build more efficient bus routes and provide tracking apps for parents.
“If I can track a burrito order, why can’t I track a bus?” D’Errico said. “Parents these days expect their districts to have ways to notify them on individualized ETAs and alerts for when their kid is on their routes, and not rely on schoolwide email blasts.”
Recently, school districts in Alaska, Texas and Wyoming have launched the company’s apps, which are free for parents.
Such services can provide savings by cutting back on the number of drivers and buses in operation. But they also relieve pressure on dispatchers, who can be besieged with parent phone calls during disruptions or delays.
Since rolling out a new bus tracking app this year, the St. Johns County School District in northeast Florida has fielded far fewer parent calls.
That app is just the latest addition to a portfolio of advanced onboard technology, said Jonah Paxton, transportation fleet technology foreman at the district, which serves about 27,000 bus riders.
The 52,000-student school system intentionally purchased separate products for bus cameras, parent tracking and driver navigation. Paxton said that allows the school system to avoid getting stuck with a single provider that could demand higher prices in the future.
“We’re not locked into a single sort of a walled-garden of products, which gives us a lot more freedom to pick and choose which products we like, which ones we don’t like, and gives us a little more negotiating power,” he said.
To ensure security, the school system stores video files on its own servers rather than those of outside vendors, he said. The district has a specific video retention policy and it blurs out student faces if videos are ever requested under the state’s public records law.
Paxton said student and driver safety drives many of the tech decisions for the school’s fleet of more than 300 buses.
“Buses are vastly different than they were even five,10 years ago,” he said. “I think many people who haven’t ridden a bus in a while can think of the bus as sort of an unpleasant place, or kind of the Wild West of schooling, but they’ve really come a long way.”

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)In the greater Merrimack area, where toxic forever chemicals are concentrated throughout the soil and a long-term cleanup plan is yet to materialize, keeping the contamination local is the best many feel they can do for now. But how well that’s working isn’t clear and guidance is scarce, creating headaches for developers and concern for activists.
“Soil is a major concern,” said Rep. Rosemarie Rung, of Merrimack. “There are no clear and distinct regulations on how to manage soil that needs to be removed.”
The prevalence of toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals, also called PFAS, in the Merrimack region is tied to the now-shuttered Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics plant. The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services contends that the facility released PFAS into the atmosphere in the course of its operations; the factory opened under different ownership in 1986, ended operations in May 2024, and was demolished earlier this year. 
Airborne PFAS settle into soils, from where the chemicals seep into water bodies and groundwater. In 2016, water testing revealed hundreds of contaminated wells in multiple towns. PFAS are extremely slow to break down in the environment and have been tied to myriad health concerns, including elevated incidences of certain cancers and other illnesses.
Saint-Gobain has paid for some short- and long-term drinking water solutions, including providing bottled water to some households, connecting others to public water, and filtering some public wells affected by the contaminants. 
When it comes to longer-term questions about how the soil contamination will be managed or cleaned up, however, the company, residents, and NHDES have struggled to reach an agreement, and New Hampshire has not yet settled on a remediation plan outlining Saint-Gobain’s cleanup responsibilities.
For soil contamination tied to Saint-Gobain emissions, NHDES considers the company responsible for any remediation that must occur, Waste Management Division Director Michael Wimsatt said. 
Saint-Gobain initially suggested “natural attenuation and institutional controls” as a management strategy for the contaminated area into the future, and the company continues to believe that strategy — involving monitoring levels over time as the chemicals dissipate into the environment — is an “appropriate remedy,” said company spokesperson Suzanne Loranc. 
However, NHDES disagreed and has sent a letter to the company requesting that Saint-Gobain investigate the soils in the area to understand more about the extent and nature of the contamination, spokesperson James Martin said in an email. The findings will inform longer-term action plans for both the Saint-Gobain site and broader area, Wimsatt said.
Loranc said Saint-Gobain anticipated conducting the preliminary investigation this fall. 
This will be followed by an initial report, then a next draft of an action plan, though this process could take months, Wimsatt said at the commission meeting.
Containment
In the meantime, life goes on in the Merrimack area — with added considerations for the proper care and containment of contaminated soil.
NHDES calls for PFAS-contaminated soil to be “managed appropriately to ensure it is conducted in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment,” Martin said.
That doesn’t explicitly mean that the soil cannot be removed from the area, Martin said. But there are limited options for what safe management of PFAS-contaminated soils could actually look like beyond containment, said Rep. Wendy Thomas, of Merrimack.
This is due, in part, to the sheer size of the area believed to be affected by PFAS pollution from Saint-Gobain.
“The Saint-Gobain site is a tremendously unique site,” Wimsatt said, larger than the other PFAS-contaminated sites NHDES encounters — meaning that traditional management guidance is not necessarily applicable. “The problem is that there are millions of cubic yards of soil. … It’s just not feasible, either technically or practically or economically, in any way feasible, to think that we’re going to pick up all those soils and bring them to a landfill somewhere, right?”
PFAS-contaminated soil can’t be placed just anywhere, and the dedicated hazardous waste landfills where it can be placed can also be costly. Other routes, like burning or heat-treating soil, are similarly difficult to implement, Thomas said. For now, strategies for managing soils center on keeping them in place — though, as Wimsatt noted, this strategy does not address the risk to groundwater from contaminated soils.
Unexpected costs
A common circumstance that might call for relocating significant volumes of soil is construction — and development is still progressing in Merrimack, where Saint-Gobain’s legacy “hasn’t really scared anybody away,” according to community development director Robert Price. But it has created the need for additional considerations, and sometimes costs, that not everybody expects, he said. 
“Developers, they’ve obviously heard of the Saint-Gobain contamination issue and all of that, but they aren’t necessarily aware fully of how it affects them,” Price said. “… So they realize later in the process, like, oh, by the way, you’re not allowed to remove soil from the property. And so they have to figure out, OK – what do we do with all this now?”
The town faces the same challenges.
Initial plans for a bridge construction project called for the town to relocate about 9,000 cubic yards of soil, Merrimack Town Manager Paul Micali said. But taking that soil to a dedicated facility is expensive, and it was unclear whether Saint-Gobain or any other entity would help pay for it.
“We are trying to come up with a plan to figure out what we can and cannot do with the soil,” Micali said Sept. 22. He’s concerned, he said, that the uncertainty will delay the project, which the town had hoped to put out to bid in the fall. 
Ultimately, according to Martin, plans were updated to keep all the soil contained on site, using the excess to construct berms and slopes. This path is similar to that taken by other developers who have struggled to determine what to do with their excess soil, Price said. Not all have found a path forward — leading to piles of dirt popping up from time to time along Daniel Webster Highway.
“There are a lot of projects up and down (Daniel Webster) highway that are affected by it,” Micali said. “All these projects are being affected … They can’t remove the contaminated soil.”
Unclear scope
Another challenge is establishing a border around the affected area. A commonly referenced zone is the boundary laid out in a 2018 consent decree between NHDES and Saint-Gobain, which includes portions of Bedford, Hudson, Litchfield, Londonderry, Manchester, and Merrimack. But the zone is a legal boundary and does not fully encompass the extent of pollution from Saint-Gobain, Martin said. 
Contaminated water supplies and illnesses associated with PFAS exposure have been found outside the boundaries of the agreement, Thomas said. And because PFAS leach into groundwater through the soil, activists such as Laurene Allen of Merrimack Citizens for Clean Water have said they find inaction, and the attenuation strategy proposed by Saint-Gobain, unacceptable.
“The contamination levels have not dropped over the years of site data and are not expected to drop as these are chemicals that will only decrease if the site is remediated,” Allen said. Citing the water filtration some residents were undertaking at their own expense, air quality concerns, and danger to those working in the area, she added that she felt the site should have been designated a federal CERCLA, or superfund, site, to put the authority to push for a remedy onto the federal government.
“DES lacks the authority to order action. The solutions are there for soil removal and management as well as groundwater remediation but it seems (New Hampshire) does not have the will to set a state policy of polluter accountability,” she said. “This site continues to add to our aquifer contamination that we are filtering at our own expense. … It’s a long overdue issue of environmental justice and we are paying for what we did not cause with not only remediation but also with (our) health.”
Wimsatt said NHDES believed holding Saint-Gobain directly responsible for cleanup was a more efficient way to proceed than going through Superfund. 
“What we always do is we look for a responsible party that has both the wherewithal and the willingness to do the work they need to do, and in virtually any case, we see that as a much more efficient way to get people protected than going through the Superfund process,” he said, pointing to Saint-Gobain’s work to remedy residents’ drinking water as an example of forward progress.
However, some advocates said they weren’t yet satisfied. 
“We’ve had to assume so much cost, headache, personal loss because of the actions of Saint-Gobain,” Rung said. “… We need to tighten up the regulations and the responsibility.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/saintgobain-soil-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 05:56:26.837228

(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)The monitor that had been tracking Mearl Hodge’s heartbeat started to show an abnormal rhythm. A technician at Glenwood Regional Medical Center alerted nurses that the electrodes that should have been affixed to Hodge’s chest seemed to have popped loose. No one checked. It was a granddaughter, arriving for a visit 20 minutes later, who discovered that her grandmother no longer had a pulse.
The circumstance of Hodge’s death in northeast Louisiana is among more than 650 documented instances of deficient care at nearly three dozen hospitals across eight states that were owned by Steward Health Care before the entire system collapsed last year in a spectacular bankruptcy. Hodge’s death, four days after she was admitted to Glenwood with COVID-19 in the winter of 2022, triggered an inquiry by the Louisiana Department of Health. Beyond the unattached heart monitor leads and the granddaughter’s discovery, state records from the investigation show the mask helping Hodge, 90, to breathe was sitting useless on her stomach. And though her medical chart made clear she wanted to be resuscitated in any emergency, the staff hadn’t tried, the records indicate.
For these mistakes, other state documents show, the health department fined Glenwood $1,750. What is uncommon about the case is that the hospital was fined at all. The scarcity of sanctions when some Steward facilities made even grave errors is part of a pattern in government regulation of America’s hospitals. Steward Health Care’s collapse has attracted considerable attention, largely depicted as an object lesson in the perils of for-profit hospital owners financed by private equity. However, a close examination of the Steward system points to a less obvious culprit: Across the country, oversight of hospitals by states and the federal government is inadequate – at times weakly enforced, at times absent.
This portrait of the feeble regulation of a troubled health system emerges from a new data analysis of Steward’s hospitals by the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank. The multi-prong analysis reveals substantial flaws in how states and the federal government oversee hospitals. 
On the one hand, main ways that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) require U.S. hospitals to publicly report on their finances and their quality failed to point to Steward’s deepening fragility. 
On the other hand, information that regulators do not routinely track make clear that the company’s hospitals were increasingly in trouble. One is a roster of nearly 130 lawsuits that mounted as the bankruptcy neared, because vendors – from suppliers of medical devices to air-conditioning – went to court, alleging Steward neglected to pay its bills. The other is a growing pile of hospital deficiencies – flaws, including in Mearl Hodge’s care, of varying severity that states examined in response to complaints.
This combination – public data that didn’t show the problems, revealing trends that regulators didn’t watch – does not suggest that many hospitals across the nation are poised to fail. Evidence of whether for-profit hospitals have lower quality is mixed, though a small body of research into the more than 450 with private-equity financing indicates they tend to be more problem-prone. Still, the lax regulatory climate means that state and federal early warning systems for troubled hospitals are largely absent.
“We need to build some sentinels…to catch things before a crash happens,” said Jonathan Blum, who held senior roles at CMS during the Biden and Obama administrations. 
In the meantime, certain hospitals and communities that rely on them can be vulnerable, especially as looming cuts to Medicaid and other federal health funds are widely predicted to erode the financial underpinnings of rural and other already-strapped hospitals. Some may hunt for new, deep-pocketed owners. “Unless states dramatically increase their oversight, I would certainly expect more Stewards to happen,” said Erin Fuse Brown, a health law and policy specialist at the Brown University School of Public Health.
Prospect Medical Holdings, another private equity-affiliated system with 16 hospitals in four states, including Rhode Island, declared bankruptcy in January. “I do not think it will be the last,” Fuse Brown said.
Steward’s rise and fall 
Massachusetts, a hub of academic medical centers, had never been home to a for-profit hospital backed by private equity – an arrangement that was gaining traction in U.S. health care in which investors look for large, often-quick profits outside the stock market. But a local Roman Catholic health system called Caritas Christi was faltering after a priest sex-abuse scandal financially drained the Archdiocese of Boston. Caritas began looking for a buyer, and Massachusetts officials joined the search. They were having little luck, especially finding one open to Caritas’s no-abortion policy and other Catholic values.

So, Massachusetts officials viewed it as good fortune when Ralph de la Torre, a prominent cardiac surgeon who recently had become Caritas’s chief executive, proposed what he said would be a new model of care. In 2010, the system affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management, an established private equity firm. They pledged to solidify Caritas’s pension system, strengthen its half-dozen hospitals and, for the first five years, be monitored by Massachusetts’ attorney general. The system would be renamed Steward Health Care. The attorney general and a judge approved the deal.
Though the fledgling system made some hospital improvements, Steward didn’t always adhere to the deal’s terms and, under de la Torre’s leadership, was aggressive from the start, health officials and other hospital executives recall. In 2011, the fledgling system took over four more Massachusetts hospitals and another in 2012. But Steward’s big growth spurt started in 2016, just after the monitoring ended, when it affiliated with Medical Properties Trust (MPT), a major real estate investment trust which is a type of company that pools money from many investors to buy and own income-producing real property. MPT bought all of the hospitals’ buildings and land in a “sale-leaseback,” offering cash in exchange for escalating rents. Steward, together with MPT and Cerberus, went on a buying spree. Less than a year later, it owned 36 hospitals in 10 states.
In none of the states into which Steward spread did regulators have a role reviewing the purchases, according to the Brookings analysis of health care “transaction” laws compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. In some of the states, such as Arizona, an attorney general reviews only sales of non-profit hospitals; Steward grew almost entirely by acquiring hospitals that already were for-profit. Other states, such as Florida, review sales of nursing homes, but not hospitals. Still others, such as Texas, do not oversee any health facility sales.
Financial troubles, staff and supply shortages and de la Torre’s spending on luxuries, including a $30 million yacht, eventually spilled into view. Steward sold seven hospitals in Ohio, Colorado and Utah. In January of last year, the Boston Globe broke the story of a 39-year-old woman who died of profuse bleeding from her liver the day after giving birth at Steward’s St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Boston; an unpaid vendor had repossessed common metal coils that doctors use to stem internal bleeding. In a statement to the Globe, Steward said it did its best to keep needed supplies on hand and noted that its surgical care had been “consistently recognized among the best in the nation and state by the likes of highly credible ratings organizations.”
Weeks after the Globe story, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said she wanted Steward, which had long balked at reporting financial information required there, to leave the state.
Less than three months later, in May, the whole Steward system filed for bankruptcy in Texas, where the company headquarters had moved several years before.  This summer, the remnants of Steward sued de la Torre, who resigned last fall, and three others, accusing them of “greed and bad faith misconduct” that had sunk the company. A spokeswoman for de la Torre, Rebecca Kral, said he “will vigorously defend himself” against the lawsuit. Lawyers for the former CEO have not yet filed a response to the suit in court. 
Attorneys for the Steward bankruptcy did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
The bankruptcy set off a scramble for new owners of Steward’s by-then 31 hospitals. Amid protests, two in Massachusetts closed outright. Most of the company’s hospitals, including Glenwood and the others mentioned in this story, have new owners.
 The limits of government data 

Even as Steward’s layered troubles became more evident, main types of public data that federal health officials collect from hospitals – about their finances and their quality – didn’t reveal them.
Every hospital that treats patients on Medicare must give CMS an annual “cost report” containing assorted financial information. Brookings analyzed these reports, looking at operating profit margins and three other common financial indicators, comparing Steward hospitals against U.S. hospitals overall. Over the years, the analysis found, Steward’s hospitals looked similar on average to all U.S. hospitals through 2022, the most recent data available. However, audited financial statements for the whole Steward system, available in separate public records, show the company struggling from early on, the analysis found.
The discrepancies reflect that Steward shifted many expenses to the central office – a common practice among health systems that Steward took to an extreme, according to Steward and other health care experts. As a result, “It’s not a valid data set for analyzing the financial condition of the hospitals,” said Nancy Kane, a retired professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.










There’s no one state body or federal body that is sitting there and saying, ‘Things are going off the rails at this hospital.’


– Erin Fuse Brown, professor, Brown University School Public Health


A report last year by KFF, a health information nonprofit, on gaps in hospital financial information noted that the data submitted in cost reports for individual hospitals is not standardized or rigorously scrutinized – and doesn’t reflect the financial condition of their parent health systems. Kane said CMS uses the cost reports to help ensure that Medicare is paying hospitals correctly, not to monitor their financial health.
Meanwhile, of the 10 states where Steward operated, seven require hospitals to report at least some financial data and make it publicly available, according to a canvas of state transparency laws. But just three – Colorado, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania – say they currently analyze the data for hospitals’ expenditures or financial condition.
The Brookings analysis, focused on information reported to CMS about the Steward hospitals’ quality of care, found that, like the financial data, these quality measures failed to reveal the actual trouble occurring at many of the facilities. Looking at CMS’s Hospital Care Compare data, their average was little different than hospitals nationally on seven quality indicators, including serious complications, patients’ length of time in emergency rooms, and readmissions.
Asked for a response to the findings, a CMS spokesman, Alexx Pons, said “The agency does not comment on external analysis.”
In January, days before the Biden administration ended, federal officials issued a report on health industry consolidation, including hospitals such as Steward’s with private equity backing. The report by the departments of Health and Human Services and Justice and the Federal Trade Commission said the agencies had repeatedly heard complaints that “HHS should do more to improve the quality of the data” it collects about health facilities’ owners, prices, staff levels and patient care.
Steward’s collapse has helped prompt a few states to increase oversight of health-care transactions, though most merely require notification to a state, not giving power to approve or reject a hospital sale. In January, Massachusetts passed a health care law that does not prevent private-equity firms from affiliating with health care companies but says hospitals may not be licensed if their main campus begins an affiliation with a real-estate investment trust, as Steward did. Still, Fuse Brown, the health law and policy professor, said, “There’s no one state body or federal body that is sitting there and saying, ‘Things are going off the rails at this hospital.’”
A reason for the scant oversight is that “the points of leverage are health law, and health law is very narrow,” said Rosemary Batt, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, who has studied private equity in health care, including Steward. “There’s no law that says [hospitals] need to maintain their infrastructure,” Batt said. “There’s no law that says you can’t sell your land.”
Even as two important types of federal data – on hospitals’ finances and quality – didn’t warn of Steward’s troubles, other loud hints could have revealed the escalating crisis.
One of those hints, unwatched by regulators, lies in a soaring number of lawsuits by vendors, alleging that Steward and its individual hospitals hadn’t paid bills for services, according to Brookings’ analysis, based on records in bankruptcy court and elsewhere. The cases add up to $139 million in allegedly unpaid bills. One small company, Eklund Refrigeration, sued Steward for $32,640 in March 2023, contending it had sent 37 invoices for air-conditioning service to two Arizona hospitals since it had last been paid in 2021. Seventeen months after the suit’s filing, Arizona health officials shut down one, a Phoenix psychiatric hospital, when the broken air conditioning caused the temperature inside to reach 99 degrees in the August heat.

In a number of the lawsuits, vendors were notified of the bankruptcy before their cases advanced. However, in one case, a lawsuit was filed in Massachusetts in February 2024 by OsteoRemedies, which provides medical supplies to support orthopedic surgery, alleging that Steward owed it about $176,500 for services provided in several of its hospitals in five states. In a court filing the following month, Steward lawyers denied every allegation and asked that the case be dismissed.
Instances of deficient care also were becoming more frequent. These are verified by state health department surveyors, who work on behalf of CMS to investigate complaints from patients, families or employees. Altogether, hospitals owned by Steward had nearly 680 deficiencies, federal and state records show. They climbed from 13 in 2020 to 108 last year, about 3 ½ times as many deficiencies per hospital, on average, as in U.S. hospitals overall the year before. Federal health officials define three deficiency levels. The worst, “immediate jeopardy,” is a problem that caused death or easily could have.

CMS is not empowered to fine hospitals for deficiencies – only to ban them from Medicare and Medicaid. Such a ban would be draconian and rarely happens because depriving a hospital of revenue from the two huge public insurance programs would threaten its existence. More typically, federal health officials or state regulators warn hospitals that they face being dropped from the programs unless they correct deficiencies – and then accept the hospitals’ correction plans.
Of the five states, besides Louisiana, that marked any deficiencies in the worst category, Massachusetts has no system of hospital financial penalties. According to the Pennsylvania and Utah health departments, they prefer to nudge hospitals to improve and issued no fines in these cases, including a 2023 incident at a Salt Lake City hospital in which a patient who objected to her discharge died just afterwards at a frigid bus stop.
The Texas Health and Human Services Commission issued a fine, totaling $7,200, for just one of 21 “immediate jeopardy” deficiencies involving Steward hospitals, records show, after finding a malfunctioning emergency room call system, dirt and debris on food carts and other spots, and leaks through ceiling tiles. After listing these and other flaws, however, the state’s May 2024 notice told the hospital the fine “was not a demand for payment,” if it was in bankruptcy. By then, Steward was.
Trouble at Glenwood 
Glenwood, the company’s only Louisiana hospital, racked up 47 deficiencies after Steward bought it in 2017, including four designated “immediate jeopardy.” Patients had started avoiding the hospital, according to local officials and former employees. Unpaid bills prompted vendors to cut off supplies needed to insert pacemakers and perform endoscopies, state records show. A vendor cut off the coffee supply.
Louisiana law allows penalties against hospitals that violate standards. In the months before the bankruptcy, state records show, the health department levied two fines, for $5,000 and $7,000, and said Glenwood would be banned from Medicare if conditions didn’t improve. 
Mearl Hodge’s death came before those fines. Called Meme by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, her obituary would say, Hodge was born and lived her life in Farmerville, a town of about 30 miles northwest of Glenwood with a summertime watermelon festival. She loved to cook chicken and dressing and to share afternoon coffees with her friends and family, including her husband of 76 years. She prayed for her family daily.
As a one-time “class A” violation resulting in death or serious harm, and an “immediate jeopardy” deficiency, state law permitted up to a $2,500 penalty after Hodge’s death.
On May 31, 2022, the state health department fined Glenwood $1,750. Three months later, the department dispatched a second notice. The check Steward sent, the notice said, had bounced.

Even as the number of youths who identify as LGBTQ rises, so has the number of state-level bills seeking to curtail their rights, a new analysis finds.
The number of bills aimed at rolling back or prohibiting in-school protections and health care access has tripled from 77 in 2020 to some 300 a year in 2023, 2024 and 2025, according to the Movement Advancement Project.
The drumbeat of legislation, report the researchers, has taken a steep toll on the mental health of the students in the crosshairs — regardless of where they live. When the dramatic escalation in legislation started in 2023, 90% of LGBTQ people ages 13 to 24 said politics had a negative impact on their well-being — up from 71% in 2022.
Policies enabling in-school support are particularly important to LGBTQ youth. Slightly more than half say they are accepted by peers or teachers at school, compared with 40% who are supported at home. The presence of even one supportive educator in a child’s life has long been shown to reduce rates of suicidality, anxiety and depression.
The number of young people impacted has risen sharply in recent years, though estimates vary depending on how data is tabulated. According to a recent Gallup survey, almost 2 million — or 9.5% — of teens ages 13 to 17 now identify as something other than straight or cisgender. That’s nearly twice as many as in 2020.
The project tracks state LGBTQ and elections policies using interactive maps featuring detailed information that is continually updated. For the new report, researchers tallied the number of states that enacted one or more of 16 types of laws commonly proposed in statehouses since 2020 — nine restrictive and seven protective — throughout the country.
They then combined that information with demographic data and surveys of LGBTQ young people’s well-being from a number of advocacy organizations. The top takeaway: Whether a student attends a school where teachers are able to talk about LGBTQ history, enforce anti-harassment rules, maintain confidences about a child’s identity and allow gender-nonconforming youth to play sports depends on where they live.
Nearly half of queer youth live in one of 27 states that have enacted one or more restrictions on their rights, ranging from bathroom bans to laws prohibiting schools from enacting anti-bullying policies. Thirty-eight percent live in the South, 24% in the West, 21% in the Midwest and 17% in the Northeast.
Of the nine negative state laws the researchers looked at, seven involve schools. The other two are bans on medical care for transgender youth and laws exempting providers of child welfare services, such as foster care, from nondiscrimination rules on religious grounds.



Tennessee has adopted eight, Arkansas, Montana and Idaho enacted seven each, and six other states imposed six or more new restrictions. Three-fourths of Southern states and two-thirds of the Midwest ban trans youth sports participation and medical care, while a third or fewer do in the West and Northeast.
While several states have adopted new, protective laws since 2020, MAP estimates that 6 in 10 LGBTQ youth live in places where there is no legal guarantee of support.
In 2023, 2 in 5 LGBTQ young people and their families said they had considered moving because of politics in their home state. Just 4% actually had — but if that rate is an accurate reflection of all affected families, at least 266,000 people have likely relocated, the researchers estimate.

Survey: More Than Half of LGBTQ Florida Parents Are Thinking About Moving

 




According to a survey released earlier this year by The Trevor Project, 25% of cisgender queer youth and their families and 45% of trans families have considered moving to a state with more protective laws. Seven in 10 families with a transgender member living in states with restrictive laws have thought about relocating, while 12% have crossed state lines for medical care.
Along with its state policy tally, the project released a second paper summarizing information gathered by half a dozen LGBTQ advocacy groups about the impact the recent political climate has had on queer young people. The data echoes the 2023 findings of a 74 investigation that found harassment, victimization and discrimination have spiked in blue states as well as red.



Recent surveys by The Trevor Project and GLSEN, which advocate for protective school policies, found there is no state where fewer than 93% of LGBTQ students reported hearing slurs in school in 2023. Nationwide, 83% were harassed, 54% were sexually harassed and more than 12% assaulted.
Research has long established that a hostile school climate translates to absenteeism, lower grade-point averages and graduation rates, and dramatically higher discipline rates, depression and stress — all of which can impact a student’s life trajectory.

Data Show LGBTQ Students Report Bullying and Attacks from Kids — and Teachers

 




The number of young people impacted has swelled, a change the report attributes in part to generational shifts. While 3% of Baby Boomers and 5% of Gen X identify as LGBTQ, a 2025 Gallup survey found the rate is 14% among Millennials and 23% for Gen Z.
Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the number of high school students ages 13 to 17 who identify as LGBTQ rose from 11% in 2015 to 26% in 2023.
Some of the sharp increase can be attributed to changes in how data is collected and categorized; to people realizing at younger ages they are not straight or cisgender; and to internet access to queer communities. But much of the rise can be attributed to the number of young people who identify as bisexual and/or nonbinary.
The number of transgender people of all ages, for example, has hovered around half a percent for the last decade, according to the University of California, Los Angeles’ Williams Institute. Meanwhile, Gallup found 59% of LGBTQ people in Gen Z, defined as those born between 1997 and 2006, are bisexual, and 76% of nonbinary adults are under age 29.

(Getty Images)As psychiatrists, we care daily for Granite Staters living with mental illness, addiction, developmental disorders, cognitive disorders, and the complicated medical conditions that often accompany them. We see firsthand how the decisions, or indecisions, of our public health leadership at the national level shape the lives of our patients and families. That is why we are deeply concerned about threats to clear, science-based information resulting from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and other public health leaders. 
Medication safety and misinformation
Depression and other mental illnesses are some of the most disabling conditions in the United States. Safe, effective medications, in addition to psychological and social treatments, are a cornerstone of psychiatric care. Yet recently, the public conversation has too often been dominated by misinformation rather than rigorous science, sowing doubt into the safety and effectiveness of well-established mental health treatments. Psychiatric medications save lives, and have overwhelming evidence to demonstrate their safety and effectiveness when prescribed responsibly by trained medical professionals. Without steady, transparent, and evidence-based guidance from public health leaders at all levels, both patients and providers are left vulnerable to confusion, hesitation, and harm.
 Vaccines, autism, and public trust

The persistence of myths linking vaccines to autism is particularly troubling. The evidence is clear: Vaccines save lives and do not cause autism. Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition, and equating it with vaccine injury perpetuates stigma while undermining public health. Rates of autism diagnosis are increasing largely due to a wider recognition of the symptoms of autism, growing prevalence of screening programs in pediatric health care and schools, and a wider availability of early intervention programs that demonstrate efficacy in improving overall functioning and quality of life for people living with autism. When national institutions fail to forcefully counter this misinformation and provide clear guidance, vaccine hesitancy grows, preventable illnesses return, and vulnerable populations suffer. 
Threats to Medicaid and Medicare
For many New Hampshire residents, Medicaid and Medicare are lifelines. These programs ensure access to lifesaving health care, medications, and long-term supports. Unfortunately, these programs face continual threats, from budget cuts, eligibility restrictions, and political battles that treat health care as a bargaining chip. Patients with psychiatric illness, many of whom already navigate stigma and barriers to care, cannot afford further uncertainty as to whether they’ll continue receiving these benefits.
A call for responsible leadership
Granite Staters, and all Americans, deserve leadership at all levels, including the DHHS, that centers science, transparency, and the health of its people. That means issuing clear, evidence-based public guidance on medications, vaccines, autism, and the benefits of Medicaid and Medicare. It means actively combating misinformation. It means vigorously defending the integrity of Medicaid and Medicare as essential programs for our most vulnerable citizens. Recent misinformation, including attacks on the safety of vaccines and psychiatric medications, is eroding the public’s trust in and access to safe and effective health care. 
In the current environment, we urge providers and patients to seek guidance from authoritative and trusted sources that remain committed to an evidence-based and transparent approach to health care. Examples of trusted sources free from ideological biases include national professional societies including the American College of Physicians, the American Association of Pediatrics, the American College and Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Psychiatric Association. Similarly, state level public health experts are in the early stages of collaborating to provide evidence-based guidelines regarding public health and vaccines. Examples include the West Coast Health Alliance and the Northeast Public Health Collaborative.  
As psychiatrists, we will continue to advocate for our patients in clinics, hospitals, schools, nursing homes, and communities across the state and nationally. But we cannot do it alone and we call upon DHHS leadership, the policymakers who oversee it, and professional societies nationwide to fulfill their responsibility not only to Granite Staters but all Americans: to lead with science, to protect the vulnerable, and to safeguard the future health of us all.

Courtesy photo.An Ohio lawmaker wants judges to consider a defendant’s immigration status when they set conditions for bail or hand down criminal sentences.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Township, characterized the changes as a way to give judges “a full picture” of the defendant before them.
But critics argue the proposal might violate the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause or encroach on the federal authority over immigration enforcement.
More generally, they worry the measure targets immigrants — whether here legally or not — at a moment of rising fear and distrust of justice system. People with a target on their back, they argue, aren’t likely to report crimes or testify in court.
What the bill does
When it comes to setting bail, the central question a judge must consider is whether the defendant show up for their court date.
But state law carries a laundry list of other considerations judges should weigh when determining bail, parole or sentences. Did the defendant serve in the military? Did they exhibit remorse?  Do they have ties to the community? In 2022, state lawmakers even went to the ballot to explicitly direct judges to weigh whether a defendant is a threat to public safety when setting the amount of cash bail.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
House Bill 282 would add the defendant’s immigration status to that list. Williams thinks judges should be considering whether a defendant is in the country illegally or subject to a federal detainer when they’re setting conditions.
“It’s always a factor, one, in bail, whether or not an individual is going to return to court,” Williams said. “I think immigration status has a direct effect on that, whether or not an individual is going to be here to answer to justice or not at the conclusion of the case.”
When it comes to criminal sentences and parole, Williams contends, a defendant’s immigration status should be given the same weight as their criminal history.
“Just like probation and parole, if you are actively on those at the time that you commit an offense, and you are an American citizen, that goes against the idea of you being able to be rehabilitated, absent incarceration,” Williams said. “I think it also should be a factor that an individual is here unlawfully, already breaking the law in the state of Ohio and they commit another criminal offense.”
Committee questions
Williams’ proposal got pushback from Democratic committee members, including state Rep. Ismail Mohamed, D-Columbus. He pressed Williams on the Supremacy Clause, which gives the federal government exclusive authority to enforce federal laws. Mohamed noted several states have passed laws wading into immigration enforcement and it hasn’t gone well.
“There’s about five to seven different bills that were passed in other states that were all struck down,” Mohamed said.
Williams insisted those other measures gave local authorities policing powers or made federal violations state crimes as well.
“There’s no federal statute, there’s no constitutional revision that prevents an individual from, especially a judge from considering immigration status as it comes to bond conditions or sentencing,” Williams said.
Mohamed asked about the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, which applies to “any person” within a state’s jurisdiction.
“It doesn’t make any distinction with U.S. citizens, green card holders, noncitizens,” he said. “So essentially, if this will directly lead to judges that are imposing harsher sentences, how do you reconcile that with the 14th Amendment.”
Williams didn’t deny the provision would subject immigrants to greater scrutiny.
“I think it’s reasonable that individuals that are here, legally or illegally, are held to a high standard, just like individuals that are facing parole, probation or bond conditions in another case,” he said.
Instead, Williams contends treating immigrants differently isn’t an issue because immigration status is not a suspect category under the 14th Amendment. He pointed to analysis by state legislative researchers which draws a distinction between immigration status and the race, ethnic background, gender or religion protections found in state law.
Researchers point to an Ohio case where the appeals court upheld a lower court considering a defendant’s immigration status when imposing a felony sentence.
“Courts have done it before. It’s been upheld before,” he said. “I think it’s reasonable to use that classification, because it’s not a suspect classification that gets protection under the equal protections clause.”
But notably — and Williams acknowledged as much — judges already have the discretion to consider a defendant’s immigration status. State law includes a catch all “any other factors that are relevant” in its instructions to the bench.
To Williams, though, that flexibility is treacherous.
“I think it can lead to sentencing disparities where in one jurisdiction, an immigrant would have been seen — viewed more harshly, (and) in another jurisdiction, they will be seen, more lenient,” he said. “I think we need to have consistency across the state of Ohio.”

Ohio’s official regulator in 2023 allowed a huge increase in the fixed monthly charges Columbia Gas could collect from all residential customers. 
They all have to pay the same fees, no matter how rich or poor they are, and no matter the size or density of their dwellings. The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio accepted Columbia Gas’s claims that it needed the money for infrastructure improvements even though its parent company is turning nearly $800 million in annual profit and its CEO makes $33,000 a day. But next month the question of whether those increased charges are in the public interest is headed to the Ohio Supreme Court.
The cost of utilities — what you have to pay to light and heat your home — have been exploding in Ohio. 
Some of that is attributable to increased electricity demand from the AI boom. But the PUCO has also been criticized for being too quick to OK upcharges requested by electricity and natural gas providers. As of 2020, it had granted more than $1 billion in increased charges to utilities only for the Ohio Supreme Court to later declare them illegal. Even so, the utilities got to keep the money.
With 1.5 million customers, Columbia is the largest natural gas supplier in the state. Its service area includes Columbus and Cleveland.
In 2023, the PUCO allowed the utility to increase its fixed charges by 50% — to as much as $57 a month by 2027. As of July, that amount was $53 a month, according to a de-identified bill viewed by the Capital Journal.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXControversially, the charges are shouldered by all customers equally, whether you’re a millionaire living in an 8,000-square-foot mansion on a five-acre lot in New Albany, or if you’re a single mother in a 500-square-foot apartment in North Linden.
Karin Nordstrom of the Ohio Environmental Council said high, one-size-fits-all fixed charges also discourage conservation.
“High fixed charges are bad for consumers because they remove their ability to control their bill,” she said. “They can’t reduce how much they get charged every month by reducing usage. It removes an incentive to reduce usage and it puts more overall strain on the household budget.”
In their appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, the Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Citizens Utility Board of Ohio said the PUCO ruling is not in the public interest because it allows Columbia to get 70% of its revenue from fixed charges and just 30% from the gas it actually delivers.
“The result of such a significant imbalance between fixed and variable charges is that the potential savings for customers through either energy efficiency measures or otherwise reducing usage are minimized because only thirty cents on every dollar spent on bills correlates to the actual gas they use,” the appeal said.
It also cites “the manifest unfairness in charging customers over $50 per month before they use the first therm of gas” as a reason why the charges are not in the public interest. It adds that “a low-volume consumer in a 500 square-foot house does not drive system costs in the same way as a customer in a 5,000 square-foot home.”
For its part, Columbia Gas asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the appeal. It said it hadn’t raised fixed charges since 2008.
It also said energy efficiency doesn’t figure in determinations of whether a change in rate structure is in the public interest. 
“Similarly, this Court has heard, and rejected, arguments that Ohio’s energy policies require the (PUCO) to approve some arbitrary level of funding for energy efficiency programs that matches an appellant’s policy preferences,” Columbia Gas argued. 
And it quoted expert testimony in an earlier proceeding saying it was actually more fair to charge everyone the same amount in fixed charges for infrastructure, regardless of how much of a burden they placed on it.
The witness said “‘fixed charges promote fairness to all customers because the customer’s bill reflects the actual average cost of providing gas delivery service(,) rather than being based on the volume of gas consumed,’” the Columbia Gas filing said.
A spokeswoman for the company was asked whether Columbia would commit to spending all the additional revenue it collects from the increased charges on service to the people who paid it. She was also asked whether the company needed the money, given that parent company NiSource collected nearly $800 million in profit last year and paid CEO Lloyd Yates $12.8 million.
“Columbia Gas does not comment on ongoing litigation,” the spokeswoman replied.
Oral arguments in the case are set for Oct. 29.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)Growing up, Salem Carmicheal’s family lived paycheck to paycheck, so she never considered college an option. She had always been interested in early childhood education, but didn’t think she’d be able to pursue a degree until she discovered that through the state program she could attend Eastern Maine Community College for free.
“If I didn’t go to community college for free, I wouldn’t be able to afford to go to any college,” she said.
“For a while there, it kind of saved me as a person, because I was living in my car for a little bit, but I still didn’t have to worry about college being free.”
Carmichael is now preparing to graduate after completing internships in daycares and classrooms and working at the Bangor YMCA.
“Now that I’m in a better place, I’m actually thriving,” she said. “Free college is an amazing thing, I’ve been thoroughly impacted by it positively.”
Students throughout Maine have similar stories as Carmichael. Students who were not considering college as an option, or planned to work directly after school, or were considering taking on debt to attend a four-year university when they learned about Maine’s free community college program, according to several interviews and public testimony submitted by students to the Maine Legislature. 
Free college, flexibility help drive increased enrollment in Maine’s community colleges

Since its establishment in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022, the scholarship has allowed all recent high school graduates to attend one of Maine’s seven community colleges for free, even if they don’t qualify for federal financial aid. The program has led to increased enrollment in community colleges and even contributed to an increase in transfer students attending the University of Maine System. 
But the future of that program, which is only guaranteed to include those who graduated high school in 2025, is uncertain.
Legislative ‘limbo’
When crafting the two-year budget earlier this year, the Maine Legislature was wrestling with a sizable deficit, which it made several cuts to address. Among those, the budget committee rejected Gov. Janet Mills’ proposed language to fund the free tuition program on an ongoing basis and codify it in statute, instead giving the Maine Community College System a reduced amount for the current biennium, which will help the system continue to offer free college to the high school graduating class of 2025. 
The community college system is concerned that means the scholarship is effectively over. But several members of the Legislature who have been supportive of the initiative have said they intend to continue prioritizing funding it for future years. 
The heads of the budget committee, Sen. Margaret Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) and Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), told the community college system in a July letter that the Legislature needs more information from the system to evaluate the impact of free community college. They asked for detailed cost estimates for the current and following budget cycles, including how much it costs to include nonresidents and students who didn’t graduate from a Maine high school. They also sought data on graduation rates, how many graduates stay in Maine, and potential economies of scale.
“The committee votes did not reflect a final decision on the value of the program so much as a desire for additional information and study of the relative costs and benefits of the program to the state and the participants,” Rotundo and Gattine wrote.
That information, which is due by mid-December, will be considered by either the education or budget committee as they weigh changes to the two-year budget in a change package next session, the chairs said.
Rep. Mike Brennan (D-Portland), who sits on both committees, said free community college “has been enormously successful and has been a big benefit to students in the state of Maine.” 
“There’s no intent to end the program, and there was never any intent during this last legislative session on either the education committee or the appropriations committee to discontinue the program,” he added.
A spokesperson for House of Representatives Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) also said the Legislature’s actions do not mean the program is ending, and that “the Speaker is committed to working with lawmakers to review the program with the goal of continuing to fund future graduating classes.”   
However, the lack of ongoing funding means the community college can’t promise free tuition to  graduates beyond the class of 2025, according to David Daigler, president of the Maine Community College System. The system sent out a press release at the end of the session saying the program had ended, which was widely reported throughout the state. But Daigler also said he’s continuing to work with lawmakers and is interested to see what they do next session.
“I think they understand that by not having an ongoing funding mechanism, and by not having language that says, ‘This is our intent,’ after the class of 2025, there really isn’t a free college program. But then they say, ‘We don’t want it to end,’” Daigler said.
“Right now, we’re sitting in limbo.”
Maine alone is walking back free college
Approximately 35 states have some version of free college, but Maine is currently the only state to walk back the initiative, according to two national researchers. 
Since 2014 when Tennessee became the first state in the country to offer free community college, many states have started their own programs, either focused on high school graduates, adult learners or both. 
In addition to Tennessee, California and  New Mexico have established a permanent funding mechanism for the program and don’t require annual legislative approval. But in most states, tuition-free community college programs are funded annually, or semi-annually by the legislature, “which definitely is a problem when you’re trying to create predictability,” according to Michelle Miller-Adams, a senior researcher at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and a professor of political science at Grand Valley State University in Michigan.










In every study that I've seen, it takes time, but it pays for itself. It's just a matter of fronting the cost.


– Ryan Morgan, CEO of The Campaign for Free College Tuition


“We’ve seen states create and continue free college programs over the last four or five years. Maine seems to be the only state right now going in the opposite direction,” said Ryan Morgan, CEO of national non-profit The Campaign for Free College Tuition.
When states offer free college, it boosts the economy and helps create a more educated workforce which results in higher tax revenue for the state, studies from other free college programs have shown. 
While Maine’s program is too new to be studied, Morgan said, “It’s a no-brainer. A more educated workforce is going to have economic benefits, increase tax revenues, support businesses and also make a significant impact in the lives of the students.”
“In every study that I’ve seen, it takes time, but it pays for itself. It’s just a matter of fronting the cost,” Morgan said.
Since most other New England states have some version of a free college program, Maine also risks losing students to neighboring states if it does not continue its tuition-free community colleges, Morgan said.
Miller-Adams also emphasized that while many community college students would likely qualify for a Pell Grant or other state or federal scholarships, by simplifying the process it makes it more accessible to those who may not otherwise apply.
“It’s the message that gets delivered that says: ‘You might think college is unaffordable, but guess what? Tuition is going to be covered.’”
Free community college helped broaden options
Tom McNeil, a high school counselor at Winslow High School, also said he’s noticed more students and families opening up to the idea of college.
“Changing the discussion around college affordability, which is what I think free community college has done, has made it easier for people to decide to go to school,” McNeil said.“It’s less scary from a financial perspective, so the kids and their families are a little more ready to take a risk.”
The rate of Winslow High School students continuing their education has been relatively stable for the last eight years, he said, but more students took advantage of the tuition-free community colleges, in lieu of either attending a four-year school or just trying out a few classes.
It’s too soon to tell how the class of 2026 might be impacted if the program ends, but McNeil said his biggest fear “is that it lets an old, unhelpful narrative take hold, that college is not affordable or no longer worth it.”
“This initiative has been a great way to combat that.”

Current and former students vouch for free college
Sam Parker had no plans of going to college, and was working in carpentry when his brother sent him a link to the free college program website. 
Parker, who grew up in Newfield, decided to enroll in Southern Maine Community College’s automotive technology program. He now has a job working for a Subaru dealership, and said he’s on a career path because he was able to go to community college for free.
“It just gives people another option,” he said.
Similarly, South Portland native Abby Steinhagen took a gap year after graduating high school, unsure whether she would apply to a four-year institution. But upon hearing about tuition-free community college, she also decided to start at the automotive program and is working at Arundel Ford as she finishes her degree.
“It’s taken a lot of stress from having to pay student loans,” she said. “I already work two jobs, but I would not be able to work the jobs that I need to be able to finance something like this if it wasn’t free.”
The automotive technology program was originally set up by local dealerships who were in need of technicians, said Ruth Morrison, who runs the 90-student associate degree program. Because free college helped enrollment grow, there were 25 new technicians working at shops last summer, she said.
“There are so many specialized fields nowadays that you really need those extra two years of education to get a job that’s going to sustain you and in the economy,” she said.
Jordyn Balicki had committed to attending a four-year nursing program at Husson University when she learned about free community college, and ended up changing her mind last minute and enrolled atEastern Maine Community College.
“I would have been hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt at Husson, so this was huge stress relief,” she said. She added that being able to work as a Resident Assistant her second year to cover room and board costs while doing externships at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor “helped me actually make money while going to school.”
Balicki now works as a nurse, and appealed to the Maine Legislature this session to continue free college for future high school graduates. 
“It was something I definitely didn’t think I was going to do and now I urge everyone to go to a community college,” she said.
“Really, not offering free college from now on is only harming the workforce in Maine.”

The imprint’s first book, “Whirlwind: My Life Reporting the News,” by broadcast news icon Bill Kurtis, came out this month.

 

	
Loganbill and the Press were on hand in recent weeks as Kurtis promoted his book in Lawrence and at the Kansas Book Festival in Topeka (airline delays meant the latter event occurred via Zoom). You can find the volume at all good bookstores and online.
“It’s been an absolute treat to work with Bill,” Loganbill said. “He’s an absolute professional and has an excellent story to tell, and has been a very collaborative partner with all of us.”
More is coming. Kansas City author Chris Arnone’s “My Name Was Baby: An Intersex Memoir” will arrive next fall. McCoy will also have a new book, tentatively titled “God’s Misfits.” (Want a preview? You can read his columns on the shocking case here.)
Former Kansas poet laureate and Reflector contributor Huascar Medina has signed up for “Prairie Fool,” described by the press as “a lyrical meditation on politics, class, and culture.”
My contribution will be a volume with the provisional title “In the Shadow of Trump,” examining how Kansas politics has been shaped (and misshapen) throughout the past decade thanks to the influence of a certain president. I’m not interested in writing about Trump, mind you — more how the shockwaves from his persona and politics have changed this state’s formerly sedate politics.
“That trio from the Reflector really speaks to another reason behind why we felt like we could pull this off, and there are really, really incredible writers here in Kansas and in the Midwest,” Loganbill said. “There are award-winning journalists, there are New York Times bestselling authors, there are nationally recognized poets and creative writers. We really have just a lot of literary talent in the Midwest. And so not only did I feel we had the importance of story to build this out, but we had the literary talents to tell those stories, and the Reflector was an obvious first door to knock on.”
When fully up and running, Plainspoken Books should issue about 12 books a year, the editor said. As a whole, UPK publishes about 50 books a year, working out to roughly one a week. Spend some time with their catalogue and prepare to be overwhelmed.
Loganbill still wants to find great writers and manuscripts, too. While many people imagine writing a book one day or another, not many actually sit down to do it, or sit down to do so in collaboration with an editor.
“I’m always looking for projects, for pitches, for ideas, for really any stage,” he said. “If there’s a talented writer with a story to tell, I’d love to talk.”

(Hollie Adams/Getty Images)Elections have consequences. So do Senate confirmations. Never has that been clearer than a recent warning from the government about pregnancy, another indication that science apparently no longer counts in regards to public health.
More on that below. First, some recent news in which Nebraska’s two U.S. senators — principals in the aforementioned confirmation process — were prominent: one with her take on free speech, the other to announce his intention to keep his job. Both were stories of some import but paled when we consider that at about the same time the republic was lurching further alist in an unruly, fact- and science-free sea.
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., told Nebraska Public Media in an interview earlier this month that she’s on board with the First Amendment in the aftermath of activist Charlie Kirk’s murder. She said, “Oh, I’m a strong supporter of free speech, but reactions like we’ve seen in some cases, where they are celebrating an assassination, celebrating a murder, that is not free speech, and those people need to be held responsible for the disgusting, horrible things that they are saying. It’s not free speech to celebrate the death of someone or to encourage attacks on other people. That’s not free speech. There, there is no issue that that kind of talk should be supported in any way whatsoever.”
The senator’s notion that such “talk” should go unsupported surely has plenty of support. That said, “disgusting, horrible” discourse, speech you and I might abhor, is nonetheless protected speech according to a long line of legal precedent such as Skokie v. National Socialist Party of America. Any speaker is open to the consequences of such speech, but unless it falls within the narrow confines of defamation, obscenity, threats or fighting words, incitement or fraud, the speaker has the Constitutional right to utter even the most heinous words without the government (Looking at you, FCC.) preclusion, censorship or punishment.
For his part, U.S. Sen Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., announced his intention to run as an incumbent in 2026. He touted his work in the Senate, his support of the current administration’s economic and immigration policies and his belief that his opponent, Dan Osborn, was a “fake” independent. Osborn responded by calling Ricketts a “fake senator.” 
Discussions about free speech can be enlightening. Plus, we could raise the civics conversation bar if more of our informed interactions centered on constitutional rights. 
I suppose back-and-forths over who’s real and who isn’t can temporarily entertain us — maybe even provide some comic relief from the drudgery of a political campaign — but one hopes the candidates raise the level of debate going forward. 
Speaking of raising the level of discussion, we’ve watched a verbose scolding of world leaders, an inexplicable summoning of our top military brass and, as of this writing, the readying for a government shutdown (followed surely by a blame game). Meanwhile, the president and his confirmed Secretary of Health and Human Services, without qualifying evidence, officially told pregnant women they should avoid an over-the-counter medication that has kept mothers-to-be and their children safe for years. They insist, without offering proof, that the medication increases the chances of a child being born on the autism spectrum.
They are objecting to acetaminophen, which most of us know as Tylenol. While the president and secretary offered no studies that would underscore the importance of avoiding Tylenol during pregnancy, the FDA responded the next day. It said “a causal relationship has not been established, and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature. It is also noted that acetaminophen is the only over-the-counter drug approved for use to treat fevers during pregnancy, and high fevers in pregnant women can pose a risk to their children. Additionally, aspirin and ibuprofen have well-documented adverse impacts on the fetus.”
The secretary has his job in part because of our aforementioned senators’ votes. If you’re keeping score at home, the final tally in the Senate was 52-48 for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation. His hearing was not without contention, although his history as a vaccine skeptic was front and center, not acetaminophen. His promise at those hearings to keep vaccines accessible has dimmed, too, with HHS’s recent policy changes pitting its recommendations against those of medical provider associations.
I’d be curious if either of our senators, supporters enough of the current HHS secretary to give him the department’s corner office, feel any responsibility toward their constituents to explain why a potentially dangerous public health policy is being created without the proper science to support it? 
Surely Nebraskans would want an explanation of those consequences.

But the new map excludes race, ethnicity and language data, leaving advocates scratching their heads.","A new iteration of the Maryland Department of the Environment's environmental justice map has drawn concern from advocates, who say that some communities facing pollution concerns are seeing lowered scores despite continued burdens. (Screenshot by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)A state map showing “environmental justice” communities is back online, after the state lost access, in a Trump administration purge, to federal data about communities considered overburdened by pollution and underserved by government services.
But the Maryland Department of the Environment removed race, ethnicity and language data from the calculus that determines an area’s environmental justice score on the updated map, leaving some environmental advocates scratching their heads.
Brandywine — a majority-Black Prince George’s County community surrounded by gas-fired power plants, a coal ash dump, a Superfund site and more — has long been considered a poster child for environmental injustice in Maryland. After being ranked above the 75th percentile in the previous map, a qualifier for more careful scrutiny in environmental permitting, it now has a score of 63 out of 100.
“It’s just a map change. It’s not a reality change,” said Brandywine community leader Kamita Gray. “It just appears to me that MDE blatantly does not want to be accountable in the massive pollution and the overburden of these heavy industrial industries.”
Industrial facilities applying for a permit must list the area’s environmental justice score, and Gray worries that Brandywine’s lowered score will make it even easier for polluting facilities to win new or more flexible permits, despite the fact that residents already feel inundated, particularly by air pollution.
In a statement, MDE spokesman Jay Apperson said the agency redesigned the map after the federal data loss “with pre-downloaded federal data and Maryland-specific data from our agency and the Maryland Department of Health.”

The agency website containing the map warns that race and other categories are not included in the environmental justice score calculation, but adds that the data is still available on the site “for informational purposes only.”
“Collecting and displaying this data allows users to evaluate the relationships between demographics and pollution burden, and can be used to better understand issues related to environmental justice and racial equity in Maryland,” reads the message. “MDE cautions users against using the ‘Underserved’ map layer, or its subcategories, in any manner that would be considered discriminatory under applicable law.”
MDE, which handles environmental permitting, argues that it “consider[s] the overburdened nature of all communities when evaluating the adequacy of permit conditions,” particularly when it comes to communities over the 75th percentile on the map, Apperson said.
With an overall score of 63, Brandywine falls out of that percentile, but it has scores above 75 for at least five key indicators, so it still receives a more careful review, Apperson said.
MDE also argues that the updated environmental justice map, called MDEnviroScreen, also includes a number of beneficial new features, including a new climate change vulnerability score and a more user-friendly design.
Sacoby Wilson, a University of Maryland professor focused on environmental justice issues, said he believes that the racial data was removed from the Maryland map in response to President Donald Trump’s (R) crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion programming, which he codified in an executive order on his first day back in office.
“They’re trying to shy away from that kind of scrutiny. So, I get that,” Wilson said. “Now, what it’s done is, it’s a less-inclusive tool by excluding race.”
Wilson believes that, even if MDE continues excluding race, there are ways to strengthen the map with “race-proximal” indicators that show whether an area has suffered from racist policies, such as redlining, for example. He points to the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development’s “Just Communities” tool, which takes into account homeownership rates, residential vacancy rates and more.
“We are working to explore race-proximal, race-adjacent indicators that are not race specifically, but capture the experience of racism,” Wilson said. “We are engaging with MDE to provide them with guidance and input on the types of indicators that could be really useful.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
MDE did not respond to questions about whether the map change came in response to anti-DEI pronouncements from the Trump administration.
During a July news conference in Baltimore, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that a loss of access to federal data at the beginning of Trump’s administration forced MDE’s map offline originally. The Trump administration removed the Environmental Protection Agency’s environmental justice map shortly after taking office, spurring a lawsuit from environmental groups.
At the July event, Moore touted the fact that Maryland brought the tool back online without the need for federal inputs.
“Just because we no longer have a willing partner in the federal government does not mean we just sit there now and take it,” Moore said. “We mobilize, and we step up, and that is why we are updating our environmental justice map to operate independently from our federal sources.”
Moore then signed an executive order requiring state agencies to reference the map during decision-making and produce reports on their efforts to uphold environmental justice, among other requirements.
After the MDE map was taken down, Jennifer Kunze, the Maryland organizing director for Clean Water Action, said she waited “on pins and needles” for its return. The result was disappointing, she said.
It isn’t just Brandywine, Kunze said. She said that the tool seems to struggle to account for environmental justice concerns in the state’s rural areas, lowering scores for areas near Eastern Shore poultry houses, and the former Luke Paper Mill site in Allegany County.
Kunze is among a group of advocates working on the next iteration of the CHERISH Our Communities Act, a bill that failed in the last legislative session, that would have set new requirements for pollution permits in environmental justice communities, and expressly let MDE deny permits on environmental justics grounds. Last year’s bill included all Census tracts with a score at or above 75 — and a 1.5-mile radius around them.
“Folks doing EJ organizing on the ground and living in frontline communities know what communities need to be covered by protections like the CHERISH Act and this tool — the way it’s currently calculated — leaves some of them out,” Kunze said.
Moore signs environmental justice order, amid federal government’s anti-DEI push

Wilson, who has also worked on the bill, said the group is considering alternatives for this year’s bill, including lowering the threshold, using a different measurement, or allowing communities with a score over a certain level to opt in to receive additional scrutiny during environmental permitting.
In August, Gray sent a letter to MDE leadership on behalf of the Brandywine/TB Southern Region Neighborhood Coalition, urging them to publish the rationale for dropping race, ethnicity, language and age data from the environmental justice score, and conduct an audit assessing the scores rendered by the new map. She said the previous EPA environmental justice map put Brandywine in the 97th percentile.
Gray was among the advocates who filed a 2016 federal civil rights complaint, arguing that an effort to place a new power plant near the community violated anti-discrimination law. The complaint resulted in a settlement with Maryland agencies.
Gray said that while the Moore administration has been more vocal about upholding environmental justice, including by signing its recent executive order, she continues to see be frustrated by permit decisions and potential new facilities, including a proposed concrete batching facility.
“It’s stopping nothing on the ground,” Gray said.
Greg Sawtell, a community advocate in Baltimore’s Curtis Bay, agreed. That community abuts the Curtis Bay coal piers, and is close to a number of other industrial facilities. A medical waste incinerator, which paid a historic fine for pollution in 2013, sits across Curtis Creek.
Sawtell, the zero-waste just transition director with the South Baltimore Community Land Trust, said the community has continued to track pollution events with cameras and air monitors, including puffs of dark black smoke emitted by the incinerator and clouds of coal dust from the piers.
“While we have greater willingness to acknowledge that Curtis Bay is overburdened, and talk about it, talk about it quite a bit … Those events haven’t stopped. The government hasn’t done the things that it must do in order to prevent that,” Sawtell said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-resized-scaled-e1759142998650-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-29 07:58:47.292917

Many of those cuts were averted, but the DDA now faces a challenge of determining recipients' eligibility for services. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)A group of Medicaid recipients has sued the Maryland Department of Health for a “dysfunctional” system of determining eligibility for services that they say has denied services to those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The failure of the department’s annual “redetermination” process has already caused a number of recipients to lose coverage, the suit says, and has the potential to expose thousands of disabled Marylanders with disabilities to institutionalization or homelessness as they lose the services that allow them to live independently.
The lawsuit was also brought by The Arc Montgomery County, a service provider, which says it has provided $9 million in care to clients since January 2024 for Developmental Disabilities Administration services that have not been reimbursed by the state.
The suit, filed Thursday in Montgomery County Circuit Court, seeks to be certified as a class action on behalf of all 18,000 state Medicaid recipients
“The breakdown of Maryland’s Medicaid redetermination process threatens to a have a disastrous impact on Marylanders with intellectual and developmental disabilities,” Kevin Docherty, the lead attorney in the suit, said in a statement from The Arc Montgomery County.
A spokesperson for the health department said Friday that the agency “does not comment on litigation.”
People with developmental disabilities seeing Medicaid coverage lapse more often

The named plaintiffs in the case — Ursula Battle, Constance Farrell, Frank Lee and Yolanda Puzzo — are all participants in the Community Pathways program, one of three “waiver” programs offered under Maryland’s Medicaid system, along with Community Supports and Family Supports. The services are jointly funded by the state and federal governments.
The suit says Community Pathways is “the most comprehensive waiver, paying for residential services, such as group homes; support services, including behavioral support, environmental assessments, caregiver training, and education; and day services, including employment support.”
Community Supports is similar, but does not include a residential component. Family Supports is for care of children from birth to age 21.
Participants in all the waiver programs have to prove eligibility annually. Recipients can earn up to three times the monthly Supplemental Security Income payment — currently $2,901 a month, according to the suit — and still be eligible.
Annual redeterminations were suspended in March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when states were prohibited from canceling Medicaid coverage for most recipients. But redetermination was restarted in May 2023 and advocates, and the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, say the department has struggled to keep pace with applications since then.
“Redetermination should be a straightforward process, but, for Marylanders with IDD [intellectual and development disabilities], it is not,” says the lawsuit. “Since May 2023, MDH has disenrolled people with IDD from DDA waiver programs in violation of the due process rights they are afforded under federal and state law. Many longtime participants in the waiver programs have been disenrolled without notice, a meaningful opportunity to be heard, or a reasoned decision from MDH regarding their eligibility.”
Among the problems since redetermination restarted, the lawsuit says, are notices sent to the wrong address — in many cases, an address that The Arc Montgomery County has not used for more than five years — and a failure to notify recipients that their services are in danger of being cut off. The department routinely fails to acknowledge receipt of redetermination paperwork or says it did not receive an application — sometimes by sending a notice to the wrong address — and applicants’ phone calls and emails to the department are not returned.
Hundreds of recipients who did receive notice that they were being disenrolled got letters citing a part of the Maryland Code of Regulations that “does not exist, and has never existed,” according to the suit.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
When they appeal their disenrollment, recipients do not get a decision within the required 90 days and often go months without a hearing, the plaintiffs argue. And even though the state is supposed to continue services while an appeal is pending, it will “consistently terminate benefits upon MDH’s issuance of a disenrollment notice, leaving participants without benefits while they are seeking to correct MDH’s arbitrary and erroneous actions,” the suit says.
“On the whole, Maryland’s redetermination process is so opaque, dysfunctional and arbitrary that disenrolled DDA waiver participants, and even long-established provider organizations like The Arc Montgomery County are unable to navigate it,” the lawsuit said.
Advocates said this summer, as the problem was becoming more evident, that the issue might be the result of a loss of experienced staff at the health department as it was hit with the Medicaid “unwinding” in 2023. That’s when it was forced to determine if everyone on the Medicaid rolls, which had ballooned to 1.8 million during the pandemic, was still eligible.
By summer 2024, state officials had reduced Medicaid rolls to 1.69 million, and that number was down to prepandemic levels of about 1.5 million as of May 2025, according to the department.
There is no exact count of the number of of Medicaid recipients who may have been accidentally disenrolled. But, after complaints from advocates and caregivers, the department acknowledged in July that it had restored coverage for 263 people who had been erroneously disenrolled and said it was in the “process of continuing to do a full review of all the particular circumstances of which the disenrollments occurred.”
The Arc Montgomery County said that at least 30 people it supports, including the four named plaintiffs in the suit, have been erroneously disenrolled during redetermination, even though they continue to be financially eligible.
“We stand with our co-plaintiffs and all Marylanders with intellectual and developmental disabilities in this fight to secure the rights and benefits to which they are entitled,” said Daria Cervantes, CEO of The Arc Montgomery County, in a prepared statement.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_dda_advocacyday_fy26cuts-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 06:56:30.226729

The University of West Florida is being run by Manny Diaz Jr., a former social studies teacher (and ex-Commissioner of Education) but, given that he’s Ron DeSantis’ choice, he’ll likely get the permanent position.
Florida Atlantic and Florida International have had undistinguished former legislators imposed on them; and USF president Rhea Law has announced her resignation, creating an opening for another DeSantis-friendly politician.
At the University of Florida, our supposed flagship institution, the provost is interim, the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Law, and Arts are being run by interim deans, and 30 chair or director positions are vacant.
This obvious dysfunction has not gone unnoticed: The best and brightest academics are not exactly enthusiastic about working in Florida.
I’ve been teaching for more than 30 years; I love my job at Florida State — for now, at least. The students are wonderful (most of them), and I admire, even like, my colleagues (most of them).
Ron DeSantis hasn’t gotten around to trying to trash our reputation and cripple our academic freedom the way they have at New College, UWF, and UF.
Not yet, anyway.
The state’s “post-tenure review,” in which professors (who already undergo yearly reviews) must further justify their existence to the Board of Trustees, has driven some of the most productive academics out of Florida.
Nearly a third of Florida’s faculty want to leave the state.
If I were a young professor looking for a job, I’d avoid Florida.
Churn at UF
Our state government is authoritarian and proudly ignorant, hell-bent on destroying what makes universities great — freedom of expression, critical thinking, creativity, exposing students to ideas that may challenge them (or even upset them), unfettered research, scientific rigor, and advances in knowledge based on data.
Why would a scholar want to pursue a career in such a fact-resistant, small-minded, censorious state?
As has become its habit, the University of Florida has changed presidents. Again.
University of Florida Interim President Donald Landry. (Photo via UF X account)
Dr. Donald Landry has become UF’s interim president, replacing Kent Fuchs, the former interim president and one-time actual president who stepped back in when Ben Sasse, the unqualified spendthrift former president resigned under a cloud, and then had to stay on when the trustees’ choice, Dr. Santa Ono, who’d resigned as president of the University of Michigan to take the job at Florida, fell foul of the Board of  Governors’ anti-DEI hysteria.
This is not how serious institutions of higher education conduct themselves.
But then, Florida is not a serious place.
Enter Landry, late of the Columbia Center for Human Longevity and a medical doctor with “elite” Ivy degrees.
Landry seems positively giddy at becoming UF’s latest interim, calling it “the culmination of my career” and “the opportunity of a lifetime,” and demonstrates an Olympic-standard talent for sucking up, calling UF “a preeminent university in what one could argue is the preeminent state in this nation at this moment in time.”
He obviously wants the permanent job. The trustees obviously want him to have it: They’re paying him $2 million for this year, with the possibility of a $500,000 bonus.
If they don’t give him the permanent job, they have to pay him another $2 million.
Purge of academics
While the fact-based community knows Florida is Ground Zero for the climate crisis, Landry told UF’s right-wing trustees what they wanted to hear, insisting the science is “not settled,” even though the science is indeed settled: 97% of climate scientists agree on anthropogenic causes of global warming.
Maybe they should have asked him if the Theory of Gravity is sound or if the sun orbits the earth.
Or if he’ll defend professors’ freedom of speech.
DeSantis and his anti-education squad have passed laws banning anything that smells of DEI, clamped down on the honest study of American history, pitched hissy fits over pro-Palestinian campus protests, and railed against so-called “woke” professors who have the temerity to recognize that gay people exist, trans people exist, systemic racism is real, and science doesn’t care what you believe.
Now they’re going after educators who dare disparage Charlie Kirk.
Let’s stipulate that Kirk did not deserve his violent death. No one does.
He was a human being. He had as much right as the rest of us to speak his mind.
Which is the whole point.
A University of Miami neurologist was fired for posting, “What was done to Charlie Kirk has been done to countless Palestinian babies, children, girls, boys, women and men not just over the past two years of the ongoing genocide, but decades.”
A retired University of Florida law professor was stripped of his emeritus title for saying, “I did not want him to die. I reserve that wish for Trump.”
At FAU, three professors have been placed on administrative leave. One, a tenured professor of art history, didn’t comment on Kirk’s death, but re-posted others calling Kirk bigoted and racist.
It’s not illegal.
As the great Rick Wilson says, “tastelessness is not treason.”
‘Outrageous things’
Kirk identified as a “free speech absolutist,” declaring, “You should be allowed to say outrageous things,” even if you upset people.
Among the outrageous things Charlie Kirk said:
On journalist Joy Reid, the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, former First Lady Michelle Obama, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson being “affirmative action picks,” he said, “You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.”
On women: They should “submit to a godly man,” marry early, and have babies.
On Jews: “The philosophical foundation of anti-whiteness has been largely financed by Jewish donors in the country.”
On guns: “I think it’s worth [it] to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.”
As offensive, stupid, prejudiced, or karma-inviting as you or I might find what Kirk said, we live under a system of laws that protect his right to say it.
‘Civility’
The question is whether the DeSantis administration and Florida’s education establishment, including UF’s new president, understand that freedom of speech applies to all of us.
Donald Landry says he’s big on civility: “I will be locking in a culture of freedom of academic expression tempered by civility.”
Christopher Rufo via Facebook
Landry enjoys the support of Christopher Rufo, who calls him “a principled leader who will reverse ideological capture and restore truth-seeking within the institution” at UF.
In case you’ve forgotten Rufo, he’s yet another pious conservative who likes to claim he cherishes free expression on campus, telling PBS News Hour in May the DeSantis administration has “expanded the range of discourse in higher education,” and boasting, “At New College of Florida, for example, where I’m a trustee, we have probably the widest range of discourse of any public university in the United States.”
A habit in Florida
Getting rid of a visiting professor who focuses on Black history contradicts Rufo’s smug assertion.
No one at New College accused Erik Wallenberg of incompetence or bad teaching or any other malfeasance.
But Rufo called him “a pure left-wing mad-lib” and sniffed, “New College will no longer be a jobs program for middling, left-wing intellectuals.”
Firing a professor because you don’t like his politics is not evidence of a wide range of discourse.
It’s also likely illegal.
Landry should take note and someone should alert him to Florida’s long, shameful history of McCarthyite attacks on academics.
In the late 1950s, the Legislature started investigating universities, determined to search out communists, biology professors who taught evolution, English professors who assigned “The Grapes of Wrath” and the poetry of Allen Ginsberg, and especially gay people in the student body or the faculty.
Scores were fired or expelled.
Perhaps former president/former interim president Kent Fuchs can tell Donald Landry about the time he, and UF trustees head Mori Hosseini, tried to ban four law professors from signing onto an amicus brief opposing a state law making it hard for former felons to vote, and stop three other professors  from testifying as expert witnesses on the ground that their actions might impede Ron DeSantis’ agenda.
Landry’s UF contract stipulates that a number of important decisions, including hiring, must be approved by Mori Hosseini — which means a highly partisan political appointee will exercise even more control over how the university works, what’s allowed, what’s censored.

Franklin understood that the great experiment of republican democracy requires action, and that people must work diligently to maintain such a precious form of self-government. Unlike the authoritarian governments of his time, where citizens were subjected to the demands of a ruler, democratic practices must be taught. Consequently, the civic education and engagement of an informed population are imperative in order for a democratic system of government to sustain and thrive.

State Rep. Kevin Brown
In 2023, Connecticut took a major step towards ensuring that our future generations are well-versed in the function of government and the importance of participation within their communities. Created in statute, the Civics Education, Civics Engagement & Media Literacy Task Force was formed to study the level of civic knowledge and engagement in our state, as well as our ability to navigate the ever-changing media platforms that exist in the modern 24-hour news cycle.  The bipartisan and diverse task force membership spent nearly a year checking the civic pulse of our state, only to find that while a variety of programs are working to increase participation in civic life, we fall short of truly preparing our youth to take the lead in their communities as they come of age.
As task force co-chair, a legislator, and most importantly a high school civics teacher, the dearth of civics education in our state causes me tremendous concern.  After decades of marginalized social studies instruction, due largely to a reliance on standardized testing to measure school performance, many students who enter our classrooms have little understanding of how their government works, or what their role in the process might be. 
In 2022, only 24 percent of U.S. students reached the “proficient” standard on the NAEP Civics Assessment. Volunteerism, which has seen a slight improvement since a major drop during covid, has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. Voter turnout in the last Connecticut municipal election cycle sat just above 30% statewide, and even lower in some of the communities with the greatest needs. 
With so many major issues facing our state and nation, it is easy to look past what many of us take for granted. Recent events, however, including assassinations of political figures on both sides of the aisle, should serve as a warning that a lack of civic knowledge and the ability to discern credible information can lead to an unhealthy distrust of the institution of government, vitriolic rhetoric, and a breakdown of democratic practices as we know them.


All hope is not lost, however. One simple way to encourage our youth to engage in their communities is to reward them for it.  In the 2025 legislative session, there was an opportunity to do just that with the passage of HB 7009, which included the establishment of a state seal of civics education, allowing graduates to earn a seal on their diploma certifying that they have shown proficiency in civic skills and engagement over the course of their high school career. 
While this bill passed overwhelmingly in the state House of Representatives, it was not taken up in the Senate. As a state, we must make a commitment to our future and the future of democracy.  While there are many important legislative priorities each year, our ability to address these issues through the democratic process rests upon our ability to educate and engage the public in the practice. 
If children grow up learning how democratic government works, along with the impact their participation can have, they are more likely to engage in their communities as adults. If they can identify credible sources, they will develop opinions that are supported by hard evidence and be able to take meaningful informed action. 
We must put a high level of emphasis on civics and media literacy in the classroom throughout the K-12 experience. Partnering with organizations like the Connecticut Democracy Center, Connecticut Bar Association, and CT Humanities, among others, school districts can develop engaging curricula and provide opportunities for students and adults alike to see the value of civic participation. 
As the Constitution State, let us take the lead on this Constitution Day by paying democracy forward, prioritizing civic education, engagement, and media literacy, and guaranteeing that these subjects are prioritized in schools and communities across Connecticut.

Ned Lamont’s veto of House Bill 5002: An Act Concerning Housing and the Needs of Homeless Persons and Senate Bill 8: Protections for Workers and Enhancements to Workers’ Rights.
What are these bills about and what will they do?
H.B. 5002 could be better named the “Democrats Hate Small Town Life in Connecticut Bill.” Among other things, it’s an attempt to mandate far left DEI housing policies into every city and town across the state. Many Democrats appear to believe that all local zoning ordinances are racist and discriminatory. Their solution for increasing the amount of low-income housing in Connecticut is to force the cities and towns to comply with state-issued mandates.
Democratically elected planning and zoning commissions determine local zoning ordinances. They reflect the needs of their municipalities and residents in accordance with current laws. H.B.5002 would sideline local commissions and put the power to decide where, what type and how much low-income housing will be built in the hands of state lawmakers. Compliance with the first version of this bill would have been devastatingly costly to small communities. Even the later, slightly watered down version would be financially problematic for many small towns.
H.B.5002 is nothing but a power grab for Democrat lawmakers in Hartford. It’s a crack in the door Democrats will use to push DEI policies into small communities with limited resources. Unaffordable housing is an inflationary problem of government’s own making. Homelessness is a combination of economic and social problems. But more regulations are not the answer.
Household income in Connecticut did not keep up with the housing market because we lack better job opportunities for our people. Why don’t Democrat lawmakers work to bring back the good paying manufacturing jobs they drove away with high taxes, high-energy costs and excess regulation? Then more people could afford to buy homes again. Governor Lamont was right to veto this bill.
Senate Bill 8 should have been called the “Taxpayers Funding Endless Strikes Bill.” S.B.8 aims to give unionized workers taxpayer funded unemployment benefits while out on strike. This is the second time Governor Lamont vetoed this bill.
If any company needs another reason to not do business in Connecticut, here’s one more manufactured by none other than our own legislature, with the help of public employee unions. How will employers react to the State of Connecticut injecting themselves into private labor negotiations? Would public funding of protracted strikes stifle job growth? You bet it would.
Try to imagine the effect it will have on state, county and municipal union contract negotiations. Public employees can go on strike against their employers, we the taxpayers, and we taxpayers must pay them unemployment benefits until they get what they want from us? Sounds more like legalized extortion than fair labor negotiations.
And all of this to be financed by an overtaxed population of Connecticut workers who (according to a 2022 Nutmeg Research Study) earn on average 40% less in pay and benefits than a State of Connecticut employee who does similar work. Governor Lamont was right to veto both of these bills. In this instance he stood up for the taxpayers, which is something Democrats in our legislature almost never do. Thank you, Governor Lamont.

Dover, Del. – Delaware has completed its first comprehensive property tax reassessment in over 40 years across all three counties: New Castle since 1983, Kent since 1987, and Sussex since 1974. This process was mandated following a 2018 lawsuit by civil rights groups, including the NAACP, which argued that outdated valuations led to inequities in school funding reliant on property taxes.
The reassessments, conducted by Tyler Technologies, revealed that residential property values surged, often by 400-500% or more, while commercial values rose more modestly or declined. The reassessment process aimed to be revenue-neutral, with tax rates adjusted down to result in no change in revenue for either the county or school districts. However, the shift in valuations between residential and commercial/non-residential properties significantly altered the tax burden. This disproportionately affected homeowners, with many facing tax increases of hundreds to thousands of dollars annually, particularly in New Castle County where the residential share of the tax burden jumped from 67% to about 76%. School districts in some areas also captured a 10% “windfall” in revenue allowed under state law, exacerbating the outcry.
Public frustration peaked in the summer of 2025, prompting an August 12 special legislative session where seven bills were passed for short-term relief. These included HB 242, which allows New Castle County school districts to reset and split tax rates for residential vs. non-residential properties for the 2025-2026 school year, reducing homeowner bills by shifting some burden back to commercial properties. HB 240 and HB 241 establish payment plans for residential taxes without penalties, interest, or liens if complied with, extending protections through 2026 for longer plans. SCR 122 mandates a statewide review of the reassessment process to ensure future ones (next in Kent 2029, New Castle/Sussex 2030) are fairer and more transparent. Other measures include quarterly reporting on payment plan data and protections against aggressive collection.
These were stopgap fixes; long-term reforms, including broader tax framework changes and exemptions, were deferred to 2026. In response, Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola (D-Newark), announced committee assignments on September 3, 2025, saying “The special committees… [are] tasked with investigating Delaware’s first statewide property reassessment in more than two generations… to evaluate the process, its impacts on property taxes and education funding, and possible legislative responses.” Democratic leaders have emphasized the committees as a transparent, bipartisan effort to review the reassessment process, gather public input, and develop long-term reforms, building on the August special session’s short-term relief measures.
Republicans have criticized the effort as lacking true bipartisanship, claiming their input, such as on bills like HB 73 to double senior credits, was sidelined. Per House Republican Minority Leader, Tim Dukes, and Minority Whip, Jeff Speigelmanj, “Democrats hold overwhelming majorities in both chambers… And they’ve used these numbers to dictate the reassessment debate in an entirely partisan fashion… Republicans [were] not given input or advance notice about the new committees.”
The special committees are structured as separate but coordinated House and Senate committees, each with bipartisan membership. They focus on valuation methods, tax impacts, education funding ties, exemptions, and equity. The committees aim to probe Tyler Technologies’ methodologies, assess homeowner hardships, compare Delaware’s protections to other states, and develop a “roadmap” for equitable future reassessments and targeted relief, such as for seniors and fixed-income households.
The format includes four public hearings in the Senate Chamber at Legislative Hall (411 Legislative Avenue, Dover). All are open to the public, with in-person attendance and livestreaming available at legis.delaware.gov. No registration is required, but agendas and witness lists will be posted closer to the dates.
The updated meeting schedule as of mid-September 2025 is as follows:

Hearing #1: Tuesday, September 30, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. – The Recent Reassessment: Overview of the process, methodologies used by Tyler Technologies, lessons learned, and initial inequities identified.
Hearing #2: Week of October 6, 2025 (Exact date TBD; likely Monday/Tuesday) – Property Reassessment and the Law: Legal background, compliance issues, and guardrails for future cycles.
Hearing #3: Week of October 20, 2025 (Exact date TBD) – Delawareans and Their Property Taxes: Impacts on residents, comparisons to other states’ programs, and updates to exemptions post-reassessment.
Hearing #4: Week of November 3, 2025 (Exact date TBD) – Property Reassessment and Education Funding: How reassessments affect school revenues, the 10% windfall rule, and balancing equity in funding without overburdening taxpayers.

The committee hearings will be open to public attendance at Legislative Hall and streamed on the General Assembly website, www.legis.delaware.gov. Post-hearing, the committees will compile findings and propose legislation for the January 2026 session.

Justin Taylor/The Current GA/CatchLight LocalPrivate schools in 102 Georgia cities received $5.4 million in state voucher funds this fall, as parents took advantage of the state’s newly expanded program aimed at helping students from low-performing public school get private education.
Private schools in McDonough, Covington and Conyers received as much money as schools in in more populous places like Columbus, Savannah and Atlanta.

 
Of the total $7.1 million program funds distributed so far, most have gone to educational organizations predominantly affiliated with Christian churches, according to data from the Georgia Education Savings Authority, the state agency set up to manage the program.
The private school with the largest amount of funds from the voucher program was Newton County’s Covington Academy with $120,701. It is the only school to have received more than $100,000. Tuition there runs $5,500, plus fees.
The remaining program funding spent this fall — $1.7 million — went to 153 companies, including giant retailer Amazon, that sell school supplies such as computers, tablets and books, records show.

Christian schools, Amazon attract most Georgia voucher school dollars

Under the program’s guidelines, families receive $6,500 per year for each child to pay for the switch to a private school or homeschool or other educational supports.
It will take at least 15 months before Georgians will have metrics from GESA’s first review to evaluate whether the promise of the sweeping policy — better quality education and more competition for public schooling — is fulfilled.
