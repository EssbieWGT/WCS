Library of CongressNine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.

But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
 Farming faiths and harvest festivals

The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.
Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
 ‘Days of Thanksgiving’

The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
 Harvest feast of 1621

Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
 Pilgrims’ primacy

The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.
The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
 Rising immigration

Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.
Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

(Stock photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined a lawsuit alongside 21 other state attorneys general against the U.S. Department of Agriculture over guidance issued by the department.
The lawsuit said the new guidance would eliminate eligibility for legal immigrants who had previously been eligible to receive such benefits, including those who had been granted asylum or refugee status.
The guidance, issued at the end of October, was intended to provide instructions on how to implement program changes passed in July as a part of H.R. 1, also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which narrowed eligibility for noncitizens.
“The guidance in reality goes beyond the act, arbitrarily excluding from SNAP many lawful permanent residents who remain eligible under the statutory scheme established by Congress,” the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court of Oregon Eugene Division said.
Nothing in the bill, the filing continues, would prohibit individuals who were at one point refugees, individuals granted asylum, or parolees, now groups no longer eligible for SNAP, from gaining eligibility for the program if and when they gain status as lawful permanent residents. 
“The law is clear on who can receive SNAP benefits, yet the Trump Administration is trying to strip rightful recipients of the support they need to feed their families,” Nessel said in a press release from her office. “It is my hope that the Court puts an end to this unlawful guidance and stops the White House’s ongoing chaos and confusion over Americans’ ability to put food on the table.”
The lawsuit is seeking an injunction to the changes that would prevent states from implementing the eligibility changes in question.
Nessel and 20 other attorneys general sent a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last week asking for clarification on the new guidance, but they did not receive a response from Rollins.
The lawsuit also alleges that the U.S. Department of Agriculture misapplied its own rules on new regulations about SNAP error rates within states — the legislation passed in July gave a 120-day window for states to address their error rates, but the guidance issued in October stated that the window for that exclusionary period would end on Nov. 1 — a Saturday, one day after the guidance was issued. 
The calculation was done based on the day of the passage of the bill initially, not when the guidance was issued, which Nessel and the other attorneys general argue is incorrect based on federal laws.

President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration in mid-September. The storms the declaration covered happened May 18-22. At least 50 homes were destroyed in southeastern Montana during the storms and water supply contamination was also an issue.
“One of our core responsibilities at HUD is to help rebuild homes, businesses, and communities after natural disasters,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a press release. “We are supporting the Crow Tribe of Montana by providing financial flexibility and disaster recovery resources to those impacted by the recent disasters.”
In a press release Wednesday, HUD noted several options for those impacted by the disaster.
Recipients of Indian Housing Block Grants and Indian Community Development Block Grants can apply for necessary waivers and flexibilities for disaster relief. 
Additionally, there’s a three-month moratorium on foreclosures.
“A 90-day moratorium is issued on foreclosures of mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) as well as foreclosures of mortgages to Native American borrowers guaranteed under the Section 184 Indian Home Loan Guarantee program,” the press release said.
The move also allows individuals to finance the purchase or refinance of a house, along with its repair, through a single mortgage, the release said, adding homeowners can also finance the rehabilitation of their existing home if it’s been damaged.
There’s also further flexibility for those in various federal housing programs.

If not for a series of tones broadcasting her location, no one would’ve known she had died.
Like dozens of other Yellowstone National Park wolves involved in a three-decade-long study, researchers collared wolf 1331F as a pup in 2021 to track her movements. Gray with ribbons of brown fur fading into her pale muzzle and legs, the young wolf lived with the Wapiti Lake Pack, one of the largest in Yellowstone.
Wildlife photographer V.C. Wald watched 1331 supervise black wolf pups hunting a wounded bison on the shore of the Firehole River in the winter of 2023-’24. Easily visible from the road, the pups tried to take the bison head-on, only to scatter as it bluff charged. Then, 1331 demonstrated how to approach the massive ungulate more safely from behind, nipping at its hind quarters, Wald recalls, “[she was] a teacher, of young wolves, and of me.”

The scene isn’t out of the ordinary for the Wapiti Lake Pack, whose territory encompasses Yellowstone’s sagebrush-covered Hayden Valley in the center of the park. They chase elk and bison. They play and sun themselves on cold winter days. Much of this activity occurs under the gaze of humans. But every now and then, pack members leave the park.
In late 2024, Yellowstone Wolf Project telemetry data suggest 1331 started a journey away from her pack. She headed north. First, she spent time around Mammoth Hot Springs. Then she crossed the park’s boundary into Montana. While tourists often lined roads to watch 1331 and her packmates inside the park, wolf watchers are sparser in the rugged and mountainous mix of public and private land just north of Yellowstone. Wolf 1331 had no way of knowing, but she’d crossed an invisible line where the national park gives way to state rule. It’s a consequential threshold: Wolves are protected from hunting on one side, but can be legally killed by gun, trap or snare on the other.
Park officials don’t know if 1331 was permanently leaving her pack or if she would have eventually returned to Wapiti Lake’s territory; it’s not uncommon for female wolves of her age to disperse for days or even weeks leading up to breeding season in February — sort of a lupine rumspringa. But they do know she’d left the pack far behind. On Jan. 24, 2025, staff with the Yellowstone Wolf Project drove north of the park, wielding bulky telemetry equipment to listen for collared elk and wolves. They heard 1331’s signal, indicating she’d moved farther into Montana than ever. But, the beeps suggested, she hadn’t budged in at least 12 hours.
Park staff turned the information over to Montana’s fish and game agency. Wolf 1331 would ultimately be found dead in a trap set by a prolific wolf hunter who manages a large ranch about 10 miles north of Yellowstone. The man who trapped 1331 would receive a warning for violating state trap-check laws and no other punishment. Her journey had come to an end roughly a month after it began.

The Yellowstone bubble
Wolf 1331F’s fate was unusual only in that she made it so far north. When wolves leave the park, they die — often, quickly.
Yellowstone’s roughly 100 wolves are among the most famous and beloved in the world, attracting throngs of wolf-admiring tourists who spend tens of millions of dollars in the region every year. However, protected by federal law and tolerant of their adoring fans, Yellowstone wolves are uniquely vulnerable to hunters and trappers in surrounding states where killing wolves is legal. Their destinies are often shaped by which of the three surrounding state boundaries they cross.

“When we look at the fate of collared wolves that leave Yellowstone, most commonly they don’t survive the next hunting season,” Yellowstone Wolf Project leader Dan Stahler said in a May 2024 interview.
Heading into Wyoming, wolves encounter wilderness and tightly controlled hunts, but greater danger beyond. Step into Idaho and it’s a free-fire zone, though few wolves go that way. Journeys north into Montana are the most common and have proven the most deadly, despite some state efforts to take it easy on park wolves.
Yellowstone’s wolves die from hunting and trapping outside the park every season, but things seem to be getting worse. From 2009-2020, about 4.3 wolves from Yellowstone were killed legally by hunters and trappers each year, according to National Park Service data. From 2021-2024, that number nearly tripled when an average of 12.75 wolves died annually, according to Yellowstone Wolf Project data.
It was clear to Doug Smith, retired lead of the Yellowstone Wolf Project, that the park’s porous boundaries would be an issue almost immediately after wolves were reintroduced in 1995. “This is a long-term problem for wildlife management, and particularly wolves,” Smith said in an interview this fall.
Inside Yellowstone, wolves are managed “for the benefit and enjoyment of the people,” the now-famous language adorning the top of Roosevelt Arch, a striking stone gateway often surrounded by selfie-taking tourists at the park’s North Entrance. The sentiment springs from the 1916 act creating the National Park Service and stops at the park’s border. Outside Yellowstone, the states take over wolf management. There, wolves can get into trouble. They kill livestock, the occasional pet, and lots and lots of elk. And they’re especially naive to the many dangers in the new world around them.

Even in the early days of reintroduction, Smith remembers phone calls urging him to do the impossible: keep wolves inside the park. Back then, wolves had federal protections both in and out of Yellowstone. Hunting them was illegal, whether in Montana, Wyoming or Idaho, or inside Yellowstone itself. But within a month of releasing the park’s first wolves from their enclosure, a hunter named Chad McKittrick illegally shot and killed a male wolf, numbered 10M, after it left the park and ventured onto private land near Red Lodge, Montana.
Fast-forward nearly 30 years and death also awaited 1329M, a striking green-eyed black male wolf, when he left Yellowstone. Researchers captured and collared 1329, born into the Wapiti Lake Pack just like 1331F. He was caught and joined the ranks of research wolves in 2021, the same year they collared 1331F as a pup. A year later, park scientists documented the young male, with a touch of silver on his chin, getting into a scuffle with other males, which could have spurred a dispersal. His collar’s GPS data shows he left Yellowstone on May 14, 2022, heading south. “[1329] beelined it all the way down through the trophy game wolf area,” said Stahler, the current Yellowstone Wolf Project leader.

The state of Wyoming tightly regulates wolf hunting in an area where wolves are managed as “trophy game” adjacent to Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, with the area closed to hunting in the spring. But 1329 kept moving. GPS data shows his route, loping straight through the heart of Jackson Hole, then south, looping through the Wyoming and Salt River ranges. The black wolf headed into a valley where, three years later, Sublette County resident Cody Roberts would fight a felony animal cruelty charge for allegedly making a public spectacle of a wounded, juvenile wolf in a bar before the animal died. The incident made international news and divided the small Western Wyoming community. Wolves are fewer here. There’s a reason.
Within two weeks of leaving Yellowstone, the roughly 2-year-old 1329 crossed another boundary and left Wyoming’s regulated wolf “trophy game” area for its “predator zone,” which covers 85% of the state and where there are virtually no regulations on how wolves can be killed. Running down and bludgeoning wolves with snowmobiles here is legal. The departure meant he could be killed any time of year, by almost any means, and without a license.
Toward the end of June 2022, wolf 1329 stopped moving in the mountains near Salt River Pass, near where the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem transitions into the Great Basin. He’d stepped into a steel-jawed leghold trap. “It had been in the trap about four days,” Stahler says, “based on the location and movement.” By June 26, the trapped wolf was dead. The Yellowstone biologist’s best guess is that 1329 was exposed to the elements and died of dehydration. States surrounding the park require trappers to frequently check their wolf traps to reduce animals’ suffering and minimize harm to non-target species. Negligence is illegal.

‘Risky life choice’ 
Wolves in the Northern Rockies are no strangers to controversy. Indeed, politicians in all three states surrounding Yellowstone have long seized on wolves as a prime example of federal overreach. “I remain seriously concerned with the uncertainty that continues to surround Yellowstone wolf reintroduction as it moves forward,” former Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer wrote to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt in 1995, after wolves were already on the ground. Former Idaho Gov. Butch Otter said he’d be the first to bid on a wolf tag back in 2007. And Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte was issued a warning for killing a Yellowstone wolf without the proper trapper education in 2021.
Death by hunting, trapping or wildlife management official is the most common fate for wolves that leave Yellowstone National Park. Even in a natural system, the act of dispersing is already a “risky life choice,” according to Stahler. Solo wolves end up in territories of other wolf packs, where they clash and get killed. In fact, within Yellowstone, wolves are the leading cause of wolf death.

While the number of wolves that spend the vast majority of their time inside Yellowstone has stayed relatively static for more than two decades, wolf populations outside the park have grown by leaps and bounds. That’s in part because some Yellowstone wolves successfully dispersed and survived. At the same time, other wolves reintroduced in Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness established and bred. And yet more wolves filtered down from the north, crossing the Canadian border into the U.S. Today, populations of animals as reclusive as wolves are tough to estimate, but the most recent figures for Montana and Idaho wolf populations are roughly 1,100 and 1,200, respectively. In Wyoming, which has less mountainous, treed habitat, there are fewer wolves — about 350 — and they’re counted with much greater precision.
While those wolf populations outside the park grew, the human population inside Yellowstone expanded, too. Park visitation hovered around 3 million annually at the time of wolf reintroduction in 1995. Today, that number is closer to 5 million, evidenced by the sprawl of souvenir shops in the Yellowstone gateway towns of Jackson, Wyoming and Gardiner, Montana where tourists snap up T-shirts, stuffed bison and elk toys, and art emblazoned with wolves. This increased visitation, wolf biologist Smith says, is the biggest issue facing Yellowstone National Park as a whole.
“It’s the best place in the world to view wild wolves,” says Smith, adding that in the early days of wolf reintroduction, finding wolves inside the park was exclusive, inside information. That’s changed nowadays, he says, with the influx of eager, wolf- and grizzly-watching tourists. “There’s no inside tips anymore. Just look for the traffic jam.”

Wolf-watching tourism alone contributes at least $82 million annually to communities bordering the park, the most recent data show. However, all those people lining the roads and hillsides of Yellowstone come at a cost. “[When wolves] leave the park,” Smith says, “they get shot because they stand there and look at a hunter.”
Some wolves become so accustomed to people that they become habituated, according to Smith, meaning they walk up to humans in search of food or become so bold that they run off with tripods. In rare instances, park officials have euthanized habituated wolves.
The Wapiti Lake Pack, a major draw for wolf watchers and tourists, has been susceptible to human conditioning. These Yellowstone interior wolves, considered bison-killing specialists, often use groomed park roads to get around in winter, at times walking right by snowmobilers buzzing down the road on their way to places like Old Faithful or Tower Junction. They’ve even been hazed with paintballs as a result.
But the vast majority of park wolves aren’t habituated, Smith says. Rather, they’re tolerant of people. “A wild wolf is avoidant,” he says. “They flee, they run. They know what humans mean: death. That’s not a park wolf.” Tolerance is the curse that leaves them vulnerable outside the park.

Justin Webb, executive director of the Foundation for Wildlife Management, says Yellowstone should do more to instill its wolves with a healthy fear of people.
“Wolves in the park should be given the respect of space, and I think that those wolves shouldn’t be conditioned to people,” says Webb, whose nonprofit makes bounty-like payments to trappers who kill wolves.
On occasion, Yellowstone wolves face circumstances that make them especially prone to human conditioning. The Junction Butte Pack, for example, often dens within eyeshot of Slough Creek, a popular trailhead for hikers and anglers. Tourists and Yellowstone guides have learned about the highly visible location, potentially dooming those pups.
“Why don’t they close the trailhead down?” Webb asked.
Yellowstone wolves leave the park for all kinds of reasons. Some, like 1331F, might take a temporary solo hiatus from their pack, while 1329M was likely in the midst of a more permanent dispersal, searching for new territory or a mate. However, the vast majority of Yellowstone’s wolves spend about 96% of their time inside the park, collar data shows. With no time to learn a healthy fear of humans, the 4% of the time they unwittingly leave their protections behind proves deadly. Instead of other wolves, people — either hunters or poachers — become, by far, the leading cause of death for wolves that depart Yellowstone, Stahler said.

No fear
For the first decade and a half after wolves returned to Yellowstone, the Endangered Species Act outlawed hunting wolves throughout the Lower 48. Protracted legal battles meant the first lawful hunt didn’t occur until 2009, and it revealed the risk facing wolves that spend most of their lives inside Yellowstone.
“They aren’t showing any fear,” one Montana wolf hunter told the Los Angeles Times after a successful hunt that year. “But they will, I’m sure.” Another hunting guide told the outlet about a wolf his client killed: “He was no more afraid of [the hunter] than the man in the moon.”
In 2011, wolves were permanently “delisted,” or stripped of federal protections under the Endangered Species Act, in Montana, Idaho and portions of three other western states by an act of Congress. In Wyoming, the change came more slowly because of litigation. Wolves were most recently delisted there in 2017.
Doug Smith retired as Senior Wildlife Biologist in Yellowstone National Park in 2022 after 28 years of service. He was project lead for the Yellowstone Wolf Project when wolves were reintroduced to the park in 1995. (Jacob W. Frank/National Park Service)
After years of hunts in surrounding states, the story hasn’t changed much. In late 2024, members of the 8 Mile Pack crossed the park boundary into Montana. Three hunters were waiting. They left with four dead wolves. A fifth was found days later, dead in nearby bushes. That many wolves dying at the same time rather than fleeing at the sound of a gunshot, Smith says, likely means they had no fear of people. “Killing multiple wolves at once is a sure sign of that.”
In this way, 1331 and 1329 are outliers. According to Yellowstone National Park data, over the last few years, approximately 81% of wolves that lived in Yellowstone and were killed by hunters died in Montana. That’s largely due to terrain. Think of the Gardiner Basin just north of Yellowstone like a funnel: Elk migrate to the lower-elevation, arid area in search of forage in winter. Wolves follow. Of all those wolves killed by hunters in Montana, nearly 9 in 10 died within just a mile of the park boundary. The forays of 1331 and 1329 outside Yellowstone — clocking about 10 miles and over 100, respectively — mean they traveled much farther than most of their kind before meeting the same end.

The lives of long-distance travelers, like the two Wapiti Lake pack members that died in traps, are less understood. Smith attributes the dearth of data to a simple reason: They die.
“A wolf dispersing has a higher mortality risk because it doesn’t know the landscape,” he says. “So that makes it more vulnerable to getting shot because they’re wandering around going, ‘I don’t know where I am; I don’t know where it’s safe and where it’s unsafe.’”
Montana and Wyoming’s respective wildlife management agencies investigated the trappings of 1331 and 1329. Both were found only because of their collar mortality signals, and both trappers were found to have violated state “trap-check” laws. Wolf traps must be checked every 48 hours in Montana. Leghold traps must be checked every 72 hours in Wyoming’s predator zone, the only place in the Equality State where wolf trapping is allowed.
The Wyoming trapper, a Cokeville resident named Ezra Cluff, was cited and fined $250 on June 30, 2022. “Cluff stated that he had got busy and had indeed failed to do his trap checks on time,” the warden wrote in a citation slip. Cluff did not respond to an interview request.
Nearly three years later and on the opposite end of the ecosystem, 1331 was found in a trap about 10 miles, as the crow flies, north of Yellowstone. The trap was registered to Matt Lumley, who was at the time president of the Montana Trappers Association and vice president of the National Trappers Association. Lumley also has close ties to political leadership in Montana. He helped Gov. Gianforte trap and kill another collared Yellowstone wolf in 2021. Gianforte later described Lumley as his wolf hunting “mentor” in an interview with Lee Enterprise’s Statehouse Bureau. In addition, Lumley is a founding member of the Outdoor Heritage Coalition, a group currently suing Montana, arguing that state wildlife managers aren’t setting policy aggressively enough to reduce the wolf population.

Lumley did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But his comments in the Helena Capitol building are in the public record. “I’ve killed a lot of wolves,” he testified at the Montana Legislature just days before Wolf Project staff heard 1331F’s mortality signal. “I’ve never killed a Yellowstone National Park wolf. I’m killing all my wolves in Montana.”

Matt Lumley, the trapper whose trap wolf 1331F was found dead in, was issued a warning by Montana FWP. The Park County attorney declined to prosecute.

Yellowstone park officials estimate that 1331 died on Jan. 16, 2025. Park staff detected her mortality signal on Jan. 23, and her remains were recovered even later. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks submitted a “request for prosecution” for a trap-check violation to Montana’s Park County Attorney’s Office. Despite the state’s 48-hour trap-check regulation for wolves, the county attorney declined to prosecute.
“After a careful review of the reports, supporting documents, and available evidence, we determined that the facts did not establish a criminal offense that could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,” Park County Attorney Chad Glenn said in an email to Mountain Journal and WyoFile.
Glenn did not respond to follow-up questions or provide the documents he cited as the basis for his decision. Ultimately, Lumley walked away with a formal warning from FWP. Gianforte also walked away with a warning in 2021 after running afoul of trapping regulations while killing a wolf with Lumley on the same ranch, owned by Robert E. Smith, a co-director of Sinclair Broadcasting Group and contributor to Gianforte’s 2017 congressional campaign.
Elk, livestock and wolves
The saga of Wapiti Lake’s wandering wolves reflects the complexity of managing Yellowstone wolves when they leave protected areas like the park. Over the last few decades, the region has transitioned from an economy based on resource extraction to one heavily reliant on tourism and recreation. Outside the national park, wildlife managers are tasked with balancing hard-to-reconcile viewpoints in states where hunting and ranching have deep roots and large landowners hold sway.
The overpopulated elk herds of Yellowstone’s Northern Range numbered around 15,000-20,000 in the years leading up to the 1995 wolf reintroduction. Counts are now closer to 5,000, much to the dismay of many a hunter who relied on the area’s abundance of ungulates for meat or trophies.
“I’ve got an 18-year-old son that I want to get to experience elk camp in the backcountry,” Webb, the wolf-hunting advocate, told a Wyoming audience in 2022. “I want him to sit on a mountaintop on a ridge and listen to bulls bugle below him as the sun comes up, and I believe that if we don’t do something to control wolf populations, he won’t have that experience.”
Wolves push an elk herd in Yellowstone. Biologists say wolf packs have contributed to the decline in Yellowstone elk numbers over the last 30 years since they were reintroduced to the park, but many also say that the elk population before wolves returned was greater than the area’s carrying capacity. (Matt Metz/National Park Service)
Meanwhile, Lumley the trapper called the decline of southwest Montana elk “the greatest loss of hunting opportunity in the world” during the same legislative hearing he touted killing “a lot of wolves.” Decades before wolf reintroduction, elk were so numerous in the area that Yellowstone sometimes culled thousands of the animals in a single year. Later, the park took a more hands-off approach. Elk hunting outside the park became the primary management tool to deal with the overpopulated ungulates. Locals recall a “firing line” of hunters as elk moved toward winter range outside the park’s protections.
Wolves were a factor — but not the only factor — in the region’s decline in elk numbers. Mountain lions and bears eat elk, too. And so do people. A long-running late-season elk hunt in the Gardiner area also played a role in the elk population’s shrinking size. Despite a drastic decrease in numbers from the days before wolves, elk populations north of Yellowstone still remain at or above the state-set goal for elk numbers. Access to elk is yet another important part of the hunting puzzle. Some hunters say the wary ungulates that remain in the area often take shelter from wolves and hunters alike on private land, making them next to impossible to pursue.
Part of the tension around hunting both wolves and elk also centers on economics. While wolf-watching brings millions of tourist dollars into communities surrounding the park, outfitters north of Yellowstone have lost business as elk herds declined after reintroduction. The lawsuit filed by the Outdoor Heritage Coalition features outfitter Craig Neal, an outfitter in Townsend, Montana, as a plaintiff. Neal, the brief contends, “has been negatively impacted by restrictions on wolf hunting in Montana from a personal and economic perspective … his business opportunities are limited by the insufficient wolf quotas and reduced elk available for hunting.”

Elk aren’t the only hooved creatures wolves impact, either. Outside Yellowstone, they also occasionally kill livestock. Although wolf-killed cattle and sheep are a drop in the bucket among the many factors that kill domestic livestock, the impacts aren’t trivial for individual ranchers in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
In Wyoming and Montana each year, wolves typically kill at least a few dozen of the more than 3 million cows in the two states — though many ranchers argue that wolf kills can go unproven since remote carcasses are consumed before the kill can be documented. Depredation numbers in Wyoming notably spiked from 2014 to 2017, topping out at 121 wolf-killed cattle — a pulse of conflict that coincided with the three years Wyoming wolves were relisted under the Endangered Species Act. While those federal protections prohibited hunters from killing wolves at the time, wildlife managers trying to avert conflict could do just that. And they did, killing a record number. In Montana, complaints about wolves eating livestock peaked at 233 in 2009. Since then, in the wake of delisting, the number of reports has dropped off drastically, hovering at 100 or fewer annually from 2015 to 2024.
Pressure cooker 
To control the wolf population and mitigate their impact, hunting has become a fixture of wolf management in the Northern Rockies. Since legal seasons began earlier in the century, some animals that spend most of the year in Yellowstone are always lost to hunters’ bullets and traps outside park boundaries.
In an attempt to resolve the tension between the park and surrounding states, Montana carved out small areas with more limited hunting called “wolf management units” directly north of the park. Wyoming tightly controls its hunts immediately adjacent to Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and has had minimal overall impact on Yellowstone populations. Idaho takes an aggressive, statewide approach to wolf hunting and trapping, but the topography and location of Yellowstone packs have limited its influence on park populations.

The vast majority of harvested Yellowstone wolves die in Montana, where tensions continue to flare over setting the state’s wolf season. In 2021, the Montana Legislature mandated a reduction in the state’s overall wolf population, numbering roughly 1,177 at the time. The new law simply set a minimum of 15 breeding pairs (corresponding to 450 wolves). In the years since, setting policy to reduce wolf numbers has fallen to the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission, a citizen board appointed by the governor, currently Gianforte. The commission has considered a slew of ways to meet the mandate: lengthening hunting and trapping seasons, instituting a statewide quota, night hunting on private land, and neck snaring, among other approaches. Some of those aggressive tactics have taken effect. Others haven’t. Yet today, four years after the legislative mandate took effect, Montana still hasn’t seen a meaningful reduction in its wolf population.
In 2021, about six months after Gianforte trapped and killed a Yellowstone wolf north of the park, the commission also removed quotas in the wolf management units, or WMUs, just outside Yellowstone. That winter, hunters killed at least 25 wolves that spent the vast majority of their lives inside the park. Roughly 1 in 5 park wolves perished — more park wolves than in any hunting season before or since. Yellowstone biologists worried about the impact of the hunt on their three-decade-old research project — some packs dissolved due to the hunt, and others formed. Behavior and reproductive rates changed, too. Wildlife guides were furious, concerned they’d lose business or wolf-watching opportunities altogether.
Ultimately, the quotas were restored. But over the next two years, outcomes for Yellowstone wolves only marginally improved. At least 13 park wolves were killed in the 2023-2024 hunting season. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly voiced his concern to the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission in a 2024 letter. “Wolves that primarily live within Yellowstone are exceedingly valuable to a great number of people across Montana, the country, and the world,” he wrote. “The park generates hundreds of millions of dollars in additional economic activity to Montana economies and wolves and other wildlife rate as a top reason why people visit the park and region.”
The pressure cooker of hunting policy around Yellowstone hasn’t let off steam. At the January 2025 legislative hearing, Lumley complained that the Fish and Wildlife Commission was setting policy that was too protective of wolves and listening only to out-of-state interests, particularly Yellowstone. Just 3% of the national park lies in Montana. “That’s what you are elected to do, protect Montana’s interests,” Lumley testified. “Not Yellowstone National Park’s.”
In a Fish and Wildlife Commission meeting months later, Chris Morgan, Lumley’s successor at the Montana Trappers Association, made similar claims. He alleged that policy safeguarding wolves in the region around Yellowstone is a “political ploy” and touted the state’s responsibility for wolf reduction rather than wolf watching.

“We don’t have any state mandate that requires us to make sure that ecotourism thrives,” Morgan said. “Our mandate is to reduce the state’s population of wolves. Plain and simple. Period.”
Wolf advocates were just as fired up in the day-long meeting. Cara McGary, a Yellowstone guide and cofounder of Wild Livelihoods Business Coalition, argued that plenty of Yellowstone wolves — like 1331F— die even outside the protective boundaries of the wolf management units. Southwest Montana receives far more wolf hunting pressure than anywhere else in the state, despite a lower overall wolf density than Montana’s northwest corner, according to Montana FWP data. It’s also the only area in the Treasure State where the wolf population was already on the decline. In 2024 alone, at least six wolves from the park died legally in the Yellowstone-adjacent WMUs and another five outside their boundaries. “That’s almost 10% of the product that our businesses depend on,” she testified.
At the time of publication, wolf hunting season in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho is well underway. The heat over wolf hunting regulations around Yellowstone in that August commission meeting led to something of a middle-ground approach. But already this year, a Montana hunter legally killed a Yellowstone wolf beloved to the wolf-watching community, which described the dark black 1479F as playful and tolerant of crowds.
“She was one of the few wolves in the park that would walk right through a crowd of people to reach her destination,” wildlife photographer Deby Dixon told Cowboy State Daily.

The year of the wolves





Infamous wolf captor Cody Roberts pleads not guilty, trial set for March




The National Park Service has two chief goals: preserving and protecting natural systems, and visitor enjoyment. Wolves figure into both, and the scientific gains from studying Yellowstone packs are unparalleled: They’re both uniquely visible and, at least in theory, uninfluenced by humans. But as wolves deal with such direct mortality when they set paw outside the park, Smith wonders: “Do you have a natural wolf population or not?”
Some data suggests not. A 2023 peer-reviewed study led by then-University of Montana PhD student Brenna Cassidy found that Montana’s wolf-hunting regime has a clear effect on the overall survival of Yellowstone wolves. Without hunting, park wolves have a nearly 90% chance of surviving any given year, but the rate falls to about 80% when hunting occurs with quotas. When there’s unlimited hunting outside the boundary, Yellowstone wolves’ chances of surviving a year dip closer to 70%.
Smith, Yellowstone’s retired wolf biologist, wants to be clear: He’s a hunter as well, and a self-described “gun guy.” At times, though, he worries that all the focus on Yellowstone’s wolves has an overlooked downside. It sucks the air out of the room in wolf management conversations, leaving too little focus on the thousands more wolves in Montana and the rest of the Northern Rockies that don’t have the same vocal proponents as animals in and around the park. Those wolves die too — often very quickly or brutally. In Montana, hunters and trappers can take a total of 458 wolves this season, including six in the WMUs outside Yellowstone and 60 in the larger region where 1331 met her end. There are no limits in Idaho, and it’s a wolf hunting free-for-all in Wyoming’s predator zone, where 1329 died in an illegally monitored trap.
Thinking about intense hunting pressure throughout the Northern Rockies, Smith thinks wildlife managers should consider a bigger question: “Where do wolves get to be wolves?”

They are critical. I think you understand the meaning of that,” Pirro told reporters at a Thursday morning briefing.The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan refugee who worked with U.S. forces in Afghanistan, is currently facing three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, Pirro said, adding the charges are “appropriate” for now.“It's not clear, you know, how this is going to end up. But let me be perfectly clear about how it will end up in this office if one of them is to pass. And God forbid that happens, this is a murder one (charge). Period.

Thanks to the swift and coordinated response of the National Guard and the Metropolitan Police Department, no additional victims were harmed, and the scene was secured within minutes,” Pirro said.Kash Patel, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said the agency searched Lakanwal’s home last night in Bellingham, Washington, seizing multiple electronic devices and interviewing family members.

Hyde Park Electric ratepayers are bracing for a 20% increase in their electric bills following the revelation that their municipal utility is struggling under a mountain of debt. Meanwhile, a neighboring utility manager has stepped in to try to right the ship as every option is on the table — even the potential dissolution of the utility.
The double-digit increase will take effect in the new year. It was imposed as the first part of a two-phase rate case approved by the Vermont Public Utility Commission to allow Hyde Park to keep the lights on as the state and the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority attempt to untangle its knotted finances amid significant financial distress.

In October, Hyde Park Electric’s long-simmering financial crisis came to a boil as its inability to cover expenses became known to the state. It was originally estimated that the small municipal utility, with 1,400 customers, was carrying $1.5 million in debt. After a few weeks of forensic accounting by the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority, that number has climbed to $4.5 million.
Shortly after news of Hyde Park Electric’s financial crisis broke, former village manager Brian Evans-Mongeon resigned. Evans-Mongeon bore the brunt of the Vermont Department of Public Service, which advocates for ratepayers, and its attempts to push the village of Hyde Park to face the seriousness of the situation. Even though village trustees had discussed the future of his position with the town, Evans-Mongeon resigned on his own volition, according to Fredericka French, chair of the Hyde Park Village Board of Trustees.
With a VPPSA employee now installed in the Hyde Park office, Morrisville Water & Light manager Scott Johnstone has been tapped to step in to take the helm in Hyde Park village. A former secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources, Johnstone has led the neighboring municipal utility since 2022.
Last Thursday, Johnstone held a public question and answer session prior to the trustees’ regular meeting. Frustrated ratepayers crowded into the village’s low-slung office building situated across from the imposing brick facade of the Lamoille County Courthouse.

Johnstone told village electricity customers that this phase-one rate increase is only the beginning — he said a 20% percent increase is what it will take to keep Hyde Park Electric’s and its customers’ lights on. How much ratepayers will have to pay to keep the utility solvent will be determined next spring, following completion of phase two of the rate case.
Johnstone said this increase catapulted Hyde Park into the top five for the most expensive electricity among the state’s 17 electric utilities.
Customers were also eager to learn how the utility could go about addressing the $4.5 million debt. Johnstone said most of the debt seems to have been accrued through operational costs and taking on more debt to cover other expenses.
Johnstone and the trustees are already working to determine what parts of the debt can be refinanced. The solar arrays the town has also invested in, which now contribute significantly to its debt load, could potentially be offloaded.
The village might also look at some of its other assets, including the French family home. It was donated to the village in 2013 by the nine French family siblings, including Fredericka French’s husband, Ed, with the intent of seeing it become the village offices, but the small municipality was never able to secure the funds for its renovation.
Johnstone warned ratepayers that the process of determining what was prudent for Hyde Park ratepayers by the Public Utility Commissions could become a contested one.
Some in attendance at last week’s meeting wondered who to blame. Prior village managers have managed the water, wastewater and power operations, but the publicly elected, volunteer board of trustees ultimately made the decisions.
Johnstone said that, at this point in the financial analysis, he could say with a certain amount of confidence that there had been no embezzlement that contributed to the insolvency. He said it was, rather, a general mishandling of funding.

French pointed out that, prior to 2016, the village was debt-free. It was only after state-mandated upgrades to the water and wastewater system, and new investment in renewable energy, that the debt began to mount. She said she was waiting to learn more about how exactly the village found itself in financial disarray before passing full judgement, but acknowledged that everyone in a leadership position bore some fault.
“I’d say there’s plenty of blame to go around,” she said. “I don’t really have any full answers to that at this point, and I think I will once we get all the information.”
Consolidation question
Hyde Park Electric’s insolvency has raised new questions about the long-term viability of the small municipal utility.
In a report updating the Public Utility Commission on the investigation into the utility and efforts to stabilize it — filed by Hyde Park Electric and the Department for Public Service — a “potential future steps and discussions” provides the two options on the table: Hyde Park Electric returns to solvency under new leadership and continues to exist, or it “merges with or is jointly managed with another municipal entity or utilities.”
Such discussions won’t take place until well into next year at the earliest, and Hyde Park Electric could consider other neighbors like Vermont Electric Co-Op or Green Mountain Power, or another municipal utility, for partnership or consolidations. However, Johnstone’s arrival in Hyde Park emphasizes the closeness in proximity of Morrisville Water & Light as a potential partner.
Johnstone is also currently interim director at the Hardwick Electric Department and, he said, if only because managing a public utility is difficult, the town of Hardwick is considering a merger with Morrisville Water & Light.
Should it come to pass that both Hardwick and Hyde Park consolidate under Morrisville Water & Light, the utility would serve over 11,000 customers, rivaling Washington Electric Co-op in the size of its customer-base. Johnstone, though, took care to emphasize that such discussions were a long way off, and that his focus was on the crisis at hand.
Through a confluence of geography and the history of electric infrastructure in Vermont — which grew out of densely populated village centers — Lamoille County is served by ten different utilities.
Johnstone was also careful to emphasize that a possible consolidation was not his purpose for taking over administrative duties in the village in this troubled time.
“Our intention is to help neighbors and, if they want to, they can get back on their feet and find their way forward,” Johnstone said. “That’s entirely good for us. We’re doing this because we want to help other communities.”

Oct. 29. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined attorneys general and governors from 20 other states to sue the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development over a new policy that they say drastically alters the ability of state and local agencies, as well as non-profit groups, to combat homelessness.
The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in federal court in the District of Rhode Island. 
“The complaint alleges HUD violated its own regulations by not engaging in rulemaking before issuing the changes and violated the law by not receiving congressional authorization for these new conditions, many of which are directly contrary to congressionally passed statutes and HUD’s own regulations,” a statement released by Nessel’s office said. 
The policy would significantly cut the amount of money that, through the Continuum of Care program, can be used to go towards permanent housing solutions. Only 30% of a grant could be used for permanent housing, while for previous grants, that limit was nearly 90%.
The new funding notice also imposes ideological barriers, including preventing any funding from going to organizations that acknowledge the existence of transgender or nonbinary people. It also moves away from a “Housing First” model that did not require preconditions like stable income or sobriety for access to support from the program.
“The Continuum of Care grant program is the backbone of efforts to combat homelessness across Michigan and throughout the country,” Nessel said in a press release. “Restricting funding and imposing illegal conditions on these grants violates HUD’s mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities for all. If permitted to take effect, these changes will displace thousands of Michigan families.”
The changes have been widely criticized by housing advocates, who say that they will keep currently unhoused people without access to housing and will push some people who rely on support from Continuum of Care programs back into homelessness. 
Last year, Michigan received over $100 million from the Continuum of Care grant program. Nessel’s office, in a press release, estimated that the changes in this year’s updated Notice of Funding Opportunity would put 7,000 households, including around 2,000 families with children, at risk of losing their housing.
The Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness, a group of 92 homeless service providers, said that over the organization’s 35 years in existence, they had “never encountered a threat as devastating and extreme to persons in poverty” as detrimental as the new changes.. 
“Not only will this application fracture the homeless service delivery infrastructure, which has taken decades to build, but lives will be lost,” said Sarah Rennie, Senior Director of Advocacy for the Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness. “This [Continuum of Care Notice of Funding Opportunity] completely misunderstands the root causes of homelessness. Homeless rates in Michigan continue to rise, not because of a failure in the current homeless service delivery system, but because Michigan faces an affordable housing crisis.”

Happy Thanksgiving to everyone!  We have plenty to be thankful for.
The True Story of Thanksgiving by Rush Limbaugh

“The story of the Pilgrims begins in the early part of the seventeenth century… The Church of England under King James I was persecuting anyone and everyone who did not recognize [the church’s] absolute civil and spiritual authority,” actually, the state.
“Those who challenged ecclesiastical authority and those who believed strongly in freedom of worship were hunted down…” This is in England in the 1600s. They “were hunted down and imprisoned, and sometimes executed for their beliefs. A group of separatists,” people who didn’t want any part of this, “first fled to Holland,” they liked wooden shoes and cheese, “and established a community.”
They were there for eleven years. “After eleven years, about forty of” these separatists who liked wooden shoes and cheese, “agreed to make a perilous journey to the New World…” They had heard about it. Some new, exciting place that hadn’t been developed. They knew they would “face hardships,” hardships like you and I don’t know — and I’m not preaching to you.
I’m just telling you, we don’t know the hardship these people endured. We can’t. We are way too advanced now. People who lived in the 1600s would not believe life today. (Snort!) Try to explain flight, jet travel. They wouldn’t understand it. They knew they would “face hardships,” but paramount importance to them was living freely and worshiping God according to the dictates of their own consciences, their own beliefs.
That’s what they were denied the freedom to do in England. “On August 1, 1620, the Mayflower set sail. It carried a total of 102 passengers, including forty” of these separatists, the Pilgrims. There were just 40 of them. They were “led by William Bradford. On the journey” across the Atlantic… You talk about something that had to be frightening and scary?
Rush Limbaugh in the Excellence in Broadcasting Studio in 2020.  See the video and the full transcirpt at The True Story of Thanksgiving – Rush H. Limbaugh III
The Mayflower was not much bigger than a 50-foot boat, and 102 people on it. “On the journey, Bradford set up an agreement, a contract” if you will, “that established just and equal laws for all [40] members of the [Pilgrim] community, irrespective of their religious beliefs.” It didn’t matter what their religious beliefs were.
These are the laws they were all agreeing to live by. “Where did the revolutionary ideas,” these laws, come from? We’re talking about the Mayflower Compact. That is what Bradford wrote. The Mayflower Compact derived “[f]rom the Bible. The Pilgrims were a people completely steeped in the lessons of the Old and New Testaments.”
They were devoutly religious people. No matter what else is said about them (and even that is denied), they were devoutly religious. “They looked to the ancient Israelites for their example. And, because of the biblical precedents set forth in Scripture, they never doubted that their experiment would work.”
They never doubted they would get to the New World. They never doubted that once they got there, they would thrive. The journey was long; it was arduous; it was dangerous. And when they finally landed, when the Pilgrims finally landed in New England in November, according to William Bradford’s detailed journal, they found a cold, barren, desolate wilderness. Imagine New England as it exists today as nothing but rocks, forest, undeveloped nature in November and getting colder.
There were no friends to greet them. There was no shelter of any kind other than hiding under a tree, there was nothing, folks. It was desolate. There were no hotels. There were no inns. There were no places to clean up. There were no houses. I mean, this was real hardship. The sacrifice that they had made for the freedom to worship was just beginning.
During that first winter — remember, they arrive in November — during that first winter, half of them, including William Bradford’s own wife, died of starvation, of sickness, exposure to the elements. Now we’re getting close to what you were taught in school. When spring finally came — and, by the way, writing that doesn’t do it justice. Spring didn’t just finally come. It was a survival. It was an act of survival that you and I cannot possibly relate to or understand.
American Special Forces can. Military people who’ve been trained can understand what the Pilgrims were — you and I can’t. We’ve never done anything like that first winter in the New World. They survived it. Spring finally came. They did meet the Indians, the Native Americans who were there, who did help them in planting corn and fishing for cod. They showed ’em where the beavers were so the beavers could be skinned for coats, other things. You animal rights people are not gonna like some of this story, but it happened.
But even at this, even with this degree of assistance from the Indians, the Native Americans, there wasn’t any prosperity yet. They had the Mayflower Compact. They had these laws they were living by, and there was no prosperity. And I wonder why. Now, this is important to understand here, folks, because this is where modern American history lessons end, with the Indians teaching the Pilgrims how to eat, how to fish, how to skin beavers, and all that.
That’s where it ends. And that’s the feel-good story. But that doesn’t even get close to the true story. You know, Thanksgiving is actually explained in some textbooks as a holiday for which the Pilgrims gave thanks to the Indians for saving their lives. It wasn’t that. That happened, but Thanksgiving was a devout expression of gratitude, the Pilgrims, to God for their survival, and everything that was a part of it.
Now, here’s the part that has been omitted. The original contract the Pilgrims entered into in Holland — they had sponsors. They didn’t have the money to do this trip on their own. They had sponsors. There were merchant sponsors in London and in Holland. And these merchant sponsors demanded that everything that the Pilgrims produced in the New World would go into a common store, a single bank, if you will. And that each member of the Pilgrim community was entitled to one share.
So everybody had an equal share of whatever was in that bank. All of the land they cleared, all of the houses they built belonged to that bank, to the community as well. And they were going to distribute it equally, because they were gonna be fair. So all of the land that they cleared and all the houses they built belonged to everybody. Belonged to the community. Belonged to the bank, belonged to the common store. Nobody owned anything. They just had an equal share in it. It was a commune.
The Pilgrims established a commune, essentially. Forerunner of the communes we saw in the sixties and seventies out in California. They even had their own organic vegetables, by the way. Yep. The Pilgrims, forerunners of organic vegetables. Of course, what else could there be? No such thing as processed anything back then.
Now, William Bradford, who had become the governor of the colony ’cause he was the leader, recognized that this wasn’t gonna work. This was costly and destructive, and it just wasn’t working. It was collectivism. It was socialism. It wasn’t working. That first winner had taken a lot of lives. The manpower was greatly reduced. So William Bradford decided to take bold action, which I will describe when we get back.
BREAK TRANSCRIPT
RUSH: William Bradford, the governor of the Pilgrim community, saw that none of this was working. The Mayflower Compact was not working. Giving everybody a single share of stock in the common store, in the common bank was not working. Collectivism. It was as costly and destructive to the Pilgrims as it is and has been to anybody who has ever tried it.
So Bradford decided to scrub it. He threw it out and took bold action. He assigned a plot of land to each family. Every family was given a plot of land. They could work it, manage it however they wanted to. If they just wanted to sit on it, get fat, dumb, happy, and lazy, they could. If they wanted to develop it, if they wanted to grow corn, whatever on it, they could. If they wanted to build on it, they could do that. If they wanted to turn it into a quasi-business, they could do whatever they wanted to do with it.
He turned loose the power of the capitalist marketplace. Long before Karl Marx was even born. Long before Karl Marx was a sperm cell in his father’s dreams, the Pilgrims had discovered and experimented with what could only be described as socialism, and they found that it didn’t work. Now, it wasn’t called that then. But that’s exactly what it was. Everybody was given an equal share. You know what happened? Nobody did anything. There was no incentive. Nothing worked. Nothing happened.
“What Bradford and his community found was that the most creative and industrious people had no incentive to work any harder than anyone else, unless they could utilize the power of personal motivation! But while most of the rest of the world has been experimenting with socialism for well over a hundred years — trying to refine it, perfect it, and re-invent it — the Pilgrims decided early on to scrap it permanently. What Bradford wrote about this social experiment should be in every schoolchild’s history lesson. If it were, we might prevent much needless suffering,” if the true story of Thanksgiving had been taught for years and years and years.
BREAK TRANSCRIPT
RUSH: So, William Bradford, after putting everybody in a common store, the Mayflower Compact… They wanted to be fair. They wanted everybody to have one common share of stock in everything that happened that the Pilgrims produced — and it bombed. It didn’t work.
There was no prosperity; there was no creativity because there was no incentive. Here’s what Bradford wrote about the failure: “‘For this community [so far as it was] was found to breed much confusion and discontent…’” They were not happy, in other words. “‘[T]his community was found to breed much confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort.’”
In other words, nobody worked.
The way they set it up, killed and discouraged work.
There was no need.
“‘For young men that were most able and fit for labor and service’” sat around and did nothing. “‘[T]hey should spend their time and strength to work for other men’s wives and children without’” being paid for it? Why should they do that? So, they didn’t. “‘[T]hat was thought injustice.’ Why should you work for other people when you can’t work for yourself? What’s the point? Do you hear what he was saying, ladies and gentlemen?
“The Pilgrims found that people could not be expected to do their best work without incentive. So, what did Bradford’s community try next? They unharnessed the power of good old free enterprise by invoking” capitalism, “the principle of private property,” all the way back in the 1600s. It was incredible. “Every family was assigned its own plot of land,” and they could do with it whatever they wanted to do.
“‘This had very good success,’ wrote Bradford, ‘for it made all hands industrious, so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been.’” So when profit was introduced, when the opportunity to prosper was introduced, it went gangbusters. That, my friends, is the essence of the True Story of Thanksgiving. “Now, this is where it gets really good, folks, if you’re laboring under the misconception that I was, as I was taught in school.
“So they set up trading posts and exchanged goods with the Indians” after they had enjoyed this prosperity. It was not the Indians that brought them to prosperity. It’s not said to insult anybody. The Indians assisted in their arrival undeniably. But what led to prosperity for these original settlers was the common store failed. Socialism didn’t work.
It’s when they introduced what turns out to be capitalism. They didn’t have the name for it, but when they turned loose individual incentive — keep what you produce, sell what you don’t need — it went crazy. This is not something they were taught by anybody by self-experience. It was not the Indians. None of this is said to put anybody down. Don’t misunderstand.
The Indians did a lot of things that helped them, which I’ll get to in just a second, but it was their own industriousness. “[T]hey set up trading posts and exchanged goods with the Indians.” They sold stuff to them, and those “profits allowed them to pay off their debts to the merchants,” their sponsors in London and in Holland, and you know what?
The success of that colony after they had abandoned socialism and tried what was essentially capitalism, the word spread throughout the Old World of this massive amount of prosperity that was there for the taking in the New World. And guess what happened? The New World was flooded with new arrivals. “[T]he success and prosperity of the Plymouth settlement attracted more Europeans and began what came to be known as the ‘Great Puritan Migration.’”
And all it took was prosperity and the word spreading across the Atlantic Ocean of how there was prosperity and it was there for the taking. All you had to do was get there and give it a shot. The lesson is — The True Story of Thanksgiving is — that William Bradford and his Pilgrim community were thanking God for the blessings on their community after the first miserable winter of a documented failure brought on by their attempt at fairness and equality, which was socialism.
It didn’t work.
Only when they abandoned it did it work — and I need to say it again, because I don’t want people to misunderstand and get noses out of joint. The Native Americans, the indigenous people, the Injuns, whatever you want to call ’em, they were of considerable assistance, and they were friendly when the Pilgrims arrived. But they had little, if anything, to do with the prosperity that occurred.
Because that was the result of Bradford and the Pilgrim leadership deciding to change their structure, the Mayflower Compact. Now, Indians assisted, naturally. I can’t deny it. I mean, they taught them how to fish and this kind of thing that they didn’t know how to do, and that led them to be productive, undeniably so. But it was the Pilgrim community itself which experienced this massive prosperity.
The word of which spread all the way back to the Old World, Europe across the Atlantic Ocean.
Now, I mentioned earlier that The Federalist has a story on all this, and in it they describe much of what we did in the second book that dealt with this, the children’s book, Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims. That book goes into great detail about how the Indians did provide assistance and what kind of assistance it was, how valuable it was and how crucial it was.
In Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims, we focus on a Native American by the name of Squanto. Now, as I told you, “During the winter of 1620, only 44 out of the original 102 [Pilgrims] survived, including their first elected governor of the colony, John Carver,” and it was “an Indian named Squanto came to their rescue.” As I say, this is, as I say, explored in great detail in Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims.
“Squanto was no ordinary native. Early settlers in 1610 had captured him and sold him into slavery. A group of Catholic friars freed him and brought him to England, where he learned to speak English. In 1618, serving as an interpreter on an English ship, he was brought back to the New World.” It was Squanto — who is a famous Native American in his own right in the Pilgrim story. it was Squanto who “taught the Pilgrims how to plant and fish,” how to skin beavers. It was Squanto who “broker[ed] a peace treaty between the Pilgrims and other Indian tribes.”
There was more than one tribe of Indians. It was not copacetic. It was not friendly and at one with nature. It was not anything like the multiculturalists would have you believe. There were squabbles; there were power struggles; turf battles. It was human. The Indians, the Pilgrims, everybody was scrambling for power, for survival. Survivability was the name of the game. And it was not guaranteed.
Now, many of the Pilgrims literally believed that God had sent Squanto to save them. And they believed, the Pilgrims believed, that without Squanto they never would have survived, or thrived. And they experienced a tremendous harvest in 1621, and that’s the big gathering that is taught in the history books, the native Indians and the Pilgrims joined together for a huge feast, which is the foundational story of the Thanksgiving story that’s taught in public schools.
But, again, that is not The Real Story of Thanksgiving. That’s the textbook brand. It did happen, but it’s so much more than that. And I love taking the opportunity every year to explain the truth of, especially now given this election’s apparently, allegedly fallen out. Because even at The Federalist — this is so great that the story is spreading. “One of the most important legacies of early settlers is that they experimented with socialism in the 1620s, and it didn’t work. Private property rights and personal responsibility, two pillars of a free market economy, saved the Plymouth colony from extinction and laid the economic foundation for a free and prosperous nation that we all enjoy today.”
And that is exactly right. And that is The True Story of Thanksgiving. And that has been what should have been shared with you every Thanksgiving for the past 31 years.

Nine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.
But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
 Farming faiths and harvest festivals

The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.

Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
 ‘Days of Thanksgiving’

The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
 Harvest feast of 1621

Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”

‘The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth’ by Jennie A. Brownscombe. (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal/Wikimedia Commons)
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
 Pilgrims’ primacy

The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.

The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
 Rising immigration

Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.

Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski denounced the Trump administration’s targeting of Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly on Tuesday, saying on social media that its actions are “reckless and flat-out wrong.”
Kelly, a retired astronaut and U.S. Navy officer, was one of six Democratic senators who appeared in a video directed to members of the U.S. military. In that video, they say members of the military are being subject to political pressure and should uphold the Constitution and ignore “illegal orders.”
Afterward, President Donald Trump took to social media to call for all six to be executed for treason. The FBI has begun to make inquiries about the video, and the Department of Defense have vowed to investigate. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been particularly critical of Kelly.
“Senator Kelly valiantly served our country as an aviator in the U.S. Navy before later completing four space shuttle missions as a NASA astronaut,” Murkowski said. “To accuse him and other lawmakers of treason and sedition for rightfully pointing out that servicemembers can refuse illegal orders is reckless and flat-out wrong. The Department of Defense and FBI surely have more important priorities than this frivolous investigation.”
It has become unusual for elected Republican officials to speak in defense of elected Democrats, particularly when it places them at odds with President Donald Trump, who remains popular among Republican voters, even if his approval overall is low.
Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan previously expressed concerns about the possible politicization of the military during the presidency of Democrat Joe Biden. 
Asked about the situation with Kelly, Sullivan criticized the Democratic video and the administration’s response to it. 
“The Democrats in the video have offered no explanation of what they considered to be an illegal order, sowing confusion and politicizing the ranks in a way that risks undermining military discipline, lethality and readiness,” his office said in a written statement.
The statement went on to say that “he does not believe it is a good use of the Pentagon’s time to investigate Senator Kelly” because “such an investigation has the potential to turn into a major distraction for our military.”
The office of Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, did not return a text message or email seeking comment.
Sullivan’s office requested that his statement be printed in full. Because it has not been published elsewhere, we think there is news value in reprinting it, so it is published below.
“Senator Sullivan strongly disagreed with many actions taken by the Pentagon under Presidents Obama and Biden — such as President Biden’s use of enlisted Marines as political props standing behind him in a very partisan speech in Philadelphia in 2022. But he would never have put out a video — like the one released by Senator Mark Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers — implying that troops should question orders from their superiors. The Democrats in the video have offered no explanation of what they considered to be an illegal order, sowing confusion and politicizing the ranks in a way that risks undermining military discipline, lethality and readiness. 
Instead of using our troops as political pawns, members of Congress should press top Pentagon officials directly on issues over which they have concerns. Senator Sullivan does this regularly in Senate Armed Services Committee hearings and in meetings and phone calls with top Pentagon leaders regardless of which party controls the White House.
While Senator Sullivan believes the message in the video was irresponsible and politically driven, he does not believe it is a good use of the Pentagon’s time to investigate Senator Kelly — who served honorably in the Navy — under the UCMJ, particularly given that the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause would likely take precedence over any UCMJ provision. Such an investigation has the potential to turn into a major distraction for our military. After four years of Biden’s woke military, the Department of War needs to stay laser focused on lethality and war fighting.”

(Courtesy Tami Smith)Like she does every Tuesday afternoon when the bell rings at the Shepherd’s Closet in Elephant Butte, Tami Smith stepped out the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to greet a growing line of hungry people at the food pantry she runs. Then, like she also does every Tuesday, she joined some of them in prayer.
This week, ahead of Thanksgiving, she said she read from Isaiah 41:10. It was a reminder, she said, that, “There will always be trials and tribulations in life, but God will carry you through every storm.” Then she helped 138 households comprising 523 people get food for the week, she said.

The county’s high rate of SNAP reliance made the food pantry even more vital earlier this year when federal cuts and stoppages threw the program into upheaval, Smith said. The food pantry distributes at least 36,000 pounds of food a month, she said, to people who line up beginning at 7:30 a.m. and come from as far away as Alamogordo, Socorro or Las Cruces. 
“When you have food insecurity, and then you have all this going on with SNAP, people panic,” she said. “They want to make sure that they have enough food for their family. And we have multi-generational families here. It’s not uncommon to have 11, 12, 15 people in the household.”
Those people have turned to Shepherd’s Closet during a chaotic year. 
First, federal cuts to The Emergency Food Assistance Program left Roadrunner Food Bank, which supplies most of the pantry’s food, with 30 fewer truckloads, primarily of dairy products. The food pantry in Elephant Butte had to make up the difference with canned food, Smith said. 
Then, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed in July contained provisions that cut SNAP and imposed future work requirements, along with other measures that prompted longer lines at the food pantry. 
Finally, when the federal government shut down Oct. 1, Smith said she knew to expect even longer lines. She’s worked as a volunteer at the pantry for a decade, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“It was severe fear and panic during the pandemic, and we see that same stuff right now, because it’s still so uncertain,” she said. “And people, especially during the holidays, they panic because they don’t think they can get enough food.”

The food line has not shrunk even though the state stepped in to pay for SNAP itself, first with a $30 million payment that covered SNAP through the first days of November and later with a $162.5 million payment meant to cover the program through January. And the line has stayed long even after the 43-day federal government shutdown ended, Smith said. 
“As long as there’s still that fear out there, the lines are not going to go down,” she said. “It would take the government to agree all the time, which won’t ever happen.”
Amid the panic, Smith said Shepherd’s Closet will continue opening every Tuesday to give out as much food as people need without judgment.
“I don’t ask many questions, because that’s not my business,” she said. “God says, ‘Feed my people.’ That’s what I do.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3203-e1764175859222-1024x826.jpg,,,2025-11-27 08:57:25.223379

Some might leave the state to get one,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/27/mississippi-teacher-pay-raise/,Raising Mississippi teachers' pay will likely be a hot topic during the 2026 legislative session.,"Jason Reid’s day starts at 5 a.m.
He rolls out of bed, lets his dog out and drinks his first cup of coffee. After making sure his kids’ water bottles are full, Reid walks to nearby Lewisburg Elementary School. In the crisp air and dark morning, he starts a school bus, waiting for it to warm up.
Reid, a physical education teacher in DeSoto County School District, has been teaching for 17 years. But in 2019, he also started moonlighting as a bus driver to earn extra money.
This is a reality for educators in Mississippi, which has the nation’s lowest teacher pay. 
According to the National Education Association, the average teacher salary in Mississippi is $53,704. That’s $15,000 less than what the Economic Policy Institute says is needed to comfortably support a single parent, one child household in the Jackson metro area, which is $68,772. In DeSoto County, where Reid lives, that cost is even higher — $76,612 a year.
Even though some districts pay teachers more than the state minimum, without a spouse making higher pay, some educators say they have to keep second jobs and cut corners to make ends meet. 
Some promising young teachers — and even others with years of experience — are considering moving to other states where they are better compensated. 
Mississippi is up against a critical teacher shortage. Nearly 3,000 teacher jobs are vacant across the state, according to a 2024 survey conducted by the Mississippi Department of Education. Educators say the biggest contributing factor to those vacancies is low pay, according to the Mississippi Professional Educators’ annual survey.

Teacher vacancies mean bigger classrooms and less individualized time, which deeply impact student learning. Research shows that higher pay attracts quality teachers and incentivizes them to stay. 
On the heels of nationally recognized academic achievement in the state’s public schools, teachers say they deserve more. 
And legislators say they’re listening. The issue will likely be a hot topic during the 2026 legislative session. State leaders, such as Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, have indicated they’ll focus on raising teacher pay next year, and the Senate Education Committee met about the topic in October. House Speaker Jason White said this summer that his chamber will likely include all of its education policy, including school choice measures, in an omnibus bill next session.
Educators fear their salaries will get tied up in the controversial legislation.
“Teachers should not be held hostage and used as political pawns in order to gain support for another policy issue,” said Kelly Riley, executive director of Mississippi Professional Educators. “It appears to be another sign of disrespect for our educators and teaching profession as a whole.”
Legislators passed the last meaningful teacher pay raise in 2022, a historic increase of $5,140 on average per year. But teachers say that raise was almost immediately rendered null by health insurance premium increases and inflation.
And the retirement benefits that previously kept educators in the profession were changed earlier this year, when state legislators overhauled the public employee retirement system. Teachers who start after March 1, 2026, will receive fewer benefits than their peers. 
It’s a bleak outlook that young educators, such as second-year teacher Vivienne Diaz in Jackson, have to reckon with.
“I would like to stay in Mississippi, but after I finish my master’s degree, the amount of money I’d be making as a teacher …  after all these hours of work,” she said, “it’s just not worth it.”
‘A double kick to public school teachers’
Princess Thompson can smile about it now, but she remembers feeling shocked when she received her first paycheck 20 years ago. Her annual $24,000 salary translated to $1,300 a month.
“I asked my principal, ‘Is everything OK?’” said Thompson, who teaches music at an elementary school in Madison. “Me and another first-year teacher were like, ‘What happened here?’ Our principal laughed.”

Now, two decades into her career, her pay is better. But teaching has also gotten harder. Kids are entering kindergarten with learning difficulties that should have been addressed in preschool. She said that this generation of children, raised around screens, is difficult to keep engaged.
On the Gulf Coast, Carrie Bartlett’s older students are also easily distracted, and she reports more behavior issues in recent years. Without commensurate pay, it’s increasingly frustrating to deal with, she said.
Bartlett has been teaching social studies at Long Beach High School for 15 years, and her husband teaches at Long Beach Middle School. With a daughter in her sophomore year of high school and a son in college, their finances are tight.
When Bartlett and her colleagues commiserate, they echo the same sentiments about the job — they love being educators, but they wish they were getting compensated as professionals.
“I think that teaching is an important job, and it’s rewarding intrinsically,” Bartlett said. “I just wish it was more extrinsically rewarding and that the state had higher appreciation for us doing this job, educating the state’s future.” 
Despite talks about raising teacher pay next year, Bartlett doesn’t feel appreciated. Adding insult to injury are state leaders’ discussions about expanding school choice, or policies to fund education outside of public schools, she said. 
“Pay raises should continue regularly and not be attached to political footballs, which is what I fear will happen this year,” she said. “It’s a double kick to public school teachers.”
Rising health insurance costs
The worst part about being a teacher? According to Reid — and educators across the state surveyed by the teachers association — it’s the health insurance premiums. 
When the state raised teacher pay in 2022, the monthly cost for teachers to insure themselves and their families was around $700. 
Four years later, that’s up to about $900 a month, or $10,800 a year. It’s an annual increase of $2,400. For a teacher with 10 years of experience and a master’s degree, that’s more than a fifth of their salary. At the same time, deductibles have gone up.
Rising premiums are a major part of what’s driving teachers away from the sector, said Megan Boren, who leads teacher workforce policy efforts for the Southern Regional Education Board, a nonprofit focused on improving education. In October, Boren spoke to Mississippi senators about challenges facing the education system nationwide and in the South. During that presentation, she said health insurance premiums have gone down in the region, largely due to reductions in two Southern states with some of the highest premiums. 
In Mississippi and most of the region, costs keep going up.
“Typically, older and more experienced teachers are the ones who have a family to cover,” she told Mississippi Today. “When you factor in premiums for a family, those teachers’ net pay has decreased because of that significantly increased cost.”
Reid has had cancer twice. During his second round of treatment in 2022, his deductible was $13,000. He met the deductible early on, but still spent a huge chunk of money, he said. And as a teacher, there’s not an option to take paid medical leave.
“We go on vacation … we’re not living paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “But we can’t live the lifestyle a lot of neighbors would live.”
Reid’s wife also drives a school bus to supplement their income. Their kids are limited to one sport each. The family used just one car to get around for a long time. And for a year, they made do with a mostly broken washer.

It’s not what a 17-year classroom veteran deserves, he said. 
After a quarter century in the classroom, Julie Price, a third grade reading and social studies teacher in Pearl, is getting paid less than her son in his first year as a civil engineer at the Mississippi Department of Transportation. 
“I’m proud of him, and I know the job is challenging and complicated,” she said. “But that was a slap in the face.” 
Though Price is too invested in her life in Mississippi to leave, temptation lingers. In her home state of Alabama, just a few hours away, she’d be paid almost $10,000 more each year, she said.  
Price’s husband died from COVID-19 complications in January 2021. Abruptly going from two salaries to one, right as her son was headed to college, was hard — and still is, she said. 
Recently, Price had to renew her car tag, a $300 expense that she didn’t budget for. She and her son only eat out once a week. And without meeting her deductible, going to the doctor for continuing neck issues has been expensive. 
“If you don’t have some cushion in there, you’d wipe your money out,” Price said. “Then how would you live?”
To attract quality people to the profession in Mississippi, Reid said, pay raises need to be frequent and substantial.
“Politicians can’t raise pay once and take three to four years off in between election cycles because these pay raises degrade so quickly,” he said. 
“If we want our schools to be great, we’ve got to pay for that.”
Can Mississippi teachers afford to stay?

What she sees ahead makes her nervous.

Diaz, the daughter of a teacher, didn’t go in blind. She knew her pay wouldn’t reflect the hours she’d spend outside of the classroom, planning her lessons and sponsoring a club. With her free time, Diaz helps plan educational programming and teaches at her synagogue on Sundays, which brings in around $200 a month. 
“My senior year, I told my mom, ‘I’ll never be a teacher. I see how you get treated,’” she said. “It is just as difficult as I knew it was going to be.”
But she loves mentoring her students, getting to watch them bloom and being part of the process. That’s why she became a teacher, despite the challenges. 
Still, when Diaz finishes her master’s degree in teaching, it doesn’t financially make sense for her to stay, no matter how much she loves teaching. She’s looking into schools in other states or a job in Mississippi in another field.
Diaz is exactly the kind of person Mississippi leaders want to keep around — a young, smart professional who might make her home and raise her family here. A pay raise is the bare minimum state leaders could do to keep people like Diaz in Mississippi, said Boren of SREB. 
“It’s really important for state leaders to recognize that the work here to help kind of restore faith in the profession, restore those wanting to come in and stay in the profession, it’s a comprehensive approach,” Boren said. “There’s not one silver bullet. Increasing pay alone is not going to cover it. 
“That’s not always what our leaders want to hear. They want to hear what’s the solution and how to fix it now, and I sympathize with that, but the solution is a comprehensive plan and a comprehensive investment in our educators and in the profession as a whole.”
Diaz might reconsider if lawmakers pass a substantial raise, she said. But even then, she’d think twice.
“I love watching my students learn and develop and become new people,” Diaz said. “But just because I have that heart doesn’t mean I don’t deserve that good paycheck.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10104333/3X0A2628.jpg,,,2025-11-27 12:58:49.861627

SB 24, sponsored by Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, requires the Board of Pardons and Paroles to inform those who have lost their right to vote how to register to vote. Messages seeking comment from Coleman-Madison were left Tuesday. 
Under current law, certain people who have lost the right to vote due to a conviction can re-register once they serve their sentence and pay any fines related to the conviction. Current law does not require the Board of Pardons and Paroles to educate those people on how to get their voting status restored.

Jerome Dees, Alabama policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), said in an interview Monday that SPLC is supportive of any legislation that makes participation in democracy easier.
“The concept that restoring voting rights overall, whether that’s administrative or legislation that directly gets at restoring the right and changing eligibility, ultimately strengthens families and communities,” Dees said. 
Coleman-Madison sponsored a similar bill in the 2025 session. It was approved by the Senate, and the House Judiciary Committee, but was not considered by the full House. The 2026 bill mirrors the latest version of the 2025 bill.
According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), treason and impeachment are the only crimes not eligible for restoration of voting rights. 
“There’s an extensive list that was actually recently added to … you temporarily lose the ability to vote, but then you have the ability, after certain criteria are met, to have that right restored,” Dees said.
According to the Alabama Department of Corrections, 21,034 people are in Alabama’s prisons. The state is building a new prison in Elmore County, which is scheduled to open in October, to help reduce overcrowding.
The bill also requires the Board of Pardons and Paroles to notify the Secretary of State’s Office of who has completed the necessary steps to restore their voting rights. A message seeking comment from the Secretary of State’s Office was left Monday afternoon. 
“I certainly hope that the Secretary of State will see the benefit of efficiency in the process and making sure that individuals who do have the right to vote, and whether that’s they never lost it or it has been restored that they are given every opportunity to be able to participate in the voting process, particularly if that means the government removing hurdles and obstructions for those individuals,” Dees said. 
Dees said that most convicted of a felony never lose their right to vote, but the lack of education on registering to vote.
“There are a number of individuals who have been convicted of that first category that never lost their right to vote, but because of the lack of general public education and awareness, believed that they had lost their right to vote and just had never voted since,” Dees said.

Levitt,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/27/hudson-river-rail-tunnels/,"As Amtrak awaits the completion of the Gateway project, its crews spend every day inspecting the old tunnels it will replace.","Workers inside one of the Hudson River rail tunnels. (Courtesy of Amtrak)Every night, about 20 to 30 workers head inside the rail tunnels under the Hudson River to make sure New Jersey commuters can make it safely in and out of Manhattan.
They eyeball the decaying 115-year-old tunnels, which for more than a decade have been slated to be augmented by new tunnel projects, and make sure they are clear and passable.
Officials in both states want the old tunnels, which opened during the Taft administration, supplemented with newer tubes. While the $16 billion project to build those tunnels, sometimes called the most important infrastructure project in the nation, is a cause celebre, not much is ever said about the current tunnels and the daily cause of making sure the 450 or so trains daily servicing more than 200,000 riders can pass through them.
The failure of even one of the two tubes would be a catastrophe for the entire northeast, but especially New York and northern New Jersey.

“We are not at a critical failure point yet. We could be if we don’t keep up with our maintenance and demands, but we are not yet at that point,”  said David Albright, Amtrak’s assistant division engineer for fire and life safety.
He added: “Because we spend time in there, and we do a lot of preventative maintenance, we are in a good state of repair.”
Albright leads the team of workers who inspect the tunnels, two tubes that connect New Jersey to New York Penn Station, the nation’s busiest train transit hub, as well as the four tubes under the East River that also service NJ Transit by providing it with a connection to the Sunnyside Yards in Queens, where trains bound for the Garden State are staged. The tunnels form a critical link that ties together not only Amtrak’s northeast corridor, but also NJ Transit and the Long Island Rail Road’s commuter service. 
Amtrak calls them the North River tunnels, a vestige of the days that ended in the 17th century when the region was controlled by the Dutch. They called the Hudson the North River, and the Delaware was called the South River.
Both tunnels are decrepit and in danger of not being passable. Albright’s team maintains and potentially upgrades the performance of these tunnels while waiting out the almost-decade it will take for them to be augmented with the two new tubes, called the Gateway project. 
“When you have 115-year-old infrastructure, you are going to see failure points,” Albright said.
His job often entails going into the tunnels and looking for cracks and fissures, or evidence of decay. In addition to his regular title, Albright is co-chair of the New York Penn Station and tunnel system emergency response task force. 
It didn’t help matters that, when the region was hit in October 2012 by Hurricane Sandy, the tunnels were inundated with up to six feet of salt water. Though the water is long gone, its corrosive power is still felt 13 years later and likely to continue for years more, causing disintegration of the largely concrete tubes. 
“Overall Amtrak’s goal is to not change any train service,” he said  “They want to maintain the same level of service, the same on-time service that we currently provide. And still update our infrastructure.” 
The digging of the new tunnels is an infrastructure project that never quite fades from the news. An earlier version was shut down by then-Gov. Chris Christie in 2010, who cited potential cost overruns. And during the recent federal government shutdown, President Donald Trump said he had terminated “the project in New York,” largely believed to be a reference to Gateway and/or the 2nd Avenue subway project.
Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the Gateway Development Commission, a bi-state agency that represents the interests of the two states in expediting the project, said Gateway remains on track to be completed in 2035. 
Evidence of the project may be seen on Tonnelle Avenue, where a roadway bridge in North Bergen is being built that will carry Routes 1&9 over the tracks leading to the new tunnel. To the east, work is underway on the Palisades Tunnel, preparing the site for building the first mile of new tunnel with state-of-the-art boring machines. Such a machine is scheduled to arrive there in early 2026.
Overhead bridge and utility relocations have commenced at Tonnelle, and in New York, the construction of concrete casing in the Hudson Yards train yard has begun, according to Amtrak. 
Sigmund said the project is “on scope, schedule, and budget.”
Albright said he and his team are responsible for all the maintenance in the existing tunnels except for maintaining the tracks and the electronic traction system, which you may know from outside the tunnels as the catenary wires that feed power to the trains. Those are handled by a different engineering team at Amtrak. Amtrak is responsible for maintenance along the northeast corridor route for both NJ Transit and its own trains.
Albright’s team is responsible for maintaining the “benchwalls,” which are the concrete walls of each tube. The tunnel walls are about two feet thick, and they are constructed of reinforced concrete and steel.
These tunnels are the only way for Amtrak and NJ Transit trains to get in and out of Manhattan, noted  Amtrak spokesman Jason Abrams. That makes it different from elsewhere in the coast-to-coast Amtrak system. In other places, trains can be rerouted around a problem spot. 
The walls carry all the electronic components that control the signaling, Albright said. The catenary system was severely damaged by the Sandy infiltration and is in need of an overhaul. 
Abrams said the railroad has installed flood doors outside the tubes to ward off any further inundation caused by a new storm.
Permanent repairs for the existing tunnels must wait until the middle of the next decade, when the first of the new tunnels is placed into service. At that time, one of the existing tubes will be taken out of service for the year and a half it will take to fully renovate it. Then it’s the other tube’s turn.
Other entities, notably New York’s police and fire departments and North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue, also have teams that examine the tunnels, Albright said.  
Albright and his team are also responsible for keeping passable the emergency evacuation system that hopefully no one ever has to use.
“We have egress door, ventilation shafts, there are also some passages that go between the two tunnels” that at its deepest is about 90 feet from the surface of the river, he said. “That could be detrimental to some of our riding public, to have to go up those stairs in emergencies.” 
He said Amtrak’s goal is first to send in a rescue engine to push or pull a stalled train out.
The White House has not clarified Trump’s remarks from October on the Gateway project’s potential termination. And Gateway itself is not commenting on that threat.
“We have, and continue to, decline comment on the President’s remarks from October,” Sigmund said.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in the Other Paper on Nov. 26, 2025.
The South Burlington school board and South Burlington Educators’ Association have ratified new tentative agreements for both a three-year teachers’ contract and a two-year support staff contract.
The contracts, while not yet publicly available by press deadline, will retroactively cover July 1 of this year through June 30, 2028, for teachers and through June 30, 2027, for support staff.
Teachers will receive a 4.25% raise for the first two years of the contract, with the third year increase set at whatever the inflation number is at the time, anywhere between 2-5%. Support staff will receive a 5.25% raise for the first year, and the same inflation-fixed increase for the second year.

“I think the overall story is that the board went into the negotiation very committed to holding costs down and making sustainable budgeting possible — the 4.25% and inflation being the three years of the term were the lowest cost that we could get,” School Board Chair Seamus Abshere said. “And in the last year, we were signaling an interest in returning to essentially cost-of-living adjustment based on inflation.”
Joe McNeil, the board’s attorney, noted that while the contract essentially maintains the same terms and conditions as previously in effect, most of the negotiations centered around money. And compared to past years, an agreement was come to relatively quickly.
“This really, for South Burlington, was fairly expeditious in the sense that several of the last agreements included declarations of impasse and then required mediation and fact finding,” McNeil said. “And in two instances, there were strikes.”
Noah Everitt, co-president of the South Burlington Educators’ Association, agreed that previous negotiations have often been characterized as contentious, but discussions this time didn’t fit that mold. Aside from the wage increase conversations, there weren’t any significant issues being negotiated this year, largely, Everitt said, thanks to the maturity of past contracts which had ironed out a lot of issues.
“I think any negotiation is ideally a place where both parties feel good about the resulting deal,” Everitt said. “And I think that that’s true of this one.”
He said that this time around, there were improvements made to language in the contract regarding the reduction in the force of probationary employees being placed on a “recall list.”
“That had been a challenge for folks in the past, because if you’re on probation in those first two years and different budgeting years can sometimes have some anticipated reductions that don’t end up happening because the budget passes,” Everitt said. “This would allow those folks to keep their jobs without having to reapply or start probation over.
While he didn’t consider this any sort of big win, it is ultimately better for everyone, he said.
Everitt led negotiations on the union side with a small team of teachers, while Abshere and new school board member Dan Boyer represented the board. Prior to Abshere, former board member Tim Warren had represented the board until he resigned in July amid district-wide tumult.
Beginning this spring, as the union demanded more vision and leadership around a passed budget that resulted in the reduction of nearly 15 full time equivalent positions, tensions were at an all-time high between teachers, district leadership and board members. The union ultimately engaged in multiple months of public activism and demanded that former superintendent Violet Nichols be removed from her role.
McNeil noted that anytime there is turmoil, there is concern about trust and the ability to speak candidly during negotiations for fear of creating additional fervor. But in this case, he said, when it came to negotiations, there was interest on both sides to begin the school year on a new page without letting those distractions get in the way.
Although some expressed concern that the public activism was a way for the union to get a leg up in negotiations, Everitt said that what was being discussed at the negotiating table had nothing to do with their asks from the district at that time.
“Those things were not the same,” he said. “We’ve really focused on trying to just maintain a consistent set of values that puts teachers and students first. And we think that by being consistent, a relationship can be developed between what can for teachers seem like a revolving door of board members, because they will be able to predict our behavior.”

It is important for all of America to recognize the degree to which the nation’s rogue leadership has pitted one America against the other and is tearing the nation apart.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  David Moats: Two Americas.","This commentary is by David Moats, of Salisbury. He is editorial page editor emeritus at the Rutland Herald, where he won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for a series of editorials on Vermont’s civil union law.
Two Americas were in evidence in Middlebury one Saturday in October


One America was present at Middlebury College for a football game against the team from Bates College. This is the America where higher education is a common rite of passage, where international travel is a frequent avenue of adventure and cultural enrichment, where travel on the nation’s highways occasions a feeling of liberation, where home ownership is taken for granted. It is where people stand for the national anthem and the commonly felt message is: This is America.
But there is another America, also present in Middlebury that Saturday. At the Champlain Valley Unitarian-Universalist Church, a steady stream of people arrived during the day to meet with officials from the Mexican consulate in Boston. They were migrants seeking Mexican passports, mostly young men, but also women and children. The sanctuary was full, and the mood was relaxed and friendly, but the families there were all too aware of the danger around them — the arbitrary detention and deportation that could come crashing down on them at any time. 
The visit by Mexican consular officials is an annual event meant to serve residents from Mexico. But the Latino population in Vermont consists of more than the Mexican farm workers who for years have kept Vermont’s dairy economy afloat. Ecuadorean, Guatemalan, Venezuelan, Peruvian, Honduran, Brazilian, and other immigrants work in roofing, construction and other industries, many or most of them lacking the documentation that could protect them from the ongoing immigration crackdown.
It is easy for the one America not to notice the other. But among those who have noticed are the volunteers who work to provide health care, food, transportation, education, legal representation and other support for migrants, many of whom live in isolation out on the farm.
For the consular visit, the Open Door Clinic of Middlebury had put up tables along one side of the sanctuary to provide vaccinations and health care information. The advocacy group Migrant Justice had set up its own table. The language of the day was Spanish, and numerous volunteers with Spanish language skills were pitching in to help
One of those helping was Fernanda Canales, who came to the United States with her Chilean family when she was 14 years old and who recently retired after a 39-year career in education. For the last 16 years she was principal of the Salisbury Community School in Addison County.
And yet as deeply embedded in the community as she was, she said it was only after she retired and began work helping the region’s migrant population that she came to recognize and appreciate the broad and diverse Latino community that existed in Vermont. Even for her, an immigrant herself, the migrant community had largely been out of view.
Now Canales works as dental coordinator for the Open Door Clinic and as the multilingual liaison for the Addison Central School District. When she arrived in the United States, she knew no English. “I understand the journey,” she said, and she is glad for the chance to help with the journey of the thousands of Latinos trying to set down roots in Vermont.
It is not an easy journey, and it is getting harder. Vermont is not Chicago or Los Angeles, but Migrant Justice has compiled a list of 87 people detained this year by Customs and Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement as of a month ago. Since then more have been detained, including a group of 17 recently imprisoned at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in Franklin County. Detainees are often people grabbed up on their way to work. They are people without recourse, which is why Migrant Justice and the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project work to keep track of who they are and what becomes of them.
Stories continue to emerge from across the nation of violent tactics by masked agents who act with impunity, ignoring due process and seizing people at will from the streets or on the job. For comfortable America, free to come and go, to take in the football game, or enjoy a vacation in Cancun, it is becoming an act of willful blindness to ignore or excuse the barbaric conditions at hastily constructed detention camps and the lawless manner in which people are seized and taken away from their families.  
It is important for the one America to see the other — see the people, driven by their own enterprising spirit to seek opportunity north of the border and to find jobs that will help them support their families here and back home, jobs upon which the U.S. economy depends.
It is important for all of America to recognize the degree to which the nation’s rogue leadership has pitted one America against the other and is tearing the nation apart. 
It need not be that way.

On Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, George Washington woke early. Assisted by his enslaved valets – William “Billy” Lee and the young Christopher Sheels – he powdered his hair, put on his favorite black velvet suit, tied his white neckwear and donned his yellow gloves.
Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.
He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
Devotion in the service of unity
It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The first took place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621 — Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag Tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving — which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-General Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November — it became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.
Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”
The president had prepared for the occasion. He also contributed a sizable sum of his own money to buy beer and food for prisoners confined for debt in the New York City jail. The donation was deemed to be a magnanimous and moving gesture, suitable to the spirit of the holiday. A week later, in an advertisement in the Dec. 3 issue of the New York Journal, those very prisoners returned their “grateful thanks” to their president “for his very acceptable donation on Thursday last.”
Washington’s first Thanksgiving as a president may have not been tremendously successful, given the scarce attendance at the church service.
Yet, as a scholar writing a biography about Washington, I believe it was an important step in his much larger political plan to bring the executive branch to the people’s doorstep.
What Washington wanted was a virtuous kind of populism in the new country he led. Washington’s populism wasn’t about inciting an angry mob; it was about sharing in their rituals, worshiping their God, speaking their own language. And he did so in the sole interest of the American people.
Thanksgiving 1789, for Washington, was at once religious and more than religious. Washington’s proclamation invoked devotional language, literally. The upcoming festivity, in his words, could “be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”
But Washington’s main concern was political. The nation was recently formed, and he feared that it could easily collapse. Its many internal divisions and separate interests could be lethal. Consequently, the president wanted this holiday to be a civic celebration in which “we may then all unite.”
As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws. Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.
He was a slave owner, a relentless pursuer of African American fugitives and a destroyer of Native American villages. He was also a warrior who deployed brutality against enemies. He was a commander who resorted to corporal punishment with his own soldiers. Washington believed that he was not a saint to be mindlessly imitated. This made him humble in his duties.
More importantly, Washington also grasped the power of his symbolic position as president. He sought to leverage that for the good of the nation.
As president, Washington could not advertise his actions effectively via Twitter and social media. He had to show himself around constantly, no matter the weather. He had to painstakingly attend balls, plays, dinners, public receptions and of course the church. Every occasion, every Thanksgiving counted.
Through his outings, Washington met with a diversity of people, including those who were second-class citizens or were not citizens at all. Women, for example, greeted Washington at nearly every stop of the extended presidential trips he took between 1789 and 1791. Textile workers in New England, Jewish leaders in Newport, many enslaved persons in the South and churchgoers everywhere did the same.
These women and men, in bondage or free, believers or skeptics, played a part in the invention of a new political theater. Maybe, it was just a theatrical illusion. But these individuals – just like the prisoners in the New York City jail — thanked President Washington because they felt they were voices in a larger political culture.
Washington made sure his Thanksgiving message — not simply a message, but a “proclamation” — sounded clear and strong: May God “render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed.”

(Photo by Jean Beaufort)I have always been intrigued by Thanksgiving — the traditions, the meal, the idea of a holiday that is simply about being thankful.

For my family, Thanksgiving is all about the food. Some foods, like turkey and mashed potatoes, may be familiar. But there are a few twists. Since I grew up in the Caribbean, I’m allowed a Caribbean dish or two. The reliability of the menu – with a little flexibility sprinkled in – seems to unite us as a family while acknowledging our different cultural backgrounds.
Chances are you and your family have similar traditions. Filipino-American families might include pancit. Russian-American families might serve a side dish of borscht. That’s what makes Thanksgiving unique. It’s a holiday embraced by people regardless of their religion or ethnicity.
Yet despite this adaptability, there’s a core part of the meal that almost everyone embraces. How did this come to be? Although few appreciate it, advertisers have shaped the meal as much as family tradition.
A uniquely broad appeal
When Sarah Josepha Hale, the editor of Godey’s Lady’s Book, first advocated for Thanksgiving as a national holiday in 1846, she argued that it would unify the country. In our research, my colleagues and I have been able to show that Hale’s vision for the holiday has been largely fulfilled: Inclusivity of people and traditions has been Thanksgiving’s hallmark quality.
A reason for its broad appeal is that it lacks any association with an institutionalized religion. As one interviewee told us, “There is no other purpose than to sit down with your family and be thankful.” And after interviewing a range of people – from those born in the U.S. to immigrants from countries like South Africa, Australia and China – it became obvious that the principles and rituals they embraced during the holiday were universal no matter the culture: family, food and gratitude.
But as a relatively new holiday – one not tied to a religious or patriotic tradition – a shared understanding of the celebration and the meal is crucial to ensure its long-term survival.
While there might be subtle variations, the Thanksgiving meal is the lodestone of the holiday, the magnet that brings people together. Today, familiar items constitute the meal: turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, gravy, alcohol, salad, apple pie and pumpkin pie. Many of our interviewees tended to serve some version of this list.
But why these items and not others? What makes turkey, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie so special? My colleagues and I studied 99 years of Thanksgiving ads in Good Housekeeping magazine to find out.
Marketing a ritual
Starting with Thanksgiving’s early champion, Sarah Josepha Hale, the history of Thanksgiving is rooted in marketing. Marketers not only helped create many of the rituals and cultural myths associated with the Thanksgiving meal, but they also legitimized and maintained them.
Aladdin Cooking Utensils advertises its double roaster in a 1920 issue of Good Housekeeping.

Initially, the Thanksgiving turkey competed with other meats, like duck, chicken and goose, for centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table.
But by the 1920s, turkey had become the only meat advertised. Early ads would focus on how to prepare and present the perfect bird, promoting branded tools like roasters, ranges, pop-up thermometers and oven-cooking bags.
Iconic Swift’s Premium turkey ads focused on the sacredness of the meal by featuring families at prayer, giving thanks before the meal begins. The importance of the turkey to the Thanksgiving celebration dominates, helping to perpetuate the Thanksgiving turkey tradition.
Meanwhile, early ads for the Eatmor Cranberry Company positioned their whole cranberries as a perfect complement to any and all Thanksgiving meat dishes. This brand dominated until the 1930s when another brand, Ocean Spray, entered with its canned gelatin cranberry sauce.

Ads for both brands implied that cranberry sauce has been around since the first Thanksgiving dinner, which was highly unlikely. However, the brand positioning war successfully promoted cranberry sauce as the natural condiment for the Thanksgiving turkey. Ocean Spray would triumph and, to this day, promotes whole cranberries and canned gelatin.
Considered by many to be the quintessential Thanksgiving dessert, pumpkin pie also wasn’t present at the first Thanksgiving meal. (The Pilgrims lacked the butter, wheat flour and sugar to make the pastry.) Nonetheless, beginning as early as 1925, a range of brands – for example, Borden’s, Snowdrift, Mrs. Smith’s and Libby’s – have competed fiercely to connect pumpkin pie to the season, the holiday and the meal. It’s a rivalry that continues to this day.
The role of the consumer
Not every product category or brand succeeded in becoming a core part of the Thanksgiving meal.
A Welch’s ad from the 1960s implies that the first Thanksgiving meal included juice made from grapes. In 1928, Diamond marketed their walnuts as an accessory to dress up Thanksgiving dishes. Despite vociferous ad campaigns, few associate Welch’s grape juice or Diamond walnuts with Thanksgiving today.
But those early 20th-century ads for turkey clearly resonated: Today, nearly 88 percent of U.S. households have turkey on Thanksgiving, and approximately 20 percent of the turkeys consumed in any given year are consumed at Thanksgiving. This is a testament to the enduring influence of marketing on the holiday. For brands like Butterball (formerly Swift’s Premium), Thanksgiving is big business.
Whether you’re a turkey fan or not, prefer apple pie to pumpkin pie, enjoy canned gelatin over whole cranberry sauce, by celebrating Thanksgiving, you play a role as well. Marketers may have shaped many of the rituals of the holiday. But all Americans – from all backgrounds – certainly do their part to maintain them.

Nine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.
But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
Farming faiths and harvest festivals
The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.
Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
‘Days of Thanksgiving’ 
The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
Harvest feast of 1621
Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”

Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
Pilgrims’ primacy
The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.
The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
Rising immigration
Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.

Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

On Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, George Washington woke early. Assisted by his enslaved valets — William “Billy” Lee and the young Christopher Sheels — he powdered his hair, put on his favorite black velvet suit, tied his white neckwear and donned his yellow gloves.
Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.

He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
Devotion in the service of unity

	
It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The first took place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621 — Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving — which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-General Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November — it became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.

Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”
The president had prepared for the occasion. He also contributed a sizable sum of his own money to buy beer and food for prisoners confined for debt in the New York City jail. The donation was deemed to be a magnanimous and moving gesture, suitable to the spirit of the holiday. A week later, in an advertisement in the Dec. 3 issue of the New York Journal, those very prisoners returned their “grateful thanks” to their president “for his very acceptable donation on Thursday last.”
Washington’s first Thanksgiving as a president may have not been tremendously successful, given the scarce attendance at the church service.
Yet, as a scholar writing a biography about Washington, I believe it was an important step in his much larger political plan to bring the executive branch to the people’s doorstep.
What Washington wanted was a virtuous kind of populism in the new country he led. Washington’s populism wasn’t about inciting an angry mob; it was about sharing in their rituals, worshiping their God, speaking their own language. And he did so in the sole interest of the American people.
Thanksgiving 1789, for Washington, was at once religious and more than religious. Washington’s proclamation invoked devotional language, literally. The upcoming festivity, in his words, could “be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”
But Washington’s main concern was political. The nation was recently formed, and he feared that it could easily collapse. Its many internal divisions and separate interests could be lethal. Consequently, the president wanted this holiday to be a civic celebration in which “we may then all unite.”

Washington’s proclamation was printed in newspapers throughout the country. (George Washington’s Mt. Vernon)
‘Pardon our national…transgressions’

	
As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws. Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.
He was a slave owner, a relentless pursuer of African American fugitives and a destroyer of Native American villages. He was also a warrior who deployed brutality against enemies. He was a commander who resorted to corporal punishment with his own soldiers. Washington believed that he was not a saint to be mindlessly imitated. This made him humble in his duties.
More importantly, Washington also grasped the power of his symbolic position as president. He sought to leverage that for the good of the nation.
As president, Washington could not advertise his actions effectively via Twitter and social media. He had to show himself around constantly, no matter the weather. He had to painstakingly attend balls, plays, dinners, public receptions and of course the church. Every occasion, every Thanksgiving counted.
Through his outings, Washington met with a diversity of people, including those who were second-class citizens or were not citizens at all. Women, for example, greeted Washington at nearly every stop of the extended presidential trips he took between 1789 and 1791. Textile workers in New England, Jewish leaders in Newport, many enslaved persons in the South and churchgoers everywhere did the same.
These women and men, in bondage or free, believers or skeptics, played a part in the invention of a new political theater. Maybe, it was just a theatrical illusion. But these individuals — just like the prisoners in the New York City jail — thanked President Washington because they felt they were voices in a larger political culture.
Washington made sure his Thanksgiving message — not simply a message, but a “proclamation” — sounded clear and strong: May God “render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed.”

Adoptions for three young Michigan children were celebrated on Tuesday morning at this year’s Michigan Adoption Day Ceremony, held in the Michigan Supreme Court chambers.

Boxes of tissues were placed throughout the room for that very reason. 
“I think I can declare that this is definitely the best day here in our court,” Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Megan Cavanagh said at the start of the event. “Too often, what happens in a courtroom, including this one, involves sadness and tears as well as life changing decisions. But today, we replace sadness with joy, but we keep those tears and the life changing decisions for the families this morning.”
Eaton County Probate Judge Amanda Pollard presided over the adoption finalizations for two families from Eaton County.
Jackson Adams, 5, was adopted by his biological grandparents, Timothy and Lori Adams, who have served as his guardians since he was around two years old. Surrounded at the ceremony by other members of their family, they wore pins in memory of Jackson’s biological parents, who are both deceased. 
“We are so grateful that we have had such great help from the legal system and from our family,” Lori Adams said. “We’re here, and thank you.”

Milah and Autumn Woolley, ages 7 and 2, were adopted by their foster parents, Lyonel and Monalisa Woolley, alongside the Woolleys’ older son. Myla and Autumn are sisters and were adopted together at Tuesday’s ceremony, after being with the Woolleys for over two years.
“Since that day, they’ve been a part of my family,” said Lyonel Wooley. “I couldn’t go on without them being a part of my family.”
Pollard heaped praise on the Woolley family.
“I think that they exemplify, from my experience, what we should ask for in foster parents, opening their homes and loving support for kids who are in need of that support,” Pollard said, who presided over the foster case for several years.
Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Elizabeth Hertel said, in a speech after the adoption finalizations, that there are around 1800 children in Michigan currently in foster care with the goal of adoption.

“Days like these are such an important reminder of the love and the New Beginnings that adoption can bring to children and families across the state,” Hertel said. “It also serves as an incredibly important reminder to us about why our department and all of our partners continue to do the work that we do connecting kids to adoptive parents when we need to.”
Michigan hosts an Adoption Day ceremony each year. This year’s event, with the theme “Giving Thanks for Families,” marked the 23rd ceremony. 
“It’s a day set aside to shine a spotlight on the adoptions and celebrate the families who are finalizing their journeys today, whether it’s here in the courtrooms or across the state, we want to say congratulations to all the families today,” said Demetrius Starling, senior deputy director at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. “Your decision to open your hearts and your homes is a profound act of love, kindness and compassion, hope for all of our children and we thank you for making a lasting difference in a child’s life.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_3132-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-27 07:58:46.541129

Mike Braun — now governor of Indiana — and U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin were among the 118th Congress’ most effective lawmakers, in an issue-specific analysis by the Center for Effective Lawmaking.
The center is a nonpartisan collaboration between the University of Virginia’s Batten School and Vanderbilt University.
Researchers there used 15 indicators of effectiveness to calculate scores for lawmakers who served from January 2023 to 2025. The metrics gauge how many bills a lawmaker sponsored, how substantial the policy proposals within were, and how far those ideas moved though the legislative process.
Then, they identified the top two performers — a Republican and Democrat — across 21 policy areas. The results were published last week.

Braun was named the most effective Senate Republican on housing policy. He got points for sponsoring two “substantive” pieces of housing-related legislation, one of which passed the Senate chamber, but didn’t become law.
Houchin was named the most effective House Republican on education matters. She sponsored one “substantive and significant” education proposal that became law, plus two “substantive” bills that died early on.
Committee chairs are often among best performers, but neither Braun nor Houchin led committees handling their respective top policy areas.
A broader analysis of the 118th Congress, released in March, identified Braun as the ninth-most effective lawmaker in the Senate, as well as the chamber’s fourth-best Republican.
He was lauded for introducing 116 bills, seven of which passed the Senate and four of which became law. Braun was also listed among first-term senators “exceeding expectations” by outperforming a benchmark.
“With Sen. Braun concluding his service in the Senate to become Governor of Indiana in January 2025, it is clear that there will be one less effective lawmaker among the more senior ranks in the Senate moving forward,” researchers wrote at the time.
All members of the 118th Congress, including the rest of Indiana’s delegation, are scored in an online database. They’re ranked by party.
Sen. Todd Young was lower than Braun despite sponsoring nearly three-dozen bills; one passed the Senate but it didn’t become law.
Rep. Larry Bucshon, who retired from the House in January, was the most effective Hoosier overall in that chamber. He was followed by Houchin and former U.S. Rep. Jim Banks, who has since won Braun’s seat in the Senate.
Former Rep. Greg Pence and current Rep. Jim Baird are next. Reps. Rudy Yakym and Victoria Spartz were near the bottom of the 228 Republicans.
Indiana’s two Democratic lawmakers, Reps. Frank Mrvan and André Carson, were also near the bottom of the 220 Democrats.
State lawmakers plan to meet in December to consider redrawing Indiana’s congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Those efforts will target Mrvan and Carson.

The sixth-ranked Rebels (10-1, 6-1 SEC, No. 7 CFP) could lock up a spot in the College Football Playoff with a victory Friday over the Bulldogs (5-6, 1-6) in the Egg Bowl — only to have their celebration muted if coach Lane Kiffin announces after the game that he has decided to leave the program for another suitor.
During the past two weeks, Kiffin family members have traveled from Oxford to both Gainesville, Florida, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, while Ole Miss has sought to fend off efforts by Florida and LSU to lure away their coach.
Kiffin and Mississippi athletics director Keith Carter had a meeting last Friday where they reportedly discussed the coach’s future. Carter emerged from that with a public statement that Kiffin was focused on the Egg Bowl and a decision on his future would be announced by Saturday.
The sixth-year Rebels coach has offered little clarity since.
“Keith and I have a great relationship. We communicate daily on a lot of things and I love it here. It’s been amazing,” Kiffin said. “We’re in a season that’s the greatest run in the history of Ole Miss at this point, having never been at this point.
“It’s really exciting. So, I’m just living in the moment,” Kiffin continued. “And our players are, too, you know? I see their joy … about where they’re at and have so much on the line. It’s just awesome to be a part of.”
This is the second time that the rivalry game has been shadowed by Kiffin’s potential exit from Oxford.
In 2022, Kiffin was linked to an opening at Auburn. His Rebels lost to the Bulldogs at home, 24-22, and wound up 8-5, but Kiffin signed an extension with Ole Miss.
Going for gold
A trophy known as the Golden Egg has gone to the winner of this matchup since 1927 — a year after a brawl broke out in Starkville after Ole Miss fans attempted to take down the goal posts.
There has been plenty more vitriol between them since, regardless of what else was at stake for either team.

On Friday, the stakes are higher for the Rebels, but the Bulldogs have a chance to extend their season as well because one more victory would make them bowl eligible in coach Jeff Lebby’s second season.
“We have a bunch of staff members that played here and played inside this game, understand what it’s about,” Lebby said. “The more you can talk about that part of it and guys that have come before and played in between the white lines in this game, they have the ability to communicate to our guys that haven’t been here long and don’t know the history as some of the others.
“It’s great for our entire football team to understand the urgency of what’s at stake,” Lebby added. “You see the guys that are from this state and have played in this game, there’s great pride in how we do what we go do on Friday.”
Recent dominance
Ole Miss has had the better of this rivalry in recent years, winning the past two and four of the past five.
But Kiffin, who had Lebby on his Ole Miss staff earlier this decade, has been impressed by the Bulldogs’ improvement this season.
“Lebby’s done a great job,” Kiffin said, calling him “one of the best offensive minds in football.”
Meanwhile, Kiffin declined to discuss his future this week and said his players have not appeared distracted by the uncertainty surrounding their coach.
“Our team has been very focused since noise has been out there,” Kiffin said. “It’s a different generation … They all can leave every year. A lot of that is financially based. And so, they don’t think the traditional way.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/26165940/AP25312799409077.jpg,,,2025-11-27 07:58:46.541129

The town of Manchester authorized two nonbinding agreements at a special meeting last Friday that will both conserve a flood prone area and allow needed housing at another site.
Under one part of a memorandum of understanding, Blackacre LLC — which owns the flood prone plot on Richville Road — agreed to come to the table to formalize a deal to donate the eight-acre property proposed for a housing development to the town. A local developer Paul Carroccio, who was consulting with Blackacre LLC, had planned to construct housing on the site. 
The town also agreed to work toward a lease agreement to sell undeveloped land sandwiched between a highway and an abandoned airport to a company owned by Carroccio for the construction of housing and other mixed use development.

The proposed priority housing project highlights the tension between pressing issues faced by the state to push for more housing and plan for natural disasters.  
The project proposal unleashed a torrent of local opposition and sparked questions regarding the application of new legislation to exempt some development from the state’s land use review process.
Manchester town manager Scott Murphy said he is glad the town and developers have kickstarted the public comment period so agreements can be formalized within 90 days. After acquiring an easement to conserve the land in perpetuity, the town plans to transform the eight acres on Richville Road into a community resource for recreation and agriculture, Murphy said.
Ed Gotgart, one of the neighbors who opposed the initial site, said the change of course was a “win-win” for the town and developers. People should not live on a flood hazard overlay district, Gotgart said, but they should be able to use the land for recreation. Plus, the town seeking a conservation easement means the view of “magnificent Mount Equinox” will be preserved, he said.
Annette Smith, executive director of Vermonters for a Clean Environment, aided Richville Road neighbors who mobilized against the initial housing proposal. While in favor of a conservation easement on the property, Smith cautioned the town against setting up any recreation structures on the land that may exacerbate flooding. 
Murphy said the town had previously sought requests for proposals to develop the undeveloped plot on Airport Road, but acknowledged that extending the water and sewer lines on the site will cost the town $4 to 5 million. Once an agreement is finalized, Carroccio plans to offer $1 million toward the town project.
Of the 60 acres on Airport Road under current town ownership, no more than seven acres will be sold to a third party. Another seven acres is currently conserved for agriculture. The remaining 46 acres could be developed by Carroccio if the parties come to a final agreement. 
In the short term, Carroccio said he plans to construct four to eight of the so-called “workforce” housing units on the Airport Road property, but he said the site could hold over 200 units, including 50 workforce housing units. 
Workforce housing is defined in the Manchester Town Plan as “reasonably priced housing” that is not subsidized, but is targeted toward individuals, families and younger people who want to afford housing in the community they work in. 
Carroccio said that Manchester does not have housing stock that is affordable for people with moderate incomes that are too high to qualify for subsidized, affordable housing projects.
Dom Penges, a neighbor who opposed the original Richville Road development proposal, said the new housing site proposal appears to be a “better one.”
“It’s a nice, beautiful, flat piece of ground close enough to town, but without any hazardous flooding issues,” Penges said “I think if they did it properly — if they come up with guidelines that they could have the developer stand by — I think it would be a great asset for the town.”

But what happens when that plan backfires and accidentally benefits the opposing party instead? Enter what politicos call the “dummymander.”
Republicans in several states, including Missouri, followed President Donald Trump’s orders to redraw congressional maps to protect the GOP’s House majority. To do it, they carved up blue seats and dispersed those Democratic voters into deep red districts, making many hue more towards pink.
Earlier this month, Democrats scored massive wins across the country — seen by many as a rebuke of the president and the prelude to a blue wave in next year’s midterms. Could that wave be large enough to turn carefully constructed GOP maps into a dummymander?
Republicans worried about that very scenario in Missouri two years ago, when state senators rejected a map that would have given the GOP seven of the state’s eight congressional seats. They feared a 7-1 map could swing to a 5-3 map if political winds shifted.
Those concerns were set aside in September when the legislature redrew the map to break up the Kansas City-based 5th District represented by Democrat Emanuel Cleaver.
So does this make Missouri a prime candidate for a dummymander?
Probably not.
The key difference between 2022, when the 7-1 map was deemed too risky, and 2025, when it was approved, is the retirement of Republican U.S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer. His rural St. Elizabeth home made it difficult to keep him in his district while maintaining a GOP advantage everywhere else.
Luetkemeyer’s replacement, Bob Onder, lives in the St. Louis suburbs, making a gerrymander easier.
Under the new lines, the previously Democratic 5th District would have voted for Trump by 18 percentage points last year, said Erin Covey of Cook Political Report, a national nonpartisan newsletter that analyzes election trends. And Trump would have won the new 4th District — which now includes more Democratic voters from Kansas City — by 21 percentage points.
Even the 2nd District, long targeted by Democrats, became redder under the new map. Covey said the new 2nd District would have voted for Trump by 11 points, compared to 8 points before.
She notes that the last time the U.S. saw a blue wave — in 2018 — the reddest seat Democrats flipped was in a New York district Trump won by 15 points.
Now, all this could ultimately be moot. A referendum campaign is raising millions to put the new map on the 2026 ballot, which could freeze the current districts in place until an up-or-down statewide vote.
But if the new map stands, Missouri Democrats shouldn’t be so discouraged that they don’t recruit and run strong candidates, said Kyle Kondik of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, which also provides nonpartisan political analysis at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.
“If the wave comes,” Kondik said, “you want as many surfboards in the water as possible.”
Look no further than Tennessee, where Democrats are contesting a special election for a U.S. House seat Trump carried by 22 points. Despite the district’s deep red tilt, Democrats are making a play, hoping an anti-Trump electorate is ready to rebuke the party in power.
As both parties brace for the chaos of 2026, one thing’s clear: in the game of gerrymandering, the only certainty is that the lines will always keep shifting.

(Photo courtesy of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Department of Corrections may soon have a new tool to eliminate the use of contraband cellphones among inmates following a decision from the Federal Communications Commission.
Kay Thompson, an Oklahoma Department of Corrections spokesperson, said the agency is in talks with different companies to provide technology to jam cellphone signals within state prisons.
The FCC earlier this year advanced a proposal that for the first time could allow state prisons to use cellphone jamming technology to block phone signals amid a rise in contraband phones in prisons. The federal agency announced it is taking public comments on proposed rules, a step necessary to allow the jamming technology.
Thompson said contraband cellphones are a growing problem in Oklahoma prisons.
From January to August, the agency confiscated 4,475 cellphones, she said.

Inmates use the phones to coordinate violence, harass victims and for other criminal activity, she said.
“Being able to use jamming technology is another tool to help us combat cellphones, which will negatively impact the introduction of all contraband and make our facilities safer for both staff and inmates,” said Oklahoma Department of Corrections Director Justin Farris.
Cellphones are often smuggled into prison by visitors, staff or with drones. Drones drop them onto prison property, Thompson said.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond and 12 other attorneys general sent the federal agency a letter in support allowing jamming devices.
Current FCC interpretation of federal rules prohibits the use of jamming devices in prisons, his office said. A 1934 federal law allows only federal authorities the authority to block public airwaves.
“It’s time that our rules and policies catch up with the needs of 21st century technology and stop any and all criminal activity from occurring through illicit means of communication within our prison walls,” Drummond said in a press release.
Thompson said the agency does not anticipate asking lawmakers for additional funds to implement a program to jam cellphones behind prison walls because it has enough money in its technology budget. However, some other projects may need to be put on hold, she said. 
“We don’t know what the technology is going to be or even an estimated cost at this point,” Thompson said.
A past concern was that jamming devices could impact users outside of prison boundaries.
But Thompson said technology has evolved to a point where the jamming devices can be targeted and not impact those outside prisons.
She said the project would not impact staff because employees are already prohibited from bringing in cellphones. 
Thompson said the jamming technology would be rolled out starting with the maximum-security Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester and then into larger, medium-secure facilities.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)The Elver Park Neighborhood Center on the far southwest side of Madison has long been a familiar and welcome source of help for Joeniece Jackson and her four children.
Her oldest, now 14, attended the center’s after-school programs from an early age, as have her other three kids. And Joeniece says she’s enjoyed volunteering as well, or bringing the children of friends who may need child care unexpectedly.
But in the last few years, the center has served another purpose as well — as a food pantry for families who need to stretch their family meal budgets.
“The food pantry has gotten us through some of our hard times,” Jackson says.
The Elver Park after-school program isn’t the only one doing double duty. Across Wisconsin, other after-school programs have added food pantry services to their offerings for families who may not be able to afford to keep their cupboards full.
“After-school programs have long been doing after-school meals and snacks for kids,” says Daniel Gage of the Wisconsin Out of School Time Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of after-school programs. Food pantry programs are a newer addition to that work. “After-school programs tend to be a place where people come together as parents are coming to pick up their kids.”
The recent federal shutdown, when federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Payments were halted Nov. 1, exacerbated the need. With the shutdown finished and SNAP funds flowing again, that has eased off, but only slightly.
The Elver Park Neighborhood Center and its after-school program are run by the Wisconsin Youth Company. The agency operates two neighborhood centers in Madison along with school-based after-school programs in Dane County and  Waukesha County.
Elver Park’s food pantry began operating during the COVID-19 pandemic, when schools were closed and, for a time, the center’s after-school programs were on hold as well, according to Takela Harper, the assistant director of centers for Wisconsin Youth Company.
Originally the center partnered with the Madison Metropolitan School District to deliver food to school district families who needed it, Harper said. When schools and after-school programs reopened, the program converted to a store-style food pantry, where families come on Tuesdays and Thursdays to pick up donations of packaged as well as fresh foods.
At Elver Park, there’s been “a consistent flow” in traffic for the last couple of years, Harper says. But that doubled in October from the previous month, with about 30 to 50 families a week coming in for assistance.
In Nekoosa, located in Wood County in North Central Wisconsin, the Nekoosa School District launched a food pantry a year ago. The city has a population of about 2,500 and the school district an enrollment of just over 1,200.
Nikki Stearns organized the Nekoosa program while serving in Americorps with the local YMCA. Her Americorps assignment had her working with elementary school-age children, and she soon learned the extent of hunger in some of those kids.
“So many of my kids are hungry,” Stearns said. “I started bringing in snacks, and other teachers started bringing in snacks for students, too.”
A 2023 United Way report on ALICE families in the community — families on the edge and vulnerable to falling into poverty — documented how pervasive families are who cannot count on regular meals or an adequate supply of food .  
“In Nekoosa, 53% of our community is either living in poverty or one paycheck away,” Stearns says.
In the Nekoosa program, families who sign up receive a box of food each month. Some are also enrolled in FoodShare — Wisconsin’s name for the state’s SNAP benefits program. When SNAP payments stopped Nov. 1, however, the food pantry’s signups shot up.
Through September and October, the Nekoosa program served 38 people — eight to 10 families, Stearns said. That jumped to more than 50 in November after SNAP benefits stopped.
“The first day when SNAP benefits weren’t uploaded to people’s [electronic benefits] cards, I think I had 35 applications come in in one day,” Stearns said.
 “Now we’re serving about 200 people.” Even with the resumption of SNAP after the end of the shutdown, the demand has not diminished significantly, she added.
The Nekoosa food pantry program had been housed with the YMCA after-school program, based at a middle school. In June, the school transferred the food pantry program to the operation of the YMCA, which moved it to share space with the Y’s child care program, where recipients pick up their monthly boxes of food.
Providing a monthly allotment of food proved to be the most practical way for the Nekoosa program to operate, Stearns said, because “I don’t always know what [food] donations we’ll get or how much funding we’ll have to support people.”
The Nekoosa program was launched as part of a Wisconsin Partnership Program grant that the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health made to the Marshfield Clinic. With the $500,000 grant, the clinic was able to fund seven projects across the state’s northern half to address food insecurity.
“When students are fed and have those basic needs met, with food as one of those basic needs, they certainly can learn and focus so much more,” says Jill Niemczyk, a health educator with the Marshfield Clinic’s Center for Community Health Advancement who has been coordinating the program.
Other projects included a food pantry expansion, a teen meal program, gardening projects and a variety of nutrition education and community engagement programs.
“Each one of our seven sites is doing something a little bit different,” Niemczyk says.
The grant is now in its second year. In the third and final year, she says, attention will turn to assisting the various recipients as they look at how to establish ongoing community support and build on what they have been doing.
Even with SNAP benefits restored with temporary legislation to fund the federal government through January, Stearns expects the need to address hunger and food insecurity to persist.
“I think a lot of people are feeling like the food crisis is addressed” because the shutdown ended, Stearns says. “But a lot of us in food security are nervous about January. There’s a pretty big need to focus on people being fed — students are going to school hungry, whether there’s FoodShare or not.”

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)The other day I spoke with a dear friend I’ve known since I was 21. As we compared Thanksgiving plans, I described my usual traditional menu: turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, salad, cranberry relish, pie – the comforting repertoire my husband and mother insist on. I don’t have strong feelings about the menu, but I love making people happy, and I do love gravy.
My friend, though, was headed to a community “pitch-in.” Her assigned dish? Mashed potatoes. Yet, in her 80s now, her hands were hurting, and she didn’t feel up to making the smooth, whipped, traditional version. Instead, she planned to bring what she called “chunky, smashed, skin-on Yukon gold potatoes.” Just potatoes boiled and smashed with butter, salt and pepper.
“Sounds great,” I said. But she was anxious. She feared her dinner companions would want potatoes “like Grandma made,” and worse, that they’d judge her deviation from the script. She didn’t believe they would be grateful for her contribution; she feared they might be annoyed. She even asked if I’d write a poem for her to give her fellow diners to help “curb” the change.
Her worry was both touching and deeply familiar. I had just finished teaching a course on leading through disruption and change for MBA students in the Iowa State University Ivy College of Business. We spent weeks discussing how the pace of change, whether from geopolitical, technological, organizational or cultural shifts, is accelerating, and what that means for leaders. Research consistently shows that humans resist change as a survival mechanism; often, the more disruption we experience, the more we cling to the familiar. As a result, in times of turbulence, we yearn for reliable anchors: a workplace that feels predictable, technology we understand, mashed potatoes just like Grandma used to make. Consistency give us comfort, identity, and a sense of continuity when the world feels unsteady.
Yet leadership in the modern world requires helping people acknowledge that change is both inevitable and constant. Change itself is neither inherently good nor bad, but it is unstoppable. We can yell into the sky: “No more change!” – but that will not slow anything down. We can only control our own reaction to it. Instead of assuming the worst and resisting, leaders must acknowledge the change as real and cultivate adaptability, nimbleness and emotional intelligence. We must learn to communicate in an empathic and human-centric way, and to help others navigate ambiguity, see new possibilities, and even discover gratitude for what the new can bring.
Gratitude may seem like an odd companion to turbulence, but research shows it is foundational to effective leadership. In an article called, “How to Show More Gratitude at Work: Giving Thanks Makes You a Better Leader,”The Center for Creative Leadership notes that leaders who express gratitude build trust, wellbeing, and engagement in their teams. And new studies from the University of Florida reveal that when leaders reflect on gratitude received from family members, they show more empowering and supportive behaviors at work. Gratitude literally broadens our mindset, both psychologically and biochemically, making us more resilient and more connected both professionally and in our personal lives.
At the same time, gratitude must be balanced. As Harvard Business Review scholars Lan Nguyen Chaplin and Mike Chisholm note, excessive gratitude can become a trap, making people hesitant to self-advocate or voice legitimate concerns. The key is not blind positivity but “empowered gratitude,” where appreciation coexists with ambition, boundaries, and honest reflection. Leaders must model this balance: grateful for what has been and what is, yet willing to ask for what might be better.
This, too, mirrors the tension many of us feel around family traditions during the holidays. My Thanksgiving table is smaller now. Our family is dispersed and others who we shared the traditional meal with have moved or passed away. I miss the siblings, stepchildren, and friends who once filled the room and feel the ache of change. And yet, there are unexpected gifts: less rushing, fewer dishes to wash, quieter conversations, more leftovers. I loved the old traditions, but I also love the new ones emerging in their place.
Which brings me back to my friend and her “modern” potatoes. They are not the whipped clouds of childhood memory, but they carry their own warmth: creative, rustic, honest. They reflect her changing abilities, her desire to show up anyway, her willingness to contribute in a way that honors both tradition and reality. I hope her fellow diners greet her potatoes with delight rather than comparison; I hope they practice gratitude for the spirit behind the dish, not the perfection of the recipe.
Because this is the real leadership lesson, whether in organizations or around a crowded buffet table. We want the comfort of tradition, but the pace of life requires us to accept and even embrace the new. Gratitude helps us bridge the gap between what was and what is becoming. It steadies us as we adapt, and it softens us as others do the same.
So this Thanksgiving, may we savor both the familiar and the unexpected. May we honor Grandma’s recipes while welcoming chunky, smashed, Yukon-gold innovations. And may we practice the kind of gratitude that strengthens us for change: generous, grounded and open to whatever new flavors arrive on the table.



Here is the poem I wrote for my friend’s Thanksgiving:
Giving Thanks for Chunky Smashed Yukon Gold Potatoes
O beloved presence at the heart of the universe,
today I lift my spoon and my spirit
in gratitude for the humble potato,
that golden oracle of comfort.
Thank you for spuds that shape-shift with our moods:
fried with a sizzle, French fried with flair,
deep fried into celebratory crunch,
hash browned at sunrise, tater totted for joy,
cubed for soups, or layered in creamy devotion.
For baked beauties bursting with generosity,
and for the holiday mound of butter-kissed mashed potatoes
Grandma conjured with her quiet magic,
I give thanks.
But the world keeps spinning, full of surprise and reinvention.
My hands, marked by age and experience, welcome change.
So today I honor the modern potato,
the chunky, skin-on Yukon gold,
earthy and honest, tender with bits of truth.
A reminder that life is not always smooth,
but textured, real, and rooted.
Variety surrounds us, tradition gently bends,
perfection is unnecessary, and choice is abundant.
Giving thanks again and again strengthens us.
And may this humble, chunky Yukon gold remind us
that we too can evolve,
soft in some places, textured in others,
honoring where we have been
while embracing where we are going.
For in every potato and every moment
there is proof that we can rise, grow,
and remake ourselves
beautifully, bravely,
bursting with flavor,
blessed with favor.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)When Alex Adams stepped into his role leading the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare in June 2024, he immediately announced a laser focus on foster care. 
Adams, nominated by President Donald Trump in March and last month confirmed by the U.S. Senate as Administration for Children and Families assistant secretary, is now taking a similar approach to his federal position. 
On Monday, the federal administration announced the launch of “A Home for Every Child,” an initiative to bring up the ratio of foster children to foster homes to 1-to-1.  
“Our Home for Every Child initiative nationally is really modeled off of what we did here in Idaho,” Adams said in an interview Wednesday in Boise.  
As the state Health and Welfare director, Adams focused on policies to improve recruitment and retention of foster families as well as to prevent children from entering the system when possible, the Idaho Press reported. While his role now is more of an “overseer,” rather than provider of foster care services, he said he wants to focus on the same goals. 
Many of his goals are outlined in a federal executive order signed Nov. 13 by Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. 
 Adams hopes to start by collecting the right data, doing away with the rest 

Around two months into the new job, Adams said he’s hoping to start the new initiative by learning exactly how many foster homes there are nationwide. 
“We don’t have good data on the number of homes nationally,” he said. “We require 200 data points from each state to be reported to us at the federal government, but homes is not one of them.” 
Adams cited the nonprofit foster family counting project from the news outlet the Imprint, showing there are about 57 foster homes per 100 youth in the system nationwide. He’s working on ensuring states are counting how many available foster homes they have. 
The administration is also in the process of evaluating how many of the required data points are necessary for states to continue to report. 
“Accountability for federal taxpayer dollars is important, but right now we’re collecting too much from states that we don’t do anything with,” he said. “… I want to start clearing away that brush so that the front-end service providers can spend more of their time and energy on things that actually benefit children, as opposed to just box checking and hoop jumping.” 
As part of the executive order, the federal agency was directed to identify and eliminate “unnecessary high-cost and low-value reporting requirements.” Adams said his agency has submitted ideas to reduce reporting requirements but couldn’t discuss them until they were approved.

 It’s up to the states to determine how to improve foster home ratio

The administration provides between $11 billion and $12 billion to state child welfare systems. The federal administration can create financial incentives and provide guidance, technical assistance and best practices, but Adams expects states to create their own plans to achieve the goal. 
His office is beginning to meet with state directors of health agencies or child welfare departments to start conversations around the goals and get their input before he launches specific directives. 
He highlighted his work in Idaho, which included policies to make it easier to find and license family members, or kin, increased recruitment through faith-based organizations, and added resources and services for foster parents. 
Idaho health official nominated to federal Health and Human Services role in Trump administration

He also focused heavily on prevention. During the 2025 legislative session, the child welfare budget included 36 new full-time employees for the prevention specialist team. Adams said at the time the majority of young people were entering the foster system because of mental health or substance abuse issues, and he wanted to focus on providing services to parents in the home to prevent their children’s removal. 
 There’s ‘right’ and ‘wrong ways’ to focus on prevention, Adams says 

Adams highlighted Idaho’s work in prevention, but said there are “wrong ways” to do it. 
In Idaho, prevention policies coincided with a court decision that limited law enforcement’s ability to remove children from homes; these factors, combined with the pandemic, led to a “perfect storm,” that seems to have resulted in increasingly severe abuse cases of children entering the foster system, foster child advocates previously told the Sun. 
Adams said the administration is also working on about seven measures for states to implement alongside their policies to improve foster child-to-home ratios, to track indicators of child safety. 
“I’ve been on the job for about six weeks at this point, but suffice it to say, child safety is our number one priority at (the Administration for Children and Families),” Adams said. “And as we lean into this and try to get a home for every child, making sure it’s done the right way, which is why it’s going to be really important the seven safety measures that we wrap around this.” 
 Idaho among first states to implement ‘predictive analytics’ in foster care

Next week, the federal administration will begin meetings about the use of predictive analytics in child welfare, Adams said. 
The tool uses technology such as AI to help determine more quickly the best placement for a foster child, and move them more quickly toward permanency, either through adoption or reunification. 
Idaho is one of the first states working to implement the tool, Adams said. 
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Division of Youth Safety and Permanency Administrator Jean Fisher told the Sun in October that the state agency was in the process of training in what are called “poor prognosis indicators.” 
“They’re national indicators that would really be able to help our social workers critically think through cases where they, based on what those indicators are, might understand the case a little bit better from an earlier perspective that this case clearly has some reunification efforts that are very strong,” Fisher said.
 Adams plans to address state foster systems’ use of children’s Social Security benefits 

Adams is also gathering information about a nationwide practice of state welfare programs — including Idaho — collecting Social Security survivors’ and disability benefits entitled to foster children and using them to pay for their care. 
Idaho foster youth didn’t receive Social Security money they’re entitled to. That will soon change. 

Adams, as Idaho’s health director, issued a directive in May for the agency to halt the practice by July 1, 2026. He said Wednesday he’s now hoping to address it in his federal position. 
“It’s very difficult to see any scenario in which you can morally justify, a child whose parents died, the parent having earned a Social Security survivor’s benefit, the child being entitled to that benefit, and then the state agency saying, ‘I’ll take that,’” Adams said. 
The magnitude of the issue is hard to quantify, he said, because the money collected tends to get lumped with other federal benefits. 
“The overall pie is estimated at about $160 million, but I have states that are telling me this might be 10% to 30% of the overall pie,” he said. 
He’s begun by telling directors it’s happening, because he’s found some who were unaware. There’s not currently a specific plan to address it. 
“I think the first thing I’m trying to do is get my arms around the magnitude of this,” he said, “because once you figure out the magnitude of it, then you can calibrate actions that are responsive to that.”",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_6203-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-27 06:57:02.141584

Days later, in his monthly call-in show Nov. 10 with the Nebraska Broadcaster’s Association, Pillen confirmed: “We, the state, are not going to provide SNAP benefits, pure and simple, if the federal government doesn’t.”
The shutdown ended when Trump signed a new spending bill late Nov. 12.
Special session needed 33 supporters
A group of 15 state lawmakers — 14 Democrats and the Legislature’s one nonpartisan progressive — had tried to force a special session to make Pillen cover SNAP payments and fund Head Start preschool and nutrition programs. 
The lawmaker-sought session also pushed for general changes in state law to address the rising costs of food, household necessities and other essential goods. Only items specified in a special session call can be considered during such a session. Had it been successful, it would have been the Unicameral’s first senator-initiated special session.

But by the 5 p.m. deadline on Nov. 14, no more senators had signed on to the special session call. The letter from State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha needed at least 18 more senators to agree that a special session was warranted.
“I still think that it was important to do, to show the people of Nebraska that legislators were trying to do something to help alleviate the burden everybody is under,” said Cavanaugh, who led the special session call.
The lone Democratic lawmaker not to join the call was State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, who told the Nebraska Examiner he supported the effort but couldn’t confirm his support as he was out of the country.
‘Bad news of SNAP benefits’
Had the shutdown continued, Pillen said Nebraska would have picked up the $100,000-a-day cost for WIC, the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program that supports low-income pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding mothers, as well as qualifying infants and children up to age five.

Pillen said Nebraskans take care of each other and that he was “old and long enough in the tooth” to remember when neighbors and churches helped one another, a “better” model than government involvement. He repeatedly said Nebraska would “go back the way we used to do it years ago, before the government got involved.”
The country’s first “Food Stamp Program” began in 1939 and ended in 1943, according to USDA. A revised pilot program came in 1961, when Pillen was five years old. It became permanent in 1964.
“The bad news of SNAP benefits,” Pillen told one caller to his Nov. 10 show, was “unfortunately, you’re living more in isolation, and nobody knows you need help, and it’s hard to ask for help.”
Pillen urged the caller to reach out to churches, food banks and other Nebraskans stepping up. He said the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services was “standing on top of” the situation, but that Nebraska was not the federal government.

The next caller, a staffer for the Nebraska Democratic Party, told Pillen his answer was a “cop out.” Pillen responded that when Nebraskans know someone is in need, they help.
“If you just stand there and think the government is going to solve every problem, no,” Pillen said. “That’s not a ‘cop out.’ Pun intended, thinking the government is going to feed everybody is hogwash.”
Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., a Democrat, was among many local officials organizing community responses. His office launched and helped a citywide food drive with city and county officials directing available funds to nonprofits and community partners.
‘Why pay taxes anymore?’
Cavanaugh said lawmakers had “no idea” when the shutdown was going to end or what would happen with SNAP. Come Oct. 31, with slightly more clarity about how the federal government would respond, or wouldn’t, she and her colleagues decided not to wait.
State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, a member of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee with Cavanaugh, said the special session call was meant to provide leadership, because Nebraskans were in need.
“We’re glad that it’s restored for folks now, and that doesn’t change the crisis that we are coming into,” Spivey said.

State law requires the Nebraska secretary of state to forward a special session request to all other lawmakers and solicit responses if the initial call is made by at least 10 lawmakers. State senators then have 10 days to join.
Cavanaugh’s group sent an identical request Nov. 3, which reset the 10-day clock. Secretary of State Bob Evnen’s office emailed and mailed the request to all other lawmakers the next day with a Nov. 14 deadline. If successful, Pillen would have needed to convene the Legislature within five days of Evnen’s confirmation.
Cavanaugh said she was “disappointed” in the lack of lawmaker responses, especially after she talked to “several” Republican colleagues who she thought would be supportive.
“I question why pay taxes anymore if our taxes are supposed to go to public good and to support our most vulnerable populations … and they’re not,” Cavanaugh said. “They’re going to corporate welfare and to the 1%.”
‘Our community stepped up’
One of those senators Cavanaugh talked to was State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, who has supported food assistance programs, including an early 2024 call to force Pillen to permanently participate in a pandemic-era summer food program for low-income families. Pillen later reversed and signed up.

A SNAP-focused special session would cost money and would have come as the state continues to dig out of a budget hole, Hughes said. The Pillen-ordered session focused on property taxes in summer 2024 cost $9,529 per day. 
Hughes said a new special session likely wouldn’t have gotten fully underway until this week or later.
“Well, call me crazy, but I just really feel like this will be resolved before anything would happen special session-wise,” Hughes recalled telling Cavanaugh.
Hughes told the Examiner: “I would just be sick if we spent money on something that was not necessary.”
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, gave a similar assessment on why he didn’t join the special session call.

State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, another Republican who has worked with Hughes, progressive lawmakers and others on food assistance in the past, said he felt the shutdown was nearing an end when the call reached his mailbox. But had the shutdown continued for “months and months,” he said lawmakers would have needed to act. 
Brandt, a farmer representing a rural district in southeast Nebraska, also noted that the United States is the richest country in the world and said it’s “obscene” that anyone goes without food.
“I don’t want to see anybody go hungry,” Brandt said.
Hughes said she was confident Washington, D.C., couldn’t be shut down that long and that she was delighted by how many Nebraskans were ramping up services, increasing food donations and expanding community outreach, including in her Seward-area district.
“For this one month of delay, I feel like our community stepped up and filled the gap,” Hughes said.
‘Limited bucket of funds’
Chelsea Salifou, CEO of Omaha-based Heartland Hope Mission, said the return of SNAP benefits has not yet equated to stabilization. 
During the SNAP delay and uncertainty, many turned to food pantries but were unable to get certain necessities or baby items, so some families used dollars that would have otherwise gone toward housing and utility bills, Salifou said.
While trying to catch up, many face rent shortages and power shut-off threats. 
“There is a limited bucket of funds to help with those things,” said Salifou, whose organization provides a wide range of resources beyond groceries. 
Questions, concerns cloud Nebraska SNAP food benefits, despite judge’s order

She said the nonprofit’s Christmas gift registration list signals tough times ahead. Currently, about 8,000 kids are registered, she said, about a 30% increase over last year at this time.
“Our biggest concern right now is housing stability for these families that have gotten behind on rent because of delayed SNAP benefits,” Salifou said.
Concern is escalated by the permanent loss of SNAP and medical benefits for refugees and others due to changes resulting from President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law, which Trump and allies called “big” and “beautiful,” says Hannah Vlach of Omaha-based Restoring Dignity, which works with refugee communities.
The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that some 6,300 refugees, asylees and other Nebraska newcomers without permanent residency status are losing food aid benefits altogether.
Under the megabill approved July 4, the grocery benefits now will be limited almost exclusively to citizens and green card-carrying lawful permanent residents who also meet income guidelines.
About 150,000 Nebraskans, nearly 8% of the state’s population, currently participate in SNAP, the program formerly known as food stamps. People without a documented immigration status have never been eligible.
“It’s going to be bad,” said Vlach.
Support for refugees
Vlach’s organization on Wednesday launched a “Feed a Family” campaign, asking faith communities, organizations and households to sponsor refugee families who have permanently lost public food assistance.

The effort comes on the heels of a memo from the Trump administration calling for an unprecedented review of all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration, affecting potentially 230,000 refugees who entered the U.S. between 2021 and 2025 after going through a rigorous admissions process.
A signal of need locally, said Vlach, is illustrated by a donation she received Tuesday of this week, a $700 batch of gift cards. They were gone two minutes after she put out the word they were available, she said.
Many of the refugee families seeking assistance are large, with 10 children, she said. 
One beacon of hope, Vlach said, is that families should be getting income tax refunds back early next year, which could help sustain them for a short while.
2026 session on the horizon
Clements said the federal changes were “pretty minor” in his view and that Nebraska’s split on covering Medicaid costs with the federal government didn’t decrease, unlike last year, a major component of the latest budget hole that lawmakers filled this spring.

SNAP administrative costs will increase for Nebraska as a result of federal spending changes, but Clements said those can be absorbed into the state budget.
“I was pleased with how the federal changes were not severe to us,” Clements said. “We have enough other challenges with the budget.”
Spivey disagreed and said, “We can’t cut our way out of it.” 
She said lawmakers will need to focus on spending priorities, which she argued should include child care, housing and other social safety nets. Cavanaugh said she’s approaching her last session in 2026 with a “very heavy heart” and feels it’s been a “losing battle” to get lawmakers to “care more.”
Spivey said she hopes lawmakers leave party politics behind.
“The beauty and the history and intention of our institution is that we work across the aisle and we have conversations, even if people don’t agree,” Spivey said. “My hope is that I can continue to work hand in hand with all of my colleagues around really important issues facing Nebraskans.”

Silas Wilbur remembers fishing for trout on the Little Salmon River as a kid. His parents owned a ranch on the Little Salmon, north of New Meadows, and he used to visit frequently.  
“I used to catch a lot of trout on the river, that was really fun,” Wilbur says. “You can’t catch any trout in that stream now.”
Wilbur grew up in Weiser, and his parents ran Texas longhorn cattle on the Meadows Valley property. “That’s some of the best grass in the state,” he notes.

When his parents reached retirement age, they leased out the ranch. During the COVID years, Silas and his wife, April, made a permanent move to the family ranch in Meadows Valley.  
They’re still raising cattle on the ranch, and they also have chickens, goats and a llama named Reba. 
“We like cattle, but it’s not our first priority, honestly,” Silas Wilbur says. “As soon as we moved up there, we’ve been working on fixing up the place and doing some restoration work on the landscape.” 
The Wilburs approached the Natural Resources Conservation Service to learn about what federal assistance might be available. They also had a fortuitous visit from Wes Keller of McCall, who works in the fisheries department for the Nez Perce Tribe. In talking to Keller, they realized that the Nez Perce Tribe had a similar vision for restoring the Little Salmon River to improve riparian habitat for resident fish, steelhead and endangered salmon. 
“They used to call this area Chinook Meadows,” noted their neighbor to the north, Kurt Kroll. “I dearly love that place, I’m very grateful to have it.” 
Kroll bought his ranch property four years ago. He also has a strong interest in the restoring the property to improve the riparian area and enhance water quality in the Little Salmon River. 
Keller talked to Wendy Green, chair of the Adams Soil and Water Conservation District Board of Supervisors, about his conversations with the Wilburs and Kroll. To help improve the Little Salmon River water quality and riparian area fits the district’s mission. 
“This section of the Little Salmon is a 303 (d)-listed stream due to temperature, sediment and nutrient loads,” Green said. “We welcomed the opportunity to work with willing landowners to help improve water quality.”
 A habitat restoration project — the Idaho way

Green suggested that they could apply for a Water Quality Program for Agriculture grant from the Idaho Soil and Water Conservation Commission to install fencing along the Little Salmon to exclude cattle. 
In addition to protecting streambanks from livestock, the riparian buffer would support the Nez Perce Tribe’s effort to plant shrubs and trees to begin the restoration effort. The tribe had significant resources from a larger grant to restore fisheries in the Salmon and Clearwater river basins. But they wanted to make sure that the riparian plantings would be protected from cattle grazing. The fencing project made all of that possible.
“Our goal is to always help our local landowners find resources to accomplish conservation and restoration projects,” said Charlie Munden, a supervisor on the Adams Soil and Water Conservation District board. “We were happy to help.”
The Adams district applied for and received a $23,800 Water Quality Program for Agriculture grant to purchase 1.25 miles of fencing to begin restoration work on 385 acres of land in the Little Salmon River corridor shared by Kroll and the Wilburs. Plus, the Nez Perce Tribe owns 37 acres of land immediately to the north of those properties to tie more conservation projects together. 
The riparian fencing was installed in the late fall of 2024. The first round of riparian trees and shrubs were planted by a variety of volunteers in September 2025. 
“We’ve been really thrilled with the project so far,” said April Wilbur. “It’s been really wonderful.”
“It’s a beautiful piece of river – I can’t wait to see how things improve over time,” Kroll says.
“The end goal aligned perfectly for all of us,” added Silas Wilbur. “We all want a healthy river. It feels like a win-win-win project all the way around.”

 Background: Little Salmon River water quality issues

The Little Salmon River flows north for 45 miles from its headwaters south of New Meadows to its confluence with the main Salmon River near Riggins. The Upper Little Salmon River segment extends 12.5 miles, from Big Creek in the south downstream to Round Valley Creek. This stream segment is on the state’s list of degraded waters (§303(d) list) because it does not meet minimum standards for water temperature, bacteria and nutrients, the Adams district’s grant application noted.
“The proposed Meadows Valley Riparian Fencing Project is the necessary first phase of a comprehensive plan to reduce agricultural impacts and restore beneficial uses in the heart of the Little Salmon River segment that flows through the Meadows Valley,” Wendy Green wrote in the application. 
The Wilbur family’s property has 270 acres and 1.4 miles of Little Salmon River in the project area. Kroll has 116 acres and .6 miles of the river in the project area. With the Water Quality Program for Agriculture funding and $13,232 in landowner cost-share contributions, the landowners installed 6,573 feet of riparian fence to restore and protect 1.25 miles of the listed stream, along with significant wetlands. 
Livestock are being excluded from 132 acres on both properties. The project also features the following benefits: 

 It will meet or exceed a 42-meter riparian buffer in this reach as recommended in the Little Salmon River Total Maximum Daily Load Implementation Plan for Agriculture, 2008.
 It protects more than 15 acres of existing wetlands on the two parcels.
 It allows for future managed grazing in the riparian pastures, once shrubs have become established and streambanks have stabilized.

 What difference will the project make for water quality? 

Fencing cattle off streambanks can make a significant improvement in water quality. According to the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, the fencing project will reduce sediment loads by 79 tons per year, nitrogen by 254 pounds per year, and phosphorus by 127 pounds per year.
Both landowners have met with the Natural Resources Conservation Service and begun the process of applying for EQIP federal funds in order to develop off-stream stockwater facilities, improve aging irrigation infrastructure, and refine their grazing plans.
In addition, the Nez Perce Tribe’s Watershed Division has offered expertise, labor, and plant materials to help restore riparian shrubs along the protected river reach. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, through its Idaho Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program, has offered to provide equipment and staff time to assist with implementing BMPs. The Adams district has water-jet stingers available to aid in riparian planting, as well. 
“This restoration effort is going to require all hands on deck, and we have received enthusiastic support from many willing partners,” Green said in the Adams Water Quality Program for Agriculture application. 
Indeed, the tribe’s staff and volunteers from local schools, Idaho Fish and Game, the Forest Service, Alzar School in Cascade, and the University of Idaho Master Gardener program planted more than 500 trees and shrubs in the fall of 2025. Many more plantings are planned in 2026 and beyond. 
The Wilburs signed a contract with the Nez Perce Tribe that details the types of trees and shrubs that will be planted in the Little Salmon River riparian area over time. All told, more than 9,600 trees and shrubs are scheduled to be planted in the next five years. The trunks of the trees were protected with a mesh material to prevent deer from eating them. 
Plantings will include:

Thin-leaf alder 
Serviceberry
Birch
Red dogwood
Black cottonwood
Aspens
Six different species of willows 

Keller was out of the country when contacted for this story and was not available to comment. But Silas Wilbur gives him a lot of credit for pulling all of the partners together for the Little Salmon River restoration project. 
“Wes was really excited after our initial conversation, knowing that we all had a similar long-term vision for the Little Salmon River,” Wilbur said. “He worked his butt off on this project, quite frankly. We could not have done it financially without the WQPA grant and the tribe’s assistance.” 
“I’m starting to see positive changes in the river already,” he says. “I’m looking forward to catching trout in the Little Salmon once again.” 
“Things are looking good so far,” added Kroll. “I’m looking forward to seeing how things look 5 years from now. I think those plantings are going to grow up and thrive, and we should see a real positive change in the water quality of the river. Hopefully, someday, we’ll see steelhead and chinook spawning up here.”

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)In the summer of 2024, Arthur Barnard was invited to throw out the first pitch at a Boston Red Sox game. 
It was the first time he’d been to a professional baseball game since the 1980s, but he wasn’t there to just reconnect with America’s pastime. Barnard was among a handful of gun violence survivors and advocates invited onto the mound that day, including former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. 
Looking around the stadium, his first thought was of the size of the crowd. He estimated there were probably more than 40,000 people — which he noted was close to the 44,000 people who died from gun violence in America that year. 
Barnard thinks that way because his son, Arthur Strout, was one of the 18 people killed in the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston. 
Not even 24 hours after the shooting, Barnard said he knew he was going to take action. He didn’t know what it would look like, but he just started talking to people. He asked if there is a network for families affected by mass shootings, which led him to connect with a man whose daughter died in the Parkland High School shooting in Florida. 
Less than three months later, Barnard spoke at a press conference at the State House in Augusta in support of stronger gun laws. Thinking back, he said it felt like a circus with thousands of people crammed into the Hall of Flags. 
“This is not about taking guns,” Barnard said at the event, explaining to the crowd that he understands both sides of the issue. “This is about doing the right thing and finding the right politicians who are willing to do the right thing more than they’re afraid of losing their jobs.”
‘Doing the right thing’
After that first speech, Barnard said he transformed from someone who had never before read the text of a law to collecting signatures and traveling to Washington, D.C. to talk with Congress members. Through that evolution, his message stayed consistent: He wants lawmakers to pass laws that keep people safe. 
Barnard was also a strong supporter of the red flag referendum that Maine voters approved in November. His story was even featured in a campaign video. When he was out collecting signatures, Barnard said he often asked people if they would like to help with mental health and gun safety. As he sees it, the Lewiston shooting “was a mental health issue all day long.”
Maine voters opt for red flag law, expanding options for confiscating a firearm

That’s why to him a red flag law makes sense. Robert Card II, the perpetrator of the Lewiston shooting, needed mental health support and although his family sought help for him, they weren’t successful in getting it. Barnard said he considers Card a victim, too, because of his ultimate death by suicide. Had the red flag law been in place, Card’s family could have gone directly to a judge to have his firearms confiscated.
Barnard’s work volunteering for the red flag campaign and his other advocacy over the past two years culminated last week when he was recognized by the Maine Gun Safety Coalition.
Executive Director Nacole Palmer said that when she thinks of Barnard, she thinks of Atlas, the character from Greek mythology who holds the world on his shoulders. She called him “the hero of our movement.”
“His willingness to share his story so that others can be spared from having to endure that most painful loss is extraordinary,” she said. 
While Palmer was happy to recognize him publicly and tell the couple hundred people who were at the ceremony last Thursday in Portland about all the good Barnard has done, she said any award pales in comparison to the energy and passion he’s put in.
But if you ask Barnard, he said he’s just “doing the right thing.” Telling his story takes him back to those painful moments, but he also speaks up because he believes that Lewiston was an avoidable tragedy. 
Advocating beyond Maine’s borders
Although the red flag law passed, Barnard said his work is “far, far” from over. He wants his advocacy to stretch beyond the state’s boundaries to see laws passed that keep families across the country from experiencing what he has.
People, he said, need to be responsible for their guns. One of his proposals is to create a transfer of ownership document, similar to a vehicle title, that people would fill out when selling or purchasing guns.
He explained that it wouldn’t be a government registry, which many Second Amendment advocates oppose. Rather, he said it would increase accountability for who is buying and selling guns and could be helpful for police tracing weapons used in crimes. 
Palmer isn’t surprised Barnard wants to take his efforts beyond Maine and said she looks forward to continuing to work by his side.
“I do feel that Arthur has and continues to honor his son through all of his advocacy, and I hope that he feels good about all that he has contributed,” she said.

That includes “Iryna’s Law”, a Republican-led measure that limits pretrial release options for those accused of violent crimes, ramps up scrutiny of court magistrates and attempts to jumpstart the state’s death penalty process.
State lawmakers passed the bill earlier this year after Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian woman, was killed on public transit in Charlotte. That killing sparked national headlines and drew the attention of the White House. House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) has called the new law a “first step to ensure what happened to her never happens again.”
Gov. Josh Stein signed the bill into law in October, praising its changes to pretrial release but calling its attempt to expedite the death penalty process “barbaric.” He also called for the General Assembly to further invest in mental health treatment.
The law requires secured bond or GPS-monitored house arrest for defendants accused of “violent offenses,” as lawmakers aim to prevent magistrates from releasing repeat offenders before trial. And court magistrates who oversee those hearings are now subject to suspension by state Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Newby.
“Iryna’s Law” also aims to streamline aspects of the death penalty and open the possibility of resuming executions.
Lethal injection remains the state’s default method of execution, but has been on pause for almost two decades amid continued legal and regulatory challenges. Under the new law, if a court finds the method to be unconstitutional, the state would be required to adopt another method. That could include the electric chair or firing squad.
Stein has said “there will be no firing squads in North Carolina during my time as governor.”
‘Public Safety Act’ creates new felonies, ramps up severity of other penalties
Another criminal justice law will also take effect Dec. 1, creating new criminal penalties and increasing the punishment for existing penalties. It also makes changes to post-conviction court motions, the release of firearms to defendants and out-of-state domestic violence orders.
The “Public Safety Act of 2025” also:

Creates new felony charges for exposing a child under 16 years old to a controlled substance.
Makes all instances of solicitation of minors by computer into more severe felonies.
Allows an out-of-state resident to pursue a protective order against another person for acts that have occurred within the state.
Creates the felony crime of “habitual domestic violence” if a person has repeated convictions of domestic violence. The new felony is a more severe violation than the defendant’s most recent violation.
Increases severity of felonies for possession and sale of fentanyl and carfentanil.
Requires defendants to file motions for relief after conviction within seven years of one of the events that led to that conviction.
Allows a sheriff to release surrendered firearms to a defendant without a court order if the defendant is not otherwise barred from having them. The sheriff must conduct a criminal history check before doing so.

Other North Carolina laws taking effect Dec. 1
More new criminal penalties: Creates a variety of new criminal penalties, including the unlawful sale and possession of embalming fluid and larceny of gift cards. Also increases punishments for other offenses, including larceny of mail and assaulting a utility or communications worker.
Online sexual exploitation: Requires online sites to establish procedures to remove pornographic images upon request. Allows the attorney general to pursue action against users or site operators who violate the law. Also requires the state registrar to maintain copies of previous birth certificates when a person requests to have their sex changed on their certificate.
(A separate, controversial section of the law, which defines “biological sex” and “male” and “female” among other terms, takes effect Jan. 1.) The law was vetoed by Stein and overridden by lawmakers.
Auditor investigations: Allows the state auditor to audit or investigate any entity that receives state or federal dollars. The bill was vetoed by Gov. Josh Stein and overridden by lawmakers.
Nondiscrimination in disaster recovery: Makes it a felony to discriminate based on political affiliation while providing disaster recovery assistance. The law was spurred by a report of a FEMA supervisor in Florida instructing workers to avoid homes with Trump flags or signs after Hurricane Milton.
Squatter removal: Allows property owners to pursue an expedited process to remove squatters.

(Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)Days before Thanksgiving, volunteers at the Dream Center in Bismarck were busy prepping 40 turkeys for a holiday meal. 
Last year, the meal ministry served 500 Thanksgiving meals. This year, founder and executive director Jim Barnhardt anticipates more than 600 people will walk in for a sit-down dinner.
“We try to make food access very easy for people,” he said. “We see a lot of younger families and seniors who are trying to stretch their budgets. This is one way we can help.”
Communities across the state are seeing a growing need for food assistance this holiday season. 
Reasons for the increased need vary, according to community and faith leaders who are finding ways to address food insecurity. Some families and individuals are catching up financially after the federal government shutdown postponed federal food assistance payments in November. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, provides food benefits to low-income families to supplement their grocery budget. 
North Dakota sends out SNAP money but effects of delay remain 

Others are challenged by the growing cost of groceries.
Still others are stressed by the need to prepare for this time of year. Colder weather means the cost of winter coats and heating bills. Christmas means gifts and more celebrations. 
It’s one reason the Dream Center will keep its food pantry open on Thanksgiving while the turkey dinner is being served. 
“We know going into the holiday season, a lot of people are trying to catch up and save money to buy some of the other things they need,” Barnhardt said. “A free meal or groceries makes a difference.”
Community Action Partnership in Minot has handed out Thanksgiving baskets for several years. This year, they distributed 30 baskets filled with a turkey and a $50 gift certificate. The priority is families the partnership has helped throughout the year.
That said, the organization could’ve handed out to more families but was limited by funding, said Willy Soderholm, executive director.
“We’re seeing more and more requests,” he said. “Over the last year or so, I’ve noticed a lot more need for food assistance. Food is expensive.”
In Fargo, Calvary United Methodist is one of several churches offering Thanksgiving meals and baskets for the holiday. Church leadership reached out to Fargo and West Fargo schools to identify families who might benefit. 
Calvary planned for 250 meals and opened registration on Nov. 3. 
By noon, all the meals were claimed and the church decided to offer an additional 50 meals.
“There’s a big need out there in the community,” said the Rev. Rey Colón, Calvary’s senior pastor. “We felt bad that we had to turn people away. Next year, we think we’ll double the amount.”
He and his staff think the government shutdown this fall drove people to sign up for a holiday meal. When registration opened in early November, the fate of SNAP benefits were uncertain. But even once federal food assistance was issued, the need for food remained.
“If you have a family of five, you might spend half of your food assistance for the month on one (Thanksgiving) meal,” he said. “It’s hard to justify that.”

When Red River United Indivisible became aware that federal food assistance could be frozen, its members decided to host community meals every Saturday in November. One week volunteers served hotdishes and desserts to anyone who came to the basement of the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Moorhead, Minnesota. 
Leftovers were packaged and distributed in downtown Fargo.
“We recognize that the price of groceries is going up and that SNAP benefits are no longer certain,” said Lyn Docter-Pinnick. “Families are struggling and a warm meal can make a difference.”
In Grand Forks, the Northlands Rescue Mission is preparing to deliver over 2,000 meals on Thanksgiving morning. Cooking started the weekend before and 25 volunteers were expected to deliver the meals to those who signed up until the day before Thanksgiving.
The fully cooked meals include turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberries, buns, a vegetable and pie.
“It’s all hands on deck,” said Elaina Wickman, interim director at the mission.  “Most of our staff volunteers on Thanksgiving. My whole family is involved. It’s quite a process.”
The mission typically distributes 60 food boxes every Tuesday and Friday to people who are food insecure, Wickman said. On the first Tuesday in November after food stamps were suspended, staff handed out over 100 food boxes – a record for the organization.
Federal food assistance has returned, but Wickman observes that people are worried.
“They don’t know what might happen in the future, so I’m seeing more people making decisions ‘just in case,’” she said.

On Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, George Washington woke early. Assisted by his enslaved valets — William “Billy” Lee and the young Christopher Sheels — he powdered his hair, put on his favorite black velvet suit, tied his white neckwear and donned his yellow gloves.
Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.
He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
Devotion in the service of unity
It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The first took place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621. Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving — which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-Gen. Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November. It became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.

Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”
The president had prepared for the occasion. He also contributed a sizable sum of his own money to buy beer and food for prisoners confined for debt in the New York City jail.
The donation was deemed to be a magnanimous and moving gesture, suitable to the spirit of the holiday. A week later, in an advertisement in the Dec. 3 issue of the New York Journal, those very prisoners returned their “grateful thanks” to their president “for his very acceptable donation on Thursday last.”
Washington’s first Thanksgiving as a president may have not been tremendously successful, given the scarce attendance at the church service.
Yet, as a scholar writing a biography about Washington, I believe it was an important step in his much larger political plan to bring the executive branch to the people’s doorstep.
What Washington wanted was a virtuous kind of populism in the new country he led.
Washington’s populism wasn’t about inciting an angry mob; it was about sharing in their rituals, worshiping their God, speaking their own language. And he did so in the sole interest of the American people.
Thanksgiving 1789, for Washington, was at once religious and more than religious.
Washington’s proclamation invoked devotional language, literally. The upcoming festivity, in his words, could “be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”
But Washington’s main concern was political.
The nation was recently formed, and he feared that it could easily collapse. Its many internal divisions and separate interests could be lethal. Consequently, the president wanted this holiday to be a civic celebration in which “we may then all unite.”
‘Pardon our national…transgressions’
As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws.
Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.
He was a slave owner, a relentless pursuer of African American fugitives and a destroyer of Native American villages. He was also a warrior who deployed brutality against enemies. He was a commander who resorted to corporal punishment with his own soldiers. Washington believed that he was not a saint to be mindlessly imitated.
This made him humble in his duties.
More importantly, Washington also grasped the power of his symbolic position as president. He sought to leverage that for the good of the nation.
As president, Washington could not advertise his actions effectively via Twitter and social media. He had to show himself around constantly, no matter the weather. He had to painstakingly attend balls, plays, dinners, public receptions and, of course, the church. Every occasion, every Thanksgiving counted.
Through his outings, Washington met with a diversity of people, including those who were second-class citizens or were not citizens at all.
Women, for example, greeted Washington at nearly every stop of the extended presidential trips he took between 1789 and 1791. Textile workers in New England, Jewish leaders in Newport, many enslaved persons in the South and churchgoers everywhere did the same.
These women and men, in bondage or free, believers or skeptics, played a part in the invention of a new political theater. Maybe, it was just a theatrical illusion. But these individuals — just like the prisoners in the New York City jail — thanked President Washington because they felt they were voices in a larger political culture.
Washington made sure his Thanksgiving message — not simply a message, but a “proclamation” — sounded clear and strong: May God “render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed.”

(Photo: Getty Images) Governor Josh Stein and the NC Department of Commerce last week celebrated seven new economic development projects, bringing the total number of new jobs created in North Carolina this year to nearly 33,000. But the thirst to attract more jobs to the state also brings new pressures on North Carolina’s water infrastructure.
A study released this month by the NC Chamber Foundation finds the state’s future growth may very well depend on how well the state can balance aging infrastructure, supply reliability, and uncertain funding over the long-term.

The report notes that North Carolina has more than 5,800 public water systems, including nearly 2,000 community water systems and over 3,600 wastewater systems. The systems are aging and in many cases are “financially fragile.” In rural communities, the problems are especially vexing because they can’t generate additional revenue due to the small customer base. According to the report, nearly one-third of North Carolina’s community water systems serve 100 or fewer customers, with limited resources available for maintenance.
A 2024 survey of water utilities conducted by the University of North Carolina School of Government and released this summer found that over half of the respondents (56.3%) said that their system does not engage in long-term supply or demand forecasting.
Another challenge highlighted by the chamber foundation’s report is the inconsistent data available on our water supply. The report points out that agricultural water users that withdraw one million or more gallons of water a day, and non-agricultural water users that withdraw 100,000 or more gallons of water a day, must report on their water usage annually to the Department of Environmental Quality. But agricultural withdrawals of less than one million gallons per day are not required to be reported. That data is collected through a voluntary survey.

Theresa Landewe, director and principal scientist for Intera, which conducted the analysis for the chamber, believes accurate data helps better understand the reliability of this resource.
“We need to understand what those limitations are, and really need a whole picture of all the water uses and how those impact each other,” said Landewe during a Nov. 18 webinar on the Water Infrastructure Competitiveness Report.  “Historically, we have all these small utilities, and they didn’t run into each other. They didn’t impact each other. Now with growth, everything has implications for our neighbors.”
 An aging workforce
In addition to data, the report highlights the need for more water system workers.
Roughly one-third of the national water-sector workforce will be eligible to retire within the next decade, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
The report says the state can address that expected shortfall by creating new partnerships between state agencies, community colleges and professional associations to grow the next generation of operators, managers, and engineers.
“North Carolina has a great opportunity to leverage higher education in this regard,” said Jim Spangler, president of Spangler Environmental, an environmental consulting firm. “That pipeline of talent needs to be a priority for economic development success in this state.”
A key ingredient to growth
When Amgen announced it would expand its manufacturing operation in Holly Springs and invest $1 billion in Wake County, the biotech company had to be certain that it would have the water it needed now and in the future.

“Water isn’t just a utility for us, it’s an ingredient. It’s how we manufacture products for patients all across the globe,” said Dana Martinez, the head of corporate affairs for Amgen North Carolina.
“Water reliability and quality are essential from day one. Our bio-manufacturing depends on the consistent high purity availability from our municipal partners,” said Martinez. “It’s important that we have confidence that the systems can grow with us as we grow.”
Martinez said Amgen worked closely with local municipalities and the state Department of Environmental Quality early in the planning process to understand infrastructure, timelines and redundancy options.
“It’s important that we have a clear understanding of not just the current capacity, but the future expansion plans as well,” said Martinez.

Beyond industrial water use, residential water use can have a big impact on supply. Raleigh Water serves approximately 650,000 residents not only in Raleigh, but the surrounding towns of Garner, Wake Forest, Rolesville, Knightdale, Wendell and Zebulon.
And while many take safe, clean drinking water for granted, conservation remains critical. A leaky toilet can waste 200 gallons of water per day. The average shower uses five gallons of water per minute, based on Raleigh’s water usage calculator. And if you hand-wash your dishes with the water running, you use about three gallons of water per minute. Add it all together and the average North Carolinian uses between 50 and 75 gallons of water daily.
According to estimates from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), the state requires over $10 billion to address drinking water infrastructure needs.
The chamber report recommends that the state establish sustainable, long-term funding mechanisms, advance regional partnerships to improve both resiliency and efficiency, and improve data collection to maintain North Carolina’s competitiveness.
“Water, in a regional sense, is like a bank account, and you can’t make decisions about what to spend and what to use if you don’t understand what’s there,” said Landewe. “You really need to have that understanding before you can say, ‘Yeah, we’re going to have this water here for the next 50 years.'”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/waterpfascancer-1024x746.jpg,,,2025-11-27 06:57:02.141584

(Getty Images)Foodborne illnesses involving raw milk exposure have increased after West Virginia legalized direct-to-consumer sales, according to information from the state Department of Health. 
Consuming raw or unpasteurized milk, which can be a health risk, has been legal in West Virginia since 2016 through herd shares, which allows people to pay a monthly fee to buy a share of a dairy herd and get a portion of the milk produced. 
In 2024, lawmakers passed House Bill 4911, which allows the direct sale of raw milk. 
According to the state Department of Health, between 2014 and 2023, West Virginia averaged about four foodborne illnesses per year among people who reported raw dairy as an exposure.  Between 2016 and 2024, the state investigated a single suspected outbreak involving raw milk. 
Since House Bill 4911 became law in June 2024, the state has had 12 foodborne illnesses where raw milk has been reported to have been an exposure, the state health department said. In the same time frame, the state has not investigated any outbreaks involving raw milk.
The illnesses reported include five cases of Campylobacteriosis, which causes diarrhea and spreads to people from animals, including cows; four cases of salmonella, a bacteria that causes diarrhea, fever and stomach pains; two cases of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or STEC, an illness that can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever, and can lead to kidney failure; and one case of Giardiasis, an illness caused by a parasite that causes stomach cramps, bloating, upset stomach and loose stools.
“Consuming raw milk can lead to serious health risks, especially for certain vulnerable populations,” Gailyn M. Markham, director of communications for the state Office of Shared Administration, wrote in an email to West Virginia Watch. “Raw milk that has not been pasteurized can be a source of a foodborne illness. While good practices on farms can reduce contamination, they cannot guarantee safety from harmful bacteria.”
According to the health department, consuming saw milk was a potential risk factor for transmitting the bacteria, but other contributing factors may have been involved, so the state cannot confirm that the raw milk caused the illnesses. 
The bill legalizing direct raw milk sales had wide support from Republicans in both the state House of Delegates and the Senate during the regular legislative session last year. Then-Gov. Jim Justice allowed the bill to become law without signing it. 
The law requires that containers of raw milk be clearly labeled as “unpasteurized raw milk”, and include the name and physical address of the seller, the date of production, and a warning that consuming raw milk may increase risk of foodborne illness. Rules from the state Department of Agriculture require the milk be stored in a system or device that maintains a temperature of 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit until the exchange of sale. Any complaints of adulterated milk received by the Department of Agriculture are to be referred on to the state Department of Health. 
Beth Southern, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Agriculture, said the department has not received any reports of illnesses associated with raw milk sales. The department does not keep track of who sells raw milk or where, she said. 
Marie Krause, an associate professor in West Virginia University’s School of Agriculture and Food Systems, said it’s difficult to tell if the increase in foodborne illnesses is alarming without knowing how much raw milk was sold in the state in that time frame. She repeated the Department of Health’s point that the cases involved raw milk but may not have been caused by the raw milk. 
“Also, since there were no outbreaks linked to raw milk consumption, it means that no more than one person who consumed raw milk became ill at that time,” she wrote in an email to West Virginia Watch.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)Groups have begun offering support or a rebuttal to the West Virginia Board of Education as they’ve asked the state’s highest court whether lawmakers have the authority to approve or reject education rules approved by the state board.
A Republican-led bill, passed earlier this year in West Virginia, gave lawmakers the ultimate authority over school board policies. It became law in April without the governor’s signature, and lawmakers behind the measure assumed it would trigger a lawsuit.
While state agencies submit rule changes to the Legislature for review, the state school board previously had autonomy to determine education policies. The West Virginia Constitution says, “The general supervision of the free schools of the State shall be vested in the West Virginia board of education which shall perform such duties as may be prescribed by law.”
House Bill 2755 requires that all legislative rules enacted by the board must first be authorized by the Legislative Oversight Commission on Education Accountability. Next, proposed rules would then be submitted to the full Legislature for review to determine adoption, rejection or possible changes. 
Three years ago, West Virginia voters rejected a similar proposal giving lawmakers the power in education. 
The state school board has challenged the legislation, filing a lawsuit that asks the state Supreme Court to determine whether lawmakers have the legal authority included in the bill.
The West Virginia Parent Teacher Association, which has more than 5,500 members in the state, submitted a brief in support of the state school board’s lawsuit, saying the legislation “would place unconstitutional limits on the board’s constitutional authority to oversee the state’s public schools and the board’s ability to make educational decisions based on the best interests of students.”
“House Bill 2755 is a hornbook example of one branch of government treading upon the constitutionally derived powers of other branches, which is an outcome of our system of checks and balances, as well as this court’s binding decisions, cannot abide,” the group wrote in the fling. 
The West Virginia PTA cited a1988 state Supreme Court decision that upheld the school board’s authority in rulemaking, saying the board has a “special standing” under the state constitution. The group said the ruling means the legislation passed this year “is void” and called on the state Supreme Court to declare the bill unconstitutional. 
The West Virginia Association of School Administrators and the West Virginia School Board Association also filed a joint brief in support of the school board.
“County superintendents, boards of education, and administrators all rely on the State [Board of Education] as the education expert to quickly and effectively implement policies to govern both the day-to-day and systemic operations,” they wrote. 
“The State [Board of Education] directs the functioning of the county boards. For example, when the State [Board of Education] issues state-wide standards, it is the job of the county to carry out those standards,” the filing continued. “Imposing legislative whims into the rulemaking process would upend the current process and remove constitutionally-granted authority from the hands of education experts.”
The Cardinal Institute, a conservative nonprofit focused on education policy, sided with the Legislature, saying the 1988 Supreme Court ruling should be overturned.
Their filing said the highest court’s ruling “infringes on the power” of the Legislature, and that the state school board should not be immune from legislative oversight and power. 
“As a part of the executive department, the Board of Education must be subject to the checks and balances of other departments,” the Cardinal Institute wrote in their filing. “The legislature has, by general law, provided a system of free schools throughout the state. But it will be noted that it is not prohibited from augmenting, and making more efficient, the general system of free schools.”
Lawmakers behind the bill said they wanted more accountability on the state’s struggling school system. 
In July, the board announced that it was planning to sue Secretary of State Kris Warner after it unanimously approved a new rule that dealt with design equipment standards for school buses. It was first approved by the state board on May 14 and put out for a 30-day public comment period.
The Secretary of State’s Office said it was obligated to reject that filing because of the newly passed law.

CEDAR RAPIDS — College and pro football teams have had a trick play called the Fumblerooski. The Kinney family invented a play I call the “Mom-arooski.”
It happened at a backyard Thanksgiving Day touch football game in my sister’s backyard in Cedar Rapids 24 years ago.
We were playing “boys vs. girls.” Of course, we boys thought we had the upper hand.
Nope. Dumb as a box of rocks.
On the girls’ opening play, Mom, who was celebrating her 79th birthday that day, crumpled to the ground upon the snap of the ball. We boys all rushed to Mom’s aid, fearing a twisted ankle or worse.
While we were all gathered around Mom, my sister handed off to my daughter Hannah, who was 9 then, and the little sweetie gleefully ran for a touchdown!
Mom was fine. My sister had dialed up a masterpiece, perfectly executed by Mom and Hannah.
I can hear deep-voiced John Facenda, narrator of NFL Films: “A play as devastatingly effective as a Jerry Kramer block on the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field.”
That’s one of my happiest Thanksgiving memories. May you cherish yours and hopefully make some new ones.
Happy Thanksgiving.

I say hello and ask him if he is alone, yes, if he is scared, yes, if he wants to come inside, yes. He puts on a thick Spiderman poncho, and I carry him in. 
The spirited employee who is there every morning lets us come behind the check-in counter. I sit the boy down on a tall chair and take a seat next to him. She calls the police. I realize what is about to happen and warn the boy, the police are going to come, they are going to ask you questions, you are not in trouble, it’s OK to be afraid, it’s OK to ask for help, OK? His eyes are big as he glances toward the door.  
While we wait, I ask him questions: his name, his Halloween costume, his favorite trick-or-treat candy. Where is your mother? Are you hungry? The Y employee pulls a Goldfish snack bag from her own lunch when he says he likes cheese and crackers. 
He tells me his mother is in jail, and it reminds me of stories I’ve heard about the disparate sentencing for women here and how Idaho has the highest incarceration rate of women in the United States, by a lot.  
The police arrive, and they ask the boy questions; he doesn’t answer them but after they turn away he asks me where their guns are. I have trouble understanding him so he makes the signal for a gun with his pointer finger and thumb and points to their belts. 
Five EMTs arrive, all, it seems, sporting mustaches, to check for cold exposure. They are friendly, are able to get a couple answers out of him and leave without any concerns. 
Dad comes out and looks shocked but sober and calm. I can hear some of the questions the officers are asking: Where do you work? What were you thinking? Where do you park your car to sleep? It’s illegal to sleep in your car in Idaho in cities with populations over 100,000 so I gather they are building their case. 
The father says he is employed in the trades, an essential profession, and that his son goes to day care. I hear him tell the officer that he thought if his son woke up and got afraid he could just come inside. It’s a big miscalculation, born more from a lack of understanding of the socio-emotional needs of a child that age than from some intentional harm or simple neglect. 
The boy says he wants to go to his dad so we let him down from the tall chair and he gives his dad a big punch in the leg, as if to say, how dare you leave me. I say hello to the dad and goodbye to the boy and try to get some exercise before work, but I am quickly called back to the front desk to give a statement. 
The officer, a new one, asks me some basic questions. I repeat the story. She layers my answers with her own judgments, judgements I wouldn’t apply in this situation. 
Any questions for me, she asks. I ask if they are connecting the father with services. Oh we will connect him with services; he’ll be hearing from Heath and Welfare, she says in a lofty tone. 
The process is a total scene, so public, and so shameful. If I were that father, I’d find it hard to show my face there again. I myself have trouble returning the next day. 
Visceral memories of my own single mother, our houseless struggles, being left alone, terrified, and finally, the loss of her, all come flooding back. 
I have no recourse. I have no way of knowing what happened next, no way of offering the support I know he needs and that I would freely give. I am prevented from caring any further by a system that steps in instead. I am forced to walk away and encouraged to forget. 
But I cannot forget. 
We cannot forget that child’s face, not in the richest country in the world, while our government wastes money on ballrooms and bailouts, parties and private jets. Not while they rig it so the rich get richer while that little boy sleeps in the back of a truck with his mother in jail. I will never forget that father’s face, holding his son’s hand while the whole world bears down.

My father and mother were born in the 1920’s, grew up during the Depression and World War II, and November and December were not very different for them than the other 10 months of the year. Thanksgiving and Christmas days were quiet and simple. 
But not for their children: It was important to my parents to create memories for us and their grandchildren and what better way to do that than to start the holiday season with an unforgettable Thanksgiving lunch.  Food was always a big part of any special occasion that involved my   m demothe
My husband Larry’s first Thanksgiving meal as an official part of my family came in 1992. My family —  the Terrys — were East Tennessee Lincoln Republicans.  Even though he is a yellow dog Democrat, Larry had been warmly accepted by my family — or so he thought. 
Mother always started her Christmas decorating the day after Halloween. Every wall, staircase, table and corner in her home was covered with Christmas decorations and they stayed up at least until Jan. 2.  Starting at Thanksgiving, my sisters and I were expected to wear our best holiday motif sweaters and style our hair for the family pictures that would surely be taken.
Mother set the time that we would eat and on Thanksgiving morning, as soon as we arrived, we went to work. My daddy had an annual ritual of telling my sisters and me that it might be Mother’s last holiday season because she worked too hard. Then Daddy would worry which of his four daughters and their families were going to be late and whether the time of our arrival would impact the time we ate.



				My mother, a Republican, professed to like my new husband, a Democrat. But the food she served him made us all question her intentions.			


My sisters and I knew exactly what was involved in Mother’s “memory creating holiday” meal. My mother inherited her mother’s table and normally my parents had enough room around it for four to six people. But not for family gatherings! There were several heavy big wooden leaves that had to be installed to seat up to 20 people and the leaves had to be locked in to avoid accidents.  Our husbands offered to help, which we accepted for only the heavy lifting, and we had to collect chairs from all over the house and make sure they were sturdy. A chair collapsing during a big meal was funny but could be unhealthy. We then asked the men to leave so the sisters could privately share our news — or call it gossip if you must. 
The tablecloth had to hang correctly and at one time Mother’s table looked like something out of “Downton Abby” with her best china, polished sterling silver and cloth napkins. 
When it was just the two of them, Mother rarely cooked for Daddy. There was a friendly meat-and-three restaurant in their neighborhood, and eating there at least once a day —not necessarily together  —was a way for Daddy and Mother to socialize with the community and keep up with what was going on. 
This informal eatery had a catering service, and Mother decided to order her Thanksgiving meal from them. She picked up her order and put the containers of food in the trunk of her car, drove the short distance home and brought the food into her kitchen. She got up early on Thanksgiving morning to warm the food and to transfer most of it to her dishes. 
My husband, Larry Woods, was already a vegetarian when we married, and this caused much angst in our family. They thought he would starve without meat and that it would be okay to serve vegetables that had been cooked with pork, chicken or beef.  I suggested Mother add a dish of macaroni and cheese for Larry because what could go wrong?  Everyone loves macaroni and cheese. 
When we finally sat down to eat Daddy always said a few words before offering grace. Mother, in turn, always worried the food was getting cold while Daddy was praising Mother for her efforts and the Lord for our bounty. We kept our heads bowed and sometimes glanced and smiled at each other wondering how long this would go on before we could finally eat. 
Passing all the food was a production. which according to Mother — and manners expert Emily Post — was to the right. We all talked at the same time and tried not to drop the heavy serving pieces as we passed around the food. We had been raised to put a small portion of every dish on our plate, which did not apply to the vegetarian at the table. 
As we ate, I noticed the mac and cheese had a strange taste to it and that Larry was stirring and playing with his mac and cheese instead of eating it and served himself a mound of bread each time the silver breadbasket was passed. 
Finally, we cleared the table and began preparing dessert. When my sisters and I were alone in the kitchen, I asked them if they noticed anything weird about the mac and cheese, and they all said it tasted terrible. One of us asked Mother if she had tasted it. She reminded us that she did not care for mac and cheese but there could have been a problem with the kerosene she kept in her car spilling in her trunk and “just perhaps” some of that kerosene spilled onto the mac and cheese. Mother said she was not going to throw away good money spent on food just because of a little kerosene. We did not know whether to laugh hysterically or be horrified. 
The next day Larry was on “The Roundtable,” a Nashville talk radio program that featured politicos discussing current events. Live and on the air, he said that his new mother-in-law had tried to kill him at his first Thanksgiving meal because his candidate, and not hers, had just won the 1992 Presidential election. Mother was listening, she called me immediately and said to tell Larry she was going to kill him and just tell God he died. 
The mac and cheese with kerosene became part of our family history. Vegetarian dishes are always viewed with suspicion, especially during an election year, and we still do not know why the kerosene was in Mother’s trunk, but Larry took great joy for many years by sharing the story of how his mother-in-law tried to kill him that Thanksgiving Day.

(West Virginia Legislative Photography)Returning to a now very familiar restaurant a few blocks from where I live in New York City for brunch a few days ago, I met the new hostess who, much to my surprise, is a poet, who has performed at the Guggenheim. Then again, perhaps it wasn’t so surprising since creatives seem to find one another. Her name is even poetic, Alondra. 
What unfolded over the course of enjoying my blueberry, silver-dollar pancakes provided nourishment for my soul, my spirit. We talked about our journey to becoming a creative and about poets whose work we respect for the truths they bring out of the shadows and into the light: Silas House, Ocean Vuong, Callie Siskel and in my mind always Mary Oliver and Billy Collins. I mentioned that I would gladly yield to her to explain in further detail to me Vuong’s core message. And since I frequent this restaurant often, I welcome what future conversations will gift to broaden my horizons on the work of such an acclaimed author. Up to this point, the conversation was enlightening and energizing. But what followed far surpassed an appreciation of poetry.
I was asked (as I often am in New York City) about the Appalachian region in general and West Virginia in particular. The conversation almost always turns to one of their misunderstanding of the struggles faced by those in rural America and a fierce pride deeply rooted in those who dwell in that culture. They want to know how West Virginians moved from a historically blue state to an overwhelming red state. Conversation turns to the coal industry and geographical challenges and the opioid epidemic. Each is a revealing detour from the enjoyment of blueberry pancakes and crisp bacon. And I welcome it at every turn.
But it wasn’t until Alondra said, “We are living in fascinating times,” that I stopped eating and wondered at the certainty and near enthusiasm with which she delivered these words. I looked at her and asked what she meant. She explained with such conviction that in times of unrest, uncertainty, creatives find ways to hone their craft to an even greater degree; they are fed by the challenge to put the turmoil, the spectacle in perspective and create work that speaks not only to the unrest but to the possibilities that we, as creatives, can bring to the table to possibly, hopefully, right the wrongs that plague us. I was not only grateful for her vision, but reminded also of how very important it is for each of us to be more open than ever to finding ways out of a most intricate and dangerous maze.
This moment — this most refreshing moment — reminded me of a note I received from a reader of one of my recent op-eds, who while supporting my opinion reminded me that what is happening throughout West Virginia is also happening all across the country. And with the reduction and even the elimination of arts and culture both nationally and throughout West Virginia, Alondra reminded me that more than ever we must not loosen our firm hold on what creatives bring to the table, for it has been shown throughout history what happens when those voices are threatened, in some cases silenced; they grow even stronger. My message to those who are coming far too close in their attempts to silence those certain, creative voices: Be careful. Be very careful.

(Getty Images)More than half a million hunters are expected to take to the fields and woods for Pennsylvania’s firearm deer hunting season that begins on Saturday, Nov. 29 this year. 
The season will last through Dec. 13, with hunting allowed on two Sundays – Nov. 30 and Dec. 7.
Listen to Ian and Emily’s audio recap: 

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/26epikRDHS.mp3
 
“Opening day of deer season here touches countless families, mine included, as well as offices, work sites and schools,” said State Game Commission Executive Director Steve Smith. “It’s about more than recreation, though. Deer season is also conservation and compassion turned into action, as our hunters keep deer in balance with their habitat, while feeding themselves and hungry neighbors. There’s truly nothing like it.”
Last year, an estimated 476,880 deer were harvested by hunters in Pennsylvania, with an estimated 283,760 during firearm season.
Nearly 284,000 pounds of venison were donated through the Hunters Sharing the Harvest program at more than 100 licensed butcher shops in 56 counties. It was then distributed to food banks across the state. Some 1.1 million servings of venison were ultimately delivered.
According to the Game Commission, during rifle deer hunting season, Pennsylvanians are allowed one antlered deer per hunting license, and one antlerless deer per Wildlife Management Unity (WMU) specific antlerless license, Deer Management Assistance Program (DMAP) permit or Agricultural Deer Control Permit.
Hunters must wear 250 inches of fluorescent orange material on their head, chest and back, visible 360 degrees around them, and can shoot between a half hour before sunrise and a half hour after sundown.
This year marks the first firearm deer hunting season since legislation allowing hunting on Sundays was passed in Pennsylvania. Thirteen Sundays were selected throughout the year, with two, during rifle deer season.
However, hunting will not be allowed in Pennsylvania state parks on Dec. 7, though it is permitted on state game lands, state forests and private lands where hunters have permission.
Licenses cost $20.97 for adult Pennsylvanians  and $101,97 for nonresidents. 
Antler restrictions vary by WMU. Details about antler restrictions statewide and reporting harvests can be found on the game commission’s website.
Hunters are required to fill out harvest tags that come with their licenses and attach them to the ear of each deer. Deer harvests must be reported to the Game Commission within 10 days, which can be done online at huntfish.pa.gov or by calling 800-838-4431.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hunter-field-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-27 05:57:09.395674

Every November, Lauren Testoni climbs into a 26-foot U-Haul with a friend or family member and drives across Rhode Island collecting coats and other winter gear, all of which are stored at her family’s East Greenwich home until the next morning.
Then on the Friday after Thanksgiving, the U-Haul delivers the donations to the State House lawn for the annual Buy Nothing Day Coat Exchange. Coats, hats, gloves, scarves and socks are given away for free to anyone who needs them — often unhoused people, refugees and low-income families.
“People need a leg up and this is their first way to do that,” Testoni said in an interview. “It literally keeps people alive in the winter to have a coat.”
This year’s exchange will be held from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 28, outside the State House, on the lawn facing the Providence Place mall.
The annual Black Friday tradition dates back to 1997 when local activist Greg Gerritt and some friends wanted to highlight the problems with consumerism while also doing something useful for the community, Testoni said.
It’s part of the reason the event has been held on the State House lawn, which lies directly across the street from Providence Place where shoppers are looking for holiday deals.

“It’s absolutely there to make a statement,” Testoni said. “We have to be prepared for anything to happen. We have to be prepared to help each other. We have to be prepared to stand together as a community.”
Volunteers send out the initial call for donations on Labor Day weekend before setting up collection locations. 
When she stopped at CARJON Air Conditioning and Heating in Smithfield late Tuesday afternoon, Testoni collected 567 coats — the largest single-site donation she’s picked up in her 15 years helping with the exchange.
“We’ve been busy elves,” Chris Collette, CARJON’s sales team manager, said. “We were happy to get a decent amount to be able to help people.”
Collette said he and coworkers felt it was especially important to collect winter gear this year amid the recent pause in federal food benefits.
Testoni doesn’t have any firm number on how many items get distributed at the annual coat exchange. She said she just knows that it’s in the hundreds. Which leaves plenty of leftover coats, which she said are then given to the Mathewson Street United Methodist Church in Providence where they can be distributed to people in need..
While rewarding, Testoni said it’s challenging to constantly see hundreds of people line up for a coat.
“I hate that we have to do it, but I’m glad there are people who step up,” she said. “We’ve never gone without coats.”
Testoni has acknowledged recent state investments in trying to keep Rhode Islanders warm this coming winter. In late October, Gov. Dan McKee’s administration committed over $1.7 million in grants to municipalities and nonprofit service providers to expand Rhode Island’s network of warming centers and homeless shelters.
But as long as the need continues to keep Rhode Islanders warm, Testoni said organizers will continue to distribute coats.
“With a simple twist of fate or loss of a job, any one of us can be standing there waiting for a coat,” she said.

This column was first published Nov. 27, 2024.
Frankfort’s small army of state workers, fresh from four days off for Thanksgiving on Dec. 1, 1997, slipped from their cars in normal morning sun and almost as one looked to the sky with twisted, stricken faces.
The Capitol Annex parking lot seemed misted with some indelible flesh-rot that despised humankind. It wasn’t just a smell but a Presence. It sucked life from you; your soul departed and you knew it would not return. Your eyes glazed toward opaque. You could not breathe but for shallow, burning gasps that presaged death rattle.
Of all possible causes, you wouldn’t at this moment imagine a turkey.
Yet. Over there, 30 feet yonder, a maintenance lad in a white haz-mat suit with a stout black bag and a muscular garbage picker crept toward a thing on the Annex lawn. It looked like a yellowed stew of plastic and flesh. It seemed to glow and quiver. Some brave parking-lot sufferer managed to croak out toward the creeping lad, “Dear God, son … What … Why?”
“Some a-hole threw a turkey on the lawn,” the lad said, in a voice that echoed death. It was a sentence as final and direct as, “They launched the nuclear missiles.”
When he’d kissed his wife goodbye that morning, the young man had no clue what this day would bring. He was about to be a hero. He retrieved the turkey. He lost his sense of smell. “Like starin’ at the Sun and goin’ blind,” he told the Workers Comp Board weeks later, I heard. It was a metaphor nailed down tight.
So this is a story I’ve been badgered to tell since then. It started when Rep. Jim Callahan of Southgate gave me a Thanksgiving turkey.
Jim was House Democratic Caucus chairman. In the happy event he liked you, you could have no finer friend in the stinging spin-drift of the Kentucky legislature. If he didn’t, he was one of the few people who could and would get you fired. A man to be trusted and feared. A perfect politician.
I had just lately and reluctantly been put in charge of the Legislative Research Commission’s Public Information Office, a communications shop whose future was in doubt because of some early Republican restiveness. They didn’t find the office deferential enough. It likely wasn’t.
I made it my strategic purpose in life to become indispensable to Jim, so he (and the House Dems, then lazy with a comfortable majority) would protect me against the new restive Republican hordes. I succeeded with Jim, the caucus obeyed his instructions re: me, and in late 1997 Jim started rewarding me for my many good works with appreciated tokens like holiday meats.
The day before this particular Thanksgiving — five days before the maintenance lad’s heroics — Jim’s lanky assistant presented me with my first turkey, laid the sweaty sucker on my desk, bagged in plastic, pristine, frozen and promptly forgotten.
Forgotten, that is to say, in my windowless, steam-heated office, 80 degrees at least, with four black holidays awaiting it and a billion turkey-flesh bacteria awakening to yawn, scratch themselves, and eat.
Flash forward: 9:27 p.m., Payton Residence, Louisville. Sat. Nov. 29.
Quick scene:
“Aw, MAN! NO!”
“What?”
“I forgot the damn TURKEY!”
“What turkey?”
“The one Jim C. gave me three days ago that’s sitting on my desk like a bomb about to explode, if it hasn’t already! I have to get it.’
(Indistinct squabbling).
Even quicker scene:
“You’re not driving a hundred miles round-trip to Frankfort in the dead of night to retrieve a turkey that’s wrapped in plastic and perfectly fine. No.”
Note to young husbands: There are many days coming in your marriage when you simply look at your wife’s slant eyes and surrender. I surrendered. Fifty miles east, the turkey-flesh bacteria ate and ate.
The rest of the weekend was like waiting for biopsy results. Monday morning I drove to work early, dreading what I’d find, hoping against hope the turkey hadn’t exploded but otherwise wanting to get things cleaned up and tended to as best I could before anyone else arrived. Pretty sure I was first in the parking lot slammed by the Presence, the living thing I’d birthed.
The Kentucky Capitol and Annex are in the author’s hometown of Frankfort along the Kentucky River. (University of Kentucky Libraries, Special Collections Research Center, Post Card Collection)
But hope withstood its first assault. As a Frankfort native, I was accustomed to its distilleries, specifically the smell of its distilleries burning mash. The signature smell of the Kentucky River valley. In many ways, Frankfort is a smell. It’s not necessarily a good smell; many find it rank. But all share in it. Every redneck boy, every doctor’s son, every lawyer’s daughter and governor’s privileged kid walks out on fall mornings into its egalitarian embrace. It is hillbilly Marxism: Share the stink.
So for no more than half a second I thought/hoped this stink might be mash. For the second half-second I thought, “Whew, did they throw some rotting sheep cadavers into the mash vats this morning?” Then of course I knew: Turkey. Hissing from my office. Into the Annex HVAC system. Leaking out the old building’s windows. Filling the river valley. Soon to make me the laughing stock of Frankfort. Republicans would say this proved my liberalism.
I try to be relatively accurate in memoirish accounts like this (facts are critically important until they interfere with a good laugh). So I’ll admit the next half hour is a blur that resists disinterment.
The grotesque bird was still on my desk, its plastic bag ripped open by the force of its eruption. I recall an echoey dripping sound onto the floor, a yellowish oozing slime, thick like molasses, that seemed alive itself (remember, it teemed with a billion chomping necrobiomes). It looked like some bad special-effects alien from the first season of Star Trek in 1966.
I cannot remember how I managed to scoop up the carcass itself, make some quick impossible decision about disposing of it, and rush it down the still-deserted Annex hall to the bronze entry doors, where I flung it mightily onto the front lawn and the Presence began spreading in earnest, as did its legend.
At some point the heroic haz-mat kid was called, he gave the remains their final scoop, yet the smell snaked through the Capitol campus (HVAC circulation and filters are eternal, and the river valley itself a thermal trap). Many workers went home for an extra day or two of Thanksgiving celebration. Every sentence at home began “You won’t believe…”
Me, I suffered the derision I deserved, and have at least once a year for 27 years been hectored into telling “Scott’s Turkey Story” to wildly laughing, knee-slapping audiences. I’ve hated it every time, knowing they’re not exactly laughing with me, and sworn for many years I’d “write it up” and just hand the sucker out at every such request.
So now I’ve done that. Here you are. Don’t ask again.
But.
Coda: There is more to the story, and it’s good, but it doesn’t belong to me. It belongs to a fellow Capitol staffer who worked a mysterious deskless job for people who seemed powerful. His name recalls that of a major world capital. He would “borrow” your desk without asking if he needed one. Jim Callahan gave him a turkey every year too.
This is a grand fellow, as all in politics must be, but a bit absent-minded, as most in politics are. To his credit though, and unlike me, he miraculously got his gifted bird to his car that afternoon. Threw it in the trunk. Promptly forgot it.
A week or so later, troubled by some mystery problem with the car — couldn’t quite put his finger on it, snap, snap! — he dropped it off at the repair shop.
From memory:

Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.
He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
Devotion in the service of unity
It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The first took place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621 — Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving — which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-General Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November — it became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.

Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”
The president had prepared for the occasion. He also contributed a sizable sum of his own money to buy beer and food for prisoners confined for debt in the New York City jail. The donation was deemed to be a magnanimous and moving gesture, suitable to the spirit of the holiday. A week later, in an advertisement in the Dec. 3 issue of the New York Journal, those very prisoners returned their “grateful thanks” to their president “for his very acceptable donation on Thursday last.”

Washington’s first Thanksgiving as a president may have not been tremendously successful, given the scarce attendance at the church service.
Yet, as a scholar writing a biography about Washington, I believe it was an important step in his much larger political plan to bring the executive branch to the people’s doorstep.
What Washington wanted was a virtuous kind of populism in the new country he led. Washington’s populism wasn’t about inciting an angry mob; it was about sharing in their rituals, worshiping their God, speaking their own language. And he did so in the sole interest of the American people.
Thanksgiving 1789, for Washington, was at once religious and more than religious. Washington’s proclamation invoked devotional language, literally. The upcoming festivity, in his words, could “be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”
But Washington’s main concern was political. The nation was recently formed, and he feared that it could easily collapse. Its many internal divisions and separate interests could be lethal. Consequently, the president wanted this holiday to be a civic celebration in which “we may then all unite.”
‘Pardon our national…transgressions’
As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws. Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.
He was a slave owner, a relentless pursuer of African American fugitives and a destroyer of Native American villages. He was also a warrior who deployed brutality against enemies. He was a commander who resorted to corporal punishment with his own soldiers. Washington believed that he was not a saint to be mindlessly imitated. This made him humble in his duties.
More importantly, Washington also grasped the power of his symbolic position as president. He sought to leverage that for the good of the nation.
As president, Washington could not advertise his actions effectively via Twitter and social media. He had to show himself around constantly, no matter the weather. He had to painstakingly attend balls, plays, dinners, public receptions and of course the church. Every occasion, every Thanksgiving counted.
Through his outings, Washington met with a diversity of people, including those who were second-class citizens or were not citizens at all. Women, for example, greeted Washington at nearly every stop of the extended presidential trips he took between 1789 and 1791. Textile workers in New England, Jewish leaders in Newport, many enslaved persons in the South and churchgoers everywhere did the same.
These women and men, in bondage or free, believers or skeptics, played a part in the invention of a new political theater. Maybe, it was just a theatrical illusion. But these individuals — just like the prisoners in the New York City jail — thanked President Washington because they felt they were voices in a larger political culture.
Washington made sure his Thanksgiving message — not simply a message, but a “proclamation” — sounded clear and strong: May God “render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed.”

(Matt Poole / U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) As families gather around the Thanksgiving table today, there is a good chance that the steaming bird at the center of the feast could have come from Virginia. The U.S. Department of Agriculture ranks the commonwealth as the sixth largest producer of turkey in the country, estimating over 15 million birds were produced in 2024.
The turkeys produced in the state are not all for holiday roasts. The growth of Americans’ turkey consumption makes it an all-year commodity through ground meat, deli slices, and other foods that have become staples of the nation’s diet. In 2023, the Virginia turkey industry is estimated to have brought in over $400 million.
“Back in my grandparents’ day, it was a holiday specialty, but now, you can enjoy turkey products year round,” said Hobey Bauhan, president of the Virginia Poultry Federation.
While the value of turkeys and the amount of production nationwide is down, Bauhan said the importance of the industry is still reflected in Virginia, evidenced by investments in plants and feed operations. He said that the federation works with lawmakers on a bipartisan basis to manage policies about protecting the environment to ensure they aren’t too restrictive for the 200 family farms in the state.
“You know, if Virginia does not maintain such a positive business climate, investment could flow through another part of the country,” Bauhan said. “That’s what we want to keep the paltry industry thriving in Virginia.”
Virginia is among states such as Minnesota, North Carolina, Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, and Pennsylvania as top producers of the bird. 
With the rise in tariffs in recent years some industries have severely struggled. The turkey industry saw a win in 2023 when U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., was part of talks to lift the significant tariffs India had placed on certain American agricultural products, such as frozen turkey. The first shipments to India came out of the Shenandoah Valley, according to Bauhan.
The turkey industry was modernized through innovation in the Shenandoah Valley in the 1920s at Virginia Tech. A.L. Dean, the head of poultry science at the time, got a letter from Charles Wampler – an extension agent in Rockingham County – about artificially raising turkeys. 
“(He) experimented with hatching turkey eggs in an incubator back in the 1920s and it just kind of gave rise to a significant industry in the Shenandoah Valley,” Bauhan said.
This led the turkey industry to operate year-round in a similar way as the chicken industry.
This year the poultry federation celebrated 100 years since its official inception. Agricultural leaders and Gov. Glenn Youngkin reflected on the rich history of the industry in the region in Rockingham County.

RICHMOND. Va – Some lawmakers hope for more guardrails to better protect Virginians amid the boom in artificial intelligence.
Legislators have started to pre-file bills for the upcoming session which starts on Jan. 14. Most so far represent Democratic legislative initiatives frequently discussed on the campaign trail.
Some of the bills that will be filed include placing limitations on what chatbots can say and banning AI from purchasing tickets, according to Dels. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, and Michelle Maldonado, D-Manassas.
Last year, legislators introduced at least 20 bills in the General Assembly that tried to define or regulate AI use and expand consumer protections. A majority failed or were vetoed.
Maldonado plans to introduce an AI bill that limits what chatbots can say to humans in therapeutic and psychotherapeutic settings. Chatbots are “primed” to make a human feel good, according to Maldonado.
However, a 16-year-old boy confided in a chatbot about his suicidal thoughts and plans. He took his own life in April, according to National Public Radio. His father testified the chatbot discouraged his son from seeking parental help.
Three out of four teenagers have used AI as consultants, according to Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that prioritizes kids’ safety.
“We have to make sure that when people are engaging with these chatbots, they are trained in such a way that they detect language that suggests self-harm, suicidal ideation, or anything like that, the responses are appropriate to go get help,” Maldonado said.
Some startup companies are trying to create chatbot companions that help people in therapy, but they cannot substitute for a human, according to Maldonado.
The second proposed bill from Maldonado will address the usage of chatbots with Virginians age 18 and under. High school and college students are heavily affected by chatbots, according to Maldonado.
“We have a gap that needs to be addressed, and regulating what kinds of uses and what kinds of guardrails we need to have in place when chatbots are interacting with minors,” Maldonado said.
Maldonado has not finalized her legislation, but she hopes there is bipartisan support for her bills.
“There will probably be some things we’ll have to work out to to make sure we garner the support we need to get it passed, but I think there is an appetite and a willingness to do it,” Maldonado said.
Maldonado introduced House Bill 2094 in the last session, which would have created requirements for developing, deploying and using high-risk AI systems. The bill also created requirements for civil penalties for noncompliance.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed the bill, saying it was too “rigid” and would “establish a burdensome artificial intelligence regulatory framework.”
Maldonado will reintroduce the bill, but tailor it more to a specific use case and industry sector.
“I’m disappointed that he chose not to pass this bill,” Maldonado said. “This bill, a version like this that is much more comprehensive, was also carried in other states.”
Maldonado also introduced two other bills related to AI that failed in the previous General Assembly session.
Maldonado said she would like the General Assembly to take a “more aggressive position” to pass a bill that clarifies the structure around the use of social media platforms and their interaction with Virginians under the age of 18.
“The research is clear that there have been mental health harms,” Maldonado said. “That’s undeniable.”
Lawmakers will also propose a bill to require AI labels on certain types of media in an effort to slow down deepfake images and videos, according to Hayes. They may also introduce the Ban Bots Buys Act, which bans AI from purchasing tickets for events, according to Hayes.
“Those bots can be created in such a way that they buy up in bulk,” Hayes said. “They resell the tickets online and other venues, causing people to have to overpay for their purchases.”
There “definitely” needs to be guardrails around AI, according to Hayes.
“AI is already here,” Hayes said. “It is already advanced. So, for those who believe that it’s coming, they’re already way behind.”
The General Assembly passed Hayes’ bill in February which required recommendations or predictions provided by any AI-based tool to not be the sole basis for any criminal justice decisions.
 Virginians cannot be so caught up in artificial intelligence that it impacts their lives and ultimately makes decisions that could cause harm, according to Hayes.
“We want to make sure that we remain innovative, but at the same time, we want to make sure that people come first,” Hayes said.
Alan Shark, a political science associate professor at George Mason University, said he would like the General Assembly to reintroduce HB 2094.
“It really puts more pressure on the developing community to provide documentation so that if there is any kind of issue, legal challenge or otherwise, that there is documentation in a process in which they can explain,” Shark said.
Youngkin issued Executive Order 51 in July, which launched a review of statewide regulations using AI technology. An AI tool will scan state regulations and guidance documents, searching for contradictory or redundant statutes. The tool highlights areas in which the regulatory language can be streamlined.
Shark supports mandates that call for more human oversight.
“It’s just the governor prefers this to be as an executive order versus legislation,” Shark said. “On the other side, though, is a push to leverage AI for regulatory efficiency, meaning they’re looking to find ways to reduce regulation, therefore ideally encouraging more innovation.”
AI should not be political, according to Shark.
“I don’t think you can look at that by party anywhere in the country,” Shark said. “I just think it’s the level of understanding of what AI is and can do.”

Nine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.
But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
Farming faiths and harvest festivals
The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.

Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
Days of Thanksgiving
The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
Harvest feast of 1621
Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
Pilgrims’ primacy
The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.
The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
Rising immigration
Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.

Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

Photo courtesy of the Georgia Department of Natural ResourcesIt’s a bad time to be a turkey in Georgia, even if you don’t live on a poultry farm.
The number of turkey poults – what turkey experts call baby turkeys – is on the decline across nearly all of Georgia, according to numbers from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, with most of the state’s turkeys reproducing below the replacement rate of two poults per hen.
“We have been monitoring poult production in Georgia since the late 70s, and back in the 80s and 90s, we averaged about four poults per hen,” said wildlife biologist and DNR wild turkey project coordinator Emily Rushton.
The DNR’s annual count of poults per hen takes place over the summer, after the spring breeding season, when hens are with their poults. Members of the public can submit observations to help with the count.
“In the early 2000s, it took a pretty sharp decline,” Rushton said. “But the past 10 years or so, we’ve been holding steady at about 1.5 poults per hen.”
Turkeys in Georgia’s lower coastal plain in the southeastern part of the state are the sole silver lining in the poult census, with the average hen hatching 2.39 poults, up from 1.85 in last year’s survey.
The heavily populated Piedmont region which takes up most of the northern half of the state and includes Atlanta and its surrounding regions saw the steepest decline, dropping from 1.94 poults per hen last year to 1.21 this year.

The No. 1 problem facing Georgia’s gobblers is the loss of what’s called early successional habitat, which flourishes after a disturbance like a hurricane, wildfire or the removal of trees and is what exists long before land evolves into a mature forest. Think shrubby, grassy fields with dense ground cover but not a lot of trees, where turkeys can be themselves, hiding out and munching on seeds, insects and other favorites.
“There’s a lot of factors at play, certainly the most important one is probably habitat loss and landscape level changes in the state,” Rushton said. “Obviously there’s been a lot of development in Georgia, habitat fragmentation and loss of early successional habitat, which is really important for turkeys for raising their broods. The poults are relying on insects, and insects are most abundant in early successional habitat.”
Georgia has taken steps in recent years to reverse the turkeys’ downward trend, including shortening the turkey hunting season starting in 2021.
Turkey season takes place during the spring breeding season, and wildlife experts hoped pushing back the start date a week or two to let the turkeys do their thing without getting shot at would help bolster nest numbers.
“There’s some thought that perhaps the early hunting season was interrupting some of the natural calling and response in the way they behave in the woods,” said Georgia Wildlife Federation President Mike Worley. “So that’s why it was pushed back some time, to give a little bit better opportunity to allow the birds to kind of go through a natural cycle without people in the woods with them.”
Worley called the turkeys’ decline “a real concern across the state,” but he expressed optimism that the situation can be improved.
“We’ve cut the bag limit and put restrictions on how many birds hunters can take. All of those things contribute to addressing the issue,” he said. “And we’re not in a situation of absolute crisis. We’re in a situation where it demands perhaps a bit more aggressive management, and I think that’s what you’re seeing, rather than the whole nuclear option of shutting down hunting.”
Worley said one thing property owners can do to make things easier for turkeys is to plan controlled burns.
Georgia’s flora and fauna evolved to benefit from periodic fires, and burning down old vegetation can help make room for the early successional habitat where turkeys thrive.
“If somebody comes to us and says we would like to manage our land for turkeys, one of the first things that we tell them is let’s get some fire on the ground,” Worley said. “There are certainly plants that you can plant, food plots that you can put in, all kinds of things, but those are all secondary to the fact that just a simple burn – which is what our native environment really requires – a simple burn can do a lot in restoring turkey habitat.”
Rushton said it’s not just people who look forward to eating turkey, and the birds’ recovery will be important for critters up and down the food chain.
“They are a really important prey species,” she said. “Their eggs are an important prey item for a lot of wildlife species – other avian species, birds, snakes, and mammals, basically anything will eat a turkey egg or a turkey poult. And they are also a good indicator of forest health, habitat health.”

The singular ruggedness and beauty of the region is part of what draws as many as 6 million visitors to the landscape each year. But the destination also shows the effects of climate change in unique ways, and that reality is already putting pressure on regional recreation, tourism, and ways of life, said North Country scientists, business owners, and officials gathered at the foot of Mount Washington earlier this month to mark the release of the inaugural White Mountains Almanac.

 Where to find the almanac

	Four thousand copies of the first White Mountains Almanac have been printed so far, said Appalachian Mountain Club Senior Scientist Georgia Murray. While supplies last, physical copies of the almanac can be ordered online for free or for a suggested donation. A free e-edition is also available online.

	Rich collections of weather and climate data gathered in and around the White Mountain region can help put numbers to the changes residents and visitors have already observed, scientists said. They hope to begin sharing that data more broadly, and leverage the ability of the White Mountains to capture visitors’ hearts and minds, to help the many who enjoy the landscape adapt to the changes it faces and become more responsible stewards.
“To truly love this landscape, we must understand it,” state Tourism Director Michelle Cruz said at the event.
Long-term data provides insight
The almanac is  a free publication created through a collaboration among three North Country research institutions: the Appalachian Mountain Club, Hubbard Brook Research Foundation, and the Mount Washington Observatory. Scientists involved in the project said the text was the product of their desire to see the powerful data collected in the region reach a larger audience.
The publication contains a month-to-month description of natural phenomena local to the White Mountains, and will be distributed across the North Country. It is intended to serve as a guide for visitors to what’s happening — environmentally speaking — on the landscape at all times of year, said Appalachian Mountain Club Senior Scientist Georgia Murray in an interview. The text was authored by intern and science communicator Frank Vazzano. 
Its conclusions are based on expansive data collected by the three institutions about weather patterns and ecosystems in the White Mountains, Murray said. But scientists felt it wasn’t reaching enough people to have the impact it could.
“(The almanac) is really near and dear to my heart, because I’ve been thinking about this for years. … A lot of people care about the weather, but they may not really make those connections to, you know, what it means when we put all of this data together, and how our climate is changing,” Murray said.

Discussing how shifts in winter weather affect plant life, Murray emphasized the importance of tracking weather and other natural phenomena over many years to better understand how climate change is threatening northern forests.

Adapting to a changing landscape
Together, the data paint a powerful picture, Murray said, though given that the implications for the beloved landscape are murky, it’s not an easy one to share.
Among the topics covered by the almanac are a long-term increase in winter temperatures across the White Mountains; an increase in winter thaw events that can destabilize snowpack for backcountry skiers; and an overall downturn in the number of winter and summer “recreation days,” which are scored on factors like temperature and sunshine.
“It is a tough thing to feel sort of down as you realize that all these trends are going in the direction of, you know, losing the charm and the environment that we typically think of when we think about visiting the Whites,” Murray said.

Though things are changing, there are ways to adapt to these shifts and still enjoy what the White Mountains have to offer, said Mount Washington Observatory Director of Weather Operations Jay Broccolo.
That might mean timing visits better, or adjusting snowmaking operations at ski resorts to make the best use of what resources we have available, he said.
While the nature of each season is changing, the White Mountain region is still holding on to the traits that make it special, Murray said. Making visitors aware of how these phenomena are shifting over time is an important part of helping ensure they can still enjoy the things they love most about the region, she said.
“The mountains are still snowing, but when are they snowing? It’s more about change: It’s about planning and staying tuned in to what’s happening when you plan to come to the Whites,” she said.
AMC Director of Research Sarah J. Nelson echoed this idea at the Nov. 18 press event, saying that mountains like the Whites are, for many, “climate refugia,” or places where the effects of climate change are less pronounced. Mountains are still going to be cooler than other places all year round, and will still have more snow than other regions in the near future, she said.
With so many people coming from far and wide to visit the mountains, making sure they are prepared will help them find joy in the changing landscape, steward it, and stay safe meanwhile, said Charlie Buterbaugh, director of external affairs at the Mount Washington Observatory.
“The wave is happening, right? And so I think we see our role as educating people who are coming from metropolitan regions about this special place, and how to recreate responsibly,” he said. 
Sarah Nelson, director of research with the Appalachian Mountain Club, prepares to demonstrate proper snowpack measuring technique on Nov. 18. Snowpack depth measurements collected by laypeople and scientists alike are an important part of the data the AMC and other local research organizations collect on climate change and weather in the region, Nelson said.

BOILING SPRINGS, S.C. — Near the back corner of the local library’s parking lot, largely out of view from the main road, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened a pop-up clinic in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children.
Spartanburg County, in South Carolina’s Upstate region, has been fighting a measles outbreak since early October, with more than 50 cases identified. Health officials have encouraged people who are unvaccinated to get a shot by visiting its mobile vaccine clinic at any of its several stops throughout the county.
But on a Monday afternoon in Boiling Springs, only one person showed up.
“It’s progress. That progress is slow,” Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health, said during a recent press briefing. “We had hoped to see a more robust uptake than that in our mobile health units.”
As South Carolina tries to contain its measles outbreak, public health officials across the nation are concerned that the highly contagious virus is making a major comeback. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied more than 1,700 measles cases and 45 outbreaks in 2025. The largest started in Texas, where hundreds of people were infected and two children died.
For the first time in more than two decades, the United States is poised to lose its measles elimination status, a designation indicating that outbreaks are rare and rapidly contained.
Florida governor’s administration pushes to eliminate state’s vaccine mandates

South Carolina’s measles outbreak isn’t yet as large as those in other states, such as New Mexico, Arizona and Kansas. But it shows how a confluence of larger national trends — including historically low vaccination rates, skepticism fueled by the pandemic, misinformation and “health freedom” ideologies promoted by conservative politicians — have put some communities at risk for the reemergence of a preventable, potentially deadly virus.
“Everyone talks about it being the canary in the coal mine because it’s the most contagious infectious disease out there,” said Josh Michaud, associate director for global and public health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “The logic is indisputable that we’re likely to see more outbreaks.”
Schools and ‘small brush fires’
Spartanburg’s vaccination rate is among the lowest of South Carolina’s 46 counties. And that was true “even before COVID,” said Chris Lombardozzi, a senior vice president with the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.
Nearly 6,000 children in Spartanburg County schools last year — 10% of the total enrollment — either received an exemption allowing them to forgo required vaccinations or did not meet vaccine requirements, according to data published by the state.
Lombardozzi said the county’s low vaccination rate is tied to misinformation not only published on social media but also spread by “a variety of nonmedical leaders over the years.”
The pandemic made things worse. Michaud said that fear and misinformation surrounding COVID-19 vaccines “threw gasoline on the fire of people’s vaccine skepticism.” In some cases, that skepticism transferred to childhood vaccines, which historically have been less controversial, he said.
This made communities like Spartanburg County with low vaccination rates more vulnerable. “Which is why we’re seeing constant, small brush fires of measles outbreaks,” Michaud said.
In Spartanburg, the overall percentage of students with required immunizations fell from 95.1% to 90% between the 2020-21 and 2024-25 academic years. Public health officials say a minimum of 95% is required to prevent significant spread of measles.
CDC vaccine officials resign while childhood vaccination rates decline

Children who attend public and private schools in South Carolina are required to show that they’ve received some vaccinations, including the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, but religious exemptions are relatively easy to obtain. The exemption form must be notarized, but it does not require a doctor’s note or any disclosure about the family’s religious beliefs.
The number of students in South Carolina who have been granted religious exemptions has increased dramatically over the past decade. That’s particularly true in the Upstate region, where religious exemptions have increased sixfold from a decade ago. During the 2013-14 school year, 2,044 students in the Upstate were granted a religious exemption to the vaccine requirements, according to data published by The Post and Courier. By fall 2024, that number had jumped to more than 13,000.
Some schools are more exposed than others. The beginning of the South Carolina outbreak was largely linked to one public charter school, Global Academy of South Carolina, where only 17% of the 605 students enrolled during the 2024-25 school year provided documentation showing they had received their required vaccinations, according to data published by the Department of Public Health.
No one from Global Academy responded to interview requests.
‘Health freedom’
In April, after visiting a Texas family whose daughter had died from measles, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He made a similar statement during an interview on “Dr. Phil” later that month.
But these endorsements stand at odds with other statements Kennedy has made that cast doubt on vaccine safety and have falsely linked vaccines with autism. The CDC, under his authority, now claims such links “have been ignored by health authorities.”
“What would I do if I could go back in time and I could avoid giving my children the vaccines that I gave them?” he said on a podcast in 2020. “I would do anything for that. I would pay anything to be able to do that.”
Throughout 2025, he has made other misleading or unsupported statements. During a congressional hearing in September, Kennedy defended his past claims that he was not anti-vaccine but affirmed his stated position that no vaccines are safe or effective.
Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told KFF Health News that Kennedy is “pro-safety, pro-transparency and pro-accountability.” Hilliard said HHS is working with “state and local partners in South Carolina” and in other states to provide support during the measles outbreaks.
Meanwhile, Kennedy has frequently championed the idea of health freedom, or freedom of choice, regarding vaccines, a talking point that has taken root among Republicans.
That has had a “chilling effect all the way down through state and local lawmakers,” Michaud said, making some leaders hesitant to talk about the threat that the ongoing measles outbreaks poses or the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccine.
Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, said the governor was not available to be interviewed for this article but referenced McMaster’s comment from October that measles “is a dangerous disease, but in terms of diseases, it’s not one that we should panic about.”
On a separate occasion that month, the Republican governor said he does not support vaccine mandates. “We’re not going to have mandates,” he said, “and I think we are responding properly.”
Even though the South Carolina Department of Public Health has repeatedly encouraged measles vaccines, the push has been notably quieter than the agency’s COVID-19 vaccine outreach efforts.
In 2021, for example, the agency partnered with breweries throughout the state for a campaign called “Shot and a Chaser,” which rewarded people who got a COVID-19 vaccine with a free beer or soda. By contrast, the pop-up measles vaccine clinic at the Boiling Springs Library featured no flashy signage, no freebies, and wasn’t visible from the library’s main entrance.
Edward Simmer, interim director of the Department of Public Health, would not speak to KFF Health News about the measles outbreak. During a legislative hearing in April, Republican state lawmakers voted against his permanent confirmation because of his past support for COVID-19 vaccines and masking. One lawmaker specifically criticized the agency during that hearing for the Shot and a Chaser campaign.
Public health officials in other states also have been blocked from new roles because of their COVID-19 response. In Missouri, where MMR vaccine rates have declined among kindergartners since 2020 and measles cases have been reported this year, Republican lawmakers rejected a public health director in 2022 after vaccine opponents protested his appointment.
In South Carolina, Simmer, lacking lawmakers’ confirmation, leads the public health agency in an interim capacity.
South Carolina Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort was the only Republican on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee who voted to confirm Simmer in April. He told KFF Health News that his Republican colleagues raised valid questions about Simmer’s past support for COVID-19 vaccines.
But, Davis said, it would be “tremendously unfortunate and not beneficial from a public health perspective” if the Republican Party just took a stance against vaccines “as a matter of policy.”
The Department of Public Health had administered 44 doses of the MMR vaccine through its mobile health unit from October to mid-November. The last mobile vaccine clinic was scheduled for Nov. 24. But health officials are encouraged that patients are seeking vaccines elsewhere. The agency’s tracking system shows that providers across Spartanburg County administered more than twice as many measles vaccines in October as they did a year ago.
As of mid-November, more than 130 people remained in quarantine, most of them students at local elementary and middle schools. Cases have also been linked to a church and Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport.
“We’re reminding people that travel for the upcoming holidays increases the risk of exposures greatly,” said Bell, the state epidemiologist. “Due to that risk, we’re encouraging people to consider getting vaccinated now.”

Ohio voting rights advocates are urging Gov. Mike DeWine to veto a voting measure approved just before lawmakers left for the holidays. The bill, Ohio Senate Bill 293, eliminates a grace period for absentee ballots post-marked by Election Day to arrive by mail, which GOP lawmakers have been whittling away in recent years.
Lawmakers also lumped in several provisions targeting noncitizens on the voting rolls. It’s an issue Secretary of State Frank LaRose has repeatedly raised even as he insists on Ohio’s “gold standard” electoral system.
LaRose has flagged hundreds of registrations since taking office. State and county prosecutors have largely dismissed his allegations as meritless. Earlier this month, LaRose tried again and sent those cases to U.S. Department of Justice.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The last-minute changes to S.B. 293 will give much greater weight to LaRose’s regular reviews of the voter rolls.
Not only does it require audits occur monthly (despite federal law barring removals during a 90-day ‘quiet period’ before federal elections), but it also directs county boards to cancel a person’s registration without notice if the secretary determines the person isn’t a citizen.
Just last year, LaRose’s reviews erroneously targeted several recently naturalized citizens.
Testifying before an Ohio House committee the day prior to the bill’s passage, LaRose downplayed the changes.
The more than 7,000 ballots that arrived after Election Day in 2024?
“That is .0129% of the overall,” LaRose said, noting that already two-thirds of states have the same deadline in place.
The move to cancel registrations? LaRose sidestepped that, insisting the change “simply” defines federal data as “one of the approved sets of data for conducting voter list maintenance.”
Ohio lawmakers clear absentee ballot, citizenship restrictions for House floor vote

The deadline
The impetus for changing Ohio’s absentee ballot deadline came, at least in part, from the U.S. Department of Justice.
In March, President Trump asserted in an executive order that all ballots arriving after Election Day should be thrown out.
LaRose told lawmakers DOJ attorneys have warned his office they would sue Ohio if it didn’t change state law to comply.
“I think it’s just very unusual for the Department of Justice to act as the President’s lobbyist,” Center for Election Innovation and Research Executive Director David Becker said of that pressure campaign.
The Department of Justice’s role is to enforce federal law, he said, and there’s no federal law defining the time when ballots need to arrive.
“There is no federal law that does that whatsoever,” he said, “and for the Department of Justice to be pressuring states is, at best, highly unusual, and at worst, outright corrupt.”
Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to hear a case out of Mississippi in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled against a similar grace period.
Several state lawmakers voiced concern about what happens if the court eliminates grace periods nationwide. And worse, the possibility of that decision landing next summer between Ohio’s primary and general elections.
Becker acknowledged that decision could go either way but called the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation “unusual.”
The audits
The organization VoteRiders helps voters get the ID they need to cast a ballot in their state.
The group’s legal director, Ceridwen Cherry, said routinely scouring federal database and Ohio’s Bureau of Motor Vehicles records to “root out suspected noncitizen voters is a solution in search of a problem.”
Information in the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database isn’t always up to date, she explained.
There’s also no state or federal law requiring naturalized citizens to update their driver’s license.
That means a new citizen could register to vote, and one or both of the databases LaRose uses to review their registration might wrongly indicate that they’re ineligible.
And Cherry worries the bill “does not give incorrectly flagged eligible US citizens a chance to prove their citizenship. Instead, they would be purged from voter rolls without warning or recourse.”
VoteRiders worked with the University of Maryland’s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement to study Americans’ access to documentary proof of citizenship.
They found more than 21 million Americans, or more than 9% of the voting age population, do not have ready access to the documents they need.
Cherry warns those two factors together — lack of warning and lack of access — could lead to otherwise eligible voters being disenfranchised because they don’t have what they need and don’t have time to get it.
DeWine’s call
The governor has ten days to decide on whether to sign the bill once it arrives on his desk.
As of Tuesday afternoon, the Senate has not yet sent it to the governor.
But the Ohio Voter Rights Coalition, which includes groups like the League of Women Voters, Common Cause, and the ACLU of Ohio, is already urging DeWine to reject the bill.
In a press release the group criticized the measure for “needlessly eliminat(ing) the post-election window” and imposing audits “that will drastically increase the number of provisional ballots.”
And the coalition calls back to DeWine’s own 2023 signing statement when he approved Ohio House Bill 458.
That bill required voters show photo ID to cast a ballot and directed the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to put a “noncitizen” designation on driver’s licenses or IDs issued to people who aren’t U.S. citizens.
Notably, just like the bill headed to DeWine’s desk, H.B. 458 shortened the deadline for absentee ballots — cutting it from 10 days post-election to four.
Should DeWine sign the bill, Ohio voters will see a different absentee ballot deadline in three successive federal elections.
On signing the bill, DeWine said, “I believe with the enactment of the new election integrity provisions in House Bill 458, this matter should be settled, and I do not expect to see any further statutory changes to Ohio voting procedures while I am Governor.”
The Ohio Voter Rights Coalition is now calling on DeWine to “veto this anti-democratic bill immediately, stand by his word, and reaffirm his commitment to Ohio voters.”

Nine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.
But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
 Farming faiths and harvest festivals

The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.

Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
 ‘Days of Thanksgiving’

The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
 Harvest feast of 1621

Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”

‘The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth’ by Jennie A. Brownscombe. (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal/Wikimedia Commons)
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
 Pilgrims’ primacy

The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.

The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
 Rising immigration

Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.

Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

But one survey found that the overall price of Thanksgiving dinner in Connecticut is down from last year.
In Connecticut, there have been 41 cases of the avian flu in wild birds this year alone, and 102 total since 2022, according to the USDA. Five flocks in Connecticut have been infected since 2022, three in 2025. And nationwide, the USDA projected that the cost of wholesale, whole turkey would increase at the end of this year after production fell in January due to the avian flu.
However, projections from the American Farm Bureau Federation found that many stores surveyed were offering holiday deals on turkey, decreasing consumer costs.
Overall, the survey projected that a meal serving 10 people could cost $55.81, down from last year but still higher than the organization projected in 2021. But since this decrease was due partly because of deals grocery stores put on, Thanksgiving meal costs may vary based on store and location. 
According to Datasembly, a market research company that assess grocery prices from 150,000 stores across the country, prices rose, and poultry saw a 4.4% index change in Connecticut 4.4%. But just across the border in Massachusetts, there was a drop in prices, and a drop of 2.1%.
Side dishes like mac and cheese, and canned goods like vegetables, pumpkin and cranberry sauce, have seen price increases since last year.
Because of the Trump administration’s 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, the price of canned goods has risen since last year. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that September 2024 to September 2025, canned good prices increased by 5% in U.S. cities.
And pasta, one of the goods that could be affected by President Donald Trump’s proposed 107% tariff on Italian imports, is crucial to one of the nation’s favorite sides — mac and cheese.
An annual “sides report” from Campbell’s found that in the majority of U.S. states, including Connecticut, stuffing was the most popular of all the Thanksgiving sides. The survey also found that 67% of all Americans preferred eating sides over the main course.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/A3hFo-cost-of-wholesale-whole-turkey-in-the-u.s.-cents-per-lb--1024x662.png,,,2025-11-27 05:57:09.395674

The Ohio House and the Senate passed Ohio House Bill 184 during marathon sessions last week. 
Ohio Republican House Reps. Brian Stewart and Ty Mathews introduced the bill earlier this year, which now goes to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine.

The bill started out as legislation that prohibits a NIL contract from remaining in effect after a student athlete is done playing college sports. 
Former Ohio State Buckeyes wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. and Fanatics were involved in a legal dispute over a NIL deal after Fanatics claimed Harrison did not meet his obligation. 
“His NIL agreement continued on after his eligibility at college and went into when he was in the NFL,” said Ohio Sen. Nathan Manning, R-North Ridgeville. 
“This simply just does not allow these agreements to go past your eligibility in college, and if it does do that, then it ceases to exist.” 
Ohio state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, said he liked the NIL provisions in the bill.

“When one of my football players is taken advantage of … there’s something we need to do about this,” he said. 
“We can’t have these athletes be used and abused and taken advantage of.” 
Ohio state Rep. Munira Abdullahi, D-Columbus, said it is important to protect student-athletes. 
“When a kid shows up to college as a star recruit there are agents waiting to lock them into contracts that drain money from them for years,” she said. 
Several last minute additions were added to the bill including transferring $40 million from the general revenue fund to go toward the post-traumatic stress fund for first responders; changing the funding formula for nursing home payments from the state; and paying publicly funded child care based on attendance instead of enrollment, among other additions. 
“This does not necessarily mark the end of budget corrections,” Ohio state Sen. Jerry Cirino R-Kirtland, said. 
Lawmakers in both chambers on both sides of the aisles criticized not having much time to look over all the changes made to the bill. 
“I’m not a big fan of these Christmas tree bills,” DeMora said. “I think too much stuff is crammed into it at late hours, and we don’t get to see it all.”
Ohio state Sen. George Lang, R-West Chester, said the changes happened last minute. 
“I truly didn’t have time to vet it,” he said. 
Ohio state Sen. Al Cutrona, R-Canfield, was the only senator to vote against the bill last week. 
“I have major concerns with the process that’s being conducted here in this chamber,” he said. “Maybe the policy is good, maybe it’s bad. I can’t tell you one way or another, because, well, frankly, we haven’t had any true eyes on it. … I’m going to have to vote no on a very good bill.”
Rep. Abdullahi said she reluctantly voted f0r the bill.
“(Changes) were dropped at the eleventh hour and they affect hundreds of millions of your tax dollars,” she said. 
“We’re using what was once a good, simple, common sense bill to quietly move hundreds of millions of dollars while Ohioans are not looking. If anyone else did this would be calling it money laundering, but when we do it, it’s a budget correction bill.”
State Rep. Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati, and four Republicans state Reps. Levi Dean, Jason Stephens, Jennifer Gross, and Michelle Teska voted against the bill. 
Many lawmakers voiced support for the post-traumatic stress fund for first responders. 
“I wish it was more money,” DeMora said. “I wish it was over more years, but I will certainly settle for the $40 million one time placement of this money into that fund.”
The average person sees one to three traumatic events in their lifetime while first responders see an average of 11 traumatic things a month, said state Sen. Thomas Patton, R-Strongsville. 
“They’re seeing the very, very worst things we can’t possibly imagine,” he said. 
Democratic state Rep. Erika White’s husband is a firefighter in the Toledo area. 
“I’ve watched him carry home the kind of pain that no one sees,” she said. “… (Post-traumatic stress) doesn’t end when the siren stops. It follows them into our homes, to our marriages, in our daily lives.”

(Photo by Alan MacRae/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Bulletin’s three-part series, by William Skipworth, on our state’s disability residential services system is painful to read. It chronicles stories of criminal behavior — neglect, physical assaults, sexual assaults, and preventable deaths of residents with intellectual and developmental disabilities — with families left seeking answers through the courts. The New Hampshire Bulletin and Mr. Skipworth have done New Hampshire a great service by bringing these stories to light.
As someone who has worked in disability policy research for decades, I wish these stories were anomalies. They are not. They are the result of historic prejudice, leading to chronic underfunding, and subsequently to inadequate staffing with insufficient training and oversight.  
Over the course of American history, many people with disabilities were housed and isolated in ever larger, more centrally controlled institutions — from local almshouses in Colonial America to county poor farms in the 1800s to state-run schools and hospitals in the 1900s — all in the name of safety and cost savings. Examples include the Strafford County Poor Farm, New Hampshire School for the Feebleminded (renamed the Laconia State School), and the New Hampshire Asylum for the Insane (renamed the New Hampshire State Hospital). However, the promises of cost savings were never realized. Within these centralized institutions came neglect and abuse on an industrial scale, and in many states, forced sterilization, including New Hampshire. 
A movement to eliminate these institutions — the Deinstitutionalization Movement — picked up steam in the 1970s, particularly with the release of Geraldo Rivera’s 1972 documentary, “Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace.” Like the Vietnam War, television footage dramatically changed public awareness. In turn, public pressure led to changes in federal policy, which created small group homes and, still further, home and community-based services (including adult foster care) that are intended to support independent living and keep people with their families and in their communities. As of 2023, about 6,500 people with disabilities live in a mix of these residential settings that are run by private businesses and funded with state and federal funds. 
New Hampshire confronted its own institutional past much later. The 2010 documentary “Lost in Laconia,” offered a stark retrospective on the Laconia State School and reminded us why the state committed to community-based supports in the first place — and what can happen when oversight weakens or systems lose sight of the people they exist to support.
While abuse and neglect are no longer committed on an industrial scale, Mr. Skipworth’s reporting reveals similar patterns of criminal behavior continuing in smaller, more isolated and concealed places. 
So where do we go from here?
This moment calls for a shared commitment — from state leaders, service providers, families, and the broader public. First and foremost, when abuse or neglect is suspected, it must be reported. New Hampshire’s mandatory reporting law applies to everyone. You do not need proof; you need only reasonable suspicion to call local law enforcement or the appropriate state agency. These are crimes and must be treated as such. 
But reporting alone will not fix a system under strain. A stronger federal and state investment is needed to fairly compensate family caregivers — who often provide the very services the residential system struggles to deliver — and to build a stable workforce of well-trained direct support professionals. Turnover is extraordinarily high in-home health and personal care occupations; as a labor economist, I can say clearly that the people who stay in this work do so out of dedication, not pay. Sustaining a dependable, skilled workforce requires real investment.
Everyone in New Hampshire has a role to play. This is the time for us to fully commit to the inclusion of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in everyday life — in schools, workplaces, civic spaces, places of worship, and neighborhoods across New Hampshire. Inclusion brings sunlight into the smaller, more isolated settings where abuse can take root. Think of how we notice when a friend, neighbor, or colleague is struggling: they are not at work, not at church, not leaving the house. Those same natural cues protect people with disabilities when they are part of our daily lives. Abuse and neglect are far more difficult to hide when someone is known and seen regularly in their community.
Inclusion is not only the ethical thing to do; it is a practical, cost-effective way to ensure safety. 
When people with disabilities participate fully in community life, we — the public — become partners in accountability. We notice. We ask questions. We intervene. We lift up the expectation that everyone belongs, and everyone deserves to be safe.
The Institute on Disability (IOD) was created in the wake of deinstitutionalization and serves as New Hampshire’s University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD). As a UCEDD, we provide training, technical assistance, and research to strengthen disability services and promote full inclusion. But institutions like ours cannot do this work alone. We must redouble — and broaden — our collective efforts to ensure that New Hampshire’s disability service systems are properly funded and equipped to guarantee the full participation and safety of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

(Photo by WEWS.)A new bill proposed by an Ohio Republican lawmaker would revoke the brand new ability for high school athletes to be compensated for their Name, Image and Likeness. Just Monday, the state’s student athletic association announced it had voted to allow for the NIL deals.
The legislation, shared with us, is sponsored by state Rep. Adam Bird (R-New Richmond). It states that high schoolers can’t participate in NIL deals — like basketball superstar Marcus Johnson.
“It’s a blessing from God,” Johnson told us earlier this year about his athletic ability and winning awards.
He has national recognition, fans screaming for him at games — and tens of thousands of followers on Instagram.
“We have received a lot of offers from clothing lines to drinks, drink companies,” Sonny Johnson, Marcus’ father and coach, said.
But he hasn’t accepted any deals, since he’s only a senior at Garfield Heights. But Sonny is thrilled that athletes like Marcus and their families will now get a chance for a slam dunk.
“If you can get a kid that could get a couple thousand dollars without the parents having to give it to him, it saves us some groceries,” Sonny said, laughing.
The Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) announced Monday that it passed new bylaws that allow the high school athletes to be compensated through appearances, licensing, social media, endorsements and/or the use of branding based on their public recognition or notoriety.
It also establishes limitations so that athletes do not hurt their eligibility when it comes to recruiting.
“Having NIL in Ohio would definitely be great for me and my family,” Marcus said.
But those opportunities may be blocked.
“Earning money is not what Ohio high school sports is about,” Rep. Bird said.
Less than 24 hours after the announcement, the Republican lawmaker proposed a bill to ban NIL deals for high school student-athletes.
“We want our sports to be about character development and leadership and fitness and social connections and all of those kinds of things — and not creating even more pressure for our students,” Bird continued.
Students shouldn’t be earning more than coaches and referees, he said, and the athlete’s focus shouldn’t be on endorsements.
“When you’re using public money to create gymnasiums and stadiums and weight rooms, we should be using that publicly paid-for facility for those kinds of things and not for the athlete to be earning NIL money,” the lawmaker said.
Sonny said opponents to NIL don’t understand. Marcus added that 44 other states already approve of NIL for high schoolers.
“I’ve just seen a lot of talent leave Ohio… A lot of talent that want to experience other places because they have NIL,” Marcus said.
The bill is in the early stages and isn’t expected to be heard for several months. Still, athletes hope it’s an airball.
This debate stems from a court case.
A Franklin County high school football player’s mother filed a lawsuit against the OHSAA in mid-October, arguing that students should be permitted to make money from their image. Her son had already missed out on more than $100,000 in potential NIL deals, the mom said.
Franklin County Common Pleas Court Judge Jaiza Page issued an order in late October, allowing students to make money.
Thus, OHSAA had an emergency referendum vote. It passed.

Ha! I kid, because Thanksgiving of course lives in our hearts and minds as a meaningful holiday, not just an excuse for four days away from work and trampling our fellow humans in a quest for flat-screen television sets. We come together to express thanks — for the love that surrounds us, for our family and friends, and for other things that make for dreadfully dull columns. I call them like I see them, folks.
In the interest of shaking things up, here are a dozen messages of thanks for the decidedly cruddy autumn of 2025. It’s bad out there! 
I’m thankful for Senate President Ty Masterson’s close reading of my Kansas Reflector columns. He’s used some of my words for an ad, which I can assure you was not my intent. His gubernatorial campaign should stay tuned for my next column, which will no doubt be even more complimentary!
I’m thankful for President Donald Trump, who has contributed to the civil discourse we all value by calling reporters “piggy,” “insubordinate” and “ugly” in recent days. Here in Kansas, we have to sit so far away from Republicans we can’t even hear what they’re calling us!
I’m thankful for Gov. Laura Kelly’s victory lap in Newsweek, where she’s profiled as a Democrat who can set an example for the nation. I might feel even more thankful if there were more than the one, single, soon-to-depart Laura Kelly.
I’m thankful for the spread of artificial intelligence, which has nearly reached the level of Kansas lawmakers, all the while enriching tech titans and literally driving people insane. Nothing problematic will ever come from this!
I’m thankful for House Speaker Dan Hawkins’ thin-skinned fit of pique in punishing Republicans who wouldn’t call for a special session. That will definitely encourage no one else to run for speaker in January, Dan!
I’m thankful for the hundreds of books I have piled up around my room and definitely plan to read some day. I’m not just creating a hoarding situation and/or fire hazard.
I’m thankful for the fact that hot, young, fresh artists like Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and the Beatles have released enormous multi-disk boxed sets for the holiday season. We need to hear more even minute variations of their previously released recordings.
I’m thankful for the Kansas Republican Party, which showed its deep commitment to equality and justice by condemning hateful texts from young staffers while simultaneously posting racist memes about Kelly. Only the best sombreros for our state GOP!
I’m thankful for those in Kansas who voted for a candidate and administration that promised a wholesale rollback of civil liberties and war on the poor, embodied in Project 2025. Looks like you got what you voted for! Hope you enjoy all those tariff-inflated prices this holiday season.
I’m thankful for the way that Kansas Republicans so bravely condemned homophobia in August — when it meant being able to go after a Democrat. What a coincidence!
I’m thankful for all the earth-shaking decisions that Kansans will get to make next year: our governor, D.C. delegation, state Legislature and method of selecting state Supreme Court justices. I’m sure that will all go well and there’s absolutely nothing to be concerned about!
Finally, and more seriously.
I’m actually thankful for all those who made this a joyous year for me personally, regardless of the political and cultural headwinds. By that I mean my family and friends, the amazing Kansas Reflector staff and community, my poetry night comrades, and the mensches at the University Press of Kansas.
You’ve all indulged and encouraged me through these turbulent months. I appreciate it more than words can say. May your Thursday of Thursdays be the Thursday-ist it can be.

Library of Congress)Nine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.

This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.

	But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America — at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
Farming faiths and harvest festivals
The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.
Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
‘Days of Thanksgiving’
The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
Harvest feast of 1621
Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”
‘The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth’ by Jennie A. Brownscombe. (Image: Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal/Wikimedia Commons)
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
Pilgrims’ primacy
The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.
The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
Rising immigration
Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.
Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961-1024x653.jpg,,,2025-11-27 04:56:33.273872

Faith Winter, a Broomfield Democrat, speaks ahead of a bill signing for two reproductive rights policies at the Colorado Capitol on April 24, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state Sen. Faith Winter, a Broomfield Democrat who served for more than a decade in the Colorado General Assembly, was killed Wednesday night in a multi-vehicle crash south of Denver.
“Our state is shaken by the loss of Sen. Faith Winter, and I send my deepest condolences to her children, loved ones, friends, and colleagues across our state,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.
“Faith was a fierce advocate for hardworking Coloradans, women, and families, and our climate,” Polis added. “I’ve known Faith for nearly twenty years, first as an organizer for environmental causes and then expanding women’s representation and leadership, and finally, as a state senator. I have had the honor of working with her on many issues to improve the lives of every person and family in our great state, and tackling climate change.”
At least three other people were injured in the crash, which occurred on northbound Interstate 25 near the Dry Creek Road exit, according to South Metro Fire Rescue and the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office.
Before winning election to the Senate in 2018, Winter, a former environmental nonprofit director, served two terms in the Colorado House of Representatives.
She served as chair of the Senate’s Transportation and Energy Committee, spearheading efforts to modernize Colorado transportation funding, expand public transit investments and reduce vehicle pollution. She was a co-sponsor of House Bill 19-1261, a landmark 2019 climate action law that established the state’s first statutory greenhouse gas reduction targets.
“Words cannot express how deeply heartbroken we are tonight as Colorado mourns the loss of an exceptional legislator, a champion for working people, and a steadfast defender of our environment and abortion rights,” Colorado House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, and House Majority Leader Monica Duran, a Wheat Ridge Democrat, said in a statement.
Senate President James Coleman and Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, both Denver Democrats, called Winter “a dedicated public servant whose commitment to the people of Colorado never wavered.”
Senator Winter was a colleague whose presence brought warmth and an invaluable perspective to the Capitol. We will miss her leadership, her partnership, and her deep commitment to a brighter Colorado,” Coleman and Rodriguez said. “Our hearts are with Senator Winter’s family and friends as they navigate this unimaginable loss.”

Gators are ""part of what makes Florida Florida,"" said author Rebecca Renner.The Pilgrims were idiots. If they had just taken a sharp left at Plymouth Rock and sailed southward for another 500 miles, they could have spent that first winter luxuriating at a hotel in St. Augustine.
The Spanish settlers in St. Augustine had beaten them to the New World by more than 50 years. They’d also beaten the Pilgrims to the idea of holding a Thanksgiving feast.
The original celebrants were Spanish explorers and Native Soon-To-Be-Americans, and instead of turkey, they dined on salt pork and garbanzo beans. Then they probably got into an argument over whether that one side dish should be called “stuffing” or “dressing.”
Because of that history, I always think of Thanksgiving as the most Florida of the holidays and always look for something we should all be thankful for.
This isn’t easy to do these days amid exorbitant grocery prices, skyrocketing insurance rates, and widespread political insanity: “Hey, let’s revive the reputation of Red Scare bully Joe McCarthy while the president has a lovefest with a guy he says is a communist!”
But if you look for blessings, you’ll find them, sometimes in the most unlikely places. Today, I want to tell you why we should all be thankful for alligators.
No, not the college football team that’s 3-8. I mean our official state reptile that lurks in every body of water in Florida that’s larger than a mud puddle.
Some people find them terrifying because of their role as predators in the whole “Circle of Life” thing. But I’m here to tell you that alligators have many admirable qualities. For instance, they’re our first line of defense against the pythons invading the Everglades.
And I know of three instances in which alligators helped the cops nab fleeing suspects. Talk about taking a bite out of crime!
What’s most amazing, though, is that there was a time when they were on the endangered species list.
And now they may wind up saving us.
Trading gator for beer
Gators “are part of what makes Florida Florida,” said Rebecca Renner, who wrote the riveting true-crime book “Gator Country” about a particularly wild gator poaching case.
Rebecca Renner via Goodreads
Gators are so identified with the state, she said, that “a lot of people who come here want to see them.” That’s why we have such thriving attractions as Gatorland and the St. Augustine Alligator Farm.
Fueling their fascination with gators is the fact that a lot of the wacky Florida man and woman stories you see are also Florida gator stories.
“Florida man tries trading gator for beer.” “Forida woman fights to keep her pet alligator who wears clothes and rides an ATV.” “Florida woman pulls alligator out of pants during traffic stop.” That last one, which involved turtle smuggling, inspired Dave Barry and Carl Hiaasen to write a lovely song called, “She Had Turtles in Her Trunk and a Reptile in Her Pants.”
Probably the best-known one happened in 2016, when a 24-year-old Florida man pulled up to a Wendy’s in Royal Palm Beach and tossed an alligator through the drive-thru window. He did it as a prank, but the drive-thru clerk was not amused. She was so terrified she dove out through the same window by which the 3-foot gator entered.
My favorite part of the story is that the guy was charged with assault with a deadly weapon — to wit, the gator.
The first biologist to study gators would have been on the drive-thru clerk’s side.
Slaughter for fun and fashion
Pioneering naturalist William Bartram, who visited Florida in the 1770s, was the first scientist to document alligators’ behavior. He was clearly scared of them, considering them man-eating monsters.
William Bartram via Independence National Historical Park Collection
There were a lot of gators back then, he reported: “The alligators were in such incredible numbers, and so close together from shore to shore, that it would have been easy to have walked across on their heads, had the animals been harmless.”
When he tried fishing, a congregation (yes, that’s the word) of gators went after his boat, he wrote.
“I was attacked on all sides,” Bartram wrote.  “… Two very large ones attacked me closely, at the same instant, rushing up with their heads and part of their bodies above the water, roaring terribly and belching floods of water over me.”
When another one attacked later, he dispatched it with a single shot to the head. After that, Bartram would as soon shoot gators as look at them.

Lots of other Florida tourists reacted the same way. From the 1800s to the 1960s, there was a wholesale slaughter. An incredible number of nitwit Northerners thought that no vacation in Florida was complete unless they’d bagged a gator or twelve.
Some of the shooting was for fun. Some was for fashion.
An 1893 federal fisheries report found that gator hides had become a highly lucrative industry, with Florida the center of the trade. The report figured 2.5 million hides had been shipped out of the state since 1880. Two Jacksonville firms handled more than 60,000 skins in a single year.
The alligator was being ‘‘systematically and relentlessly hunted in nearly every part of Florida,’’ the report noted, predicting that it was ‘‘only a question of time when this valuable fishery resource will become exhausted.’’
Saving the species
Five decades ago, when a Florida man named Nathaniel Reed worked as assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, he changed the nation.
This is a different kind of Florida man story than you’re used to.
Nat Reed via National Audubon Society
Reed had spent his childhood collecting butterflies, jotting notes on all the birds he saw around Jupiter, and fishing in Hobe Sound. He loved fishing so much, his mother joked that he emerged from the womb carrying a fly rod.
The grown-up Reed was alarmed by reports of wildlife disappearing around America. He gathered a group of like-minded federal officials at a Chinese restaurant in Washington. Between egg rolls and moo goo gai pan, they jotted down the wording for what would become the Endangered Species Act.
The bill passed Congress by a nearly unanimous vote in 1973 and was signed into law by Reed’s Republican boss, Richard Nixon.
“We had the fervor of youth and a sense of high ethical standards for how man should treat his fellow creatures on spaceship Earth,” Reed told me years later.
The earliest list of endangered species included several well-known Florida critters, including the panther, the manatee, and — believe it or not — the alligator.
As difficult as it may be to imagine, we nearly had a Florida without alligators. Frankly, that wouldn’t be much like the Florida we know and love, would it?
The gator renaissance
The comeback began with the state and federal government setting aside places for the gators to exist undisturbed by intrusive humans, Renner said.
State parks like Hillsborough River and Highlands Hammock, built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, as well as Everglades National Park, opened in 1947, gave the gators to live and thrive in their native habitat.
Then, in the 1970s, under what became known as the Clean Water Act, developers began to think twice (at least at first) about whether they should wipe out wetlands to build houses, stores, and offices. That, too, benefited the gators.
“They’re very resilient animals,” Renner said. “Their comeback helps us be hopeful for other animals to do the same.”
The gators’ revival also helped other animals that depend on them, she pointed out. Gators dig holes that become wet refuges for fish, turtles, and frogs during droughts.
The gator renaissance is now in full swing. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission estimates we have more than 1 million roaming through all 67 Florida counties.
We have so many gators that the FWC has launched a Statewide Nuisance Alligator Program, or SNAP for short, to trap the ones that cause trouble. If anyone tells you bureaucrats have no sense of humor, tell ’em about SNAP.
But the programs that brought the gators back from the edge of extinction have now themselves become endangered.
The real predators
Last week, the Trump Administration proposed major rollbacks for both the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act.
For the Clean Water Act, his Environmental Protection Agency said it would redefine what’s protected to “exclude many wetlands and streams across the country. The changes could strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85% of all wetlands nationwide,” The New York Times reported.
So much for sparing all that gator habitat. Looks like it’s going to be covered by asphalt now.
As for the Endangered Species Act, his Interior Department announced several proposed changes to such things as “critical habitat” and other aspects of the law.
The most radical change calls for counting economic impact, instead of only focusing on what the science says about protecting an endangered species. Up until now, science alone determined whether a species was endangered. Not anymore.
“For example, if the Trump administration determined that the economic harm to a golf course would be greater than protections for the Florida panther, then they could make that determination,” Susan Holmes, executive director of the Endangered Species Coalition, told ABC News. “It would essentially potentially put money over the science.”
The folks who are applauding this are the folks who would make a quick buck by destroying wetlands and wildlife habitat — the homebuilders, the real estate moguls, the big-money developers. You know, the real predators.
But what’s happened recently with the gators shows that we humans have no idea how economically valuable our wildlife can be when we preserve it.
In the blood
Biologist Kent Vliet became fascinated by gators when he first got to Gainesville. At the University of Florida, the young grad student was dispatched to study the mating habits of alligators.

To do that, Vliet traveled to the St. Augustine Alligator Farm and talked to the staff. He wanted to tag their gators so he could observe them. A staffer helped him lasso them, tie them up, weigh them, and attach an identification marker to their tails.
“The biggest one I’d ever grabbed before then was 4 feet,” Vliet said. “There were some 11-footers in there. … When we lassoed one, I’d jump on the back of the animal to restrain it and tape its jaws up.”
Adrenaline roaring through his veins, Vliet became hooked on working with gators. That was in 1980, and 45 years later he’s still at it. He’s even written a book: “Alligators: The Illustrated Guide to Their Biology, Behavior, and Conservation.”
What Vliet has been working on in the last few years struck me as particularly fascinating. He’s been collecting alligator blood for scientists studying its special properties.
Turns out gators have a superpower.
“You often see gators living in some pretty grody habitat with a huge open wound,” he explained. “Then it just heals up, and they go back to living their life.”
Their amazing healing ability comes from substances in the gators’ blood known as peptides. Scientists at George Mason University have been trying to identify those antiviral peptides, then extract and isolate them.
So far, they’ve found there could be thousands, each targeted to block a different strain of bacteria, Vliet said. Their goal is to figure out how to use those peptides to protect us humans from infections, too, including from COVID and HIV.
“And all from an animal that a lot of people wish didn’t even exist,” Vliet said.
So, say a prayer of thanks today that we saved the alligators, because now they’re likely to save us — assuming we can keep them around a while longer.
But with this proposed rollback of the laws that led to the gators’ revival, I have to wonder what we might lose if they go away again. And what other critters have superpowers that could help us if we take better care of their habitat?
Somehow, I don’t think our Circle of Life will turn out so well without them.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Visitors-look-at-gators-at-Homosassa-Springs-via-FSA.jpg,,,2025-11-27 00:56:58.083797

Each nomination will become effective if at least five of the Senate’s nine other Republicans approve them. Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, said the votes will take place by secret ballot at 10 a.m. Saturday in Anchorage.
“Honestly, I think both of them are excellent candidates,” Stevens said on Wednesday, adding that he expects both to be confirmed.
If Rauscher and Tilton are confirmed, their House seats would become vacant, and Dunleavy would be required to appoint replacements within 30 days of their resignations. 
The two Senate seats became vacant after Sen. Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, resigned to run for lieutenant governor and Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, resigned to run for governor.

Dunleavy’s picks were due no more than 30 days after their resignations, but he acted earlier, which will allow the replacement legislators to take office before the regular legislative session convenes in January.
“I can’t think of two Alaskans more qualified and committed to public service to serve in the Alaska Senate than Representatives Rauscher and Tilton,” Dunleavy said in a statement announcing the selections. “I have known and worked with both for as long as I have been in public office and I look forward to working collaboratively with them as senators. I also want to thank the local Republican district committees for taking the time to meet, deliberate, and send forward names for these seats. This process works best when the people closest to the communities are involved.”
Tilton, first elected to the House in 2014, was Speaker of the House from 2023 through 2024. Reached by phone on Wednesday in the middle of Thanksgiving shopping, she referred to a statement on her Facebook page.
“I look forward to collaborating with my Senate colleagues to advance sensible policy solutions, foster an energy renaissance, and usher in an era of renewed prosperity for all Alaskans,” the statement said in part.

Rauscher said he’s already at work on a letter thanking Dunleavy for his appointment, but he declined to say what he thinks his confirmation chances are.
“It’s an honor,” Rauscher said of the appointment, “and I feel like it was quite the undertaking — the process — and to have it this close to seeing what the final outcome is, is always a relief in some ways, but it’s also very exciting that I am this close. So I appreciate the fact that the governor did consider me and thought highly enough of me to appoint me.”
Several senators said they expect Rauscher and Tilton to be confirmed, but each declined to say how he or she will vote, citing the need to work with them regardless.
Of the nine Republican senators who will be voting on this weekend’s confirmations, five are members of the Senate’s bipartisan majority caucus, and four are members of the Senate’s all-Republican minority.
Shower and Hughes were members of the House minority, and their replacements are expected to be as well.
Stevens said he’s conducting the confirmation vote by secret ballot in order to avoid the possibility of hurt feelings.
“I don’t want to have anybody have bad feelings when we start working together in January,” he said.
Stevens said he wants to give the House’s replacement process as much time as possible, since that will involve the appointment of two people new to the Legislature who will need to hire staff and uproot their lives in order to arrive in Juneau in January and be ready to work.
“I just want to make sure the House has all the time they need,” he said.

(Source: ncleg.gov)North Carolina Republican lawmakers prevailed Wednesday on a preliminary injunction that would have blocked a 2026 congressional map redrawn to favor the GOP.
The redrawn map is GOP lawmakers’ response to President Donald Trump’s push to change voting maps across the country to help Republicans retain control of the U.S. House in 2026.
The North Carolina NAACP, Common Cause of North Carolina and a group of voters identified as the Williams plaintiffs had argued that a 2026 congressional map passed by the General Assembly last month reflects unconstitutional racial discrimination.
They alleged that changes to the 1st Congressional District dismantled a region known as the Black Belt, a region spanning many counties whose voters have elected a Black member of Congress for more than 50 years.
A three-judge panel — Fourth Circuit Judge Allison J. Rushing and the Middle District’s Chief Judge Richard Myers and Judge Thomas Schroeder, all appointed by Republican presidents — found that while the plaintiffs “have shown a disparate impact on black voters, they have not demonstrated that this effect likely reflects discriminatory intent.”
The judges determined that there was not enough evidence to provide a “clear showing” that the racial discrimination claim is likely to succeed. The new congressional map will therefore go into effect even as the lawsuit continues.
In a statement on social media, Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) took a victory lap, praising North Carolina Republicans who “went to work to protect the America First Agenda.”
“North Carolinians voted to send President Trump to the White House in 2016, 2020, and 2024, and this new map reflects that support,” Berger wrote. “President Trump deserves a Congress that will fight for American citizens and move his agenda forward. Today’s decision thwarts the radical left’s latest attempt to circumvent the will of the people.”
The plaintiffs and their attorneys said the ruling is highly damaging to democracy.
“We’re disappointed in the court’s decision today,” said Common Cause NC Executive Director Bob Phillips. “This ruling gives blessing to what will be the most gerrymandered congressional map in state history, a map that intentionally retaliates against voters in eastern North Carolina for supporting a candidate not preferred by the majority party.”
Hilary Harris Klein, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said the courts must live up to their responsibility to “protect voters and the right to dissent.”
“These mid-decade redistricting battles are tearing our democracy apart,” she said in a statement. “If politicians want to keep their majority in any legislative body, our Constitution should require them to do it by earning votes, not by silencing the voices of communities they disagree with after every election.”
The victory for Republicans stands in contrast to a recent ruling in Texas, the largest battleground over mid-decade redistricting, where Trump appointee Judge Jeffrey Brown found that “substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.” (That map, too, remains in effect after U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito paused the lower court ruling as litigation continues.)
North Carolina’s new map is expected to eliminate Congressman Don Davis (D-N.C.), one of three Black members of Congress from the state, resulting in an 11-3 Republican majority in the state’s delegation.

Thousands of Vermonters face the loss of Medicare Advantage plans and must navigate through a muddle of insurance regulations before open enrollment ends on December 7.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Medicare Advantage plans are leaving Vermont. Now what?.","Bouncing from plan to plan for Medicare coverage has become an inadvertent, annual tradition for Becky Beerwald.
When she moved to Essex Junction from the Connecticut coast in 2023, she selected a Medicare Advantage plan before it was discontinued for the following year. Then she enrolled in a Vermont Blue Advantage plan, only for the insurer to announce in October that it would not offer the plans in 2026. This fall, she went back to the drawing board but in an insurance landscape almost entirely stripped of the Medicare Advantage plans that nearly 51,000 people in the state had relied on. 
Beerwald is just one of the thousands of Vermonters trying to make sense of the coverage that remains available now that Medicare Advantage has essentially left the state.

This year’s open enrollment period for Medicare, which runs through Dec. 7, has been a “challenging one,” said Sam Carleton, who directs the State Health Insurance Program, a state entity that provides guidance for Medicare beneficiaries. The small office has been flooded with inquiries since the start of October, when BlueCross Blue Shield and United Healthcare’s departures from the Advantage market became public. Agewell, the elderly support agency Carleton leads in Northwestern Vermont has also seen a surge in interest for the webinars they offer to explain how Medicare works and how people can get the coverage they need under it.
Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people 65 and older and those with certain disabilities. 
Medicare has four parts: Part A covers inpatient care while Part B broadly covers outpatient care, medical devices and preventative care, among other things. Together, these two are regarded as original Medicare. It generally covers 80% of the cost of services, meaning many people who opt for traditional Medicare coverage also opt for something known as a Medigap plan, or supplemental insurance, sold by a private insurer that can help cover the remaining 20% of costs. 
Medicare Part D offers prescription drug coverage, which is also provided by a private insurer. 
Part C plans bundle all of that — and often include additional benefits like dental, or vision. These plans, known as Medicare Advantage plans, are offered by private insurers. 
While many people like their Advantage plans, others can feel trapped in them because they require approval before covering some drugs and services and often require people to see in-network providers.
When the insurers providing Medicare Advantage plans in Vermont announced the end to their coverage, it gave some people a welcomed exit ramp from plans that are otherwise difficult to leave, explained Kaj Samsom, the commissioner of the Department of Financial Regulation, the state office that regulates insurers.
“This event, as really truly unfortunate as it is for folks who are no longer in Medicare Advantage and no longer have other options, there are some people who are probably happy,” Samsom said.

When an insurer withdraws a plan, it triggers something called a special enrollment period, which comes with different privileges than the regular open enrollment period.
In particular, it means people searching for new plans get something called “Guaranteed Issue Rights.” These rights mean that insurance companies cannot charge someone more for their insurance based on pre-existing health conditions — things like diabetes or cancer — that would make care more expensive for the insurer to pay out. 
When someone is new to Medicare and enrolling for the first time, they are also protected from this type of underwriting. But after that initial enrollment, Medigap plans can reject or charge sicker patients more based on their health history. Samsom referred to this as the “one way street” of Medicare Advantage, where individuals can’t switch to traditional Medicare without the massive cost of a Medigap supplement plan looming over them.
Now, nearly all Vermonters who bought Medicare Advantage plans will need to opt into original Medicare, with the option to buy the supplemental Medigap plans — protected from underwriting during this special enrollment. 
The issue of underwriting became particularly concerning to Beerwald. As she scoured the best Medigap plan, she said some insurers asked for her health history, despite her guaranteed issue rights. 
When open enrollment began, Beerwald said she started calling the insurers offering the least expensive Medigap plans for 2026: Medco, State Farm and Aflac. 
Each insurer offers a selection of Medigap plans: A, B, C,  D, F, G. These letter plans are standardized, so that plans with the same letter include the same benefits, no matter which insurer sells them. Price should be the only difference. 
Beerwald said she wants a G plan because it offers the best coverage with the most diverse beneficiary pool — because of a 2015 law, people who became eligible for Medicare after 2020 can’t buy Medigap plans C or F. That restriction effectively leaves plans’ pool older. Plans D and G now offer similar coverage, without the age restriction.

“My mother lived until almost 102 my dad was 87, so I’ve got a long life ahead of me,” Beerwald said. “I don’t want to be in the older pool, I want to be in the younger pool.” 
She said she worries that as the pools under plans C and F grow older and smaller over time, their premiums will soar or the plans could disappear altogether. 
“I don’t want to be in the lurch again. I want to be in the popular plan with the popular kids,” she said. 
Insurers she found that honored the guaranteed issue rights for plan G charged higher premiums. She did notice, however, that insurers would honor these rights for C and F plans. 
Eventually, she bought a TVHP Medigap Blue Plan G from BlueCross BlueShield of VT, for about $258 per month, she said.
Still, the fact that she encountered some insurers who would not honor the guaranteed issue for every letter plan conflicted with her understanding of how the law should protect that right.
Beerwald’s quest to understand and rectify this issue offers a window onto the maelstrom that can arise when private insurers are tasked with delivering a government service. She said she reached out to the state office tasked with regulating insurers, their consumer protection line, U.S. Rep. Becca Balint’s office, SHIP and Carleton, in an attempt to make sense of it all.
“I certainly feel that frustration. I mean, you’re in a circumstance where you’ve lost your insurance, you received notice from the federal government that you are getting a special enrollment period, and you’re able to get another plan. You’ve done the legwork. … You’ve made a choice, and you then call this insurance company, those insurance companies say sure we’ll sell you a policy, but only if you send us all your medical records. That stinks,” Carleton said.  
However, Carleton and the Department of Regulation told Beerwald — and confirmed to VTDigger — that it is legal for insurers to not apply guaranteed issue rights to every letter plan. 
It comes down to one small matter of wording in the regulation that applies to Medigap plans:  “It’s a ‘must’ for (plans) A, B, C, F,” Department of Regulation Deputy Commissioner Mary Block said. “It’s a ‘may’ for G, for people before that 2020 date.” 
“So some insurance companies will offer it, some will not,” she added.  
There’s nothing the state can do to rectify this frustration, according to Block, since federal law dictates Medigap plan regulations. 
“In Vermont, we don’t have the discretion to say Plan G is always going to be available to everybody,” she said. 
Block added that other consumers have run into confusion when dealing with insurance brokers, who may not be aware of which customers are receiving guaranteed issue rights and may mix up forms. 
The best way to combat that, Samson said, is for people to advocate for themselves and make it very clear when they are on the phone that they need the guaranteed issue rights. 
Beerwald remains unsatisfied with their explanation.
Now, the only remaining Medicare Advantage plans in the state are Humana plans in six counties — including Orange, Windham and Windsor, where many of the available care comes from providers in the Dartmouth Health network. However, Dartmouth Health has long been out of network for Humana. During a Nov. 19 town hall with the Vermont congressional delegation, Balint raised particular concern over this and cautioned beneficiaries in those counties to choose new plans.
Carleton assured that even in the counties where Humana remains, if people have lost their other Advantage plan, they should still receive guaranteed issue rights for Medigap plans if they chose to buy one and opt into original Medicare. 
“What prompts the special enrollment period is your plan leaving, not necessarily the loss of all Medicare Advantage plans,” he said. 
Carleton said he worries about the overall sticker shock that comes with Medigap plans, and  fears some people will opt into original Medicare and forgo supplemental plans, leaving them vulnerable to the 20% of costs that original Medicare doesn’t cover.
Beerwald said she’s going to end up paying more than $7,500 for insurance this year. After her Medigap plan, she said she’s buying a drug plan, vision and hearing plans, as well as a dental plan, to cover the cost of extensive dental work she needs 
She said she worries not just for herself but for other older adults who are not as savvy as navigating all the pitfalls of the insurance system. But for now, she is locked in to her BlueCross BlueShield’s plan for at least a year and whatever 2026 may have in store.

(Courtesy of Washington State Budget and Policy Center)Democratic state lawmakers are once again eyeing a statewide version of a Seattle tax on companies with large payrolls and high-paid employees.
Proposed legislation crafted by Rep. Shaun Scott, D-Seattle, aims to raise more than $2 billion a year. His idea is for this money to go to education, health care and human service programs facing steep reductions in federal funding under the Republican-backed “Big, Beautiful Bill” President Donald Trump signed into law this year.
Scott will discuss his proposal at a news conference Tuesday. Representatives of the Washington Federation of State Employees, Service Employees International Union and pro-tax groups will join the first-term Democratic Socialist legislator.
His is the latest salvo — and likely not the last — in a tax debate expected to dominate the 2026 session that begins Jan. 12. 
Senate Democrats are drawing up designs for a possible income tax on millionaire-earners and reigniting talks on a so-called wealth tax that made it through the chamber on the final day of last session. All this because the state’s budget continues to face a shortfall and many Democrats are wary of going much further with cuts.
Republicans are slamming Scott’s proposal, arguing it will drive businesses from the state and hurt wages. They point to billions in new taxes Democrats pushed through the Legislature this year. 
Scott said his idea would help budget writers by making sure there is a stream of revenue to backfill what the federal government takes away.
Though there’s been some paring of federal resources already, he said action is needed this session because deeper cuts arrive in 2027 and 2028. Absent proactive measures by the Legislature, thousands of residents will find themselves facing greater food insecurity, less access to health care and higher costs for education, he said.
Scott’s legislation is modeled on Seattle’s JumpStart payroll expense tax and is similar to the approach Senate Democrats proposed this year but discarded in favor of other new taxes to help erase a multi-billion dollar shortfall in the state budget.
This year’s bill, Senate Bill 5796,  would remove the cap on employer payroll taxes and impose a new 5% tax on payroll expenses above the Social Security threshold of $176,100 per year. Companies with $7 million or more in payroll expenses would be subject to the tax. Those already paying the Seattle levy would be exempt.
Sen. Rebecca Saldana, D-Seattle, sponsored the bill, which is still alive heading into the 2026 session. As written it would raise about $2 billion a year, per a fiscal analysis.
How the new proposal would work
Scott’s bill would create the “Well Washington Fund” to “maintain the economic health” of the state, according to a draft of the legislation.
If passed and signed into law, it would take effect July 1, 2026 and generate an estimated $2.2 billion a year, Scott said.
It targets private employers whose workers earn more than $125,000 a year. It would impose a 5% tax on payroll expenses above that salary threshold. Companies with more than 50 workers, payroll in excess of $7 million and gross receipts of more than $5 million would pay the tax, he said.
Businesses may not deduct from employee wages to pay this tax. Like the Senate bill, if the firm already pays the Seattle levy, it would be exempt from this one, Scott said.
Roughly 4,300 businesses would be covered, he said. The state’s largest health care and social services providers would likely be exempt, Scott added.

His proposal directs all money collected in the first year into the general fund, the main account used to support public schools and state government operations. Starting the second year, 51% of the tax receipts would go into the Well Washington account and 49% into the general fund.
Expenditures from the new account would be limited to higher education, health care, especially Medicaid, cash assistance programs, and energy and housing programs.
A 25-member oversight board — of which 20 would be lawmakers — would be created. Its role would be to make recommendations to legislative budget committees on where money in the Well Washington account would be best spent. 

‘Wrong approach’
A top House Republican on Wednesday called the proposal the wrong approach to a serious problem and warned it could drive businesses out of state and hurt the state’s economy.
“You’re destroying your own tax base,” said Rep. Chris Corry, R-Yakima, the deputy leader of the House Republican Caucus. “If you want to incentivize businesses to pay people less money, this is it. In the long run, I think it will cost the state more than it makes.”
Corry chided Democrats’ pursuit of a new business tax so soon after enacting a raft of them earlier this year.
“There will always be a need. There will always be an excuse. The excuse this year is not that we’re spending more than we take in. It’s the Trump administration,” Corry said. “We will offer what we believe are solutions to help manage the state’s fiscal challenge without resorting to new taxes.”
Rep. April Berg, D-Mill Creek, who chairs the House Finance Committee, said Wednesday she had not seen the draft legislation. She also didn’t think it would be the last revenue bill to emerge.
“Everything’s on the table. Members are going to have lots of ideas as we enter another season of dealing with a deficit,” she said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-2-3-1024x759.jpg,,,2025-11-26 19:56:56.582595

The union has asked Washington County court to block Vermont from ordering its employees back to the office on December 1. A ruling is expected Wednesday or Friday.

Attorneys for the state of Vermont and for the Vermont State Employees’ Association argued in court Wednesday whether a judge should prevent the upcoming return-to-office mandate for state employees. 
Gov. Phil Scott has ordered state employees to return to in-person work at least three days a week starting Dec. 1. But the state employees union has fought back in multiple venues. Earlier this month, it filed charges with the state Labor Relations Board and sued the state to demand an injunction until the labor board could rule on the case.
Washington County Superior Court Justice Dan Richardson said the matter would come down to a few key questions: whether he had statutory authority to issue an injunction, and whether the mandate constituted an “irreparable harm” that required him to intervene before the board’s decision could be made.

Union attorney Alfred O’Connell said the mandate could force dozens of state employees to relocate closer to their designated work location. He gave the example of a breastfeeding mother who would be forced to commute three hours each way to work in person. 
“She would be required to breast pump, or take her child with her on a six-hour commute,” he said. 
Attorneys for the state pushed back, arguing that the state has provided a way for employees to request an exemption based on their individual circumstances. 
“That mother and many other state employees would receive careful, individualized attention, and none would be facing a Dec. 1 deadline,” state’s attorney Peter Sterling said.

The two parties went back and forth over whether the exemptions policy was sufficient to prevent the irreparable harm question. At one point, Sean Brown, deputy director of the Agency of Administration, was called to testify on the details of the exemptions. He told the court that, out of the more than 8,000 state employees, approximately 425 had asked for an exemption. So far, only 25 of those requests had been reviewed and none had been denied. 
Sterling also argued that Vermont has a public interest in ordering state employees to the office “to provide for Vermonters the services they expect,” adding that the executive branch has the authority to decide on the best use of taxpayer money.
O’Connell shot back that the state was investing millions of taxpayer dollars in reclaiming office space for in-person work. 
“The whole thing smacks of the governor being over his skis, making a decision on the fly, and now here we are trying to clean up that mess,” he said.

But Richardson said he can’t base his ruling on that aspect of their arguments. 
“I understand attorney O’Connell’s arguments and passion,” he said. “Ultimately the Labor Relations Board has to make that determination, and this court isn’t really a position of posture or proclivity to make the movement on the policy choices that the executive branch made.”
As the hearing wrapped up, Richardson said he was unlikely to grant a very broad injunction, given the legal limitations of the court’s jurisdiction. He contemplated a narrower injunction that simply prevented people with hardships from being fired while the labor board deliberated. 
“At the same time, I think it’s fair to both sides for the court to go through these arguments a little bit further,” he said.

He said he hoped to have a decision made by the end of the day on Wednesday or on Friday. 
“I recognize there are a number of individuals making plans and expectations” based on this decision, he said.

(Photo by Thomas Quinn/University of Washington, provided by the Environmental Protection Agency)Fishery biologists expect another strong year for sockeye salmon in southwestern Alaska’s Bristol Bay region, site of the world’s largest runs of the fish, also known as red salmon.
Next year’s run is not expected to equal the magnitude of the huge runs in some recent record-breaking and near-record years, however, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s preseason forecast.
The forecast, released earlier this month, predicts a return of 45.32 million Bristol Bay sockeye salmon next year, enough to support a harvest of 33.5 million fish.
This year’s Bristol Bay run totaled 56.7 million fish, and the harvest totaled 41.2 million fish. The record highs were set in 2022, when a run of 79 million sockeye salmon supported a harvest of just over 60 million fish.
If the 2026 forecast proves to be accurate, that would place next year’s Bristol Bay sockeye run below the last 10 years’ average of 61 million fish but above the long-term average of 37.4 million fish, the department said in its statement.
While the 2026 sockeye run forecast is for 45.32 million fish, the run size could be as low as 31.12 million and as high as 59.52 million, according to the department’s calculations.
The forecast is based on an analysis of the four age classes of sockeye salmon tied to Bristol Bay’s nine different river systems, past run histories and other factors. Age classes are split by years spent in freshwater and in the ocean. Bristol Bay sockeye spend one to two years in freshwater and two to three years in the ocean.
There is a caveat to the department’s preseason prediction: Forecasting salmon returns is “inherently difficult and uncertain,” said the department’s statement.
The methodology the state uses has generally worked well for the most part, the statement said, but in the past two decades, forecasts have underestimated Bristol Bay’s sockeye returns by 14% on average. Since 2014, each year’s actual return has exceeded the state’s preseason forecast.
Observed Bristol Bay sockeye salmon returns from 2006 to 2024 are compared to preseason Alaska Department of Fish and Game forecasts, with 80% intervals shown. In most years, observed runs exceeded preseason forecasts. The department has forecast a 2026 run of 45.32 million fish, with a range of 31.12 million to 59.52 million.

The percentage of international tourists to the world’s first national park has dropped by half over six years, raising questions about the new surcharge revenue.
The post New $100 fee on Yellowstone, Grand Teton’s foreign visitors brings uncertain impacts appeared first on WyoFile .","A new $100 surcharge on foreign visitors at select national parks raises a suite of questions regarding how much revenue the fees will generate, an economic consultant in Jackson Hole said Wednesday.
The Department of Interior announced the new fee Tuesday, sparking speculation about how much money it will raise and whether it might further curtail international travel to the federal preserves and the gateway communities like Jackson and Cody whose economies run on tourism.
The fee will be imposed in 2026 on each foreign visitor to Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks in Wyoming. The surcharge will also apply to Yosemite, Glacier, Rocky Mountain, Grand Canyon, Zion, Everglades, Acadia, Bryce Canyon and Sequoia & Kings Canyon national parks in other states.
Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum said the fees put American families first. Americans will continue to enjoy affordable access, he said in a statement, “while international visitors [will] contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”
Yellowstone counted 4.7 million visitors in 2024, down from a high of 4.8 million in 2021.
What impact the surcharge will have on national parks’ revenues, which individual parks retain, is uncertain, especially in light of declining international visitation. Between 2018 and 2024, foreign visitation to Yellowstone dropped from about 30% of total visitors to 14.8%, according to the park’s statistics.
“To me the interesting question is what happened between 2018-2024 that cut international visitation. Why would international visitation fall in half?” Jonathan Schechter
As President Donald Trump’s administration curtails visas, angers Canadians by proclaiming that country should become the 51st U.S. state, imposes tariffs and takes other actions, fewer tourists may want to visit the U.S., said Jonathan Schechter, an economic consultant and a member of the Jackson Town Council.
“We’re already seeing a big drop,” Schechter said, even before Trump took office. In 2018, Yellowstone attracted 1.2 million foreign visitors, he said, citing park figures. In 2024, that number was down to 712,089.
What’s going to happen, he mused about foreign tourists, if in 2026 “they’re not feeling welcome?”
$55 million for Yellowstone?
The fee, long touted by the Property and Environmental Research Council, a Montana-based nonprofit focused on environmental conservation, will boost Yellowstone’s revenues substantially, said Brian Yablonski, the organization’s CEO.
“A $100 international visitor surcharge could generate $55 million annually at Yellowstone National Park alone, more than quadrupling that park’s revenue to address deteriorating trails, failing wastewater systems, and crumbling bridges,” he said in a statement. He referenced a 2025 study by Stephen C. Newbold, an associate professor at the Department of Economics at the University of Wyoming.
“I calculated the relative changes in visits and revenues over a wide range of entrance fees using the averaged travel costs,” Newbold wrote, “which revealed that a surcharge would need to be increased beyond $200 per visitor before revenues would decline.”
The analysis probes visitors’ spending “elasticity,” which is their response to a price increase. Entrance fees make up a small portion of the money a foreign traveler will spend on a visit to America’s national parks, he notes.
Leon Mooijan and his family traveled from the Netherlands to rent a mobile home to tour Yellowstone as part of a five-week trip across the U.S. in 2022. (Angus M. Thuermer, Jr./WyoFile)
Newbold wrote that his study has limitations because it used data from 2016 and 2018 and lacked critical information from a 2024 visitor survey. Also, the words “tariffs” and “visas” do not appear in Newbold’s 23-page paper titled “The price elasticity of the demand for visits to Yellowstone National Park.”
That suggests the research stopped short of accounting for overall international tourism trends to the U.S. Additional research could develop “more robust models of international visitor demand,” he wrote.
Today, it costs $35 per vehicle to enter Yellowstone for a week. The average vehicle carries between 2.1 and 2.8 passengers, according to Yellowstone statistics. The number varies according to entrance station and season, Yellowstone’s visitor use reporting and counting instructions state.
Shechter made some calculations using Yellowstone figures and some estimates. Those include an estimated 5% visitation growth from 2024-2026 and an average of 2.5 visitors per vehicle.
Under that scenario, if the percentage of foreign visitors to Yellowstone remains at 15%, the park would see foreign entrance fee revenues increase from $9.9 million a year to $85.2 million if the surcharges are factored in.
That’s an increase of $75.2 million.
He offered other scenarios. If international visitation in 2026 drops to 8% of all Yellowstone visitors (“all” being 5% more than the 2024 total visitation figure), the new fee would generate an additional $32.6 million.
If international visitation dropped to 1% of visitors in 2026, the park would receive $5.6 million from foreigners. That would be a drop of $4.2 million in foreign visitor entrance revenue compared to 2024.
Changing trends
Elasticity aside, the huge variable that remains is whether foreigners will be discouraged from visiting the U.S. because of the Trump administration’s foreign, immigration, visa and trade policies.
“To me the interesting question is what happened between  2018-2024 that cut international visitation,” he said. “Why would international visitation fall in half?”
Was it COVID, he wondered, or a slow recovery from that pandemic? Will it be harder to get a visa to visit the U.S. in 2026? How will international visitors react to perceived American hostility toward some foreigners?
Things have changed.
Eight years ago, Schechter said, there were planeloads of visitors from Shanghai landing in Salt Lake City, loading buses and touring Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. It is much rarer to see a coach full of foreigners wending its way through Jackson, Grand Teton and Yellowstone roads today.
The affordable American national park vacation may be becoming less affordable too, Schechter said.
“Most of the consumer spending going on right now in the U.S. is coming from the ultra-wealthy,” he said. “People who are in the middle, lower [income strata] are not spending. Those are the bulk of the people visiting Yellowstone and Grand Teton.”
Lodging revenue “has been saving the bacon of the local taxable economy,” Schechter said. In Jackson, hotels have “raised their rates, and there hasn’t been pushback yet.”
If that trend continues “that just adds even more cost to the price of a vacation,” he said. “How’s that going to affect us?

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Ethics Commission dismissed complaints against Lt. Gov. Leslie Rutledge and Arkansas Secretary of State Cole Jester, both Republicans, according to documents from the commission.
Rutledge and Jester did not violate the law pertaining to campaign contribution and expenditure reports in their candidacies for the 2026 election cycle, the commission agreed. Both decisions were 4-0 votes with one commissioner absent, according to letters Ethics Commission Director Graham Sloan sent to Rutledge and Jester on Friday.
Rutledge is seeking a second and final term as lieutenant governor, and Jester is running for commissioner of state lands.
ArkLeg Bill Tracker co-founder Janie Ginocchio filed the complaints in September, alleging that Rutledge and Jester filed incomplete and inaccurate campaign finance reports.
Ginocchio also filed complaints against Attorney General Tim Griffin, state Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, and state Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, and political action committees associated with them. She alleged they all violated campaign contribution limits and prohibitions on illegal coordination of contributions, the use of public property for campaign purposes and public servants receiving outside payment for carrying out official duties.

Ray, Gilmore and Griffin all characterized the complaints as frivolous and politically motivated. The ethics commission has not yet ruled on the allegations.
Ginnochio accused Rutledge and Jester of violating the law mandating that campaign contribution and expenditure reports include the amount, date and recipients of campaign expenses over $100.
“While the original C&E reports in question include some expenditures without providing the ‘Description of Expenditure’ as requested on the report, a plain reading of [Arkansas law] does not require a description of an itemized expenditure to be provided,” Sloan wrote in both letters. “…Based upon the available facts and the applicable law, it appears the statutory filing requirements of these provisions have been fulfilled.”
Sloan acknowledged in his letters to Rutledge and Jester that since the complaints were filed, the two candidates have amended their contribution and expenditure reports for the sake of “transparency.”
The ethics commission also dismissed a complaint against Arkansas Association of Counties Executive Director Chris Villines, in his capacity as a member of the Arkansas Cyber Response Board. Ginnochio alleged that Villines failed to disclose business or holding information on a statement of financial interest for calendar year 2024.
Friday’s letter from Sloan to Villines about the dismissal incorrectly stated that the commission had issued Villines a public letter of caution. Sloan wrote in a follow-up letter on Tuesday that this language was incorrect and that he issued an amended letter with the language removed.
Sloan sent all three letters to Ginocchio in addition to the subjects of her complaints.
Jester told the Advocate he is “thankful for the role the Ethics Commission plays, not just in punishing bad actors, but in protecting good actors from inaccurate complaints.”

Abelson’s ruling comes one day after a contentious hearing in Baltimore’s U.S. District Court between the two parties over hunting — and just a few days before the popular rifle hunting season for white-tailed deer is set to begin. It runs from Saturday through Dec. 13.

In his order, Abelson argued that neither the landowners nor the power company were perfectly in the right.
The power company wanted to ban hunting on any days when surveying might occur, but noted that it would attempt to make exceptions for landowners who reached out to share their hunting plans.
They argued that a blanket ban was needed because some landowners are not communicative, and others have made violent threats toward surveyors in the past. The Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, as the proposed line is known, has attracted considerable ire from residents in its path, who have pushed hard against its construction.
But attorneys for the landowners said that PSEG routinely issues notices to property holders that it could survey any time during a two-week period. If hunting were banned during that entire stretch, landowners could lose a substantial part of the hunting season, they argued.
On that point, Abelson agreed with the landowners.
“The Court concludes that hunting should be prohibited in areas where surveyors are working while a survey is occurring,” Abelson wrote in his order. “PSEG has not shown a basis for restricting hunting on non-survey days during the notice period.”
In a statement Wednesday, StopMPRP, a coalition of opponents that includes some of the landowners in the suit, said that Abelson’s ruling shows that PSEG is overreaching.
“The Court’s clarification today makes one thing unmistakably clear: this developer is pushing far beyond what Maryland’s laws and processes were designed to allow. PSEG continues to demand access to private land for a project that the State of Maryland has not approved, forcing families to absorb the consequences long before the Public Service Commission has completed its review.
The landowners argued that Abelson shouldn’t place any hunting restrictions at all, and that for many of them hunting is not just a sport, but is a way put food on the table and protect crops from ravenous deer. They argued that surveyors should wear bright colored orange or pink hunting gear, and that PSEG should give landowners 72 hours of notice about where and when they intend to survey, to allow hunters to prepare.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Abelson determined that solution would not do enough to protect the surveyors, who have a right to complete the studies, which will inform the Maryland Public Service Commission’s final decision on the proposed power line. Abelson did, however, require surveyors to wear the brightly-colored clothing during surveys that overlap with any Maryland hunting season.
His order also requires the opposing parties to submit, by Dec. 3, either joint or competing proposals for “how to effectuate” the hunting prohibitions “including timelines and specific information each party should be communicating to one another in order to limit hunting only to the extent necessary to protect the surveyors’ safety.”
“In the meantime, PSEG should continue coordinating with Respondents who reach out to provide them with information as to minimize the intrusion upon the use of their properties,” Abelson wrote.

(Photo by txking via Getty Images)Gov. Wes Moore’s September decision to close the aging Maryland Correctional Institute at Jessup, or MCIJ, was very good news. Why?  Because the state’s 12 other prisons don’t operate at full capacity.
With redistribution of correctional officers and incarcerated individuals, a smaller Maryland prison could work much more effectively. Our current arrangement is dangerously dysfunctional.
Maryland’s criminal justice system, in recent years, has see-sawed between tough-on-crime ideas, on one hand, that expand our prisons, and smarter ideas, on the other hand, that shrink the prisons – simultaneously, helping better to safeguard our communities.
Ten years ago, Maryland’s governor and legislators agreed on an important new bipartisan plan — the Justice Reinvestment Act (JRA). Study after study has shown that mere prison time does not reduce criminal activity upon release. So, JRA’s milestone, bipartisan plan aimed to shrink the state’s prison population and spend the tax savings on prevention measures proven to cut the crime rate.
Over the next few years, state prison populations shrank 23% and our crime rate dropped. But now, in the past two years, JRA’s plan faces a serious problem.
As of December 2024, Maryland’s prison administrators reported that they cannot hire correctional officers fast enough to replace those leaving (10.8% gap or 574 officers ). Completing fiscal year 2024, the population of incarcerated individuals was rising (a 3% rise or 560 more incarcerated people).  This is progress in the wrong direction.
Why should voters care? More than 90% of those in Maryland prisons will someday return to our communities. Their recidivism or law-abidingness correlate strongly to what happens while they are behind prison walls.

Those who complete their educations with GEDs or other degrees, those who learn marketable job skills, and those who get substance abuse treatment become much less likely to commit new offenses. Our communities get safer and healthier. And our taxpayer costs for prisons get smaller as prisons shrink.
But these protective measures (school, jobs, treatment — and more) all get canceled if there aren’t enough correctional officers to accompany  incarcerated individuals to prison classrooms.  As stated in Maryland prisons’ FY’26 budget overview, “CO [correctional officer] vacancies are particularly troubling as low staffing rates contribute to inmate idleness, safety risks, and a reduced emphasis on rehabilitation.”
For example, at Eastern Correctional Institute (ECI) this summer between late June and mid-September all prison classrooms were empty and prisoners  were locked in their cells nearly 23 hours per day, due to the shortage of correctional officers — while the temperatures regularly hit 100 degrees.
ECI isn’t the only Maryland prison with such problems.
There are proven, evidence-based solutions: One prison management system, used in seven other states (“Restoring Promise”), could reduce assaults among incarcerated individuals by 90%! Correctional officer satisfaction also greatly increases where this system is adopted. But Maryland hasn’t pursued this system yet, despite invitations over several years.
Increased use of “peer mentors” — well-trained, responsible older prisoners — also could help to counsel younger ones  and reduce the burden on prison staff. And it would provide job experience for these mentors when later released.
Increased pay for correctional officers might seem to increase the budget. But, in the long run, these dollars would reduce  mandatory overtime, reduce the quit-rate of experienced correctional officers, and reduce the need to continuously train new, inexperienced ones.
Finally, and just as important, Maryland could reduce prisons’ inflow by adopting more, proven programs for diversion:

Prosecutors and courts could give priority to sentences that provide treatment rather than those that simply imprison.
Drug courts and mental health courts could be expanded to youthful and first-time violent offenders  (currently excluded) — costing less and working better than mandatory prison sentences.
Many women and youthful offenders are pulled into criminal activities by their abusers. They could be given more low-cost counseling and less expensive  incarceration.
Marylanders on parole and probation also could get more reentry help with their problems, such as finding housing and employment. That help would cost less than more years in prison.

With Maryland’s state and local elections approaching in 2026, both voters and candidates should keep in mind that “tough on crime” may not be so smart, either for public safety or for our taxpayers’ burden.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Prison-cells-for-Aug-14-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 17:57:41.380311

Thist story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Nov. 26, 2025.
As one of three men detained by immigration police in Jeffersonville on Nov. 7 was granted bond, their lawyer has been denied access to the other two men after allegedly violating Department of Corrections policy around the use of translators.
Last Thursday, a virtual bond hearing held in Massachusetts state court morning for Jeffersonville business owner Vicente Acosta Yupangui, 40, concluded with a judge allowing Yupangui to await a removal hearing at his home. On Monday, Yupangui’s lawyer Kristen Connors was back in Vermont District Court in Burlington for another hearing, this time for a second man detained in the same Jeffersonville raid, Luis Lala Inamagua.
While the hearing pertained to filings around Inamagua’s federal case, Vermont Department of Justice lawyers were also on hand representing Northwest State Correctional Facility, where Inamagua, 46, has been detained along with Alex Japon Benites, 28, a third man detained in Jeffersonville. Until recently, Yupangui had also been detained there.

Connors said she had been “banned” from the prison and was not allowed to visit her clients in-person because she had brought an interpreter to help translate for a client who was related to that translator.
Connors said she was unaware this violated Department of Corrections policy and no one at the prison checked their identification or questioned them. When she tried to schedule an in-person meeting with Inamagua last week, she said she was informed that she had been banned from Northwest State Correctional Facility and that the state had filed an ethics complaint against Connors.
Isaac Dayno, a spokesperson for the Department of Corrections, initially denied that Connors had been “banned” from Northwest State Correctional Facility and declined to share a copy of the ethics report filed against Connors.
When pressed to further clarify Connors’ denial, Dayno acknowledged that there had been “confusion around her access privileges” after a miscommunication between the department’s legal team and prison staff.
Dayno said Connors “should be cleared to enter a correctional facility to meet with a client” but warned that any accompanying interpreter would need prior clearance from the Department of Corrections as well.
“The issue was not the interpreter’s relationship to the detainee but rather the fact counsel knowingly did not disclose that relationship, which is a violation of DOC policy,” Dayno wrote. “The Department is still investigating the circumstances of this violation.”
Connors, who only learned of this clarification in the department’s policy toward her when asked about it by the News & Citizen, said she would verify this claim with the department separately, and alleged the department had initially claimed she had violated specific policies regulating prisoner visitation that she claimed she had not violated.
Roofer freed
In a virtual hearing conducted Nov. 20 through the immigration court in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, Yupangui became the first of those detained Nov. 7 in the parking lot of the Maplefields in Jeffersonville to be allowed a bond hearing.
Prior to the hearing, Connors argued in filings that although Yupangui had entered the United States outside of the proper channels, he had been an asylum seeker for over a decade. She said he is a taxpaying owner of a roofing business based in Cambridge and is the father of four children who are citizens.
At the hearing, Sarah Sawwan, a Texas-based attorney representing the Department of Homeland Security, tried to make the case that Yupangui was a flight risk, citing the fact that he attempted to flee from immigration police, as many others at the scene did, and that his original immigration to the United States being unlawful.
Julio Cortes del Olmo, the Massachusetts lawyer who represented Yupangui in immigration court, argued that the court could not prove that Yupangui was among those who had fled, and pointed to the abundance of evidence of his client’s deep ties to the Cambridge community, from his family to the many who rallied to his cause after his detainment.
Del Olmo said that Yupangui received more than 10 letters of support, which he was able to submit to the court on behalf of his client. In one of them, Alisa Anderson, an owner at Three Mountain Roofing, another Cambridge roofing company with whom Yupangui works, had paid for his legal representation and characterized him as a “hard working man.”
Judge Natalie Smith determined that the state had not successfully proven that Yupangui was a flight risk and set his bond at $5,000.
Connors confirmed that Yupangui had been released on bond to await his removal hearing, which is scheduled for early December. Inamagua and Benites had their “master calendar” hearings, the first procedural step in the removal process, rescheduled to early December as well, though Connors hopes to secure them bond hearings as well.
Of the four other state-confirmed people detained in relation to the Jeffersonville operation, three have been transferred to a family-detainment facility in Texas and another was transferred to an Arizona facility, according to advocates.

Menzies, 67, died of “presumed natural causes at a local hospital” Wednesday afternoon, according to the Utah Department of Corrections. 
Matt Hunsaker, Maurine Hunsaker’s son, said Menzies’ death “was a complete surprise.” 
“First off, I’d say that I’m numb. And second off, I would say, grateful,” Hunsaker told Utah News Dispatch. “I’m grateful that my family does not have to endure this for the holidays.” 
Hunsaker continued, “It’s over. It’s over.”

Menzies had been scheduled to be executed by firing squad earlier this year, on Sept. 5. As the date drew closer, his attorneys argued his dementia had worsened. He had been diagnosed with vascular dementia, caused when the brain’s blood flow is disrupted, leading to memory loss and declining cognitive function, according to court testimony.
A state evaluator says Ralph Menzies is too ill with dementia to be executed

The Utah Supreme Court court called off the execution roughly a week before it was scheduled to take place. The justices found there was enough evidence to warrant another competency evaluation. 
A judge was scheduled to consider new reports from psychologists who evaluated Menzies in recent weeks during a multi-day court hearing that had been scheduled to start Dec. 9. Ahead of that hearing, a forensic psychologist said in an evaluation that Menzies was “not competent to be executed.” That report was one of several that were to be considered by a judge.  
Menzies killed the 26-year-old Hunsaker nearly four decades ago after kidnapping her from her job at a gas station in Kearns. He tied her to a tree in Big Cottonwood Canyon, strangled her and slit her throat, prosecutors said. She was found by a hiker days later.

The alliance of unions and school districts also added a major disability rights advocacy group to its ranks in the amended complaint that detailed how the department’s Nov. 18 announcement of six interagency agreements could harm students.
The agreements to transfer several Education responsibilities to four other departments drew swift backlash from Democratic officials, labor unions and advocacy groups, who questioned the legality of the transfers and expressed concerns over the harms that would be imposed on students, families and schools as a result. 
“Scattering Department of Education programs among agencies with no expertise in education or lacking key agency infrastructure will reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs and will prevent the type of synergy that Congress intended to achieve by consolidating federal education activities in one cabinet level agency,” the coalition, represented by the legal advocacy group Democracy Forward, wrote in the amended complaint. 
The expanded suit asks for declaratory and injunctive relief against what it describes as the administration’s “unlawful effort to dismantle the Department of Education,” pointing to the interagency agreements, mass layoffs at the department earlier this year and implementation of an executive order that called on Education Secretary Linda McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department.  
The Education Department clarified in fact sheets related to the agreements  with the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services and State that it would “maintain all statutory responsibilities and will continue its oversight of these programs.”
Axing the Education Department
Trump has sought to take an axe to the 46-year-old department, saying he wants to send education “back to the states.” Much of the funding and oversight of schools already occurs at the state and local levels.
The original lawsuit, filed in March in Massachusetts federal court, was brought by the American Federation of Teachers, its Massachusetts chapter, AFSCME Council 93, the American Association of University Professors, the Service Employees International Union and two school districts in Massachusetts. 
The Tuesday filing adds The Arc of the United States, an advocacy group for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, as a plaintiff. 
Earlier this year, the case was consolidated with another March lawsuit from Democratic attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin.  
“It’s no surprise that blue states and unions care more about preserving the DC bureaucracy than about giving parents, students, and teachers more control over education and improving the efficient delivery of funds and services,” Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the department, said in a statement shared with States Newsroom.
Supreme Court temporarily greenlit Trump plan
In May, a federal judge in Massachusetts granted a preliminary injunction in the consolidated case, blocking the administration’s efforts, including a reduction in force effort at the agency that gutted more than 1,300 employees, Trump’s executive order calling on McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department and a directive to transfer some services to other federal agencies.
A federal appeals court upheld that order in June, prompting the administration to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. 
The nation’s highest court in July temporarily suspended the lower courts’ orders, allowing the administration to proceed, for now, with those dismantling efforts.

A recently released trove of thousands of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s emails offer glimpses into his time in New Mexico, including the prominent people he invited to his home here and when he scheduled visits. 
The United States House Oversight Committee released more than 20,000 pages of records earlier this month amid a renewed push to share with the public more about the disgraced financier with longstanding ties to elected officials, business leaders and celebrities, including Former President Bill Clinton and President Donald Trump. 
That release included more than 2,000 thousand emails Epstein exchanged between 2009 and 2019. Several dozen mention New Mexico or related phrases, according to Source New Mexico review, including in news articles or from Epstein himself.
Epstein bought a 7,500 Santa Fe-area property called Zorro Ranch from former Gov. Bruce King in 1993.It was sold at an undisclosed price in 2023, four years after Epstein’s death in custody awaiting federal sex trafficking charges.
According to court documents, the ranch, which has its own airstrip and helipad, was the site of sex trafficking, including by Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 as Epstein’s co-conspirator.
The emails show Epstein invited prominent figures—none of whom have been accused of any crimes associated with Epstein— including author Deepak Chopra, linguist Noam Chomsky, billionaire Tom Pritzker, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and filmmaker Bill Sieger, to his ranch at various times. It’s unclear from the emails whether any of those people took him up on his offer, though one email from Epstein to Chomsky asks if he wants to “visit again.”
The emails also show Epstein scheduled visits to the area, including for about two weeks in August 2016 and between Feb. 24 and March 1, 2017, following visits to New York and Paris. 
Trump signs bill requiring DOJ release of Epstein files

In addition to the emails, other released documents mention former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, including an excerpt of a draft article about Epstein, which Semafor confirmed came from journalist Michael Wolf. In the excerpt, Wolff recounts asking Richardson at lunch how he knew Epstein. 
“Jeffrey,” Richardson replied, according to Wolff’s telling, “is the biggest landowner in New Mexico.
In addition to efforts by Congress to release more Epstein files, two New Mexico state lawmakers have announced plans for a truth commission that will seek to document abuses and gather testimony from victims, witnesses and perpetrators in a series of public hearings. 
Reps. Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) and Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) told an interim legislative committee in early November that the commission will cost about $2 million, with funding from an untapped revenue source dedicated to helping victims of sex trafficking. Lawmakers from both parties said they approved of the commission and urged the lawmakers to follow leads wherever they take them. 
Two New Mexican attorneys general have opened previous investigations into Epstein’s activities in the state: Hector Balderas’ criminal investigation in 2019 closed within the year without filing any charges. In 2023, current Attorney General Raúl Torrez investigated the role financial services companies played in failing to identify the abuses at the ranch.

During this time of gratitude, all of us at VTDigger want to say thank you. Thank you for reading, for sharing your tips and perspectives with us and for supporting a newsroom that works every day to help Vermonters understand the world around them. Your trust is the reason we can keep doing this work.
Thanksgiving also reminds us how many neighbors may be experiencing the holiday very differently. Food insecurity has continued to rise in Vermont since 2020. The Vermont Foodbank now distributes 25 percent more food each year than it did before the pandemic. Federal funding changes have already impacted nutrition programs and food assistance access for refugees and asylum seekers. With the recent government shutdown, many food pantries faced a renewed surge in need. Looking ahead, up to 14,000 Vermonters could lose food benefits in 2026 when new federal laws take effect.
Our recent reporting underscores how quickly policy changes ripple into daily life and how urgently many Vermonters need clear information and strong community support.
This is why we partner with the Vermont Foodbank each Thanksgiving. Our job is to explain the systems that shape life in Vermont and to ensure those most affected are heard. The Foodbank’s job is to make sure our neighbors have enough to eat. Together, we can raise awareness and support Vermonters.
If you are able, there is still time to help send 3 meals to a Vermonter in need through our Thanksgiving Drive. Your gift also strengthens the reporting that sheds light on wealth, poverty and economic inequality at a time when many people are navigating real uncertainty.

Give today and send 3 meals

Most of all, thank you for being part of this community. Whether you give, read, send a tip or share our stories, you help make independent local news possible in Vermont.

Every week, two local newspapers close somewhere in the country. Some 50 million Americans have limited to no  access to local news. That may increase with loss of public media funding. 
What is the future of journalism in an age where truth itself is under attack? 
Local news is essential because “that’s where rebuilding confidence in facts and truth starts,” said VTDigger editor in chief Geeta Anand. We spoke at a public event at the Manchester Community Library on Nov. 11. 
“If you’ve actually gone to a meeting and seen a story based on it and met the reporter and it actually seems the article matches what you heard, then you begin to disbelieve the discrediting of journalism that is happening, led by the leaders of our country, which is having a devastating effect on our democracy.”
Anand’s career as a journalist and author spans the globe. Her stories on corporate corruption in the Wall Street Journal earned her a Pulitzer Prize in 2002, and she was a finalist again in 2003. Her book, “The Cure,” about a father’s fight to save his kids by starting a company to make a medicine for their untreatable illness, was made into the 2010 movie, Extraordinary Measures, starring Harrison Ford. She was a foreign correspondent for The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal in India. 
Anand’s roots in journalism are in covering local news. She worked at Cape Cod News and then covered local government and courts at the Rutland Herald. In 2018, she became a professor at the UC Berkeley journalism school, where she was dean in 2020. She was at Berkeley until taking over leadership of VTDigger in July 2025. 
Anand spoke about how local journalism is a critical link in the information ecosystem. “Our coverage right now of immigrants getting picked up and spirited off to other parts of the country — that’s the way the world finds out that these things are happening. Our stories get picked up by national media, and the national media hold our national leaders accountable. We matter to you here in Vermont, but we’re also a key part of the web of national and international news.”
Anand said that for community and democracy to function, it is critical to support local news. “If we aren’t vibrant, if we’re not there at the city council meeting or at the school board meeting and telling those stories, government isn’t held accountable.

(U.S. Geological Survey Alaska Science Center photo)After the remnants of Typhoon Halong devastated communities in Western Alaska last month, you might have been jolted into remembering that forces beyond our immediate control govern the planet. A combination of wind, gravity, planetary rotation and uneven heating of the Earth’s surface can result in destructive storms and, in worst-case scenarios, a tragic loss of life.
While we’re right to be gravely concerned about climate change in Alaska, we can also appreciate that the powerful natural phenomena operating around us are often simply doing the quiet work of keeping our ecosystems humming — by transporting water, nutrients and atmospheric gases from place to place. The result is a bountiful suite of ecosystem services: fish and game that fill our freezers, vibrant landscapes for recreation and spiritual renewal, foundations for Indigenous culture and the economic engines of fishing and tourism. 
In Southeast Alaska, a coastal temperate rainforest flourishes with help from natural phenomena such as warm ocean currents, mid-latitude wind patterns and mountains. Though the combined effects are easy to see — towering trees and waters brimming with seafood — their machinations often appear invisible to the human eye, operating on scales too vast or microscopic to detect… until we look deeper to find what’s hiding in plain sight. Consider the following:
Tectonic motion. Over millions of years, tectonic motion — the shifting of the Earth’s crust — has helped shape a mosaic of aquatic habitats in Southeast Alaska. Picture rivers and streams gushing down mountainsides or meandering lazily across valley floors. Five species of salmon thrive in this mosaic today, with populations often genetically tuned to their particular habitat. Genetic diversity among salmon populations means higher species survival rates in a changing climate.
Glacial ablation. It’s no secret that glaciers in many parts of Alaska are melting. Glacial melt, also called ablation, is a culprit behind dangerous outburst floods and global sea-level rise. But there can be a flipside. In the transboundary Taku River watershed, for example, ablation is driving a massive ecosystem transformation with new salmon-accessible habitat emerging in pro-glacial streams. Scientists believe these waterways could begin housing Pacific salmon in as little as 15 years. As salmon habitat shrinks in other watersheds on the West Coast, glacial ablation in many Southeast Alaska ecosystems is expanding it.
Big tides. The Stikine River Delta is a major Pacific Flyway stopover for migrating shorebirds, possibly due to nutrient-rich biofilm on its mudflats. These oozing banks are expansive due to big tides that lay bare a spacious coastal table and invite famished birds to gather. While data shows that shorebirds are imperiled by habitat destruction elsewhere, they still find refuge in the Stikine where high-quality food and migratory habitat are on offer when ocean margins vanish into the distance.
Variable light conditions. Are you a seafood lover? If so, thank a rainforest cloud. In Southeast Alaska, coastal waters are often in flux when it comes to the availability of sunlight, and that could be helping fish build necessary fat stores. Research shows that variable light conditions, which can affect photosynthesis in addition to water temperature, salinity and, most crucially, nutrient levels, might be an on-switch for the production of essential fatty acids in diatoms, jumpstarting a food web that supports salmon, black cod and other species rich in omega-3 oils.  
Hydrogen bonds. The Southeast rainforest is full of water — in obvious places like rivers and streams, but also in less obvious ones such as soil and vegetation. Due to hydrogen bonds, water can absorb large amounts of energy with only a small temperature increase. The result is a sweeping heat sink that cools the surrounding environment, especially when massive conifers undergo the daily process of evapotranspiration which pulls moisture vertically through the landscape. Requiring no electrical outlets or utility bills, this natural air conditioning system is provided free of charge.
In Southeast Alaska, a host of natural phenomena keep the ecosystem — and its human communities — humming. People do their part for the ecosystem, in turn. Indigenous citizens bring traditional knowledge to natural resource management, like that of Pacific herring. Other problem-solvers work to ensure cruise-ship tourism is more sustainable by promoting a switch from heavy fuel oil to cleaner marine gas oil. 
Want to do your part, wherever your ecosystem may be? Start by simply seeing the world you inhabit a little differently. Whether it’s a receding tide, a mercurial cloud or the tremblor beneath your feet, the powers around you are invisible only until you take a closer look.

The Minnesota Society of Professional Journalists condemned law enforcement attacks on journalists during Tuesday federal operation in St. Paul.
Federal authorities took a person into custody in St. Paul in the 600 block of Rose Avenue East, Sahan Journal reported. A crowd of demonstrators showed up, as well as journalists to document the scene.
In a statement, SPJ said three photojournalists — all clearly identified as press with badges and/or vests and carrying their equipment — were hit by “less-lethal” munitions used by St. Paul police. One was taken to the hospital in an ambulance.
St. Paul police used chemical irritants liberally, according many people at the scene and confirmed by photos.
Kerem Yücel, with MPR News, was hit in the shoulder and was transported to a hospital by ambulance; he was released and is recovering. Tim Evans, a freelance photojournalist with Reuters, was hit in the stomach with a pepper ball round. Aaron Nesheim, a photojournalist with Sahan Journal, was struck in the head with a pepper ball round. Evans and Nesheim did not require hospitalization.
The three journalists told SPJ that they believe they were targeted by law enforcement.

“Photojournalists are on the frontlines of documenting history and it is imperative that they are kept safe and their First Amendment rights are protected,” SPJ said in the statement.
SPJ said it is seeking answers from St. Paul city leadership.
St. Paul police Chief Axel Henry issued a statement on YouTube asserting that a “dangerous situation was unfolding” causing officers to engage.

“The City of Saint Paul Separation Ordinance 44.01 is clear that Saint Paul Police officers will work cooperatively with all federal agencies, but that Saint Paul Police officers do not enforce federal immigration laws.”
The statement continued: “Saint Paul Police officers stood between protestors and federal agents, so protestors could express their First Amendment rights and federal agents could complete their legal objectives. During these events, officers used chemical irritants. As with any use of force that occurs, the Saint Paul Police Department will be completing a comprehensive review of the entire incident.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/R2A0683-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 18:57:40.336638

At left is Justice Douglas Bahr; at right is Chief Justice Jon Jensen. (Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Supreme Court Justice Daniel Crothers will retire from the bench on Feb. 28.
Crothers has served on the court since he was appointed by then-Gov. John Hoeven in 2005. He was then elected to an unfinished term in 2008, and 10-year terms in 2012 and 2022.
He announced his retirement in a Wednesday letter to Gov. Kelly Armstrong.
Crothers’ letter does not state the reason for his retirement.
“Justice Crothers has faithfully served the citizens of North Dakota and applied the laws of our state with the utmost dedication, fairness and professionalism for over two decades,” Armstrong said in a Wednesday statement. “His respect for the litigants who appear before the Supreme Court, as well as the separate-but-equal roles of the executive and legislative branches of state government, have been a hallmark of his years on the bench. ”
While justices are ordinarily elected, vacancies are filled by appointment of the governor.
Armstrong will soon convene a committee to put together a list of candidates for appointment, according to the Governor’s Office.
2 seek position of North Dakota Supreme Court chief justice

The members of the nominating committee include Justice Jerod Tufte, Eric Lahlum, Taylor Olson, Laura Mihalik, Paul Forster, Toby Kommer and non-voting member Tony Weiler, executive director of the North Dakota Bar Association.
Once the list is received, the governor can either choose someone to appoint, reject the list and ask the committee to reconvene or call for a special election to fill the seat.
Before joining the Supreme Court, Crothers served as an assistant state’s attorney for Walsh County and worked in private practice. He chairs North Dakota’s Committee on Judiciary Standards.
Crothers’ retirement comes after Chief Justice Jon Jensen announced he would step down as head of the court. Justices Lisa Fair McEvers and Tufte are running to succeed him in the role. Jensen will remain a justice.

Source: Screenshot/DeSantis FacebookNearly two months after calling for the elimination of vaccine mandates from Florida statutes, the DeSantis administration announced it will hold a three-hour public meeting in Northwest Florida for the public to weigh in.
The Department of Health has scheduled the meeting in Panama City Beach on Dec. 12 to discuss changes to  the existing rule regarding vaccine requirements for public and private schools, from preschool through grade 12 as well as adult education classes.
While the DOH announced a meeting date and time it did not release a draft of any of its proposed changes.
Health care attorney and lobbyist Chris Nuland predicted the meeting will be well attended.
“Despite the state putting the notice for a workshop in the most remote corner of the state, there will be several doctors who will be attending that workshop to argue for the existing rule,” said Nuland, a Jacksonville lobbyist whose clients include the Florida Chapter of the American College of Physicians Services; the Florida Chapter, American College of Surgeons; and the Florida Neurosurgical Society, among others.
Students who attend public and private schools are required by Florida law to be vaccinated for poliomyelitis, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus. The statute allows the DOH through rule to require additional vaccinations, which it does.

DOH’s rule allows exemptions for valid medical reasons but also for religious and certain belief systems.
Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced in September their desire to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida statutes, although their focus, for now, appears to be school-aged children.
DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

Ladapo, a  long time vaccine skeptic, likened vaccine requirements to slavery and told those attending the press conference that the government lacks authority to require vaccinations.
“It’s wrong, it’s immoral,” he said at the time. “They do not have the right to tell you what you put in your body. They don’t have the right to tell you what your kids have to put in [their] body. They do not have the right. Do not give it to them. Take it away from them. And we’re going to be starting that here in Florida.”
The announcement made national headlines and was immediately blasted by top Democrats. Even some Republicans have distanced themselves from the idea.
The 2026 regular session begins Tuesday, Jan. 13. To date, the DeSantis administration hasn’t floated its legislative proposal to eliminate all vaccines from statutes.
Meanwhile, Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith is pushing a proposal (SB 626) to amend statutes to include hepatitis B, chickenpox, haemophilus influenzae type b, and pneumococcal disease in the list of required vaccines in statutes.

Jeff Landry's administration plans to reopen the Jetson Center for Youth in Baker (pictured above) in April. The juvenile justice facility was shut down over a decade ago. (Photo by Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator) Louisiana officials plan to reopen a youth prison in April that was shuttered over a decade ago when it was declared inappropriate for young people. 
The state Office of Juvenile Justice plans to move 36 incarcerated youth to the old Jetson Center for Youth in Baker after some minor upgrades to buildings on the site. The interim facility is expected to help with overcrowding in the state’s youth prison system, agency undersecretary Jason Starnes said. 
“We desperately need some relief with our bed capacity issues,” Starnes told state lawmakers at a budget hearing last week. 

The long-term plan for the Jetson site is to replace the existing facility with a brand new youth prison complex that will house up to 72 children and teenagers. It is expected to cost close to $70 million and would open during the 2027-28 state budget year. 

In the meantime, the state will renovate existing buildings at Jetson to accommodate a dormitory, cafeteria, laundry facility and classrooms for the 36 youth who will arrive in the spring.

The money to make those buildings inhabitable will come from the budget for the new Jetson construction, said Matt Baker, director of the state Office of Planning and Facility Control, at the budget hearing. He did not say how much will be spent on the rehabilitation. 
“We’re going to do some cleaning up,” Baker said. “But essentially, we are doing as efficient of a renovation as possible so we can retain as much budget as we can for the new facility.”
Once the new building is opened, the state plans to tear down all the existing facilities on Jetson’s campus, Baker said.

When Jetson was closed in 2014, Gov. Bobby Jindal’s staff described it as old and obsolete. Some Jetson buildings had first opened in 1948 and were not conducive to the therapeutic setting the juvenile justice system was trying to embrace at the time. 

State officials also justified Jetson’s closure by saying it was difficult to secure because its campus is large and buildings are spread out over several acres. 
More recently, Louisiana used Jetson as its temporary women’s prison for nine years. The state hastily moved its incarcerated women to Jetson in 2016 after the women’s prison in St. Gabriel flooded and became unlivable. They were moved out of Jetson earlier this year when a new women’s prison opened at another St. Gabriel site. 

Advocates for incarcerated women complained about the condition of Jetson while the women were housed there, but juvenile justice officials say they intend to use a different building. 
Still, Starnes admitted most of the facilities at Jetson are in bad physical shape. 
“A lot of the facilities are very aged. [The buildings] are in very poor condition,” he said last week. 

Legislators are also concerned about the impact to the surrounding communities. When Jetson was open, breakouts happened frequently and surrounding neighbors experienced waves of crime from the facility. At the time, the facility housed hundreds of incarcerated youth. 
State Sen. Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, said she is concerned about new residential developments that under construction near the Jetson site. 
 “We have to be good neighbors to the people we are going to be next to,” Barrow said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PXL_20220503_223316263-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-26 16:57:39.947065

(Photo via Getty Images)The worst part of the information age is not everyone having access to everything going on in the world. It’s that everyone feels like they have to have an opinion on it all.
It’s as if the constant barrage of insane news flying at our faces 24/7 is making us all feel like we have an obligation to be keyed in to everything going on in the world. Of course, being informed is important, but so is having normal conversations about normal human things that don’t involve debating the fundamentals of humanity.
Thanksgiving is uniquely primed for those types of nausea-inducing conversations, and you might be prepping how you’re going to redirect your racist uncle right alongside the turkey.
I am proposing, instead, 24 topics of conversation that will be much more fun to discuss, reveal new and interesting depths to the relatives you see twice a year, and (hopefully) ensure no one will leave the dinner table crying and blocking everyone on Facebook.

Greet everyone with an uncomfortably long hug, like, it’s really weird that you’re hugging them for so long, why are you doing that, please let go, and see who the first person is to ask if you’re doing okay.
Share a small moment from your life that delighted you recently.
If you were a Thanksgiving dish, which would you be and why?
Do you think this life is the first time you’ve been on Earth?
Which sibling will be the best at taking care of Mom and Dad when they start to turn senile?
Say three nice things about Mom (or whoever took the lead in planning Thanksgiving, which, let’s be honest, is likely a mom).
What’s the best new song you listened to recently?
Which NFL position do you think you could play?
Which of your grandparents would you be least surprised to learn had an affair in 1972?
Reveal one bad thing you did in high school that your parents never figured out (those under 18 in attendance are excused from participating).
How was NASCAR almost as big of a sport in America as the NFL in the late 90s and early 2000s and what would it take for them to reach that level of popularity again? (This is a specific request from my husband and also a test to see if he reads my stuff)
If the entire family was stranded on an island, who would be sacrificed for food first?
Share one thing you’re thankful for.
Share one thing you’re not thankful for.
Share your most embarrassing moment from elementary school.
Do you think aliens have pets?
What’s the most evil thing one of your siblings did to you when you were children?
What are the top 5 best Christmas movies?
If you had to choose a different woman in your family to be your mom, who would you choose?
Which cousin’s ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend was your least favorite and why?
What’s your favorite book you’ve ever read?
Set a timer for five minutes and everyone make a sincere attempt at writing a poem. Then share all poems, slam-style, and the winner gets first choice of leftovers to take home.

A jury convicted Lunsford in February, but a judge called for a new trial in October. (File photo /Source NM)As a former Las Cruces police officer previously convicted for killing a Black man accused of stealing a beer awaits a possible new trial, his ankle monitor will remain on.
In 2022, Las Cruces Police Officer Brad Lunsford responded to a 911 call that alleged someone had stolen a beer from a gas station convenience store. Lunsford attempted to arrest 36-year-old Presley Eze as bystanders filmed the interaction with their cellphones. Lunsford, who had been involved in prior police shootings, alleged that Eze grabbed his Taser during the struggle. Lunsford drew his service weapon and shot Eze once in the back of the head.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez first filed criminal charges against Lunsford in late 2023. The filing marked the first time in nearly a decade that a police officer anywhere in New Mexico had faced criminal charges for a fatal shooting — the most recent instance was the trial of Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez, the Albuquerque officers who in 2014 killed James Boyd in the Sandia Foothills. Their case ended in a mistrial.
The Eze killing led Southern New Mexicans to be “rightly concerned about whether or not justice is equal in this country,” Torrez said when he announced the criminal charges in 2023.
A jury convicted Lunsford in February of this year.
In October, though, Sixth Judicial District Judge Jim Foy ordered a new trial, which has yet to be scheduled. Foy said he had inappropriately substituted two alternate jurors and dismissed two regular jurors before deliberations began because at the time the court was using a form that incorrectly listed which jurors were alternates. 
Foy also said that newly discovered evidence showed one juror held anti-cop bias. Upon his decision, the National Police Association went so far as to publish the headline, “Did an Anti-Police Activist Lie to Get on the Officer Brad Lunsford Jury?”
Torrez pushed back. His New Mexico Department of Justice in October appealed Foy’s decision to the state Court of Appeals and argued that the juror’s answers to pre-trial questionnaires, which included a disclosure about affiliation with the Southern Poverty Law Center, did not seem to alarm Lunsford’s attorneys at the start of his criminal trial. The juror’s academic works about race in early education and parenthood and podcast appearances are all easily accessible by a simple Google search of the juror’s name, lawyers with Torrez’s New Mexico Department of Justice argued.
Foy’s call for a new trial “set aside the jury’s finding of guilt (that) has devastated Presley Eze’s family and further undermines the public’s faith in New Mexico’s criminal justice system,” Torrez said in an October statement. “The presiding judge…has repeatedly mischaracterized the factual record, improperly weighed in on the strength of the state’s case and committed numerous procedural errors that prejudiced the prosecution.”
Torrez’s department filed its arguments in appeals court earlier this month. A decision remains pending.
On Nov. 21, Foy denied Lunsford’s request to modify the conditions of his release, which sought to remove his requirement to wear an ankle monitor and to post a $10,000 bond, pending the appellate court’s decision.
“Our goal in the new trial is to ensure Officer Lunsford receives a fair proceeding before an impartial jury that hears all of the evidence and correctly applies the law,” Lunsford’s attorney Matt Chandler wrote in an email to Source NM. “We remain confident that, in a fair trial, the evidence will show that Officer Lunsford’s actions were lawful, that he was protecting his own life and the life of his fellow officer from a violent, aggressive attack by the suspect, and that he should be acquitted.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716-182348-0aa-Attorney-General-Raul-Torrez-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 16:57:39.947065

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Two members of the West Virginia National Guard were shot while on deployment in Washington D.C. on Wednesday, according to a statement from Gov. Patrick Morrisey.
The condition of the two members was unknown as of 4:15 p.m.
Morrisey initially posted on social media at 3:33 p.m. that one of the victims was dead and another sent to the hospital following the shooting. He then announced at 3:42 p.m. that both members of the West Virginia National Guard were dead. 
In a third post at 4:04 p.m., however, Morrisey said he was receiving “conflicting reports” about the condition of the West Virginia National Guard members.
“… [The state] will provide additional updates once we receive more complete information,” Morrisey continued.
The shooting took place blocks from the White House. According to the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, the scene was secure and one suspect was in custody at 2:58 p.m.
President Donald Trump was in Florida on Wednesday but was briefed on the shooting, White House officials said. In social media posts, Trump said the perpetrator was an “animal” and was “also severely wounded” in the incident. Regardless, he continued, the shooter will “pay a very steep price.”
“God bless our Great National Guard, and all of our Military and Law Enforcement,” Trump said. “These are truly Great People. I, as President of the United States, and everyone associated with the Office of the Presidency, am with you!”
The shooting comes less than a week after a federal judge ruled that the deployment of National Guard troops from several states to Washington, D.C. at the request of Trump was illegal. The Trump administration was given until Dec. 11 to pull troops out or file an appeal to the ruling. 
Morrisey announced in August that he would be sending 300-400 members of the West Virginia National Guard to Washington D.C. after Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the nation’s capital. That declaration ended in September, but troops have remained in the district.
In late September, a spokesperson for the state’s National Guard said members could remain in D.C. through November.
Earlier this year, the West Virginia Citizen Action Group filed a lawsuit against Morrisey and the West Virginia National Guard regarding West Virginia troops being deployed to D.C. CAG was represented by the West Virginia arm of the American Civil Liberties Union.
The ACLU attorneys argued that the deployment by Morrisey was unlawful and an abuse of state powers that allow the governor to activate National Guard troops for matters outside of the state only under limited circumstances. They said the ongoing deployment was causing real and irreparable harm to people in West Virginia.
Attorneys for the state of West Virginia countered that CAG, the plaintiff, was not facing any real or clear harm from the deployment. The only parties who could claim to be “directly harmed” due to the National Guard deployment, the state argued, are residents of D.C. or members of the Guard themselves.
Attorneys with the ACLU were asking the court for a temporary injunction that would have seen all West Virginia National Guard members deployed to D.C. sent home.
On Nov. 10, Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Richard Lindsay sided with the state of West Virginia and dismissed the case, meaning troops remained in D.C.

Haley Stevens speaks at the Michigan Democratic Party's nominating convention in Lansing on Aug. 21, 2022. (Andrew Roth | Michigan Advance)Reports that the Big Ten Conference could sell a stake of its media rights to a private equity group have led Michigan U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) to send a letter to the conference’s commissioner stating her opposition to the deal and requesting additional information. 
Publicly reported details show the Big Ten would sell 10% of its media rights to UC Investments, a group affiliated with the University of California system pension fund, for $2.4 billion.
The conference roster includes the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, University of Illinois, Indiana University, The University of Iowa, University of Maryland, University of Minnesota, University of Nebraska, Northwestern University, The Ohio State University, The Pennsylvania State University, Purdue University, Rutgers University, University of Oregon, University of California Los Angeles, University of Southern California, University of Washington, University of Wisconsin.

In her letter to the conference commissioner Tony Petitti, Stevens warned the deal would be a “dangerous expansion of private equity influence over our nation’s universities, harming the quality of college sports and the integrity of university governance.”
The influence of wealthy non-university interests has already created issues for college sports, Stevens said, pointing to the role of television networks in eliminating the regional nature of conferences through realignment.
The deal would open the door for other conferences to seek investment from private enquiry groups, Stevens said, arguing it would further undermine regional cohesion. She also warned that giving private investment firms control of sports television revenue would create undue influence over university decisionmaking.
Big Ten member universities should be focused on their mission to educate and prepare young people for fulfilling and productive lives instead of maximizing television revenue in partnership with wealthy financial institutions.
Stevens requested Petitti respond with an answer to the following questions by Dec. 12. Stevens asked if a conference media rights agreement is reached, how will the commissioner  ensure that UC Investments, or any subsequent private equity investor, will not impact the independence and internal governance of member universities? 
She also asked if a conference media rights agreement is reached, how will the commissioner ensure that efforts to promote large revenue-generating sports does not come at the expense of support for Title IX and non-revenue sports that have provided a path to college and meaningful experiences for generations of students? 
The representative further asked if an agreement is reached, how will the commissioner ensure confidence amongst athletes, students, faculty, staff, alumni, and the local communities of member universities that the profit seeking motives of UC Investments, and any subsequent private equity investors, are not superseding the overall public serving mission of Big Ten member universities?",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AMR1000-311-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 16:57:39.947065

(Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Corrections)SIOUX FALLS — A prosecutor apologized this week for the state’s failure to preserve evidence in a case involving an overdose death in a state prison. 
The state of South Dakota wants to convict the inmate charged with providing the drugs, Manarion Fuse, of a crime that could keep him behind bars for the rest of his life.
Fuse is accused of giving drugs to Anthony Richards, who died of a drug overdose in February at the South Dakota State Penitentiary’s Jameson Annex. Fuse, who appeared in court via video link on Tuesday, maintains his innocence.
During the hearing, Assistant Attorney General Ryan McFall told Minnehaha County Judge Jon Sogn that the state never measured the quantity of the drug present in Richards’ system before it concluded that he’d died by overdosing on it.
The prosecutor also admitted, with an apology to the judge, that it no longer has videos of the visits where Fuse was allegedly given the drugs he was later indicted for distributing inside the prison.
“It was supposed to have been preserved,” McFall said of the video evidence, adding, “There is not a good answer as to why it was not.”
Case the first of several tied to ‘K2’
Fuse’s case is among several tied to an uptick in the circulation of synthetic drugs, referred to colloquially as “K2,” inside South Dakota’s prisons.
Overdose deaths, gang violence draw charges in some — not all — recent prison incidents

Seven people are believed to have died of overdoses this year in the state’s custody. K2 is suspected or confirmed as a cause of death in at least five of them, starting with Richards, who died on Feb. 6 at the age of 20.
Fuse, 22, went to prison last year for the unlawful discharge of a firearm. He’s serving a 10-year sentence, with three years suspended. Given his prior convictions, he could be sentenced to life if he’s found guilty of distributing a substance resulting in death.
Questions key to Fuse’s defense involve the drug’s concentration in Richards’ body, the source of the K2 involved, and Fuse’s contention that the drugs came from other inmates or Department of Corrections staff members.
Fuse’s court-appointed attorney, Minnehaha County Deputy Public Defender Kylie Beck, said Tuesday that her client “is adamant that he is not the person who provided the drugs” that killed Richards.
Video visits
The state has alleged that family and friends gave Fuse the K2 during visits, Beck told the judge.
Beck said she expected the state to be able to prove as much with videos of those visits, which she’s asked to review. In response, McFall said he also expected the videos to be preserved, but that there’s little he can do about it now.
“They do not exist at this time, and cannot be provided,” he said.
The Department of Corrections did not respond to a South Dakota Searchlight request for comment on the videos.
On the issue of testing for the amount of K2 in Richards’ system, Beck said the reports she received indicate only that the drug was present.
“I believe quantity is critical if the allegation involves an overdose in which a person was killed,” Beck said.
McFall said no such “quantitative” tests were performed at the time of Richards’ autopsy, repeating a line he’d use several times during the half-hour hearing:
“We’ve turned over what we have.”
Inmate points finger at staff
Beck has twice requested reports about six current or former state employees who worked inside the prison “regarding their possible involvement and/or knowledge” of the drug distribution tied to Richards’ death. 
Beck was given reports showing that those staff members responded to the Richards overdose, but said Tuesday she was looking for reports that might support her client’s contention that they were known to be “dirty” staff.

At least one of the staff members no longer works for the state, according to South Dakota Searchlight reviews of the state’s salary database.
McFall said the state had provided all the incident-related reports that mention the staff members. He’s not aware of any reports accusing the staff of drug-related misbehavior, and said he’s “not aware of any authority” that would grant Fuse access to any reports on those staffers beyond those created in relation to Richards’ death.
But, he added, “to my knowledge at this time, no reports investigating those individuals exist.”
Judge Sogn told Beck there’s no way he can order the release of reports that don’t exist, but said the state must produce them if they emerge.
Phone calls, inmate safety checks
Beck also wanted to know the dates attached to “about 20” recorded phone calls placed by other inmates on Fuse’s unit in the run-up to Richards’ death.
Beck said she needs to know the dates to determine if any talk about drugs captured on those calls can offer insight on the source of the drugs circulating at the time.
High prison death toll continues after 33-year-old man found unresponsive in cell

McFall said the dates were not part of a “bevy of answers” delivered in October from the state. At this point, he said, the case’s lead investigator is out on maternity leave and might not be able to help for a few weeks.
Judge Sogn told McFall the information ought to come earlier than that.
“There has to be at least one person at the penitentiary” who can provide the dates and times for the calls, Sogn said.
The judge also told McFall to seek out more details about the cell checks performed on the day of Richards’ death. Thus far, Beck said, she’s received information on how often cells ought to be checked, but no records to show that those checks took place — or didn’t — on the day Richards died. 
The judge gave the state until mid-December to deliver the remainder of deliverable evidence to Fuse’s attorney. The case is scheduled for trial on the week of Jan. 26.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4256-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 15:57:36.036454

(Photo by John McCosh/Georgia Recorder)The preliminary injunction against the state’s social media ban on minors won’t last, an appeals court concluded this week. 
Two judges on a three-judge panel told the state Tuesday it may begin enforcing a 2024 law that prohibits young Floridians from using social media while litigation plays out. 
“HB3 is now the law of the state and will be enforced. We’re putting all big tech companies on notice: endanger our kids and find out what happens!” Uthmeier posted to his personal X account Tuesday, posting on his official account that his office “will aggressively enforce this law.”
In June, a federal district court judge granted a preliminary injunction against enforcing the law. It had previously denied a request for preliminary injunction before the social media giants amended their complaint. 
Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit halted the preliminary injunction. 
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier (via Department of Legal Affairs)
“Another win on appeal, this time upholding Florida’s protections for kids against predatory social media companies. We put parents and kids first!” Gov. Ron DeSantis posted to his personal X account. 
The law, a focus of former House Speaker and now candidate for governor Paul Renner, passed in 2024 and prohibits Floridians younger than 14 from having social media accounts on platforms that deploy “addictive features.” The law, which scored bipartisan support, also requires parental consent for youngsters age 14 and 15 to have accounts on those same platforms.
The circuit court majority, comprising Judges Elizabeth Branch and Barbara Lagoa, both Donald Trump appointees, said the attorney general has made a “strong showing of a likelihood of success.” 
Largely an argument of First Amendment infringement, the majority opinion and and a dissent written by Judge Robin Rosenbaum, a President Barack Obama appointee, conflict on whether the law should fall under strict or intermediate First Amendment scrutiny. 
The state has argued that the law does not prohibit the use of social media, instead just apps that use addictive features like “infinite scrolling,” push notifications or alerts, “personal interactive metrics” regarding likes or shares, “auto-play video,” and “live-streaming.” The circuit majority agreed, conflicting with the district court ruling. 
Platforms, upon notification from a minor’s parent, must terminate a minor’s account, the law requires.
The suit was filed by NetChoice and Computer and Communications Industry Association.  Proceedings will continue over the merits of the law itself.
NetChoice represents Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, YouTube, Pinterest, Google, and other tech giants. CCIA also represents Facebook and Instagram, Google, Pinterest, and others.
“NetChoice is disappointed in the Eleventh Circuit’s ruling allowing Florida’s censorship law to take effect while Florida continues to appeal our injunction. Briefing has finished, and we look forward to the opportunity to explain the law’s constitutional problems to the Court directly,” Paul Taske of NetChoice said in an online statement. 
“We will consider all available options to ensure Floridians’ online communication is safe and free. Florida’s censorship regime not only violates its citizens’ free speech rights but also makes all users — especially minors — less safe.”
The majority wrote that the law is “likely content neutral” and satisfies the intermediate scrutiny test. 
“The Attorney General is likely to show that the legislature chose the regulation it did, not because it is easier than alternatives, but because it is the most effective way of achieving its interest,” Branch wrote. 
“It is unlikely that HB3 inappropriately curtails any First Amendment rights. And the compliance costs plaintiffs might incur do not outweigh the State’s interest in enforcing its lawful regulation,” Branch wrote.

Dissent
In a lengthy dissent, Rosenbaum said the law is “plainly unconstitutional under the First Amendment. In fact, it’s plainly unconstitutional on its face.”
Rosenbaum finds it to be content-based, which would put it under strict scrutiny as opposed to intermediate scrutiny. The absence of  streaming services like Hulu and Disney+ in the lawsuit but the inclusion of other social media platforms signal that the law is content-based, Rosenbaum wrote. 
“The Act directly regulates expression in at least two ways. First, the Act inserts the state of Florida into users’ decisions about whether and how to speak online,” Rosenbaum wrote. Second, is that the law “interferes with the platforms’ editorial choices about which users can join the platform and about what content to display to those users.”
Rosenbaum points to the majority classifying age verification as imposing a “modest” burden on adult speech when it requires providing personally identifiable information.
“And to be sure, for adult users who seek to engage in online speech that Florida state officials and their political allies would approve of, the burden may be ‘modest.’ But for everyone else — especially those who wish to express dissatisfaction with Florida politics and officials — the Act’s disclosure requirements impose a heavy burden.” Rosenbaum wrote.
Rosenbaum invoked the parental empowerment movement in contesting the law.
“We should be wary of governments supplanting parents in deciding which ideas children should and should not be exposed to,” Rosenbaum wrote.

National Guard were on high visibility patrols in the area of 17th and I Street Northwest when a suspect came around the corner, raised his arm with a firearm and discharged at the National Guard members,” MPD Executive Assistant Chief Jeffery Carroll said. “There were other (National Guard) members that were in the area. They were able to, after some back and forth … subdue the individual and bring them into custody,” Carroll added. “Within moments, members of law enforcement in the area were also able to assist and bring that individual into custody.”Carroll said there were no other suspects at the time of the press conference, in the early evening, and that law enforcement officials had reviewed video footage from the area where the shooting took place. “It appears, like I said, to be a lone gunman that raised the firearm and ambushed these members of the National Guard, and he was quickly taken into custody by other National Guard members and law enforcement members,” he said. The guardsmen were armed, but Carroll said investigators had not yet determined if they shot back or how the suspect, whom he did not name, was shot. “At this point, we're still investigating exactly who shot the individual. It's not clear at this time,” he said. Officials were also not yet sure “what kind of weapon” the suspect used during the shooting, which Carroll said “happened right in front of the Metro, although there is no indication that the perpetrator was on the Metro.” The Metro is the district’s public transit system.Bowser reiterated during the press conference that the two National Guard members were in critical condition and referred to the shooting as “targeted.”

Pat Pettey, a Democrat from Kansas City, Kansas, questions the process of selecting a company to implement a $10 million gun-detection program in public schools. The initiative began as a 2024 request by a Pennsylvania technology company for an exclusive service contract in Kansas. In this image from April 10, 2025, Pettey offers remarks in the Kansas Senate. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature’s special budget committee revealed the attorney general’s office continues to work toward awarding a $10 million contract to a private vendor for deployment of artificial intelligence and use of security cameras to spot gun-wielding intruders in public schools.
Gov. Laura Kelly signed a budget bill in April that included funding for technology that promised to identify unconcealed firearms in school buildings so alerts could be forwarded to school staff and law enforcement officers. In October, three companies submitted bids through the Kansas Department of Administration. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Kris Kobach said a contract hadn’t been issued.
Under state law, the attorney general’s office was directed to make certain the system was installed in schools by the end of December and operational at the close of February.
Sen. Pat Pettey, a Democrat from Kansas City, Kansas, said the initiative was embraced by the Legislature at the same time a popular program offering state-funded school-security grants to districts was dropped.
“We no longer have funding in the Department of Education for safe and secure schools,” Pettey said. “But we do have this funding source … but nothing has been appropriated? Schools would like to have safe and secure funds, but they don’t have any option now except through this program.”
Bids on the Kansas firearm-identification contract were submitted by Gades Sales Co. of Wichita; CIS Data Services of Springfield, Missouri; and ZeroEyes of Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. Financial details of those company proposals haven’t been made public.
The idea of relying on AI to pinpoint unconcealed weapons in schools and possibly thwart mass shootings has been debated in Kansas since ZeroEyes hired lobbyists last year to convince legislators to award it the contract to operate an enhanced security system for benefit of Kansas schools.
Lobbyists for ZeroEyes pitched the idea of directly earmarking state funding to ZeroEyes or establishing contract provisions matching ZeroEyes’ marketing materials so rival venders would have difficulty landing the contract.
Kieran Carroll, chief strategy officer for ZeroEyes, told a Kansas House committee in February 2024 that covering 1,300 school buildings in Kansas with ZeroEyes’ technology and delivering 24-hour monitoring of two dozen cameras in each school would cost the state $8.5 million annually.
In May 2024, Gov. Laura Kelly used line-item authority to veto the budget measure dedicating $5 million to a gun-identification initiative that favored ZeroEyes. The bill limited dollar-for-dollar matches from the state to school districts that signed up with ZeroEyes.
The governor said the result would have been “a no-bid contract” that wrote ZeroEyes’ technology into state law without proper consideration of alternative companies.
The Republican-led Legislature responded during the 2025 session by authorizing expenditure of $10 million for a firearm-detection program available to all Kansas public school districts. This version of the AI funding plan wasn’t vetoed by Kelly and led to the ongoing contract bidding process.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100560-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-26 15:57:36.036454

(Photo by Megan Varner/Getty Images)The North Carolina State Board of Elections voted Tuesday to begin verifying voters’ citizenship status, as federal officials pursue a similar national plan.
The board voted to partner with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and share the state’s voter rolls with the federal government’s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements or SAVE database. According to DHS, the database was created to help states check for eligibility for benefit programs, but some states are using it to verify voter citizenship as well.
“This is one of the few tools available to us to check for noncitizens on our voter rolls,” executive director Sam Hayes, a Republican, said in a news release Wednesday. “We are pleased to follow the letter of the law outlined in North Carolina’s Constitution and to make clear that elections are reserved for U.S. citizens.”
Under state law, the state board would send reports on residents’ voter registration and citizenship status to county boards of elections. Counties would then be required to notify voters by mail within a month and, if they do not object, remove them from the voter rolls.
County boards will be required to flag any noncitizens removed from the voter rolls within the state database.
Critics of the SAVE database have warned of possible mismatches and incorrect information in it, as well as other hiccups that could lead to people being improperly removed from voter rolls.
The decision from North Carolina’s board comes as the Trump administration seeks to construct its own verification program. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is seeking access to an obscure computer database used by law enforcement officials, while also demanding that states share copies of their voter files with personal data, Stateline has reported.
But the national plan has garnered fierce opposition among civil rights advocates who argue that it would effectively create a national source of personal information on American voters.
North Carolina’s voter rolls already undergo cross-checking as officials remove voters who move out of the state or die. But Republicans, who recently took a majority on the state board, have pushed for further scrutiny and regulation, specifically on citizenship status.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Black-voters-Getty-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 15:57:36.036454

(Photos by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh hit back Wednesday at a top New Jersey legislator’s effort to weaken his office’s investigative powers, calling it a “scam” that will allow corruption to flourish unchecked.
Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) introduced a bill Monday to transfer the comptroller office’s investigative and subpoena powers to the State Commission of Investigation, and the bill is scheduled to be heard by a legislative committee Monday morning in Trenton. Walsh told reporters Wednesday the measure is designed to keep the public and Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill from “continuing to go after corruption in our state.”
“It is designed to undermine an extraordinarily effective watchdog agency. It is designed to reduce the power of the governor to address corruption, especially at the local level. It is designed to shut down ongoing investigations we are involved in,” he said.
Tensions grow between state watchdog and the pols under his scrutiny

The State Commission of Investigation already has investigative and subpoena powers, Walsh added.
“So that just shows, really, what a scam the entire concept of the bill is,” he said.
Walsh’s investigations into public fraud, waste, and abuse have tormented officials at all levels in New Jersey, driving critics to demand that state lawmakers muzzle a watchdog that reformers revere as one of New Jersey’s most effective guardians against government misconduct.
Critics’ demands for a comptroller crackdown started early last year, Walsh said. He finds that timing notable.
In December 2023, he issued a report that rebuked public payments made to several Scutari associates, including Edward Oatman, who was Scutari’s chief of staff before he was appointed Union County manager in 2018.
Walsh’s investigators found that Union County improperly paid several top officials, including Oatman, more than $400,000 in stipends and tuition reimbursements. Walsh recommended that the county work to recover the improperly paid funds, institute a corrective action plan, and be more transparent in such payments. Instead, state lawmakers moved to loosen compensation rules for county officials, although that legislation subsequently stalled.
“There is a discomfort that comes with being the subject of a report where you’re called out for doing something wrong. But our democracy is supposed to be strong enough to handle that sort of truth,” Walsh said. “I can’t speak to Sen. Scutari’s motivations in particular based on that report, but the timing is noteworthy.”
Oatman did not respond to a request for comment.
Scutari’s bill also would put legislators in charge of appointing the chair of the State Commission of Investigations, more than double the part-time commissioners’ salaries, and give the commission’s chair the authority to seek a wiretap in cases involving misconduct by state Department of Law and Public Safety employees. That department houses the state police and the Attorney General’s Office.
Walsh pushed back on all of those provisions. He called the pay hikes wasteful and said shifting appointment authority for the commission’s chair to the Legislature would politicize an oversight agency whose independence should be fiercely protected. Right now, the governor names the commission’s chair.
“We don’t do wiretapping right now. That’s a law-enforcement power, and this would seemingly, with little or no checks, grant SCI that power,” he said.










It is designed to undermine an extraordinarily effective watchdog agency.


– Acting comptroller Kevin Walsh


Scutari, who is the highest-ranking state legislator as Senate president, did not respond to a request for comment.
His bill says it aims to eliminate “overlap” in the two watchdogs’ missions and that the comptroller’s “core work … will continue unabated.”
Walsh disputed those claims too, saying the agencies have had no conflicts because they “generally try to stay out of each other’s way.”
He added: “Our core powers right now include the power to investigate public corruption.”
The office gets hundreds of tips of public corruption and waste a month, Walsh said. He cited multiple examples of major investigations his office has done that would have been impossible without investigative and subpoena powers, including exposing a police training firm’s controversial teachings, oversight lapses that led Essex County to pay millions to ghost employees carrying out its pandemic vaccination work, and the misuse of opioid settlement fund spending in Irvington.
Besides investigations, the office, which has about 130 employees, also audits public agencies, reviews public contracts, and oversees the Medicaid program. The comptroller’s office would continue that work under Scutari’s bill.
The bill is set to be heard at 10 a.m. Monday before the Senate’s state government committee at the Statehouse in Trenton. Advocates from the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey plan to join Walsh in testifying against it.
“It does a lot of damage in a moment where there is heightened distrust of government. We need more watchdogs, not fewer,” said Amol Sinha, the group’s executive director. “The idea that there is too much oversight in New Jersey is just false and disregards what people want to see, which is politics and governance that are uncorrupted.”
The police accountability work Walsh’s office does, alone, is reason why policymakers should preserve its investigative and subpoena powers, Sinha added. Walsh’s office has investigated police traffic enforcement and racial profiling, the police practice of “courtesy cards,” and lapses in public reporting of police misconduct, among other things.
“Since we cannot rely on the federal government to engage in consent decrees or pattern and practice investigations the way they once used to, we need all of the support that we can get at the state level to conduct that oversight, and it’s all the more important that we have an effective Office of the State Comptroller that can hold state police accountable,” Sinha said.
The feds have dropped oversight of and investigations into several troubled New Jersey police departments recently, including Newark and Trenton.
Walsh is almost six years into his term, but doesn’t expect he’ll serve much past Jan. 20, when Sherrill takes over from Gov. Phil Murphy. New governors typically install their own people.
But he said he’ll fight hard against Scutari’s bill anyway to protect both the comptroller office’s in-progress probes and its mission of protecting public integrity and taxpayer money.
“I’m thinking of this both as impacting the ongoing investigations that have started under my leadership, and additionally impacting whoever leads the office, prospectively,” he said.
He said he hasn’t spoken with Sherrill, Murphy, or the commission’s leaders about Scutari’s bill, but added it would be “pretty extraordinary” if Murphy signed it. Tyler Jones, a Murphy spokeswoman, declined to comment.
“No governor should permit what is occurring here, which would be hamstringing, undermining, the executive branch from policing itself,” Walsh said. “We all have an obligation to protect the important institutions of our government.”

The lawsuit claims that beginning in January 2024, City Administrator Phil Rath and Human Resources Director Barb Codjoe began making disparaging remarks about a particular council member during weekly department head meetings.
Rath, the lawsuit claims, speculated that the council member had dementia or some other impairment, and Codjoe questioned whether the council member could complete his term of office. Simonson claims he was disturbed by the remarks and attempted to redirect discussions toward proactive engagement with the council.
In late 2024, the city conducted an internal investigation into an anonymous complaint allegedly filed against Simonson but did not inform him of the nature of that investigation.
According to the lawsuit, on Dec. 19, 2024, Simonson filed a formal complaint with the city, alleging the city’s finance director had brought a bottle of Crown Royal Canadian whisky to a city meeting in violation of the city’s zero-tolerance policy on alcohol. Days later, the city allegedly placed Simonson on a performance improvement plan.
In February 2025, Simonson informed Rath that he planned to notify the Ottumwa City Council he was a finalist for the Oskaloosa city manager position while informing the council he was unhappy about the performance improvement plan and an allegedly hostile work environment.
The lawsuit alleges Rath urged Simonson not to reference the performance improvement plan, but Simonson did so anyway.
In March 2025, Simonson was still working for the City of Ottumwa — the City of Oskaloosa had hired another individual as its city manager — when, the lawsuit claims, he spoke to Landfill Supervisor Lori Creech regarding the landfill being closed without his authorization. In his lawsuit, Simonson alleges he spoke to Creech in a professional and respectful manner, but Creech later claimed he was “screaming and rude” to her.
The city then fired Simonson, alleging gross misconduct related to the conversation with Creech.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for alleged violations of the Iowa Veterans’ Preference Act, violations of Simonson’s due process rights and First Amendment rights, and retaliation for whistleblowing.
The city has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, and a trial date has yet to be scheduled.

According to DHS, the investigation began Nov. 17 after an off-duty Norfolk police officer overheard the men discussing plans to “kill police officers and ICE agents.” Authorities say Mark Bennett also talked about meeting “likeminded individuals” in Las Vegas to buy firearms equipped with explosive rounds.
Mark Bennett was arrested Nov. 19 at Norfolk International Airport before boarding a flight to Charlotte en route to Las Vegas. That same day, federal agents arrested John Bennett in Virginia Beach, where he has worked as assistant principal at Kempsville High School since 2009.
Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin emphasized the severity of the allegations, noting that a school administrator is among the accused. 
“It’s chilling that a human being, much less a child educator, would plot to ambush and kill ICE law enforcement officers — offering such specifics as to getting a high caliber rifle that would pierce the law enforcements’ bullet proof vests,” McLaughlin said. She credited Homeland Security Investigations and local police for quickly intervening.
DHS highlighted what it described as a sharp rise in violence targeting ICE employees, pointing to internal figures showing “a more than 1,150% increase in assaults” and an “8,000% increase in death threats” in recent years. 
McLaughlin said officers have faced bounties placed on their heads, threats to their families, stalking and doxxing.
Federal authorities did not say whether the brothers were connected to any organized extremist group. Both men were charged under Virginia law with conspiracy to commit malicious wounding. Court dates have not yet been set.
The case echoes other recent incidents in which immigration authorities have been targeted. 
On July 4, authorities say a group of suspects launched a coordinated attack on the Prairieland ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Tx., using fireworks as a diversion before opening fire on responding officers; the FBI later arrested 10 of 11 alleged participants, who now face local terrorism charges, according to ICE and federal court documents.
More broadly, judges and federal agents have reported increased online threats tied to political grievances, according to data and analysis from the Brennan Center for Justice and its research partners.
DHS did not release possible motives in the most recent case, and court filings have not yet been made public. The agency said only that the Virginia Beach Police Department and local law enforcement assisted in the investigation and arrests.

Content warning: This story contains graphic depictions of violence.
Tuesday, Nov. 11, should have been an ordinary workday for 20-year-old Amber Czech, who worked as a welder at a manufacturing facility in Cokato, Minnesota.
She loved her craft and taught welding at her old high school on days she had off. But she was also a rarity. Women make up just 6% of welders in the country, and, as with other male-dominated occupations, it came with the risk of isolation and bullying.
It was a reality of the job that for Czech turned deadly. While she was at her work station that day, a man she worked with walked over to her, picked up a sledgehammer and bludgeoned her to death. He later told law enforcement he simply did not like her and had been planning to murder her for some time.
As the news spread across social media, stories poured in on Instagram and TikTok from tradeswomen expressing their anger and frustration. Over the last week they have shared their own experiences of working with men who threatened them, made sexual advances or joked about their incompetence. They pondered how their story could have ended differently, how their life could have ended like Czech’s.
Angie Cacace, a carpenter from North Carolina, was one of those women who was deeply saddened by Czech’s death. “It hit me pretty hard. I probably have cried about it every day,” she said. “I’ve had altercations with men on job sites so I know that exists.”
Despite the issues she’s faced in the industry, Cacace loves the work and credits carpentry with helping her buy her first home. Now she operates a successful remodeling company.
In 2019, she co-launched a media company and, more recently, a magazine called Move Over Bob, aimed at showing the possibilities of tradeswork to girls in high school and community college. Only about 4% of tradesworkers are women, but if they can find their way into the field, the jobs, which do not require a degree, offer middle-class wages, pensions and other benefits that are often not available in women-dominated industries like caregiving or the service industry.
But Czech’s death has Cacace questioning the workplace she’s urging girls to enter.
“She did everything that we want these girls to do. She did a high school welding program. She went to a community college,” she said. “It’s just a sharp reminder that there’s just a lot of work to do and figuring out how to better advocate and make sure that these young women are safe.”
Czech’s death has opened up a wound that never really closed for tradeswomen. In 2017, 32-year-old Outi Hicks, an apprentice carpenter, was murdered at her workplace by a coworker in Fresno, California. Her death sparked similar outrage and helped spur programs like the “Be That One Guy” campaign, which includes training for bystander intervention in the workplace.
“But there’s a whole host of incidents that have occurred between the Outi Hicks horror and what just transpired,” said Rita Brown, president of the National Association of Women in Construction (NAWIC). “Change has been slow, and clearly it’s not enough.”
Instagram posts from tradeswomen across the country share reactions to the killing of Amber Czech, honoring her and calling attention to safety issues in the trades. Editor’s note: Comments have been blacked out to protect commenters’ privacy.

In 2023, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) published a report detailing the harassment women and people of color continue to face in the construction trades. It included accounts of sexual harassment like groping and lewd comments, as well as racist incidents. In 2021, a survey conducted by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research found that more than a quarter of women tradesworkers who responded said they were “always or frequently harassed” for being a woman.
While there are several programs developed by women and trades organizations to promote a safer and more inclusive workplace, there is no real federal policy or legislation that provides adequate protections, advocates say. Instead the work has happened at the grassroots level.
Now organizations like NAWIC are calling for construction companies, unions and the industry as a whole to enforce stricter workplace standards. “It is incumbent on all of us that are in leadership, that are in any kind of place of power in the ecosystem of the construction industry, to enforce this zero-tolerance policy,” Brown said.
The Tradeswomen Taskforce, an advocacy group, plans to draft a resolution, which they want these same organizations to adopt, that promotes a safe workplace for women.
Amy Roosa, who works in risk control for the construction industry, said that workplace violence should be treated as a safety hazard. “It’s a ticking time bomb at the end of the day that this is going to happen to a woman,” she said. “It’s really up to the leadership team and even safety professionals to treat this like a workplace hazard.
“We need to have an intervention process. We need to have clear reporting. A woman needs to know that when she comes up and says, ‘I have a concern’ or, ‘He’s threatening me,’ that it’s taken seriously,” she added.
At the same time that tradeswomen are urging more to be done to address gender-based violence in the workplace, the Trump administration has curtailed resources.
Last fall, the Tradeswomen Taskforce and Equal Rights Advocates, a nonprofit focused on gender justice in workplaces, won a $350,000 grant to address gender-based violence in the workplace. The Trump administration abruptly canceled the program, alongside four other grants that aimed to eliminate violence and harassment in the workplace.
Part of the work would have involved helping women navigate how to file complaints or lawsuits, something that is difficult to do on a worksite because they either don’t know the proper channel to elevate a complaint or could face retaliation, said Janelle Dejan, co-chair of the task force. “Things that we do in these advocacy organizations is try to create a safer space,” she said. This includes a place where people can report anonymously or without being ridiculed for having a concern, she said.
Other safeguards that were in place to help women report abuse are no longer functioning, according to Connie Ashbrook, also with the task force. “The EEOC has been squelched,” she said.
Up until October, it didn’t have enough commissioners to issue decisions because the Trump administration fired two of the Democratic commissioners and the general counsel. One of those commissioners, Charlotte Burrows, wrote the report on women’s harassment in the trades. That report has also disappeared from the EEOC’s website.
“It just feels like, at the same time, that we’re really digging deep to work on this problem, the government is taking tools away from us,” Ashbrook said.
In the days since Czech’s death, tradeswomen from across the country have rallied in support, donating thousands of dollars to her family’s GoFundMe and wearing blue to work in her honor.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA Fulton County judge has dismissed the case against President Donald Trump and a group of alleged co-conspirators accused of attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.
Judge Scott McAfee’s dismissal marks the end of the last criminal case facing Trump related to that year’s election. Peter J. Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, requested the dismissal after concluding the case belonged in federal court.
Skandalakis named himself prosecutor in the case this month after he said he could not find another attorney willing to take the case from embattled Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.
A Fulton County grand jury indicted Trump and 18 co-defendants in 2023, but Willis was removed from the case in 2024 amid questions of a conflict of interest stemming from a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor she hired for the case.

Four of the alleged co-conspirators pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against Trump and the other defendants.
Skandalakis did not express sympathy with the view, still espoused by Trump and allies, that the 2020 election had been stolen or rigged.
“Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, millions of citizens and hundreds of politicians continued to make unsubstantiated claims of election fraud,” he wrote. “In response, the Secretary of State undertook extensive audits to verify the vote count and demonstrate that no substantial voter fraud had occurred. Yet, despite these efforts and the evidence confirming a fair election, many individuals continue to believe—and may never be convinced otherwise—that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.”
Trump and the phone call
In a Wednesday motion asking McAfee to drop the charges, Skandalakis called the case unprecedented and noted that bringing a sitting president to trial in Georgia is unrealistic.
“The case is now nearly five years removed from President Trump’s phone call with the Secretary of State, and two years have passed since the Grand Jury returned charges against President Trump and the eighteen other defendants,” Skandalakis wrote.

A recording of a phone call with Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in January 2021 captured Trump pressing Georgia’s top election official to “find” enough votes to secure a Trump victory in Georgia.
“There is no realistic prospect that a sitting President will be compelled to appear in Georgia to stand trial on the allegations in this indictment,” Skandalakis continued. “Donald J. Trump’s current term as President of the United States of America does not expire until January 20, 2029; by that point, eight years will have elapsed since the phone call at issue.”
Skandalakis said that even if Trump were to face trial immediately after leaving office, arguments over presidential immunity alone would tie the case up for months or years, with no guarantee the state would ultimately prevail.
Skandalakis called the phone call “concerning,” but he said it is not a smoking gun, arguing that reasonable minds could disagree on whether Trump was calling on Raffensperger to create fictitious votes or investigate fraud that Trump sincerely but incorrectly believed was real.
“When multiple interpretations are equally plausible, the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt and should not be presumed to have acted criminally,” Skandalakis found.

Skandalakis did not state whether or not he believes Trump committed crimes in his efforts to overturn the election, but he said Georgia was not the best venue to determine that.
“Elections, particularly presidential elections, are intensely contested events,” Skandalakis wrote. “All too frequently, some campaign staffers, attorneys, and supporters genuinely believe that the nation’s future is at stake if the opposing candidate prevails. Political rhetoric to mobilize voters serves a purpose, but the efforts by President Trump and his legal advisors to obstruct the counting of electoral votes on January 6th lie at the core of this case. This is also why Special Counsel Jack Smith’s federal investigation and prosecution would have been the most appropriate avenue to determine whether the actions of those involved were crimes that could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”
U.S. Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith dropped that federal election interference case as well as a case alleging Trump mishandled classified documents after the president’s 2024 re-election because he concluded it would be illegal to continue prosecuting him after taking office.
Trump’s attorney, Steve Sadow, celebrated the decision to dismiss Fulton County’s case Wednesday.
“The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified DA Fani Willis is finally over. This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare,” Sadow said.
The Fulton County District Attorney’s office did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday.
The other defendants
Skandalakis said he considered severing the other defendants from the case and prosecuting them separately from Trump, but concluded that would be “both illogical and unduly burdensome and costly for the State and for Fulton County.”

The alleged conspiracy included a wide range of acts, from a meeting of “alternate” electors who met at the state Capitol with plans to certify a false Trump victory, a harassment campaign against Fulton County election worker Ruby Freeman and the breach of elections systems in Coffee County.
Skandalakis said his examination of the case suggested the alternate GOP electors did not have criminal intent to overturn the election. He had already come to a similar conclusion last year about then-state Sen. Burt Jones, who is now lieutenant governor, after his case was splintered off.
“They genuinely and sincerely believed that their actions were a lawful component of the election contest process. Thus, I find no criminal intent concerning the meeting of the Republican Electors and their plan to preserve an election challenge by casting their ballots for President Trump,” Skandalakis wrote.
With regards to the Coffee County breach, Skandalakis noted that attorney Sidney Powell and bail bondsman Scott Hall, who he called “the primary architect of the scheme” and “a principal accomplice” were among the defendants who pleaded guilty, and Skandalakis argued that pursuing charges against small-fry defendants like former election supervisor Misty Hampton and Coffee County GOP Cathy Latham chair would not be in the state’s interest.
Skandalakis called Freeman, the Fulton County poll worker who faced harassment and intimidation, “a genuinely sympathetic figure in this matter.” But he said the defendants accused of harming her did not do so in Fulton County and that the alleged crimes against her should be prosecuted in neighboring Cobb County, where Freeman lived at the time.
Because of a measure passed this year, the defendants in the case may be able to force Fulton County to cover their legal costs. The new law allows criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs if the prosecuting attorney in their case is disqualified for personal or professional misconduct.
Reaction
Josh McKoon. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The dismissal could prove a divisive conversation topic across Georgia Thanksgiving tables. Reaction to the news was split along party lines, with Republicans expressing gratitude for the decision and Democrats calling it an outrage.
“Today, as Chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, my heart swells with profound relief, unyielding gratitude, and a fierce sense of vindication for our brave patriots who have endured this dark chapter far too long,” said Georgia GOP chair Josh McKoon in a statement. “Pete Skandalakis, Executive Director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, has done what justice demanded: dismissing this sham, politically weaponized criminal case against President Donald J. Trump, (former) Georgia GOP Chairman David Shafer, and our steadfast contingent of 2020 Presidential Electors.”
Charlie Bailey. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Georgia Democratic chair Charlie Bailey had the polar opposite view.
“The dismissal of this case is a travesty and a slap in the face to Georgia voters,” Bailey wrote in a statement. “Donald Trump and eighteen others, including sitting State Senator Shawn Still, were indicted by a grand jury for attempting to illegally overturn our state’s election. Multiple of their co-defendants pled guilty. This misguided decision denies the people of Georgia the accountability they deserve for Trump and his cronies’ attempt to subvert their votes and silence their voices.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s child care assistance program is accepting new applications following months of campaigning by advocates who said more parents need the assistance, a move state officials said should extend aid to 75,000 children.
Human Services Commissioner Sarah Adelman said opening the program to new applicants comes with the goal of allowing applications for new children in January. Families who fall into the program’s priority groups and who complete registration in December will have the first chance to apply, she said. 
“For most New Jersey families, child care isn’t a luxury, it’s a necessity,” Adelman said in a statement. “The child care assistance program is a vital economic lifeline that helps pay for high-quality early childhood education and allows parents to continue their careers. That is why reopening applications to maximize utilization for this program is so important.” 
The program aims to help parents afford child care if they are working, in school, or in job training. Because of a $30 million funding gap that state officials attribute to increasing enrollment and shifting federal policy, the program paused applications in August. Copays for families enrolled in the program also rose after lawmakers passed a budget without enough money to cover the program’s operating costs. 
Earlier this month, advocates sent a letter to Gov. Phil Murphy, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, and legislative leaders urging them to increase funding for the program in the short term and to find a permanent solution to ensure child care is more affordable. 
The first priority groups include families with children from households with very low income or who are experiencing homelessness, and families with children who have special needs. Not everyone who falls into these groups will be granted assistance. 
According to 2024 U.S. Department of Labor data, families in New Jersey spend 7% to nearly 20% of their median family income on child care services. In some counties, that’s more than $16,000. 
Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex) commended the state’s decision to reopen the program to new applicants, calling it a “victory for the vitality of our families, our early childhood workforce, and our state.” 
“Child care is not just a service; it is a central cog in the system that supports our labor force, children’s academic attainment, and broader economic development,” she said in a statement. 
Families can sign up for texts or email alerts to learn when applications open on the state’s website. Registration forms will be available beginning in December.

“Michigan’s Persons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act protects residents and visitors from the automatic denial of accommodations for a disability,” Department Executive Director John E. Johnson, Jr. said in a statement. “The law requires organizations to engage in an interactive process to determine if appropriate tools or changes in policy would allow the full use and enjoyment of public resources.”
A spokesperson for McLaren health in a statement said the health system takes “any complaint of discrimination seriously and maintains zero tolerance for inequitable behavior or practices.” 
“For any patient, visitor, employee, or volunteer with a disability requiring accommodation, appropriate accommodations are provided,” the statement said. “We have always been — and remain — committed to fostering a respectful, inclusive environment for all. We are aware of the charge by the MDCR in connection with a matter previously addressed through legal channels.”
McLaren also stated that the case was originally dismissed by the MDCR for lack of merit. 
“This latest action by the MDCR is based on a circuit court decision appeal,” the health system said. “We will defend against this matter through the legal process.”
The charge was filed on Nov. 21, and will now go to a hearing before an administrative law judge, who will review the evidence and provide a recommendation to the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, the final decision-maker in discrimination complaints.

Stuart Taylor, a former Kum & Go vice president, is suing the company and Chief Marketing Officer Tracy Ging in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, claiming there was a “blatant disparity” in how the company treated men and women.
Court records indicate Taylor was hired in 2018 as Kum & Go’s vice president of business insights and analytics and later filled the interim roles of vice president of category management and vice president of food service, while retaining his original position.

According to the lawsuit, he initially received favorable performance reviews and was designated a “shooting star” at the company, signifying the company’s recognition of his talent and potential to join the senior leadership team.
In 2020, the company hired Ging as its new chief marketing officer. The lawsuit alleges that within a few months, Ging fired the vice president of food service, Jeff Schamburger, which led to Taylor filling the position on an interim basis.
According to the lawsuit, while Taylor’s work in that role was viewed as a success, Ging stripped him of his “shooting star” designation and hired a woman to fill the position of vice president of food service. She later criticized statements made by Taylor and, the lawsuit claims, “somehow managed to accuse him of gender discrimination based on his neutral suggestion” on a marketing issue. The lawsuit alleges Ging was “accusing Taylor of being chauvinistic simply for voicing an opinion that was different than her own.”
The lawsuit also alleges Taylor “asked Ging why she had accused him multiple times of being sexist. Ging’s response was to apologize, to say that she didn’t really know, but that sometimes people just ‘need a punch in the nose.’”
In addition, the lawsuit claims Ging witnessed a female vice president berating a male colleague and did nothing to intervene, citing the alleged incident as one example of the “blatant disparity in treatment” of men and women at the company.
“Ging tolerates women disrespecting men, but even a perceived slight of a man against a woman was met with an iron fist,” the lawsuit alleges. “Taylor has also been told by another individual who worked with Ging that ‘Tracy is good at strategy, but the thing about her is she just hates men.’”
Taylor alleges Ging fired him April 2023 for pretextual reasons intended to disguise illegal gender discrimination.
A trial date has yet to be scheduled in the case.

Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican and critic of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, says negotiations to end the war shouldn't reward Russia's aggression and undermine Ukraine's ability to defend itself in the future. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas joined fellow Republicans warning against negotiating an end to the Russia-Ukraine war that rewarded Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression and left Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy without effective security guarantees.
Moran, the Kansas congressional delegation’s most persistent critic of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, argued that endorsement by President Donald Trump of a deal giving into Putin’s demands would make the world more dangerous. Russia launched this invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
“Lasting peace will be achieved when the costs of continuing the war in Ukraine are unsustainable for Russia, not by acceding to Vladimir Putin’s demands,” Moran said.
Trump expressed support for a 28-point plan introduced by White House envoy Steve Witkoff after meetings with Russian officials. Some U.S. lawmakers criticized the proposal’s concessions to Russia, including ceding of Ukrainian territory. The plan also was denounced because it included a guarantee Ukraine couldn’t join NATO and failed to acknowledge other Ukrainian security interests.
“As negotiations move forward,” Moran said, “the administration must make certain Ukraine is equipped with the tools needed to defend its people and territory against ongoing aggression and demand meaningful, enduring security guarantees for Kyiv.”
In October, Moran said the United States should deliver long-range missiles to Ukraine because the armaments would “help level the battlefield as negotiations hopefully move forward.” Trump chose not to authorize shipment of cruise missiles to Ukraine.
Moran argued in July for sustained support and weapon shipments for Ukraine, because to do otherwise would send a message of weakness to the world.
“If we allow a dictator to redraw borders by force, then what message does that send to other authoritarian regimes watching closely around the globe, including China?” Moran said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Jerry-Moran-ku-cancer-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-26 14:56:51.756182

DeSantis has repeatedly boasted about his efforts to reshape Florida’s judicial branch, including the state Supreme Court. Five of the seven justices on the court were appointed by the Republican governor. The court has made several crucial rulings including one that undid previous decisions on abortion.
Justice Charles Canady announced this month he will step down in January to take a position at the University of Florida. DeSantis will get the chance to name Canady’s replacement.
The state Supreme Court on Wednesday certified the need for 13 circuit court judges and 12 county court judges. The bulk of the court’s request centered on Florida’s 20th Circuit where the court said there is a need to appoint 8 judges in the circuit that covers southwest Florida. The court request also asked for multiple county judges in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Orange counties.

The Legislature ultimately agreed to authorize a total of 39 judgeships and many of those have yet to be filled by DeSantis.
New judgeships are filled by gubernatorial appointment, although those appointed to county and circuit posts must be retained by the voters.
Annually the court looks at judicial caseloads and gets reports from the chief judges in each judicial circuit. In its latest set of recommendations the court stated it is “mindful of the state’s current fiscal climate and projected budget shortfalls in subsequent fiscal years and recognizes that establishing new judgeships results in operational and potential fiscal impacts for justice-system partners.”
The Office of State Courts Administrator reports that Florida has 1,060 authorized judgeships not counting those at the state Supreme Court.
DeSantis, who has repeatedly praised U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, has gotten to appoint many judges during his two terms in offices. Many lawyers ultimately chosen by DeSantis have ties to The Federalist Society, a conservative activist group.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_009825873-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 14:56:51.756182

 Book signing in Ashland

Student poets and author Jacqueline Hamilton will be signing “A Pencil Grows in Kentucky” from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 6, at the Highlands Museum & Discovery Center in Ashland as part of a downtown holiday  celebration. 

Six new poets from Appalachia — all girls and young women — arrived at the recent Kentucky Book Festival at Joseph-Beth Booksellers in Lexington in various parts shy, talkative, nervous and excited about their first poems appearing in the book, “A Pencil Grows in Kentucky.”
Some were still in grade school, the others in middle and high school. They took a seat among about 150 adult writers in a large, open room filled with books, book talk, hope, fear and enduring literary aspirations. The usual stuff.
Each young poet was seated in turn next to their mentor and book creator, Jacqueline Jane Hamilton, 70, a retired Eastern Kentucky University English teacher for whom her students use the more affectionate label Miss JJ. An Ohio native, she has a broad writing background, including journalism, community relations at the Dallas Fire Department, a Rotary International Journalism Fellowship in England, an MFA in nonfiction writing and a doctorate in higher education.
Hamilton’s life has now mostly come down to one thing. Giving back to the alphabet. Creating and preserving writing and poetry from the Kentucky mountains by helping foster a new generation of poets. Her claim, offered on the back page of the book, goes, “Women of Appalachia Kentucky — young and old — can reimagine the world with pencil and paper.”
“I would love to expand this work,” said Hamilton, “and feature more women writers and activists from around Kentucky and Appalachia. I started in my home county of Clark and moved east. I got three libraries, a school and a museum that jumped on the chance to help.”

Along with her teaching and writing she has created and performed portrayals of Boston journalist and social reformer Alice Lloyd, who co-founded Alice Lloyd College in Pippa Passes in Knott County, in 1923, and Louisville novelist and detective writer Sue Grafton. There’s the non-profit Why We Write Inc. she helped create for the book sales and fundraising. Add  the “Inkspire Camps” for other young writers, scheduled for June and July in Lexington and Winchester. With the “Revolutionary Kid Dreaming” writing camps for boys and girls coming this spring to honor the nation’s 250th birthday.
Bringing it all home, she used as her teaching role models the life stories of seven Appalachian heroines: Cora Wilson Stewart, Effie Waller Smith, Jean Bell Thomas, Ollie “Widow” Combs, Harriette Arnow, Verna Mae Stone and Jean Ritchie. Each story was read to the students as part of a larger program, “Appalachia Girl Dreaming,” to find and inspire young female student writers to continue the women’s  tradition. All part of her book, “A Pencil Grows in Kentucky,” a title inspired by the classic “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” — a metaphorical analogy of survival, growth and eventual success from an often-difficult environment. Read New York city streets or Appalachian hills.
Ollie Combs, one of the Appalachian heroines the girls study, lay in front of a bulldozer to protect her land in Knott County from a coal company that planned to strip mine it. She was forcibly removed, arrested and spent Thanksgiving 1964 in jail. Among the notes posted to “Widow Combs:” “You were so brave for doing what you did” and “Were you fearful that the officers would physically hurt you in any way?” (Photo courtesy of Why We Write)
Hamilton was also inspired by a 2014 collection of autobiographical poetry titled “Brown Girl Dreaming” by Jacqueline Woodson, poetry she saw as a strong mentoring text for young students. Seeking further homegrown inspiration, the first page of Hamilton’s book is a poem from Kentucky legend Wendell Berry, “How to be a Poet.” Who else to talk poetry? Its message to all writers goes: 
Accept what comes from silence.
Make the best you can of it.
Of the little words that come
out of the silence, like prayers
prayed back to the one who prays,
make a poem  that does not disturb
the silence from which it came.
Hamilton had somewhat similar thoughts:
“Í wrote the book because I was frustrated by so many students thinking that writing was horrible, boring, difficult, not worthwhile. Kids telling me they don’t need to learn because AI will do it, like a calculator does math.
“I am a firm believer that reading and writing poetry can help write all sorts of things, so I wanted to focus on teaching  about poetry which allows students to use unusual moves as compared to sentences in academic writing. Then I had a belief that if these folks saw their work in print — in an actual beautiful book — they would be encouraged to keep writing.”
Pushing ahead, she received an $18,000 grant from Steele-Reese Foundation, a charitable trust with deep roots in Appalachia. That led to inexpensive, weekly workshops where each young participant received a copy of “Brown Girl Dreaming,” art supplies and six to eight hours of personal instruction. Add singing, fun skits and two copies of “A Pencil Grows” in Kentucky.

The workshops were focused on Hamilton’s three foundations of writing: listening, landscape and language. It stressed poetic listening  to the landscape — often a missing link in good writing — along with its visual cues. Her editing includes changing an old baseball metaphor, “Three strikes and you’re out,” to “Three strikes and you’re in,” giving each student three chances at editing her poem to make it better. Then add a few more strikes if required.
As a result, several hundred poems by 70 young students from Bath, Boyd, Carter, Clark, Fleming, Montgomery and Rowan counties made their way into “A Pencil Grows in Kentucky.” With a half-dozen of those young poets sitting next to Miss JJ at the Kentucky Book Festival. Signing the pages on which their poetry appeared as the book buyers — and proud parents — stopped by. Certifying  them as Published Authors. Part of  Kentucky’s finest book festival. An opportunity so many writers of any age never get.
Hamilton’s help doesn’t end there:
“I also want my young women poets to not think of their time with Appalachia Girl Dreaming as a one and done experience. I have sprinkled Love Notes to participants throughout the book. Encouraging notes are a powerful tool that teachers and families should use more often.”
She followed that advice in her book with a Japanese proverb: “One kind word can  warm three winter months.”
The poems in the book are  living examples of the success of Hamilton, and so many others involved in the various projects. Some poems are surprising in their depth. A few offered a little humor. Many focused on home, family, gardens, the weather, the moment. Other young poets wrote of the mountains rising above them, the shelter offered, the being there with them.
Wandering through the poems in a 240-page book, you find certain sentences, even phrases, that work, each one offering a thought, a smile, a memory, even a warning.
“To be silent is to be ignored.” 
“I am from those moments across time.”
“Fabric woven gently like time’s old cloth.”
“So when you find what’s real, keep it close.”
“I sleep in a purple room with teal bed covers.”
“Disappear is just a word.”

Then, the longer pieces of their poems offer a larger time and place.:
Arsema Haset Smith-Mensah, a 12th-grader from Boyd County writes in “My Claim:”
People see me,
And, yes, see my father.
I have his nose and last name.
But when I look in a mirror
I see coily hair and a toothy grin.
I know I am my mother’s daughter.
Ella Kaufer,  ninth grader from Rowan County wrote “Baked.”
Mountains hold the stories 
of footprints stirred into the dirt –
of people who
chopped its trees,
lived in its caverns,
rested in its shade.
The mountains hold the stories
of those who have traveled 
and have baked their steps
Into earth’s very foundation.
Emma Keck, a sixth-grader from Boyd County wrote a love letter to her mother in “Mom.”

You held me inside for nine months
Now I’m growing older.
I try to help and wonder –
Is it enough?
I don’t want you to hold sadness inside
While you still take care of me
I just hope you know –
You mean everything to me.
Grayce Newcome, a Boyd County 12th-grader, wrote of “The Wooden Porch Swing,’ and wanting to sit on it with “Papa” after a long day of work, the family arguing over who will join him.
somehow our little bodies
all fit together like 
a porch puzzle,
as we sit
on the wooden swing
with Papa.

Wyleigh Osborne of Clark County writes of being “composed of white, drooping dandelions like the ones her Granny kept on her sink, not thinking them weeds.” She finishes:
My very own recipe
For my very own being
A cup of dandelions
A teaspoon of adventures
A pinch of outdoors
My beautiful composition
For I am a weed no more.
Paige E. Tak, a sixth-grader from Boyd County, put some alliteration to work talking about “Ed’s Expertise.”
Ed eagerly edits
Edgar’s excessively edited
essay while eating endless
edamame and exotic entrees.
L.B. Joey, a Carter County eighth-grader, surrenders to the task while vanquishing it in “Writing.”
Writing doesn’t
Come easily to me.
Writing doesn’t
flow like a river to a lake
Writing forces me to focus —
But sometimes
The words still slip away.
Justice Shirey
Justice Shirey, a fifth-grader from Bath County, writes in “How to Dream” of wanting to go to Princeton, to study law, to become “The Defender” who helps people recover from their mistakes:
Their life is
Not a mistake. …Their life is 
Something to hold on to.
Something to be learned.
Something to teach their children
so they don’t go through the
same pain
their family faced.
Makinzie Coleman, a Clark County 10th-grader, heard silence.
The emptiness speaks
inside the home
The ghosts asking to
be left alone.
The poem “My Heart is in The Hills” by Clark County sixth-grader Raelynn C. Atwood helps bring “A Pencil Grows” in Kentucky home:
The feeling of the earth beneath my feet,
Her warm embrace among fields so sweet.
Blue skies, dirt paths
The pines, the breeze
The sun dancing softly
Through whispering trees
I long to lose my cares where wild creeks roam
Where rivers sing and the hills call me home.

Kyndall McKnight, a seventh-grader in Boyd County, touches all the bases with “More.”
Appalachia
More than mountains.
More than hillbillies.
Rooted
More than music.
More than land.
Home
More than acceptance.
More than comfort.
We are one and other.
Hamilton said all the initial $18,000  grant has been used, with sales from her book being used to fund more poetry classes. She is seeking more sponsors as everyone involved is working for free. Meanwhile, she has received another $18,000 grant from the Steele-Reese Foundation to create more camps for boys and girls focused on listening — that often missing ingredient in life.
“I think I can keep this going,” she said, “as long as my health holds up.”

(Photo by Steve Hillebrand/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The state of Alaska is asking a federal appeals court to re-examine a district court decision that denied the state almost 20,000 acres of potentially oil-rich land. 
On Monday, the Alaska Department of Law filed a notice of appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in an 11-year-old lawsuit that is attempting to fix the location of the western border of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
That border has been disputed between the state and the federal government for decades and matters because the land in the disputed area is believed to contain significant amounts of oil.
“The public land order that created ANWR placed its western boundary on the ‘extreme west bank of the Canning River.’ Despite this clear language, the Bureau of Land Management had placed the boundary on the western bank of a separate and distinct river — the Staines — and the federal court got it wrong too,” the Department of Law said in a statement. “This dispute affects approximately 20,000 acres of Alaska’s lands, which are believed to have valuable oil and gas reserves.”
If the land is not within the refuge, it would still be federally owned but could be selected for eventual transfer to the state. 
A ruling in the state’s favor might eventually result in oil and gas drilling that would generate millions of dollars in state and local revenue.
A ruling in the federal government’s favor would either protect the land from development or allow oil and gas development under the federal government’s controversial and legally challenged refuge drilling plan.
The appeal comes less than 30 days after District Court Judge Judge Sharon Gleason entered a judgment against the state and in favor of the federal government.
No schedule has yet been set for proceedings in the circuit court.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is among more than 20 Democratic state elected officials suing the Trump administration to block an abrupt change in the allocation of federal funds to address homelessness.
Housing advocates warn that the administration’s decision, announced Nov. 13, to shift billions of dollars in grants could put as many as 170,000 formerly homeless people back on the street. 
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, alleged the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is violating the intent of Congress by moving grants away from providing permanent housing.
Beshear in a statement provided in a press release called the funding shift “illegal and cruel” and said it would “cause more people — like veterans and families — to go homeless and make our communities less safe.” 
Many Kentuckians at risk of returning to homelessness because of federal funding switch

“We should be helping people get back on their feet through a safe place to call home, not barring them from any chance of success. These policy changes are wrong and dangerous, and they will set our commonwealth and country back,” Beshear said.
For more than a decade, HUD has put about 90% of funding through what’s known as Continuum of Care grants toward “permanent, supportive housing” which provides people — often those who have spent years on the streets and need mental health care — with a safe place to live and services such as counseling and financial education. The move by HUD would allow only 30% of the grants to go toward permanent housing. Most of the money would instead go to short-term, “transitional” housing aimed at getting people into jobs and in charge of their own housing.
Kentucky housing aid advocates previously told the Lantern the policy change would put more people at risk of homelessness. At stake is much of about $48 million that flows to Kentucky each year in HUD money, with the largest portion, $23 million, going to Louisville.
In Kentucky, around 3,700 individuals with disabling conditions live in permanent, supportive housing, which advocates say has proven to be the best solution for preventing homelessness. “We know that permanent housing is the solution to homelessness,” said Catherine McGeeney, communications director for the Louisville Coalition for the Homeless, which coordinates HUD funding for the area. “It effectively ends homelessness.”
The changes would affect a wide range of programs throughout Kentucky, said Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, including housing help offered by domestic violence, veterans and mental health groups as well as agencies that directly serve the homeless. 
“There are folks who without this program would be homeless. They most likely will be homeless again without rent support and case management,” said Bush.
HUD Secretary Scott Turner in a press release announcing the policy change said it would stop “the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values and incentivized never-ending government dependency.”

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Following the busiest year on record for the U.S. National Park Service, which saw more than 331 million visitors in 2024, the Department of the Interior announced this week changes to how national parks will be accessed next year.
The major change is the implementation of resident and nonresident fees for national parks, an idea the federal government proposed earlier this summer.
While entry costs and annual passes for U.S. residents will not change, nonresident visitors will pay a higher rate to increase funds that support maintenance of the park system.

Starting Jan. 1, nonresident visitors will pay $250 for an annual America the Beautiful pass, while U.S. residents will continue to pay $80. The annual passes allow a vehicle, or four individuals, to access more than 2,000 recreation sites managed by federal agencies including DOI, the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
In addition to the increased cost of annual passes, the nation’s 11 most visited national parks will charge $100 to nonresidents, on top of the standard entrance fee, which is $35 for a private vehicle at the most popular parks such as Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park.
Both of Montana’s national parks are among the top-10 most visited, with Yellowstone ranking fourth in 2024 with 4.7 million visitors, and Glacier ranking 10th, with 3.2 million.
“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement. “These policies ensure that U.S. taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”
The department said in a press release that the “America-first entry fee policies” are designed to ensure “American taxpayers who already support the National Park System receive the greatest benefit.
Annual passes will continue to be offered at a discounted price for seniors, and for free for military members, U.S. residents with permanent disabilities, all U.S. 4th grade students, and federal recreation site volunteers.
The international surcharge for park visitation is an idea long championed by the Property and Environment Research Center, a Bozeman-based “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank.
PERC has advocated for changes to the NPS fee structure for years as a way to increase budgets and address growing backlogs of maintenance at National Parks at a time when visitation is routinely breaking records, and published a report earlier this year that considered different fee structure scenarios.
Using Yellowstone as an example, a $100 international surcharge for visitors could raise an additional $55.2 million in entry fees for the park, while only leading to a decrease of roughly 57,000 visitors, PERC estimated.
“The status quo is not one of sustainable and proper management of these sites,” Tate Watkins, a research fellow at PERC, told the Daily Montanan earlier this year. “The current model just doesn’t keep up with it.”
Other countries have similar fee structures that charge international visitors higher prices, including the often-cited Galapagos Islands, where Ecuadorian adults pay $30 to visit, while foreign tourists pay $200.
There is a similar system in place in Montana to access state parks, where residents pay a $9 annual fee with their vehicle registration and can access state parks all year. Nonresidents, however, are charged $50 for an annual fee or $8 per entrance.
Montana U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, former Secretary of the Interior during President Donald Trump’s first term, praised the move on Wednesday.
“President Trump and Secretary Burgum are putting Americans first by asking foreign visitors to pay their fair share while holding entrance fees steady for the American people,” Zinke and West Virginia Rep. Wes Moore said in a joint statement. “This policy ensures that our beautiful national heritage is preserved and the critical maintenance backlog is addressed so that America’s national parks will remain affordable, well-maintained, and financially sustainable for generations to come. We owe it to future generations of Americans — our children and grandchildren — to ensure our beautiful natural heritage that God created is well preserved.”
Zinke and Moore introduced the “Protecting America’s Treasure by Raising Inflow from Overseas Tourists (PATRIOT) Parks Act earlier this year, which would codify the foreign fees to national parks.
Companion legislation in the Senate was introduced by U.S. Sens. Tim Sheehy of Montana and Jim Banks of Indiana.
More changes, digital first
Another part of the changes include a modernization of park passes, including offering digital America the Beautiful passes.
The passes will be fully available in a digital format through Recreation.gov, as opposed to visitors having to purchase a hard copy. Similar to using a digital wallet or a mobile ID app, visitors can store their passes on a phone and they can be used to enter federal recreation sites.
The America the Beautiful pass will also cover the entrance fee for up to two motorcycles.
New designs for the the annual passes have also been unveiled by the Department.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Glacier_sign_2-1024x646.jpg,,,2025-11-26 13:56:54.786011

Alan Schmidt, who filed the lawsuit, said Rankin County deputies beat and sexually assaulted him in late 2022. Three of the involved deputies were sentenced to federal and state prison terms last year, in part for their role in the incident. They are also defendants in the lawsuit.
In the lawsuit, which represents one side of a legal argument, Schmidt alleged that the department was responsible for a pattern of misconduct by deputies and jail guards, listing several other lawsuits against deputies and county jail guards. 
While he’s seeking an unspecified amount of compensation for his own pain and suffering, he said he is also filing the lawsuit on behalf of everyone who has been abused by the sheriff’s department.
“There are many things that go on in this county that have gone on for many years,” Schmidt said. “I want justice for everyone that has been wronged.”
The department did not respond to a request for comment. 
In December 2022, deputies pulled Schmidt from his car and beat him while he was handcuffed, the lawsuit alleges. One deputy pressed his arm into an anthill, and former narcotics investigator Christian Dedmon fired a gun near Schmidt’s head while interrogating him about the location of stolen tools he believed Schmidt had taken. 
Dedmon punched Schmidt and shocked him several times with Deputy Hunter Elward’s Taser, then pulled out his own genitals and attempted to rub them in Schmidt’s face, the lawsuit claims.
Dedmon pleaded guilty to violating Schimdt’s constitutional rights, but has since denied the sexual assault. Former deputies Hunter Elward and Daniel Opdyke pleaded guilty to failing to stop the beating, according to court documents.  
The deputies also pleaded guilty to a separate late-night raid of the home of Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker, two Black men who were tortured and called racial slurs for hours by five deputies and a Richland police officer in early 2023. 
Schmidt’s lawsuit is the latest in a series of allegations from people who say they were brutalized by Rankin County sheriff’s deputies and guards at the county jail, which is run by the sheriff’s department. 
An investigation by Mississippi Today and The New York Times found that the Rankin County deputies, some of whom referred to themselves as the Goon Squad, had been torturing people they suspected of using drugs for nearly two decades. 
The Justice Department launched an investigation into a potential pattern of civil rights violations at the department last year. That investigation is ongoing. 
Dedmon has since said publicly that the abuses he participated in were part of a widespread practice at the department, where deputies would routinely enter homes illegally, beat people and humiliate them to extract information and scare criminal suspects out of the county.
A recent investigation by the publications found that for years, guards and administrators at the Rankin County jail brutalized the inmates in their care, sometimes enlisting other inmates with special privileges, called trusties, to help them beat inmates who broke jail rules. 
Schmidt’s attorney, Trent Walker, who has represented several people who say they were brutalized by the sheriff’s department, said Schmidt’s case proves the entrenched culture of violence at the agency. 
“The case puts the lie to any claim that what happened to Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker was isolated,” he said. “ I want the citizens of Rankin County, specifically, to be able to look at this case and the other cases and say that it’s enough, it’s time for a fresh start.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/26120620/GOON-SQUADSchmidt_10.jpg,,,2025-11-26 13:56:54.786011

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)More bad news for Rhode Islanders struggling to pay their energy bills: Hikes are coming.
Rhode Island Energy unveiled its long-anticipated request to increase service charges for gas and electric customers in a press release the day before the Thanksgiving holiday. An application was simultaneously submitted to the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission for review.
The documents were not immediately available from the commission Wednesday morning. Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, declined to provide a copy when asked.
If approved, the increases would take effect in September 2026. The average residential electric customer would see their monthly bills rise $7.78, or 4.83%, while a typical residential gas customer would pay $343.53 more per year, a 20.6% increase, according to Rhode Island Energy.
Gov. Dan McKee blasted the proposal in a statement released just after 1 p.m.
“This is not the time for a utility rate increase,” McKee said. “With costs rising nationwide and families already burdened, my focus remains fixed on affordability for every Rhode Islander.”
Anticipating the fury coming its way, Rhode Island Energy President Greg Cornett attempted to justify the proposal by highlighting the benefits for customers. 
“This review is about making smart, necessary investments in reliability, customer service, and safety, while also keeping affordability top of mind and strengthening support for those who need it most,” Cornett said in a statement Wednesday. “Throughout this process, we want our customers to understand that we are keenly aware of the challenges so many of them are facing, and that we are committed to keeping customers informed and helping them manage their energy costs now and into the future.”
State regulators prevented the utility supplier from asking for a distribution rate increase for the last three years under the terms of the 2022 sale of gas and electric operations from National Grid to PPL Corp., Rhode Island Energy’s parent company. 
The moratorium ends this year, and Rhode Island Energy is ready to take back what it claims it needs to offset inflation and supply chain expenses.
For example, the cost of installing a 1-mile section of underground electric cable has nearly doubled, from $12,000 in 2020 to $22,000 today, according to the company. Electric surge protectors now cost $120, compared with $60 in 2020. Upgrading natural gas pipelines now come in at nearly triple the price, the company said.
“The proposed increase is necessary for [Rhode Island Energy] to continue to meet regulatory mandates, align with the real cost of doing business, and continue delivering around-the-clock service,” the press release stated.
The company expects to generate an additional $230 million in operating revenue over a two-year period from its proposal, according to a federal financial disclosure statement also filed on Wednesday.
PPL’s profits and shareholder returns have come under scrutiny by state lawmakers and consumer advocates, who contrast company earnings with cash-strapped residents struggling to pay their winter energy bills. Electricity prices have only abated slightly since reaching record highs three years ago
Under state law, the company cannot recoup any money from its usage rates, which are instead set directly by prices from third-party suppliers. 
Adding to public fury: accounting errors which revealed the company overbilled state agencies $2 million in their 2024 energy bills. State utility regulators are reviewing complaints from residential customers who allege they have been overcharged, including on the rollout of 540,000 smart electric meters statewide.
The Public Utilities Commission has final authority over any increases in electric and gas rates. The three-person panel considers the financial solvency of the company alongside ratepayer affordability and the true necessity of proposed capital projects. Historically, the commission has trimmed some money from the original company requests to blunt the impact on ratepayers.
The last time the commission reviewed a distribution rate increase, under National Grid’s ownership, was in 2017. The approved rates were 40% less than what National Grid asked for. 
Earlier this week, Chairman Ronald Gerwatowski highlighted the commission’s ability to influence distribution of customer bill credits, which Rhode Island Energy must refund to customers under the terms of the 2022 sale. Rhode Island Energy withdrew its initial proposal earlier this month amid scrutiny over the calculations, but plans to file an alternative scheme early next year.
The discounts, which aim to shield ratepayers from company tax and accounting expenses related to the 2022 sale, could help mitigate higher service charges, Gerwatowski said Monday.
McKee pledged to “continue fighting” for Rhode Island Energy’s original $150 million bill credit plan. He also said his fiscal 2027 budget proposal, unveiled in January, will include “millions of dollars” in energy savings.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)West Virginia families statewide who have a religious or philosophical objection to the state’s school vaccination requirements must be allowed to attend school, a Raleigh County judge ruled on Wednesday.
Circuit Judge Michael Froble ruled that the West Virginia and Raleigh County school boards’ policy not to accept religious exemptions is a violation of the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023. The school boards are prohibited from enforcing the school vaccination requirements on those seeking a religious or philosophical exemption, the judge wrote.
“For the avoidance of all doubt, the Enjoined Defendants shall not prevent the Plaintiffs, members of the Class, or their minor children from enrolling in school, attending school, or participating in extracurricular sports because of their vaccination status,” Froble wrote in a 74-page ruling. 
In response to the ruling, the state Board of Education said Wednesday it is suspending the policy on compulsory vaccination requirements pending further proceedings on the matter before the state Supreme Court. 
The lawsuit brought by Raleigh County residents Miranda Guzman and Carley Hunter on behalf of their children against the school boards is at the center of a debate over West Virginia’s vaccine law and religious freedom that is likely to be determined by the state Supreme Court. 
All states require school students to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases, including polio, measles and chickenpox. West Virginia has been one of only five in the country that do not allow children to opt out of the vaccine requirements based on a religious or philosophical objection. The state has only allowed medical exemptions. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January requiring the state Department of Health to allow religious exemptions. The order is based on the Equal Protection for Religion Act, a 2023 religious freedom law. Morrisey has not rescinded that order even though the Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have added the exemptions to state law. 
The state Board of Education earlier this year voted to instruct county boards of education not to accept religious exemptions. 
Froble in July had granted a preliminary injunction in the case that allowed students who are parties to the lawsuit to attend class while the proceedings continued. 
According to Froble’s ruling in October,  Wednesday’s ruling applies to any family who has sought, obtained or will seek an exemption to the state’s school vaccination requirements under the Equal Protection for Religion Act unless those families have received a final judgement on the merits in their own lawsuits in the matter. State Health Department officials  have said about 570 families so far sought a religious or philosophical exemption. 
In his ruling Wednesday, Froble wrote that the families’ religious beliefs and practices regarding vaccination have been “substantially burdened” by the school board’s policy not to allow them to attend school.
The state Board of Education filed a notice in September it would appeal Froble’s decision. The high court has given the school board until Dec. 12 to prepare its appeal, after which the justices will consider the case.
A handful of other lawsuits over religious exemptions have been filed in the state. Kanawha County Circuit judge Rich Lindsay last month dismissed a lawsuit filed against the Kanawha County board of education, saying that the governor does not have authority to make laws. 
In a statement Wednesday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey applauded Froble’s ruling. 
“Today’s ruling is a win for every family forced from school over their faith,” Morrisey said in the statement. “I will always take a stand for religious liberty and for the children of this state. I applaud the court for upholding West Virginia’s Equal Protection for Religion Act.”

Ziogas and former state deputy budget director Konstantinos Diamantis were scheduled to go to trial early next year, but now instead Ziogas could be a witness for the prosecution — as could his fianceé, Helen Zervas, who has already pleaded guilty to her role in the scheme.
Court officials said there is no mention in the 13-page plea agreement about whether Ziogas will be required to testify at Diamantis’ upcoming trial in the Zervas matter, and the issue was not brought up during Wednesday’s hearing. That trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 8 in Bridgeport.
Attorney Matthew Maddox, who represents Ziogas, declined to say whether his client will testify against Diamantis.
Diamantis’ Attorney Norm Pattis said Wednesday he was “surprised by the plea.”
“I fully expect that he will be called to testify at the trial, and I look forward to cross examining him,” Pattis said.
Diamantis has already been convicted of bribery and extortion for his role in steering school construction contracts, but Judge Stefan Underhill, who presided over the first trial, has postponed that sentencing until after the next trial.
Diamantis, the former deputy secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, is also facing bribery, extortion and filing a false statement charges in the Zervas case. Diamantis is currently free on a $500,000 bond.
Ziogas appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert M. Spector during his change of plea hearing in U.S. District Court in New Haven on Wednesday. Spector quizzed Ziogas about whether he understood what he was pleading guilty to and then asked Ziogas to describe in his own words what he had done.
“I participated in a scheme with Helen and Kosta to try and have him suppress some activity in Medicaid charges that she was facing,” Ziogas said, adding “we paid him (Kosta) to help influence the outcome of the audit.” 
When asked by the judge what he had specifically done, Ziogas added, “Helen gave me money, and I gave it to Kosta — maybe $100,000.”
[The Kosta Diamantis timeline]
Ziogas also pleaded guilty to providing a false statement to FBI agents and to bank fraud for taking $5,500 out of an account that he was the trustee of without the client’s knowledge.
Ziogas is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 18. Under the plea agreement, he is facing between 70-87 months in prison. Ziogas was allowed to remain free on the $500,000 bond that has been in place since his arrest last February.
The case has its roots in a Medicaid audit that was scheduled in early 2020.
It was during the height of COVID, in May 2020, when Diamantis and Ziogas hand-delivered a check for nearly $600,000 to DSS in order to reimburse the state Medicaid program for services that Zervas improperly billed.
After that check was delivered to the state Department of Social Services office in Hartford, the audit into Zervas’ optometry practice was dropped, which prevented state auditors from combing through her records and potentially clawing back even more money for the state.
The CT Mirror reported that the audit of Bristol Eye Care was the only one that DSS canceled over a five-year period. 
Diamantis and Ziogas previously told the CT Mirror that there was nothing illegal about the $600,000 payment, and they said their involvement had nothing to do with the agency ending the scheduled audit of Zervas’ practice.
“They can look at whatever they want,” Ziogas said in an interview at his Bristol home in 2023. “I’ve got nothing to hide.”
Zervas pleaded guilty last February to health care fraud charges and admitted that she conspired with a former state lawmaker and former high-ranking Connecticut employee to pressure officials at the state’s Medicaid agency to cancel an audit that was examining Medicaid overpayments at her optometry practice.
At that time, federal prosecutors would not identify those public officials. But less than three weeks later, Ziogas and Diamantis were indicted.
Zervas admitted that she intended to bribe Diamantis, “the high-ranking state official,” into pressuring state employees at DSS.
She eventually paid Diamantis $95,000. Much of it passed through Ziogas and was taken from her business Family Eye Care, according to the indictment.
The last payment of $65,000 to Diamantis was made three days after the two men hand-delivered the check to DSS.
In total, the federal prosecutors alleged Zervas fraudulently billed the state’s Medicaid program on more than 300 occasions between 2015 and 2020. She did the same for Medicare patients, but less frequently. 
Diamantis and Ziogas have been close associates for some time. When Diamantis’ daughter Anastasia needed an attorney during an investigation into how she got a job in former Chief State’s Attorney’s Richard Colangelo’s office, it was Ziogas, who did not have a law license at the time, who represented her. 
Ziogas served three terms as the state representative for the 79th District in Bristol before leaving office in January 2023.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ziogas-1024x737.jpg,,,2025-11-26 13:56:54.786011

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Some Montana residents may receive a holiday bonus thanks to the Office of the Commission of Securities and Insurance. 
A coordinated multi-state task force, which included the Montana Auditor’s Office, had been investigating five major brokerage firms for allegedly charging unreasonable minimum commissions in violation of federal law and totaling nearly $19 million. 
This summer, the task force announced settlements with the five firms, and Montana Auditor James Brown told the Daily Montanan this week that the next phase — letting Montanans know if they were affected and getting them their money back — is underway. 
“We take our consumer protection role pretty seriously at this agency and we have some really good news to announce to folks who have been wronged,” Brown said in a phone interview. “… We are glad we are able to do our duty as Montana’s watchdog, protect Montanans’ money and hold firms accountable.”
Brown said that roughly $160,000 of Montanans’ money was recovered in restitution and will be paid back from the brokerage firms. 
His office is sending out letters to all Montanans who were affected customers, letting them know they’ll be reimbursed their dollars. Some brokerage firms may have checks in the mail or will deposit money directly into accounts, he said. 
“We’re going to be giving a number of Montanans some good Thanksgiving news,” Brown said. 
Earlier this year, the auditor’s office announced national settlements with five major firms — Edward Jones, LPL Financial, RBC Capital Markets, Stifel, Nicolaus and Company, and TD Ameritrade. 
Securities regulators from Alabama, Iowa, Massachusetts, Missouri, Texas and Washington, as well as Montana, had investigated allegations that the firms had charged unreasonable minimum commissions to retail customers that often exceeded 5% of the principal amount on small equity trades. 
From 2018 to 2025, according to the investigations, the five firms collectively charged nearly $19 million in excessive commissions across more than 1.1 million transactions. 
Brown said that in Montana, the five firms collectively mischarged more than 8,000 transactions resulting in $160,000 in restitution for Montana victims. 
Under the settlements, the companies have also agreed to pay administrative fines, cover investigative costs to the states, review their policies and compliance systems, and are censured, and must permanently cease and desist from charging unreasonable commissions. 
“This settlement with these firms on these transactions that violated federal law is just another step we’ve taken since I became commissioner to hold Wall Street firms accountable when they engage in wrongdoing,” Brown said. “If a firm overcharges Montana investors, they can expect a knock on the door from my team.”
Brown added that additional investigations are still underway with other, unnamed companies. 
The commissioner’s office is asking Montanans to check their mailboxes for the letters from the office informing them if they are covered by the settlements, and to check for checks or brokerage statements if they are expecting to receive restitution. 
Residents can contact the state securities and insurance office via email at csi.securities@mt.gov or by calling 406-444-2040.
Earlier this year, the auditor’s office announced a multi-state settlement with Edward Jones following an investigation into the brokerage charging front-load commissions.

The former co-owner of Crane Brewing swallowed his pride to buy reduced-priced $6 meals at a local grocery store to stretch the family budget at an uncertain moment.
What happened when he went to pay at the counter left him slack-jawed.
The cashier told him that a stranger had already paid for hundreds of meals. Meyers insisted on paying so someone even less fortunate could get a free dinner.
But the random act of kindness overwhelmed him.
“I just immediately started tearing up and almost had to step out of line,” Meyers told The Beacon. “Sometimes you don’t realize you’re right on the edge until one more straw on the camel’s back. It just really hit, knowing how much that hopefully meant for people who are in even worse positions.”
The financial anxiety Meyers describes is borne out by numbers that show that roughly half of us are struggling to make ends meet.
A new report from the Urban Institute found that 52% of American families earn less than what researchers call the “true cost of economic security” — meaning they don’t make enough to cover all their regular bills, pay for necessities and still have money left over to save for emergencies. In Kansas that number is 46.9%, and in Missouri 48.6% of people are in a similar position.
“I think more people are living paycheck-to-paycheck than would like to admit it,” Meyers said. “The cost of everything being more expensive is really tough.”
Rising costs coupled with stagnant wages are putting a squeeze on working people across the spectrum in Kansas City. The squeeze is reflected in the hard choices people are making as they grapple with higher costs for housing, groceries, health care and child care.
 Brutal math


The most glaring reason for this burgeoning affordability crisis is that wages have not grown as fast as prices for the basics working people buy.

The Urban Institute’s affordability tracker says that nationally, the average monthly grocery bill is up 32% while wages have only gone up 29% since 2019.
“I saw where a pound of ground beef was almost as expensive as the federal minimum wage,” Meyers noted.
But it’s not just groceries.
Nationally, the rising cost of essentials from January 2017 to August 2025 outpaced wage growth during the same time period:

The cost of child care for two children has risen 40%.
Rent jumped 50%.
Home sale prices have surged by 80%.
And the lowest-priced “silver” plan on the health care marketplace went up by 41%.

Wages, meanwhile, only rose by 38%.
Locally, Kansas City-area workers are also paid less than workers in similar cities. According to the Mid-America Regional Council (MARC), average hourly earnings here run 15% to 20% below peer metros like Minneapolis and Denver.
Frank Lenk, MARC’s director of the Office of Economic Research, told the 2025 KC Economic Outlook event this month that the Kansas City labor market is weakening. He also noted that the area’s economic recovery from the COVID pandemic has been slower than in the rest of the U.S.
“This is a classic Kansas City story,” Lenk said. “We don’t bust as low. … But we don’t boom as high.”
Lenk said that economic boom times generally last longer than busts. In Kansas City that means with each boom-and-bust business cycle, the local economy falls further behind peer metros bit by bit.
Jeremy Hill, a regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, told the same group that lower wages in Kansas and Missouri also mean it’s harder to attract talent to the area.
“We don’t really have a labor problem, we have a wage problem,” Hill said.



Hill said that across sectors in Missouri and particularly in Kansas, businesses have higher expectations of productivity but often aren’t willing to pay higher wages for it.
When adjusted for inflation, average wages in Kansas have risen by just $20 a week between January 2017 and August 2025. Missouri has done slightly better with an average weekly pay increase of $30 during the same nearly nine-year period.
These small wage increases come during a time when workers are as productive as ever.



“This has been a trend for a long time in the U.S.,” University of Kansas economics Professor David Slusky told The Beacon. “A trend where… the amount of stuff a worker can make is growing more than workers’ wages each year.”
Slusky said the gap between productivity growth and wage growth means that while workers produce more value, they’re not seeing that value reflected in their paychecks.
Despite doing more than ever, area workers are losing buying power for basic necessities. This makes it increasingly difficult just to stay healthy, put food on the table, take care of your children or keep a roof over your head.
 Housing price spikes


Megan Overfelt moved to Raytown, Missouri, hoping to save money before she bought a home in Johnson County, Kansas, where she grew up.

That was six years ago. She’s watched housing prices soar ever since.
“How do people get ahead in this kind of climate?” Overfelt said. “I was supposed to be here for a year or two to save money. … Now those hopes and dreams seem so far out of reach.”
Overfelt, a data entry worker in her 30s with four children, says her childhood home was approximately 1,500 square feet located in “not a big, fancy, rich part of Johnson County.” Last year it sold for $375,000.
Housing prices in the area have surged beyond what many working families can afford, pushing homeownership further out of reach (File Photo/The Beacon).
According to data from the Greater Kansas City Regional Housing Partnership, nearly two out of three owner-occupied homes are valued at $300,000 or more in Johnson County. The average sale price in the county in October of this year was $465,000, according to Redfin.
“That’s insane to me, I don’t see how normal everyday working families can move up,” Overfelt said. “It’s like we are all just stuck.”
She considers herself lucky to have a landlord who has kept her rent below the median Raytown rent of $1,213 a month. She says she has neighbors with similar layouts who pay up to $1,700 a month.
“I’ve just kind of accepted that we might be renting forever,” Overfelt said.
 Child care can cost a job


Marie H. is a single mother in her 20s who says she had to leave her job because she couldn’t afford child care.
“I’ve always made less than $20 an hour and the cheapest child care I could find was $250 a week,” she said. “I can’t find a job that pays enough to cover that and my other bills.”
Marie H. is a domestic violence survivor who is being referred to by an alias in this article for her safety. She said that after leaving a women’s shelter with her young child she’s taken to delivering food for income.
She brings her child along for deliveries, which saves her the expense of child care. Marie H. said that bends delivery app rules, but it is a risk she has to take. She told The Beacon that the gig work is inconsistent, meaning she’s working with no financial flexibility and most months she’s still falling behind.
Child care costs an average of $23,300 a year in Missouri and $24,400 in Kansas for two children. According to 2022 data from the U.S. Department of Labor, the cost of one infant’s care in Jackson County is the equivalent of 13.5% of median family income in the area.

Childcare costs consume a growing share of family budgets, with Kansas City parents paying thousands annually for care (Vaughn Wheat/The Beacon).
Some parents opt out of the workforce in the face of ever-rising child care prices. The Center for American Progress estimated in 2019 that the national economy sees $57 billion a year in lost revenue, wages and productivity because of parents leaving the workforce.
Marie H. says that she has career goals and is working as much as she can, but her lack of affordable child care is holding her back.
“I’m willing to work, even as a cashier or at McDonald’s or something like that,” she said. “I just need the grace of somebody to help me with child care so I can get on my feet.”
 Health care eating wages


Rising health care costs are another squeeze point for working families. While many in Kansas City dread the prospect of health care premiums doubling next year, growing health care costs are also quietly eroding wages.
Economics professor Slusky said total compensation — a measure that includes wages plus benefits like health care — has more closely tracked productivity than wages alone.

This means employers that provide health care are putting more money towards their employees’ health insurance each year, leaving less money available for wage increases if the employer doesn’t cut elsewhere.
“Health insurance is eating up a greater share of total compensation,” Slusky said.
Kansas City Federal Reserve Senior Vice President A. Lee Smith at the KC Economic Outlook event said that higher input costs are contributing to a job market cooling at the national level. Those higher costs are being driven, in part, by recent Trump administration tariffs and employer health care expenses.
“The employer cost of health benefits is up about 6% over the past year,” Smith said. “Which is a really high pace of increase relative to what we’ve seen over the past 10 years or so.”
Meyers said his family’s health insurance premiums have nearly tripled over the past decade.
“We also just got notified that they’re going to decrease the amount they cover,” Meyers said.
Overfelt says she can afford health insurance for herself through her employer but feels fortunate to receive some federal assistance for her children’s coverage.
“I have no idea what we would do otherwise, because insurance for families through most employers is more than half your paycheck,” Overfelt said.
 Hard choices


For many, living close to the bone financially means choosing which bills to pay. Those hard choices show up in data that tracks financial distress.
Delinquent credit card debt has doubled since 2021 in both Kansas and Missouri. Now one in 20 people with a credit card in those states is 60 days or more behind on payments. The credit card delinquency increases coincide with when food prices began to jump.

Meyers says his grocery budget has nearly doubled — from $200-$300 every other week at Costco to $400-$500 now.
Families navigate grocery shopping as food costs continue to strain household budgets in the area (Chase Castor/The Beacon).
The bigger change is restaurants.
“We almost never eat out anymore,” Meyers said. “We cook pretty much everything at home.”
As a result, Meyers has chef friends he doesn’t see as much anymore.
“I have to tell them: ‘I promise you I’m not ditching you or dodging you,” Meyers said. “I still love you. I still love your food. I miss it. I just, it’s not something we can really do as much anymore.’”
Marie H. said she doesn’t have delinquent debt but she also hasn’t eaten a meal not made in her home for over a year. Financial sacrifices extend to her own health. She doesn’t even think about going to the doctor for herself.
“I basically make just enough to cover my car payment and rent,” Marie H. said. “I have zero left over for anything else.”
The crush over bills for the basics makes it even more difficult to save for a rainy day.
“I don’t think the concept of savings — no matter what level you’re on — is really a thing anymore,” Meyers said.
Overfelt has made belt-tightening decisions for her family as expenses pile up. Some months that has meant canceling a subscription, and sometimes that has meant paying late or only a partial payment until the next paycheck.
“That’s kind of been this entire last year. It’s extremely rough financially just trying to keep up,” Overfelt said. “It’s definitely a juggle each month. A lot of that boils down to making sure that the kids are fed and they have a roof over their head.”
Slusky says the good news is that the resources to address the affordability crisis exist in America. The country’s overall wealth is at an all-time high — but it’s increasingly concentrated.
“The question is what more could be done… to help those least fortunate with these resources, while maintaining the incentive structure that produces that level of wealth,” Slusky said.
He emphasizes the need for predictable, sustainable public policy rather than dramatic changes that create uncertainty for both businesses and workers.
“The resources are there,” Slusky said. “We just need the political will to try to address these concerns.”
Until paychecks catch up or costs come down, about half of Kansas City will keep choosing between eating and healing, between saving and surviving.
“Whenever you’re in a situation like this, it’s 24/7,” Marie H. said. “It’s just work. Or stress about work. Or stress about money, with no break. Everyone deserves time to take a breath.”

A memo issued this month by Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, says that all refugees admitted between Jan. 20, 2021 and February 20, 2025 will have their applications for permanent residency in the United States paused. It asserts that during those years agencies “potentially prioritized expediency, quantity, and admissions over quality interviews and detailed screening and vetting.”
Maggie Mitchell Salem, the executive director of Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services, or IRIS, a New Haven-based resettlement agency, estimated that the reviews could affect about 2,500 people the organization settled between 2021 and 2025. 
Mitchell Salem categorized the review as the latest addition to a long line of new difficulties that refugees will now face. In January, the Trump administration suspended the refugee resettlement program, a move that is being challenged in a lawsuit. 
The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July made refugees ineligible for SNAP benefits, and they will lose eligibility for Medicaid beginning in October 2026. 
“It’s basically telling refugees, ‘Get out,’” said Mitchell Salem. 
The memo casts doubt on the quality of refugee vetting conducted during the Biden years, but Mitchell Salem said the process was comprehensive. 
Refugees to the U.S. have to be reviewed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, a government organization or a nonprofit. They then have to go through a screening process and an interview to explain why they left their country and are afraid to go back. Once they have been determined to be refugees, they have to go through a second U.S. security clearance and can then be connected with a resettlement agency. The U.S. can also prioritize certain refugees based on geographic quotas or regional priorities.
“This process is extensive. It’s multiple agencies that someone has cleared through. There are multiple interviews,” said Mitchell Salem. 
The majority of refugees resettled in Connecticut in 2024 came from Syria. A large number also came from Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela. 
The Administration for Children and Families, in which the Office of Refugee Resettlement operates, did not return a request for comment. 
Rachel Kornfeld, CEO of Jewish Family Services of Greenwich, which has resettled about 2,000 refugees since 2021, said the worst part of this new policy was the uncertainty that it brought to a group of people who had already lived through war, trauma and persecution. 
“ However their path to the U.S. came to be, it was extremely challenging and tenuous,” she said. “And then to finally be in a place of safety, working toward continued independence and building a life, and then for that to be questioned just when you started to feel comfortable and feel safe is absolutely unimaginable.”  
Kornfeld noted that it was also very difficult for refugees who had gone through trauma to be forced to retell their stories over again to people whom they may not trust. 
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he has not seen any evidence to suggest that State Department officials had applied a lower standard during the Biden years. 
“There is not a scintilla of fact to distinguish the process applied since 2021 from the way it functioned before that date under the previous Trump administration,” Blumenthal said. “These refugees are here legally. There’s no indication they are committing criminal offenses or otherwise deserving of this kind of retroactive review, so it seems eminently unnecessary and wasteful.”
Mitchell Salem said the reviews would also contribute to further delays for people who are trying to get their green cards.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0205_SR_IRISVigil_262-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 15:57:36.036454

Advocates worry the change will mean more families will go hungry, and health officials warn of the dangers of malnutrition and food insecurity. The people affected represent about 10% of the state’s residents who receive benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Some organizations are asking state lawmakers to set up ongoing aid for people affected by the policy shift who will no longer qualify for SNAP under the new law.
“When you’ve got a family who are looking at a budget that doesn’t work — their income doesn’t balance with their expenses — they start saying, ‘What can we squeeze?’ Rent is what it is, you have no power to negotiate health insurance premiums, the cost of gas is what it is. One area where families have some flexibility to squeeze a budget down is food,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president and CEO of the United Way of Connecticut.

“They’re going to look for the cheapest options. They don’t have the luxury to look for the most nutritious food for their kids. They look for the cheapest volume of food for the dollar, and that is going to breed all sorts of problems.”
The cuts to food assistance in H.R. 1, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will directly affect about 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness due to new, stricter work requirements for SNAP benefits or other changes. They are expected to lose coverage between Dec. 1 and March 31.
“We’re going to have a whole lot of people who don’t have access to the food they need to stay healthy,” said Sara Parker McKernan, policy advocate for New Haven Legal Assistance. “People are going to eat as frugally as they can, which means a lot of really inexpensive foods that they’re able to buy because they don’t have the advantage of SNAP anymore.”

A call for action
With many poised to lose benefits, advocates are asking elected officials to create a state-funded food assistance program to fill the gap.
Since at least the 1990s, Connecticut had a state-financed food stamp program for legal immigrants who otherwise would have been eligible for the federal program but were excluded by welfare reform legislation in 1996. The legislature in August 2016 directed the state Department of Social Services to stop adding people to the program, though the initiative was funded through 2017, officials with DSS said.
In September, representatives with Greater Hartford Legal Aid, New Haven Legal Assistance and Connecticut Legal Services sent a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont and Democratic legislative leaders asking them to, among other things, establish a state-funded food assistance program for previously eligible legal immigrants and others who may lose SNAP benefits.
“We urge you to address the imminent harm to low-income CT residents that cuts to SNAP in H.R. 1 are poised to inflict. Our low-income clients depend on SNAP benefits to feed themselves and their families and depend on information and resources provided by DSS to access those benefits,” six people with those organizations wrote.
They asked that the issue be addressed in a special session that was held earlier this month, though lawmakers declined to do so. In recent interviews, advocates urged legislators to make it a priority in the regular session that begins in February.
“There is history of [a state-financed program], and we would like to see that again — a new program that essentially picks up all the folks who are no longer eligible for exemptions,” McKernan said. “We’re talking about folks who have been physical laborers their entire life, and all of a sudden, they’re getting to the stage where their bodies are giving out and they can no longer compete with younger workers. We’re talking about folks who have raised their kids or grandkids and now have an empty house and no work history. They may have kids over the age of 14, but they can’t act in that caretaker role and get SNAP.
“There are a lot of reasons why people can’t compete in the job market, and for those who are competing, the work requirements are going to be difficult, because they may have no control over their schedules or the amount of money they’re going to be making.”
H.R. 1 imposes a work requirement on adults 55 through 64 and parents with children 14 and older for the first time. It removes exemptions for veterans, people experiencing homelessness and young people who recently aged out of foster care — exemptions that were added in bipartisan legislation in 2023, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities. Recipients must now document 20 hours of work per week, participate in a narrow set of work activities or prove they qualify for another exemption.
The bill also ends eligibility for many immigrants living lawfully in the U.S. who have been granted humanitarian protection by the federal government, including refugees, people granted asylum and certain survivors of domestic violence and sex trafficking.
Sen. Matthew Lesser, a Democrat from Middletown who is co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said he and his colleagues are interested in exploring a state-funded food assistance program. Launching such an initiative would require money and software upgrades to run it, he said.
“At a time when the federal government is increasingly an unreliable partner, it’s important that we maintain the capacity to feed the residents of this state,” Lesser said. “Every week we find out new critical problems with changes in federal policy that are really hammering low-income people, and we have to figure out what the priorities are. I would argue that food, shelter and health care are all key priorities, food probably first among them.”
House Speaker Matthew Ritter, D-Hartford, pointed to a $500 million emergency fund authorized during the special session this month as one way to help residents losing access to SNAP.
“This is an example of what the fund could be used for,” he said. “Obviously, the governor has a lot of discretion, and we have to vote on it. If the governor were to come to us and say, ‘I’d like to help out these folks who are getting kicked off SNAP,’ I would support that.”
Senate President Pro Tem Martin Looney, D-New Haven, added: “I would support anything that helps us fill in some of the federal cuts, especially regarding food assistance. … To the extent that there are still gaps and problems with access to needed food, I would certainly be supportive if the governor proposes using some of the money set up in that $500 million fund.”
But Ritter warned that funding the program long-term could be too costly.
“The cuts to H.R. 1, if unchanged, by 2028 are billions of dollars, and the state does not have the ability to cover that. No state will,” he said. “But in the short term, while we see what happens in Washington, we have a fund set up to try to help people through that year.”
A spokesman for Lamont said the governor is still reviewing how to use money in the emergency fund.
“The administration is reviewing how best to utilize the $500 million reserve,” the spokesman, Rob Blanchard, said. “We will be announcing actions in the near future.”
Tong, 21 other attorneys general sue over SNAP eligibility guidance
Attorney General William Tong announced Wednesday that he and 21 other attorneys general are suing the federal government, seeking to block new guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that deems some immigrants ineligible for food assistance even after they become permanent residents.
In October, the USDA issued new guidance to state agencies describing changes to SNAP eligibility under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Tong said the memo incorrectly asserted that all individuals who entered the country through certain pathways — including refugees, asylum recipients and others — would remain permanently ineligible for SNAP, even after obtaining green cards and becoming lawful permanent residents. The attorneys general argue the guidance contradicts federal law and could impose large financial penalties on states.
“The Trump Administration cannot help themselves. They are messing with SNAP benefits again. This time they are inventing their own rules to permanently ban legal immigrants — green card holders — from ever receiving food stamps,” Tong said in a statement. “There is zero basis in the law for this cruel move, and we’re suing to stop them.”

Nutrition experts share dangers of malnutrition, food insecurity
As many families brace for the loss of assistance, nutrition experts and health officials warn of malnutrition concerns and the mental health effects of food insecurity.
When people tighten their budgets, they often go without meat and fresh fruit and vegetables. Many cut down on the number of items they purchase or buy more highly processed foods that are shelf stable and last longer, experts said.
That can lead to iron deficiency, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, thinning of the bones, weakness, hair loss and brittle nails, among other symptoms. In children, it can cause developmental delays, trouble concentrating and behavioral problems.
“Malnutrition is always associated with increased health risks,” said Lora Silver, a registered dietician with Yale New Haven Health. “It’s often associated with an inflammatory state or inflammatory activity.
“We have really clear evidence that malnutrition leads to an increased risk of infections. It impairs our immune function. It also puts us at risk for loss of lean muscle mass, and there’s a host of consequences to that, because it impacts our strength, balance and our ability to avoid falls.”
Some families might lean toward purchasing foods that are calorie-dense to maintain their caloric intake but that aren’t nutrient-dense, experts said. That can lead to conditions like obesity, diabetes and heart disease.
“When I was working full-time running a shelter for families experiencing homelessness, this is the part of their budget where they were looking to spend as little as possible so they could maximize what they had for rent,” Tepper Bates said. “What that meant was often, for a family with two small kids, they’re buying a 10-pound bag of white rice and five pounds of the cheapest hamburger meat they can find, and that’s going to be the basis of their food for the week. That is simply not adequate nutrition.”
Health officials say they encourage people to look toward plant-based protein sources, such as beans, legumes and tofu, that might be less costly, and frozen and canned fruits and vegetables, particularly those with less additives.
“I don’t ever tell people they shouldn’t be eating canned vegetables, because if that’s what they can afford, canned vegetables are better than no vegetables,” said Diane Bussolini, a registered dietician with Trinity Health of New England. “Frozen and canned are absolutely fine.
“Also, [I recommend] buying fruits that are in season. So right now, that’s not watermelon, peaches or cherries. It’s spending food dollars on things like apples and pears and mandarins that are in season and lower costs.”
Stress and anxiety often accompany food insecurity, health officials said, and while adults may be managing the money and purchases, children also feel the effects.
“We know that children are more aware of what’s going on in their house than sometimes parents realize. Kids recognize they don’t have enough food, or that parents are stressed out,” said Dr. Jody Terranova, a pediatrician and former president of the Connecticut Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. “There are some increased awareness and distress in children, some increase in anxiety, and in older children, there’s an increase in depression and suicidal symptoms that has been associated with food insufficiency.”
Representatives of the Connecticut Chapter of AAP issued a statement this month saying maintaining access to SNAP benefits is “critical” for the health and well-being of the state’s children.
“We urge the state of Connecticut to protect all children by prioritizing and ensuring access to essential services — starting with maintaining the food services they need to survive and thrive in school and at home,” they wrote. “Food is essential for health. Regardless of … H.R. 1 provisions, we have a duty to ensure continued access to SNAP.”
Health officials also called for more awareness of the mental health consequences of food insecurity.
“We see news reports on the prevalence of reliance on SNAP, or the prevalence of certain budget cuts and the price of food going up,” Silver said. “I wish we were talking more about some way of measuring worry and anxiety, because there are real health impacts to that, and I think adults and children experience that alike.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1105_SR_SNAPFoodPantries_001-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 16:57:39.947065

(Getty Images)The New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department this week announced $390 million in unclaimed property, and urged residents to determine if they have either money or other assets being held by the state.
The state can end up  with unclaimed property through a variety of circumstances, including death, job changes and moves. Such property runs the gamut, from money to uncashed checks to safe deposit box contents and more.
According to a news release, individual claims average $500. So far, this year, Tax and Rev has paid  6,414 claims totaling $18.5 million.
“The Taxation and Revenue Department wants to reunite owners with their lost property,” Taxation and Revenue Department Secretary Stephanie Schardin Clarke said in a statement. “The holiday season can be financially stressful, and there’s no better time to check for unclaimed property to help alleviate some of that stress.”
Search and file claims for property at: nmclaims.unclaimedproperty.com. Those claims can be made online for individuals claiming $500 or less. For those involving multiple owners, businesses or claims over $500, the state says people can submit claims via a PDF form and documentation.
Most claims are processed quickly, the state says, but the department has 90 days from submission to approve or deny it, followed by 30 days to pay it out.

The fund, provided by her parents, Melissa Stanza and Alan Haselhorst, will place an emerging journalist in a yearlong fellowship on the health team at Mississippi Today, beginning in 2026. Application information is available at this link for the fellowship, which offers journalists an immersive experience with the opportunity to report on issues including mental health, maternal health and underserved communities.
Sarah was 31 when she died in 2024 in South Carolina.
She was a native of St. Louis, Missouri and worked in health care before becoming a reporter with a passion for health journalism. She worked at the Clarion Ledger in Jackson from 2021 to 2022, where she covered the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on Mississippians and the health care system, among other pressing health topics. 
“Sarah dedicated so much of her energy and effort to shedding light on and sharing the truth about the realities too many Mississippians face when attempting to access health care, including mental health care,” said Laura Santhanam, Mississippi Today’s health editor. “It is our honor to carry her memory forward with this fellowship and to help early-career journalists continue that important work so more people in Mississippi and beyond can get the help they need.”
A graduate of the University of Missouri’s journalism school, Sarah was committed to truth and persistent in her search for it.
And though Sarah was opinionated, “she made such an effort in her reporting to be fair, to not put her perspective in there, and to give everybody a voice,” Stanza said.  
After leaving Mississippi in 2022 and moving to Hilton Head, South Carolina, to report on climate at The Island Packet, Sarah worked on a story about erosion of a barrier island owned by the University of South Carolina. The island was given to the university with the condition it remain untouched, save for the building of a lab, and that it be used for scientific and educational purposes. 
When Sarah was told she couldn’t visit the island as part of her reporting, she pushed back – and got her first inkling that there was more under the surface. 
She kept digging after publishing the first story. She interviewed the family of Philip Rhodes, the owner of Pritchards Island who donated it to the university decades ago. She also visited the island. Her months-long reporting uncovered disrepair and underfunding, in addition to a little known fact: that the deeds associated with the gift stipulated that if the University of South Carolina did not abide by its rules, Pritchards would go to the University of Georgia, Rhodes’ alma mater. 
A year after Sarah reported that story and others about the island, the South Carolina Legislature, with the support of the governor, passed a bill awarding $500,000 a year in recurring funding for Pritchards Island. The money allowed the university to revive its research efforts, which continue to this day.
A rocking chair bearing a plaque now sits on the front porch of the Beaufort College Building on the historic campus of the University of South Carolina-Beaufort. It reads: “In grateful memory of Sarah Yelena Haselhorst whose writing helped save Pritchards Island.”
The reporting by Sarah had the same kind of impact the journalists at Mississippi Today strive to achieve. The fellow will be urged to work in the same spirit as Sarah: to dig deeper, be persistent and uncover the unknown.
Stanza and Haselhorst said their daughter spoke highly of Mississippi Today when she was working in the state. The respect she held for the newsroom led them to fund a fellowship in her honor. 
“Sarah did not give her praise lightly,” Stanza said. “So when she said something was good, she really believed it was good.” 
A note Sarah wrote to readers and friends when she left Mississippi showed how deeply she was touched by her time in the state and the people she met. 
She wrote beautifully of the tragic, including the COVID-19 death of a 13-year-old girl, and the joyful, including the 100th birthday celebration of a Mississippi Delta native.    
“I hiked up to the Delta and saw high cotton, ate barbecue at a 97-year-old staple and met the bravest woman I’d ever spoken with. I went down to Biloxi to lie on the hottest sand my feet had ever encountered. Then ate some damn good fish tacos,” Sarah wrote. “I spent time with nurses, farmers, Freedom Riders, activists, people experiencing homelessness, people with fancy titles and those who were too young to talk.”
She also wrote: “The Delta is more breathtaking than you’d ever imagine. The politics more divisive. The heat and humidity more cloying. But at the crux of it all are the people. Mississippians are gracious. They share. They’re natural-born storytellers. And the people I spoke to on a regular basis craved good change.”
Stanza said Sarah always longed to return to Mississippi and to health journalism.
“It was her dream,” she said. “And in a way, now, she’s doing it.”

The Venezuelan nationals were deported under an obscure wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act.“After receiving that legal advice, Secretary Noem directed that the AEA detainees who had been removed from the United States before the Court’s order could be transferred to the custody of El Salvador,” according to the DOJ filing. “That decision was lawful and was consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the Court’s order.”Noem’s decision sent 137 Venezuelan men to a mega-prison for months until the Venezuelan government could broker a prison swap with El Salvador and the United States to have the men returned. In an emergency March 15 order, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said the planes carrying the Venezuelans had to return to the United States.They did not have the opportunity to challenge their removal, which was a violation of their due process rights, the American Civil Liberties Union has argued in its case against the Trump administration. Tuesday’s filing represents a shift in legal strategy from the administration, which had initially argued that because Boasberg’s order was verbal and not written, his temporary restraining order carried no weight. Contempt probeThe filing comes after Boasberg resumed a contempt investigation to identify the Trump administration officials involved in authorizing the Venezuelans’ removals.Last week, Boasberg ordered the administration to submit filings on how to proceed with the contempt inquiry.“I certainly intend to find out what happened that day,” Boasberg said last week.Tuesday’s filing argued that contempt proceedings are not needed and that “the Government maintains that its actions did not violate the Court’s order.”The ACLU, which is representing the deported men, in its filing on the contempt issue urged Boasberg to request testimony from nine current and former officials from the Homeland Security and Justice departments. The ACLU also said the government should identify “all individuals involved in the decision… regardless of whether they were the ultimate decision-maker or had direct input into the decision, as well as all those with knowledge of the decision-making process.”Once those people had been identified, Boasberg could determine in what order testimony should be gathered.",,,,2025-11-26 12:58:16.098267

Alabama’s largest electric utility has proposed delaying an approved rate increase for an extra year amid a public outcry surrounding high utility bills.
Alabama Power customers will still see an increase in bills stemming from the company’s $622 million purchase of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station earlier this year, but not for another year, if the plan is approved by the state’s Public Service Commission.
The rate increase, which Alabama Power said will raise an average customer’s bills by about $3.32 per month, was originally slated to go into effect in January 2027.

“Alabama Power made an informational filing with the Alabama Public Service Commission as part of our ongoing discussions about ways to help customers manage their power bills,” the company said in an emailed statement. “We know budgets are tight, and power bills are a real concern for many families and businesses.”
Alabama Power submitted the proposal in an informational filing with the PSC late last week.
A spokesperson for the PSC said that the proposal will “likely” be presented to the commission at its next regular meeting on Dec. 2.
“The Commissioners could approve the proposal in its current form, offer modifications to the proposal, reject the proposal or table the proposal, pending further information,” the spokesperson said via email. “Either action will require a vote.”
Environmental watchdog groups that follow the PSC cautioned that customers may still see rate increases over the next two years, even if the proposal is approved.
Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said that Alabama Power customers’ bills include numerous rate schedules, many of which were not included in the proposal.
“To fully understand the impact of Alabama Power’s proposal, customers deserve full bill transparency, including a breakdown of each rate included in the bill and how much a customer pays for each rate,” Tidwell said in an email. “Without this information, it is difficult to understand how much of the bill will be frozen. In addition, ratepayers deserve a thorough, transparent review of Alabama Power’s proposal to determine whether rates should actually be lowered rather than held steady.”
Daniel Tait, executive director of Energy Alabama, a nonprofit advocacy organization, said no costs were being waived, only pushed down the road.
“The fine print shows it’s a deferral strategy, not a reduction,” Tait said. “It’s just a broken attempt to help the utility weather a storm of criticism for its high bills and abnormally high profits.”
Alabama Power’s electric rates have been under scrutiny especially since new data center projects could significantly increase demand in the state for the first time in decades.
An Inside Climate News analysis showed that Alabama Power residential customers paid, on average, the highest total electric bills in the nation, thanks to slightly above average rates and extremely high electricity usage.
U.S. Sen. Katie Britt, R-Alabama, said on a recent press call that she wanted assurances that the costs of new data centers will not be passed on to customers.
“We have the highest power rates in the Southeast,” Britt said. “I think that is unacceptable.”
Alabama Power has said repeatedly that new data center customers will “pay the full, fair cost to serve their needs,” including the costs of new infrastructure to meet the demand.
New PSC President Cynthia Lee Almond, appointed earlier this year by Gov. Kay Ivey, published an op-ed highlighting the need to protect Alabama Power customers from rising rates due to data centers.
“Utility bills have spiked in some states as residential and small  business customers subsidize the infrastructure investments needed to accommodate big tech,” Almond wrote. “We have a chance to learn from their challenges and avoid them here. Alabama’s main challenge and my priority is clear: make sure our families and small businesses don’t get stuck with the bill.”
In addition to delaying the rate increase from the Lindsay Hill plant, Alabama Power’s proposal would also lock in environmental compliance costs and the fuel cost factor at current levels through 2027.
The company said to make those commitments, it sought permission from the PSC to apply potential customer refunds next year to its natural disaster reserve fund instead, and to use funds from a federal nuclear production tax credit to offset retail costs.
“The filing outlines commitments aimed at providing more certainty and predictability around electric rates at a time when many other costs are rising,” the company said. “We look forward to continuing our dialogue with the Commission on an issue that matters deeply to customers across Alabama.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lindsay-Hill-Power-Station-for-Nov-26-2025-story-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-26 12:58:16.098267

Department of Veterans Affairs)Caring for South Carolina’s elderly veterans has been one Upstate company’s focus for nearly three decades. A recent state contract will further extend that streak.
Anderson-headquartered HMR Veterans Services operates four of South Carolina’s six nursing homes for veterans.
The company started with the Richard M. Campbell Veterans Nursing Home, located in Anderson and named for the brother of the late former Gov. Carroll Campbell: U.S. Army Sgt. Richard Campbell was killed in action in May 1968 in Vietnam.
HMR has run Campbell’s namesake home since 1998 and will continue to do so through at least February 2033, along with Veterans Victory House in Walterboro. HMR has held contracts on the Lowcountry home since 2007.
For its services at the two homes, HMR will receive an estimated $375 million over seven years, paid by state and federal taxes.
HMR was the lowest bidder of three finalists for contracts starting March 1. In the first year, its rate of $333 per bed per day compared to the high bid of $425 per bed per day, according to documents provided to the SC Daily Gazette in a public records request.
Contracts for two other homes HMR runs — one in Gaffney and one in Florence — are out for bid now.
Outside the Palmetto State, HMR also runs all five of Alabama’s veterans homes and six out of 10 in Texas.
That brings the company’s total to 15 homes with 3,000 employees across three states.
SC’s investment in veterans
In SC, hundreds of veterans go homeless. These groups received state money to help.

For all six homes in South Carolina, taxpayers spend about $80 million annually to collectively care for roughly 800 veterans, according to Heyward Hilliard, director of veterans’ homes for the South Carolina Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
In a state with 400,000 veterans, the homes always have a waiting list, he said.
Future expansions, including new homes planned for Orangeburg and Horry counties and a replacement of a Columbia home with a newer facility planned for Lexington County, will eventually increase capacity to more than 1,080 veterans.
Gov. Henry McMaster has backed these veterans’ homes in his budget recommendations. That includes a 2024 call for the Legislature to set aside $41 million for the state’s share of the future Lexington facility and $8 million for renovations at existing homes. The Legislature’s final budget last year matched that request.
“The governor believes veterans bring great value to South Carolina,” said his spokesman, Brandon Charochak. “We’re a military friendly state and part of the reason for that are state veterans’ homes.”
The construction timeline of those new homes depends on congressional spending, since federal taxes cover 65% of the cost. South Carolina must kick in the other 35%. Total funding could be five years away, Hilliard said.
A focus on veterans
Operating homes for veterans is the only thing HMR does, which makes the company unique nationwide, Russell Keogler, vice president of corporate operations, told the SC Daily Gazette.
“There are competitors out there, but their main focus is on traditional nursing homes,” Keogler said. “For us, this is all we do and all we do every day.”
That gives HMR an advantage when it comes to meeting the unique needs of veterans, according to Keogler.
HMR has specialists on hand to treat illnesses more common to veterans, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. As Vietnam and Korean War veterans are aging, they are also facing more health complications from exposure to toxins, such as Agent Orange used during the war to remove trees and foliage in the dense jungle battlegrounds.
The House’s chief budget writer, Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister, said it makes sense to have specialized homes with staff to meet veteran-specific needs rather than caring for them alongside the rest of the state’s elderly population.
“South Carolina has a very long and proud history of supporting veterans,” said the Greenville Republican. “And we like the idea of taking care of veterans after their service.”
Plus, South Carolina’s military bases are major economic drivers for the state, he said.
Veterans’ homes are just one way lawmakers seek to attract veterans to the Palmetto State or, if they’re here already, keep them and their skills in South Carolina after they retire. Under a 2022 law, military retirees pay no state income taxes on pensions earned for at least 20 years of service.
“If they knew there was a robust veterans home resource, that would be a favorable consideration when thinking about where to spend their retirement years once they’re out (of the military),” Bannister said.
A company history
Still, HMR wasn’t always just a veterans-based company.
Michael McBride, a nursing home administrator, founded it as Health Management Resources, Inc., in 1993, after leasing his first six nursing homes.
Its first veterans’ home, the Campbell facility, became part of the portfolio in 1998, seven years after it opened. That’s also when Army veteran William Biggs, the husband of freshman U.S. Rep. Sheri Biggs, joined as CEO. He had been the administrator of the home in Anderson when HMR took over the contract.
At one point, HMR had as many as 27 veteran and non-veteran facilities across five states, according to McBride’s biography on the company website. In 2010, the company sold 21 hospice, rehab and pharmacy locations to a private equity firm but held on to the veterans’ services side of the business.
McBride continues to sit on HMR’s board of directors, as does the widow of another HMR co-founder, Ed Childress.
William Biggs retired and Ladeeb Diab replaced him as CEO in May 2023. Eight months later, Biggs’ wife launched her campaign for the ruby red congressional seat being vacated by Rep. Jeff Duncan, who chose not to seek an eighth term. Sheri Biggs, a nurse practitioner, emerged the winner of a seven-way GOP primary contest in June 2024. Her 3rd District win last November sent two South Carolina women to Congress for the first time ever.
William Biggs declined to comment for this article, citing a noncompete agreement he signed upon retirement that prevents him from speaking about the company.
The congresswoman, in financial disclosures filed last month, reported more than $4 million in income in 2024 from the sale of her husband’s minority interest in HMR businesses.
Members of Congress are required to annually disclose their finances. But they’re only required to report a range of how much their assets and liabilities are worth, so the couple’s exact earnings are unknown. But she valued the capital gains from each of four HMR businesses at more than $1 million.
‘Push the envelope’
Keogler said HMR has sought to “push the envelope” in other ways as well.
For example, at the request of states it contracts with, HMR began running its own pharmacies at its homes, instead of calling in prescriptions from elsewhere.
“We can do all of our medication reviews right in house, and our pharmacists actually know the residents,” he said. “It’s no longer just filling a prescription. It’s taking care of a veteran who you see every day.”
HMR also weathered staffing shortages exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It does so through a scholarship program, paying for the education of any certified nursing assistant employed by the company who wants to pursue a higher-level licensed practical nursing degree.
New SC law aims to ensure no veteran dies without proper recognition

“We help cover the cost of their tuition and books. We provide them a mentor to help guide them through the program, all while they can continue to work on this flexed academic schedule that builds professional growth for the individual and provides us a constant source of new nurses,” Keogler said. “I think it’s those innovative practices, which we’ve accelerated over the last two years, that really caught the attention of our state partners.”
A huge cost benefit
There are other reasons South Carolina’s more than 386,000 veterans and their families may choose a veterans home.
“It’s really camaraderie and connection,” Keogler said. “There’s a true brotherhood that exists in the service and that comes out later on in life.”
Also, there’s a huge cost benefit to families when they select a state veterans home. With military service benefits, their cost is far less than that of a traditional nursing home.
The federal government pays states a daily rate which can cover up to 50% of the homes’ operating costs. For veterans deemed at least 70% disabled due to injuries related to their military service, their cost is covered in full, Hilliard said.
The remaining costs are covered by state taxes or by the veterans themselves, said Hilliard, who was previously HMR’s executive vice president of operations. He joined the state agency in April 2024 after it took over the homes’ operations from the state mental health agency.

Above average
South Carolina also is in the minority of states — one of 13 — that pay private contractors to run all of its homes, though more states are trending that direction, Hilliard said.
While private contractors run the homes, the state public health agency and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are tasked with inspecting them. And the state veterans agency employs someone on site at each home, Hilliard said.
“Our homes consistently perform at or above national averages,” he said.
Three of the four HMR-run homes in South Carolina have recently received high marks.
State and federal regulators inspected the Anderson and Walterboro homes seven times over the past four years. Some reviews were the result of complaints and required the homes to make improvements. But each received a government rating of four out of five stars.
The Gaffney home has gone through four inspections and one improvement plan in that time and has a perfect rating.
The Florence home, however, sits at a two out of five. Federal reports site shortfalls in a handful of patient treatment plans for residents with medical issues including diabetes, a feeding tube and ulcers and bedsores.
The state home in Columbia, which is run by Avalon Health Care Group rather than HMR, also has a two-star rating. The same group also runs the state’s newest veterans’ home in Sumter, which opened in January. It hasn’t been rated yet.

HMR also made headlines in 2018, when the wife of a U.S. Air Force veteran alleged her husband suffered repeat infections, hospitalizations and unexplained bruises while he was in the Walterboro home, the Independent Mail reported.
And in May 2018, HMR settled a $425,000 lawsuit involving a veteran at the Anderson home who had a latex glove lodged in his airway. He died five days later.
Hilliard, who was still working for HMR at the time, told the Independent Mail: “Health care is a very litigious environment. A settlement does not constitute an admission of liability.”
State Department of Public Health investigations around this time found 13 violations involving “policies and procedures, staff training, resident records, resident care and medication administration.” The agency fined HMR $3,600.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RICHARD-M.-CAMPBELL-VETERANS-NURSING-HOME.jpg,,,2025-11-26 12:58:16.098267

Ned Lamont ended months of controversy and speculation Wednesday when he signed a new version of a bill he vetoed this past summer.,"After months of negotiations and debate, Gov. Ned Lamont has signed a controversial omnibus bill that aims to address Connecticut’s dire lack of affordable housing.
Lawmakers passed House Bill 8002 during the special session earlier this month, and Lamont signed it into law Wednesday morning, after receiving it from the Senate on Tuesday. The bill expands fair rent commissions, eliminates most off-street parking requirements for smaller housing developments and requires towns to create housing growth plans, among other measures.
[What to know about the CT housing bill passed in special session]
Lamont vetoed a similar bill that his office had worked to negotiate in June, after the regular session. The governor said he wanted to see a bill that had more town buy-in and called a two-day special session for earlier this month to give lawmakers time to work on revising the legislation.
After months of negotiations, the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and Council of Small Towns stood alongside Lamont at a press conference a few weeks ago to support the new bill.
“This bill tells mayors and first selectmen ‘What do you want your town to look like in five or 10 years? Start planning accordingly. Where do you want that housing to go? Are you going to zone accordingly? What else do you need? We want to be your partner,’” said Lamont at the press conference.
While some Democratic lawmakers said the negotiated bill wasn’t as strong as the one they originally passed, they think it will go a long way toward addressing the affordable housing need in Connecticut.
Homelessness has increased over the past few years, and rent prices have risen. Most studies estimate the state lacks more than 100,000 units of housing that are affordable and available to its low-income renters.
The bill has sparked fierce opposition from groups that say it weakens local control and puts onerous burdens on towns. Republican lawmakers voted against the bill and criticized the process of passing a bill in special session, which they said did not incorporate enough input from the public.
Lamont is expected to hold a public bill signing next week, said spokesman Rob Blanchard.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0073-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 12:58:16.098267

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Director Terry Gray had reason for optimism when he and other state administrators kicked off their work in November 2024 charting a path to achieving the state’s decarbonization mandates.
“When we first started working on this, Trump hadn’t taken office,” Gray, who heads a consortium of state agencies overseeing the implementation of Rhode Island’s Act on Climate law, said in an interview Wednesday. “We still had very strong federal policies, federal authorities and grants in place. Those three things were really, very important.”

Public comments on the state’s 2025 draft climate action strategy report can be submitted online at https://climatechange.ri.gov/act-climate/public-comment. Supplemental materials are also available online.

On Tuesday, the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council released a draft of its first comprehensive review of existing progress and future forecasting to help achieve the state’s net-zero emissions law. The 31-page report is open for public comment through Dec. 10.
And as Gray wrote in his opening letter, recent shifts in federal policy and funding have eroded his confidence in achieving Rhode Island’s aggressive emissions reduction plan.
“These shifts will have devastating and immediate consequences for Rhode Island’s climate planning,” Gray wrote. “While this Strategy focuses on impacts to our climate-change portfolio, the broader federal rollbacks are poised to trigger severe disruptions across energy, environmental protection, health care, and food-security systems, placing extraordinary strain on state agencies and undermining long-standing strategic investments.”
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act yanked more than $75 million in federal funding to Rhode Island for clean energy programs and related research and infrastructure projects. Before that, Biden-era federal tax credits for renewable energy were canceled, more stringent state vehicle emissions standards paused and offshore wind projects set to power New England’s grid were halted or pulled back. Even the federal grants for the climate council to hire a consultant to model state emissions output in future years were temporarily frozen. 
“We’re trying to figure out ways to do this without necessarily direct monetary incentives everywhere,” Gray said.
Asked what alternative, nonfinancial incentives might be, Gray responded “I don’t know. That’s what we’re working through.”
And yet, Rhode Island still must meet the legally binding mandate to reduce carbon emissions, with the first benchmark in 2030.  
“Rhode Island will forge ahead in the face of this shifting landscape and continue to collaborate across all agencies in 2026 and beyond,” the report states.
The council is charged with updating its assessment in subsequent reports issued every five years through the 2050 deadline for completion.

Establishing the goal line 
As of 2023 — the most recent data available — Rhode Island produced 9.52 million metric tons of carbon, 19.5% less than the 1990 levels used as a baseline, according to data collected and analyzed by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The emissions inventory report published last week stressed the need to accelerate incentives and policies that promote a clean energy transition, warning that the existing pace of progress was not enough to meet the first incremental benchmark in 2030. 
However, according to the climate council’s models, Rhode Island will meet the 2030 benchmark, which calls for reducing total emissions 45% from the 1990 baseline. This is largely thanks to state incentive programs and policy choices, such as discounts for property owners to switch to heat pumps, weatherize and make their homes energy efficient, and buy or lease battery-powered and hybrid cars, the report stated.
But achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 remains just of reach without “additional ambition,” the council’s draft strategy report states. The report outlines broad steps to speed up the clean energy transition, targeting the biggest culprits of carbon emissions: transportation, home heating and electricity use.
“We still have the challenge of ‘how do we achieve this,’ but at least now we kind of all know what the goal line is,” Gray said of the strategy report. 










We still have the challenge of ‘how do we achieve this,’ but at least now we kind of all know what the goal line is. 


– Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Director Terry Gray


In order to achieve the 2050 net-zero mandate, for example, Rhode Island needs to accelerate its adoption of hybrid and battery-powered vehicles, including cars, trucks, and off-road sources like boats and airplanes. Specifically, the report recommends nearly tripling annual electric vehicle sales, from the 13,000 sold this year in the state to 36,000 by 2030.
Gray is eyeing the transportation sector with extra concern, noting that Trump has sought to repeal federal waivers letting states, including Rhode Island, adopt more stringent vehicle emissions standards. 
Much of Rhode Island’s ability to achieve reductions in transportation sector emissions relies on its authority to set lower emissions standards for new cars and trucks. 
“Especially when we look beyond 2030, we have a significant challenge in reducing transportation emissions,” Gray said.
Federal rollbacks have not cooled the state’s incentive program to help property owners convert from oil or gas to electric-powered heat pumps. But surging winter electricity prices have dissuaded some heat pump converts from using their new systems, Gray said. 
“We need stability and certainty in electric rates so people actually use their heat pumps,” he said. 
Meanwhile, the heat is on to keep selling these greener home heating alternatives. 
Every home and business in Rhode Island must have a heat pump installed by 2050 to meet the decarbonization mandate, per report modeling. Achieving this overhaul requires increasing heat pump sales from the 3,000 sold in 2025 to 15,000 a year by 2030, according to the report.

Sticker shock 
Convincing cash-strapped consumers and business owners to look to long-term savings versus the upfront costs of a hybrid car or heat pump conversion is not easy, Gray acknowledged. Cost was a top concern cited by residents in a series of community meetings organized by the climate change council this fall.
“There’s got to be more hesitancy now to say ‘where is this all going’ given the rhetoric coming out of the federal government,” Gray said.
But there is also a price for doing nothing — $940 million in “social costs” by 2050, according to the report.
“Decarbonization reduces spending on fossil fuels, avoids the economic and health damages caused by climate change, and delivers cleaner air and healthier communities across the state,” the report states. 
Going green will also boost the state economy, adding an estimated 6,500 jobs by 2035 for work on offshore wind projects, battery storage and residential heating and cooling, the report states. 
The report concludes with a call to action. 
“The decarbonization and transition of our economy must be done carefully, and deliberately with affordability in mind, to meet the goals set forth in the Act on Climate,” it states. “It is important to emphasize that acting on climate change cannot be championed by state government alone. Businesses, municipalities, nonprofit leaders and residents will continue to be called up to prioritize action towards the goals of the Act on Climate.”

VoteVets, which endorsed Askins, is considered a major player in some Democratic primary races. Recently two candidates backed by the organization won their gubernatorial race, former Navy helicopter pilot Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and former CIA officer Rep.

Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd District is a crucial race for national Democratic hopes to retake the House in 2026. Democrats feel optimistic with Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon retiring. 
Askins is a part of a national Democratic strategy of promoting veterans to run in battleground districts in next year’s midterms as a throwback to a strategy that helped Democrats win control of the House in 2018.  She said she was proud to have “VoteVets by my side as we fight for the future Nebraskans deserve.” 
“From leading missions in Iraq and in support of Afghanistan, to serving at the Department of Veterans Affairs, to now running to represent Nebraskans in Congress, I’ve dedicated myself to a life of service,” Askins said.
Askins still has to navigate a primary with other Democratic candidates with higher name ID and more local ties. 
She is in a Democratic primary with business owner and political action committee co-founder Denise Powell, State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades, former congressional staffer James Leuschen and former immigration attorney Evangelos Argyrakis.
The winner of the Democratic May 12 primary will face the winner of a GOP primary featuring Omaha City Council Member Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha.

Here's what to know.","When Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam announced the pause of state-funded renovations for six public schools in September, the decision surprised the Board of Education and the Hartford School Building Committee.
They had voted in favor of the renovations, along with the City Council, to Moylan Elementary, Parkville Community, McDonough Middle, S.A.N.D, Maria C. Colon Sanchez Elementary and Batchelder schools. 
And state funding was already approved.
School renovations were part of an effort to bring Hartford residents back to study in the district. Over the past four years approximately 5,000 students moved out of the city, with many relocating to places like New Britain, East Hartford, and Manchester, according to an analysis of student enrollment trends by Caitlin Richard, chief financial officer of Hartford Public Schools, shown at a Board of Education meeting in November.
The district faces a projected budget deficit of approximately $30 million, which Richard said would be addressed if more Hartford children attended Hartford Public Schools.
Here’s what we know about the pause on school renovations.
Why did Hartford public schools plan renovations?
The projects were meant to address long-standing issues in Hartford Public Schools’ buildings including leaking roofs and outdated HVAC systems and to incorporate state-of-the-art facilities. Board of Education Chair Shonta Browdy says the lack of updated facilities push away Hartford residents to districts that already provide these.
Renovations aim to address current low enrollment in Hartford’s public schools.
What is the school construction process and at what point was it paused?
It is a long process that includes multiple stakeholders who propose, oversee and approve school construction renovation projects.
First, the school district identifies the need for renovations. Consultants and other professionals may be involved with the documentation process, considering student enrollment, building needs and academic programs.
Then the Board of Education prepares educational specifications of project costs and eight-year enrollment figures. Once the city approves those, the board and the City Council are authorized to submit a grant application to the state, and the Office of School Construction Grants & Review evaluates the proposal.
If the proposal is approved — like it was in the case of the six public schools in Hartford — the state issues a grant letter of commitment. The city’s school building committee further hires program and construction managers, and architects. 
Next, before bidding for the construction work begins, which is authorized by the state’s school construction office, designs are made, reviewed and approved. Construction then is supposed to start.
The projects were paused near the very end of the process. Construction companies already had bid and a design request for proposal for the schools was voted on by the Hartford School Building Committee.
Here are the names of the chosen construction companies, according to information provided by Browdy:

S.A.N.D has a contract with Colliers;
Sanchez Elementary and Batchelder schools with Arcadis and O&G;
McDonough Middle with PDS Engineering and Construction Inc.;
Parkville Community with 7 Summits Construction;
and Moylan Elementary with Newfield Construction.

What does the mayor say about his reasoning for pausing the school renovations?
Cristian Corza-Godinez, city of Hartford spokesperson, said in a written statement that “the status quo” is not working for students, and so the mayor is working on a 5-year plan to turn schools into centers of excellence. He said that requires conversations around whether the city is stretching resources too thin in under-enrolled schools. 
Corza-Godinez said that until the city has a plan to address this, pausing school construction is the responsible decision. 
“If we use state dollars to carry out these six construction projects, Hartford taxpayers will be on the hook for twenty years and will have to pay back those dollars if any of those six schools move in a different direction over the next two decades,” he said.
At the school building committee meeting on Oct. 20, Lori Mizerak, the city’s corporation counsel, stated that she sent a memo on Oct. 17 about what the city plans to do to evaluate all city schools facing budgeting issues. The memo is not publicly available.
What are the next steps for these projects moving forward?
As of now, the renovations are on pause and there is not a set date for them to resume construction.
Arulampalam said the city wants to resume construction as quickly as it can, and he hopes that all the parties will come to the table collaborate on a plan that provides better educational outcomes for Hartford students, so that they can offer not just better looking buildings, but also “substantially better education.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7869-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-26 11:58:32.655453

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Caitlynn Belliveau made a comfortable salary as a human resources specialist at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Sioux Falls — enough to support her four children and husband as the sole income earner and make the mortgage payments on their Worthing house.
But when the Trump administration offered her a buyout — officially called a deferred resignation — she took it, receiving four months of paid leave in exchange for quitting her job. She feared she could lose her job abruptly later if she didn’t accept.
After those payments stopped, Belliveau applied for food assistance.


From insiders to ousted
This is the third of four stories about federal government employees or contractors in South Dakota affected by the Trump administration’s reduction of the federal workforce.
Read the series >


She finally started work as an educational support professional for the Sioux Falls School District this month after over a dozen interviews in the last three months went nowhere in what she called a “hellscape of a job market.” More than a million workers have been laid off across the country this year, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, making this year the worst for layoff notices since 2009.
Within that number are the roughly 154,000 federal employees who took deferred resignations offered by the Trump administration earlier this year as a way to reduce the size of the federal workforce. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told Fox Business in August he expects the total decrease in the federal workforce to reach more than 300,000 eventually.
While Belliveau is working in the school district, she’s also working toward her second master’s degree in teaching (her first master’s was in higher education administration) in hopes of improving her prospects. She’s considering moving out of the state or country in hopes of finding better employment.
The 38-year-old is struggling to figure out the best path forward to support her family.
“Federal workers have families and mortgages and need to eat and pay bills,” she said.
While the Trump administration has described its actions as dismantling bureaucracy, Belliveau disputes that characterization.
“We’re not dismantling bureaucracy,” she said. “We’re laying people off. No other company could lay off hundreds of thousands of people without the public being up in arms. It’s crazy to me that this is being celebrated or something they’re proud about.”
The Trump administration’s cuts and layoffs “waged war on federal employees,” she said, and will hurt taxpayers.
“The bureaucracy will remain, but there will be fewer people who know how to navigate that bureaucracy,” Belliveau said.
Belliveau had planned to retire from her federal career. She is a subject matter expert on employee and labor relations. Getting rid of people like her opens up agencies to liability, she said, since it takes years to become an expert on such “incredibly complicated and delicate” subjects.
“You have supervisors who are used to having someone like myself saying, ‘You can’t do that because of this law, regulation or section in a master agreement,’” Belliveau said. “It will cost us more.”

Family, arts community remember ‘shining light’ who believed theatre could change a child’s life
WILMINGTON, Del. — Marie Swajeski, founder of the Delaware Children’s Theatre and a pioneering force in Delaware’s arts community for more than five decades, has died, her family announced yesterday.
The news was shared in a Facebook post by her daughter, Donna Marie Swajeski, who now serves as artistic director of the Delaware Children’s Theatre and has carried on her mother’s mission to bring live theatre to young audiences.
“Our beloved mother and founder of the Delaware Children’s Theatre, Marie Swajeski has peacefully passed this morning,” Donna wrote. “Marie touched so many lives and hearts. She was a shining light in our community and will never be forgotten. As her children, we are shattered, but are so proud to have had her with us for the time we had.”
Funeral information will be announced later, the family said, but a memorial gathering at the theatre is planned so friends, former cast members and audience families can come together to remember her. In lieu of flowers, the family requested donations to her “cherished Delaware Children’s Theatre.”
The Delaware Children’s Theatre on Pennsylvania Avenue in Wilmington, Delaware, was founded by Marie Swadeski.
A life spent building theatre for children
Swajeski founded what was then the Children’s Repertory Theatre in the early 1970s with a simple but ambitious vision: to introduce children to the performing arts and spark a lifelong love of theatre and music.
Rehearsing at first in basements and garages, she built a touring company that brought professional-quality productions to schools, parks, hospitals, retirement communities and nursing homes across Delaware. In its first decade, the company staged more than 700 performances for more than 90,000 children, earning critical praise and a loyal following among families.
Her belief, colleagues often said, was that any child in the audience—or on stage—might have their life changed by what they experienced at the theatre.
In the early 1980s, Marie and her husband, John, bought the historic New Century Club building on Delaware Avenue, saving it from demolition and transforming it into the permanent home of what became the Delaware Children’s Theatre. The Victorian theatre house, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, has remained both an arts hub and a preserved historic landmark under the Swajeskis’ care.
Honors and impact
Over the years, Swajeski’s work drew recognition well beyond Wilmington. In 2004, then-U.S. Sen. Tom Carper had September 18 proclaimed “Marie Swajeski Day” and entered the tribute into the Congressional Record, honoring her decades of service to children and the arts.  She was inducted into the Hall of Fame of Delaware Women in 2019 for her lifelong contributions to theatre and youth.
Under her leadership, Delaware Children’s Theatre became a launching pad for countless young performers, including future Tony Award winner John Gallagher Jr., who first appeared there as Tom Sawyer.
The theatre has staged a wide range of productions, from classics such as Charlotte’s Web to big family favorites like Shrek the Musical, along with original works written by Donna, including the Snow White musical One Magic Kiss that premiered at DCT.
Legacy carried on by her children
Today, Delaware Children’s Theatre is led by Marie’s children, Donna and David Swajeski. Donna, an Emmy-winning television writer and longtime artistic director, oversees programming and original works, while David works to preserve and maintain the historic theatre building.
That made Donna’s Facebook tribute especially poignant to many in the arts community, who see her as the standard-bearer of her mother’s legacy.
“Marie touched so many lives and hearts,” Donna wrote. “She was a shining light in our community and will never be forgotten.”
The Delaware Children’s Theatre continues to offer affordable, family-focused productions, workshops and outreach programs, reflecting Marie Swajeski’s enduring belief that the arts can build confidence, imagination and community for every child who walks through its doors.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Swajeskis.webp,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

While the Montana Secretary of State touted “only one percent” of ballots rejected due to missing or mismatched birth year, the individual county statistics show a different story, adding extra costs and labor to counties across the state as they worked to resolve the rejected ballots. 
“663 rejected ballots is definitely an uptick,” said Flathead County Election Administrator Debbie Pierson, pointing out that the voters of Flathead County reduced the number of rejected ballots due to signature mismatch by 50% when compared to the school district election that took place earlier this year. 
“The city council election only had 198 ballots rejected due to signature versus 391 due to signature rejection in the school board race,” Pierson said. “Most of our increase (in rejected ballots) this time came from birth year.” 
“The law requires us to reach out to every person whose ballot is rejected in the most expedient method possible,” explained Missoula County Deputy Elections Administrator Nathan Coyan. “And so what we do to cover everyone is every person whose ballot is rejected gets a letter at the very least.”
Of Missoula County’s initial 1,090 rejected ballots, 694 (64%) were due to errors in birth year, costing the county an additional $513 on letters sent to voters. In Gallatin County, 76% of their initial 820 rejected ballots were due to birth year, costing the county an additional $463 on letters. Yellowstone County spent $851 on letters due to the same issue and Flathead County spent $215. In total, counties across Montana spent a little more than $2,600 on letters to voters whose ballots were rejected due to birth year. 
Some counties, like Lewis and Clark, ran an early information campaign ahead of the general election, using the primary election as an opportunity to give voters a test-run with the new ballot requirement. 
Lewis and Clark County Elections Division Supervisor Connor Fitzpatrick explained there were two parts to their strategy: First, a “soft launch,” where voters received inserts with new instructions in their ballot packets explaining the birth year requirement, as well as a ballot following the new template sent out by the Secretary of State that voters would use in November general election. 
“We weren’t checking birth year for September because it wasn’t in play yet,” explained Fitzpatrick. “But we wanted to get them visually used to the thing. We were like, ‘Hey, that is going to kick into place Oct. 1.’”
The second step was a mailer sent to each address involved in the election for the city of Helena and the city of East Helena. 
“That was sent strategically a week before ballots were mailed out,” said Fitzpatrick.
The total cost of the campaign was $2,020.48, and resulted in Lewis and Clark having one of the lowest rejected ballot rates among larger counties in the state, at only 0.97%. 
  Staff Labor 

In addition to letters and early campaigns to notify voters of the upcoming changes, were supplementary staff costs that many counties found difficult to estimate. 
“It took me all day, all of my days, from when we started,” said Cascade County Elections Specialist Gretchen Yowell. “I did them in batches and I would call daily, and go through every single thing they (the voters) had ever given us to try to contact them.”
Cascade County initially had 547 rejected ballots, 305 (56%) due to birth year. They resolved all rejected ballots but 309.
“We filtered them out by what was missing so we could see what was missing first. Birth year was the first thing I could tackle, and then we could specify signature mismatches. And once the birth year was verified we sent them back through the process,” explained Yowell. “And it takes a minute, because everything has to go into the system, so that way if someone goes on the SOS website they can see it has been rejected.”
Missoula County couldn’t estimate the exact cost, but Coyan reported the effort to resolve ballots took up the majority of staff time. 
“It became the project that everyone was working on,” said Coyan. “Anyone who was available got pulled into it. Even I was working on it. It was crazy.” 
Yellowstone County Elections Administrator Dayna Causby estimated additional staff costs at $3,500, but emphasized this was only for temporary workers and didn’t include the time full-time staff spent away from their usual designated tasks to focus on resolving rejected ballots.
“That was one of the main reasons that we decided to use a ballot drop-off location, because of the birth year requirement and trying to reduce the number of ballots that were rejected,” said Causby. “You were hoping that you could catch people as they were dropping it off and point out the birth year is missing.”
Of Yellowstone County’s initial 1,381 rejected ballots, 1150 (83%) were due to birth year errors. All but 624 ballots were resolved, with 473 (76%) of those remaining due to birth year. 
Counties with smaller municipal elections utilized local connections to contact voters whose ballots had been rejected. Sweetgrass County, for example, had 35 rejected ballots, 31 (89%) due to birth year, but were able to reach most people by phone, ending with only six unresolved ballots. 
Treasure County, which had 20 ballots initially rejected, all due to birth year, ended with all ballots resolved. 
“Through friends and family and the phonebook we were able to get them all in here and write their birth year on the ballot. I was even able to get ahold of someone’s grandmother to get them in,” said Treasure County Elections Administrator Dani Erickson. “Our citizens are really good about it. They answer the phone and come in right away.” 
  The Larger Underlying Cost 

In his testimony of House Bill 719, sponsor Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, claimed the bill was a “cleanup bill,” the purpose of which was, “To make sure our elections are more secure while maintaining accessibility for voters. By adding an additional verification step we can help prevent fraud, reduce clerical errors and ensure every legally cast vote is counted correctly.” 
Yet ensuring every legally cast vote is counted is exactly what the law may have prevented. 
Even in Ravalli County, Elections Administrator Regina Plettenberg, who testified in support of HB 719 in February of this year, claimed there was no marked increase in the number of ballots rejected, yet confirmed 47% of Ravalli County’s remaining unresolved ballots were due to errors in birth year. 
The largest cost to Montana taxpayers however, may still be adding up.
A lawsuit brought by Big Sky 55+ and Disability Rights Montana in May of this year claims the new law disenfranchises elderly and disabled voters. Should Big Sky 55+ and Disability Rights Montana be successful in their lawsuit, it will add to the ever expanding demand on Montana taxpayers. 
“The state has spent millions in taxpayer dollars on litigation costs defending unconstitutional bills passed by the legislature,” said Heather O’Loughlin, Executive Director of the Montana Budget and Policy Center. “Not only do these laws create barriers to voting, they also add significant costs to the state.”
In every session, the Legislature passes supplemental appropriations in House Bill 3 which covers unexpected state agency costs accrued in the previous two fiscal years. Lawmakers also pass HB 2 every session – the General Appropriations Act – which adjusts the state’s budget going forward for the next two years. 
The 2025 Supplemental Appropriations Bill allocated $4.1 million for Legal Services, including $2.8 million specifically designated for litigation related to constitutional challenges from bills passed during the 2023 legislative session. 
The 2025 General Appropriations Act increased the Department of Justice budget by $24.2 million for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, with $2 million of that 8% increase specifically designated for the litigation of Montana legislation. 
Elections officials stressed the security of the existing voting process already in place before the passage of HB 719.
“There are already two unique numbers on your affirmation envelope that we utilize to look voters up and to verify signatures and to accept their ballots,” said Causby, in Yellowstone County. “One is a unique number specifically for that ballot for this election. The other number is the voter’s voter ID number. Then of course we have the signature.” 
A point echoed by Coyan, in Missoula County. 
“The signature is a very unique identifier,” said Coyan. “Adding the date of birth does not increase any security, it only adds an additional burden to the voter. People are receiving these ballots at their own request only because they are an active, eligible elector. There’s no need for us to have that date of birth on there.
“When we go from a small handful of rejected ballots in an election to massive piles of them, clearly something has changed for the voter. And it doesn’t look like for the better.”
The Secretary of State has not shared data supporting their claims of “one percent” rejection rate of ballots due to birth year or responded to multiple requests for comment from the Daily Montanan. 
  Another election wrinkle 

In addition to House Bill 719, little known House Bill 207, sponsored by Rep. Jodee Etchert, R-Billings also went into effect this year, changing the election deadline for candidate filings. The changes took place in the middle of the filing window, forcing many candidates to refile, or in the case of Walkerville Ward 1 Alderperson, causing candidates to miss the new deadline altogether, leaving them registered as write-in candidates only. 
“They thought they were on time, but the law changed. So they were late,” said Silver Bow County Elections Administrator Cindy Sherman. “It made it a write-in only election, which makes for a very hard election.”
Silver Bow County had no rejected ballots for the race, but of the 180 ballots mailed out, only 31 (17%) were returned. 
“I think a lot of people just didn’t know what they were supposed to do with that ballot. People want to see a name so they can check a box,” explained Sherman. “Of those 31 ballots, 15 voted for the winning candidate. Three voted for the other candidate. 10 voted for somebody else, a non-declared person, and then three of them were actually unvoted. They filled in the oval, but they didn’t write anything in the line.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JennaMartin-00159-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s most powerful state legislator introduced legislation Tuesday to weaken the powers of a state watchdog agency whose reports on government corruption, waste, and fraud have embarrassed and irritated public officials around the state.
The bill by Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), who is the Senate president, would hand the investigatory powers currently held by the state comptroller to the State Commission of Investigation. Officials targeted by the comptroller and groups including the New Jersey Association of Counties have pushed for a probe of the office, complaining about its practices in publicizing its findings.
While the bill says the comptroller’s office would be able to continue its “core work … unabated,” the office would be stripped of its investigative and subpoena powers. That means it could audit public agencies but couldn’t investigate wrongdoing or compel reforms.
A state watchdog forges ahead, in an era of endangered oversight

A public hearing on the bill is set for 10 a.m. Monday before the Senate’s state government committee at the Statehouse in Trenton. Lawmakers often use the brief lame-duck session between November’s election and January’s start of a new legislative session to fast-track controversial bills.
Scutari did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday, but his bill characterizes its goal as “eliminating duplication among State government oversight entities.”
“The investigations operations of the Office of the State Comptroller is smaller than, and different from, its main responsibilities, which are Medicaid fraud, procurement oversight, and audit functions.  Transferring the investigations function to the State Commission of Investigation does not curtail those responsibilities and is a more logical fit that will capitalize on its experience and success,” the bill says.
Kevin Walsh, the office’s acting comptroller, doesn’t buy that explanation.
“NJ ‘transparency’ at its worst. Sen. Scutari sneaks in a bill before Thanksgiving to kill OSC investigations. A vote for this bill is a vote for corruption,” Walsh wrote on social media Tuesday night.
The plan has also sparked outrage among critics who have long lamented that New Jersey doesn’t have enough watchdogs to keep up with all its corruption.
Attorney General Matt Platkin said on social media that he would testify against the bill Monday.
“This Thanksgiving, the NJ Senate is killing a gov’t watchdog that stops wasteful spending, giving politically powerful individuals broad powers to intimidate law enforcement fighting corruption & even letting them tap phones. Outrageous,” Platkin wrote.
The comptroller’s office formed in 2010. Since Walsh became acting comptroller in January 2020, his supporters have praised him as New Jersey’s leading watchdog on police accountability, government waste and fraud, and other issues involving taxpayer money and public misconduct.
His work has irked public officials at nearly every level of government though, and senators have blocked his confirmation. He has said his work is bound to “upset powerful people,” underscoring the need for his office to remain independent.
Scutari’s bill also would more than double State Commission of Investigation commissioners’ annual salary, from $35,000 to $75,000. The agency now has three commissioners and an executive director, although it’s supposed to have four commissioners by law.
It would also take the power to appoint the State Commission of Investigation’s chair away from the governor and give it to the Senate president and Assembly speaker.
A commission spokesperson, executive director Bruce P. Keller, and John P. Lacey, its chair, did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment.
Keller told the Asbury Park Press this month that he does not support eliminating government watchdogs.
“There’s plenty of work to go around,” Keller told the newspaper. “So if your question is a version of the thing that we’ve all heard – which is, are there too many watchdog agencies – my answer is, hell no, there aren’t enough.”

But most of the questions still have to clear several hurdles before making it onto the ballot.  
A major potential obstacle, one that has tripped up several would-be ballot referendums in recent years, is a court challenge that questions whether the measure, as crafted by proponents, can legally go before voters. 
In 2024, Massachusetts stared down six potential ballot measures, four of which consumed the time of the Supreme Judicial Court for months and pushed a critical ruling on controversial state housing policy off to the next year.  
Now the state could be heading toward an even messier collision of legal, legislative, and political forces. 
As the secretary of state’s office certifies hundreds of thousands of signatures submitted on behalf of the proposed 2026 ballot questions, campaigns and ballot initiative veterans estimate about half of the questions could be vulnerable to legal challenges, though not all may materialize.  
It sets up a busy next year of stress testing through courts assessing whether measures are appropriate for the ballot, lawmakers weighing whether to preempt questions through compromise legislation, and campaigns shifting into high gear to make their case to voters. Housing policy, taxes, and government transparency are among the issues that hang in the balance. 
Attorney General Andrea Campbell certified 44 potential questions earlier this year, and 11 campaigns confirmed to CommonWealth Beacon last week that they had secured enough signatures to clear the first threshold, sending the signatures to the secretary of state’s office for certification. 
Massachusetts ballot campaigns that submit 74,574 certified signatures to the secretary of state’s office by December 3 will then be sent to the Legislature in January. While lawmakers consider whether to act on the ballot proposals, several may head for lengthy court fights.  
Because ballot measures are blunt instruments, allowing voters only a yes or no vote, the questions cannot include separate and unrelated provisions. Other restrictions on ballot measures include petitions relating to the courts or judiciary, specific municipalities, certain parts of the state constitution, and some fiscal policy matters. 
One measure is already on the road to legal challenge, though opponents usually wait to file with the court until the early months of the election year. Business and landlord groups are agitating against a ballot question that would impose statewide rent control, limiting annual rent increases to the rate of inflation. 
This measure would permit an uncompensated taking of private property, which is not an appropriate matter for a ballot question, the conservative Fiscal Alliance Foundation argued in an objection to the attorney general’s certification. 
Real estate industry groups told CommonWealth Beacon that they also would be considering taking the rent control matter to the high court. 
“This is something we are taking very, very seriously,” said Tamara Small, chief executive of industry group NAIOP Massachusetts. “So we are looking at this from every single angle. If we believe that there is a court challenge, that’s something we’d certainly pursue.” 
Greg Vasil, CEO of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, said, “We’re doing everything that we can to minimize the risk to the members. This is uncharted territory on the legal side, so we have to look at every opportunity available to us.” 
In recent cycles, the state’s high court has struck several potential ballot measures for flunking the so-called relatedness test.  
In 2018, a first crack at what became the “millionaires tax,” or Fair Share Amendment, was broomed by the court for including too many unrelated provisions. Another version of the measure survived a court challenge four years later and was passed by voters into law.  
The SJC heard challenges to four measures proposed for the 2024 ballot, with three on “relatedness.” 
Those disputes swallowed months. When Attorney General Andrea Campbell sued Milton over the MBTA Communities housing law in February 2024, the SJC didn’t schedule oral arguments until October. The delay stemmed partly from the court’s ballot measure workload, justices said. Since opinions are generally issued about three months after oral arguments, a critical deadline for the housing law passed while justices deliberated. 
Along with the brewing challenge to the rent control question, Andrew Farnitano, a strategist working on several campaigns, expects organized opposition to form if two tax-related ballot measures move forward, which could find its way to the courts. 
The Massachusetts Opportunity Alliance is heading up ballot question campaigns to reduce the income tax and limit the amount of money Beacon Hill can collect and keep when revenues hit a certain threshold. Both would send shockwaves into the state budgeting process as officials work to fund health care, transportation, and other areas during a period of federal funding threats. 
Opponents of a measure that would roll back the legalization of recreational cannabis – itself a ballot referendum almost a decade ago – are focusing their ire on claims of misleading signature gathering practices for now. Depending on whether the secretary of state’s office certifies the group’s signatures, the cannabis industry may pursue legal challenges down the line or focus on defeating the measure on the ballot. 
For the 2026 cycle, Secretary of State William Galvin is not only responsible for overseeing the ballot referendum process as the state’s chief election official, he’s leading one of the ballot question campaigns. Galvin is pushing a ballot measure legalizing Election Day voter registration. 
For any would-be ballot question, the Legislature has a certain window of time in which they can simply pass the measure into the law, preempting a ballot showdown.  
Lawmakers are not responding eagerly to the workload. 
Proponents say the jump in ballot measures, which would eclipse the previous nine-question record, signals disillusionment with the Legislature, which they say refuses to take up issues that have popular support when filed as bills. Legislative leaders instead decry it as a sign of intrusion into their work by special interests. 
“Forty-four of them is a huge number of ballot questions. It makes you wonder: How easy is it for these special interest groups to go out and pay someone to get signatures?” House Speaker Ron Mariano said this week, referring to the original number of questions that were filed. “They design questions that support their topics or their personal interests.” 
The signature-gathering process whittled the number of potential measures by three-fourths, but the Speaker said he wondered if the Massachusetts ballot system will start to look like California’s. Voters in the Golden State, well known for its penchant for lawmaking by ballot question, considered 11 statewide measures in 2024, plus specific municipal- and county-level questions. 
The Legislature has until the first Wednesday in May if it wants to simply enact the ballot measure as written. Lawmakers last cycle created a new special committee to hold hearings and consider legislative action on the eight measures. They ultimately decided, as the high court deliberated, not to recommend legislative action on any of the ballot questions.  
Ballot campaigns are marathons of public and private negotiations, and a flurry of challenges would slow the regular work of the courts and the Legislature alike, but horse-trading can last until the final signature submission deadline in July.  
The final stretch can be a nail-biter — the SJC didn’t hand down its final word on the challenged ballot measures until June last cycle, just in time for one of the most controversial questions of the season to decide against going before voters because of a settlement in a completely different court case. 
If the Legislature decides not to act, and the courts allow the measures to head toward the ballot, proponents and opponents battle it out on the campaign trail.  
For some questions, though, an organized opposition seems unlikely to form.  
Ballot efforts to subject the governor’s office and the Legislature to public records laws and to rein in legislative stipends both go after the insular ways of Beacon Hill – something generally popular with voters and unlikely to draw organized opposition. A recent Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll found more than 80 percent of respondents would support the public records change. 
These efforts carry a strong echo of state Auditor Diana DiZoglio’s successful ballot campaign last year seeking to audit the Legislature and, not coincidently, the crusading auditor has now turned her focus to leading the public records campaign.

Kennedy Jr., speaking here at a September event, reportedly ordered the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to update a website page to add disproven information about autism and its causes. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)TOPEKA — A new page on a federal government website that provides inaccurate information about vaccines and autism is concerning to Kansans who work in autism research.
A majority of studies and researchers say there is no connection between autism and vaccinations, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated a page to share contradictory information.
“The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism,” the site says.
The page was updated last week, and in an interview with the New York Times, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of U.S. Health and Human Services, said he instructed the CDC to change the information.
“The information posted on the CDC website unfortunately contains multiple inaccurate or misleading statements,” said Matt Mosconi, director of the Kansas Center for Autism Research and Training. “The CDC message ignores many studies that have been conducted on this topic. And, my expectation is that this statement is confusing for individuals and families, and it has strong potential to be harmful.”
The Coalition of Autism Scientists, which Mosconi and other researchers at K-CART belong to, published a statement saying the harm caused by questioning the safety of childhood vaccines cannot be overstated.
“By altering and distorting the evidence on vaccine safety, the CDC can no longer be relied on to provide the public with accurate information,” the statement said.
Mosconi said if there had been evidence that vaccines caused autism, scientists would have followed that evidence.
“Rigorous study after rigorous study failed to find that link, so we, as scientists, follow the data to identify those factors that are associated with autism and do have potential to be informative for supporting the autism community,” he said.
Kathryn Unruh, an assistant researcher at K-CART, said the new information presented on the CDC site is concerning for several reasons, including whether people will hesitate to vaccinate their children.
Kansas has seen vaccination rates for kindergarteners drop in many areas across the state. The state also had a measles outbreak, which has since ended.
“As an autism researcher, we are also quite concerned with how this may misdirect attention as well as the critical funding we may need for studies that will support autistic individuals and their families,” Unruh said.
Two “very large” and rigorous studies have shown no association between autism and vaccinations, she said. The studies were well-controlled and had large samples. The initial and since discredited study that started the misinformation about vaccines and autism included just 12 children, Unruh said.
A 2002 Danish study included more than 500,000 children and looked at the risks of developing autism in children who were vaccinated and unvaccinated. The study controlled for multiple variables, including the age at which children received vaccines, their gestational age, birth weight and their economic status, Unruh said.
No connection was found between autism and vaccinations in that study.
Another large study in the United States also looked at familial factors because of the high likelihood of developing autism if the individual has a sibling with autism, Unruh said.
“Even if kids already had one likelihood factor for developing autism, they also found no increased association with developing autism and vaccines in those children,” she said.
The information being put out by the CDC on its official website worries Unruh.
“As a scientist, I’m quite concerned that they have ignored decades of rigorous research, including multiple studies that use CDC data,” she said. “On their own website, an archived page now, they do have a long list of studies that they have documented that show no association between vaccines and risk for developing autism.”
Scientific studies have shown a genetic component to autism and other studies have looked at environmental interactions that might increase the risk for autism, Unruh said.
A 2015 study published in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association, researched possible connections between children who have a genetic likelihood of developing autism — identified because siblings had autism — and vaccinations causing them to develop autism, she said.
That study found no connections between the two, Unruh said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rfkjrsept222025-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

Women’s Leadership Conference: RISE brings record attendance, powerful stories, and a renewed call for intentional leadership.
WILMINGTON, Del. — The New Castle County Chamber of Commerce’s annual Women’s Leadership Conference: RISE drew hundreds of business leaders, students, entrepreneurs, and community advocates to a sold-out gathering that blended professional development with honest conversations, economic insight, and the celebration of Delaware’s rising and established female leaders.
The full-day event — built around the theme of rising together — offered attendees the chance to network, learn, and hear from some of the most influential women shaping Delaware’s economic and social landscape. With keynote speakers from health care, higher education, and national nonprofits, plus five leadership award presentations, the program highlighted both the challenges women continue to face and the progress they are steadily driving.
For many, the event’s energy and sense of community were just as impactful as the formal programming.
“I’ve been here many times before and every year it keeps getting better and better and bigger and bigger,” said attendee Eve Pappas, Vice President of Business Development at Hoffman’s Exterminating. “Women are very intuitive to employee and client concerns, and to have an event like this that lifts them up to become better leaders is tremendous.”
A Showcase of Leadership, Ambition, and Collective Progress
The morning program opened with a strong focus on empowerment and perspective, reinforced by rows of exhibitor tables featuring employers, universities, nonprofits, and companies committed to elevating women in the workplace.
Among them was Diamond State Financial Group, whose representatives said the environment creates a sense of alignment and momentum.
“I think the impact is huge,” said exhibitor Allison Oberembt, Financial Advisor. “Seeing a lot of women in different paths just gives you ideas. If you’re unsure of where you belong, you’ll fit in here. The speakers and workshops are just filled with inspiring stories.”
For companies like Fulton Bank, a long-time sponsor, the conference reflects a commitment to economic and community investment.
“This is my first year attending, so I’m excited to be in the room with these amazing women,” said Jvonne Oliver, Financial Center Manager. “Fulton Bank has been sponsoring the event for 15 years or more. It fits into what we’re about — changing lives for the better, one conversation at a time.”
The atmosphere resonated beyond exhibitors. Educators and community leaders also leaned into the networking and shared purpose.
“I love it. I love all the connections we’re making and the feelings of sisterhood and camaraderie,” said Dr. Aisha Monroe, Executive Director of Graduate Programming and Student Success at Delaware State University. “My advice to the attendees is to stay open, never leave the mindset of a student, and be available to the opportunities around you.”
Keynote Speakers Emphasize Intentional Leadership and Personal Well-Being
This year’s keynote speakers tackled the deeper realities of leadership: navigating stress, leading through change, showing up with purpose, and sometimes simply admitting that you can’t do it alone.
ChristianaCare President and CEO Dr. Janice Nevin delivered an honest reflection on the responsibility and weight leaders carry — particularly women, who often juggle multiple roles.
Dr. Janice Nevin: “Leadership Isn’t Accidental”
ChristianaCare President and CEO Dr. Janice Nevin delivered an honest reflection on the responsibility and weight leaders carry — particularly women, who often juggle multiple roles.
“I think this is really, really important to the leaders in this room,” Nevin said. “It’s not a sign of weakness to feel you can’t do it alone. You have to be willing to say, ‘Hey, I could use a little help right now,’ and that’s OK.”
Nevin emphasized that leadership requires self-awareness and intentionality.
“Leadership isn’t accidental. You have to know your values, your purpose. And when those hard times come, and they will, you have to be intentional about your leadership,” she said. “What is it the people, whom you care about deeply, who are doing the work, need from you in this moment? It may not feel comfortable, but it is your job, as a leader, to do that.”
Her remarks resonated strongly with attendees navigating their own leadership journeys in industries ranging from finance to education to public service.
Dr. Laura Carlson: “Show Up — and Notice the Joy”
Dr. Laura Carlson, Interim President of the University of Delaware, focused on showing up fully, even amid demanding schedules and competing pressures.
“You have to show up, right,” Carlson said. “There’s a certain expectation, and taking care of yourself is important so that you can show up. But I also think it’s important to pay attention to the little joys that happen every day.”
Carlson pointed to the conference itself as a source of energy and optimism.
“This event will carry me for the next few days,” she said. “The fact that all of us are assembling and the energy that is here — that is awesome.”
Her remarks tied directly into the conference’s broader message: rising is not a solo act. It takes community, collaboration, and acknowledging the daily moments that keep leaders grounded.
Rosie Allen-Herring: “Respond — Don’t React”
The final keynote came from Rosie Allen-Herring, President & CEO of the United Way of the National Capital Area, who delivered a powerful message about resilience amid constant change.
“It is about, at the end of the day, what does resiliency look like,” she said. “I had to come to a point where I said to my team, ‘respond, but don’t react.’ Responding simply says, I acknowledge what’s happening.”
Her remarks acknowledged the challenges facing communities and nonprofits — rising needs, limited resources, shifting priorities — but stressed the importance of perspective.
“These times are challenging, but they don’t have to last always,” she said. “And so, this is an opportunity for us to think about who we serve, to focus on the community we serve.”
Leadership Awards Honor Women Shaping Delaware’s Future
One of the most anticipated portions of the conference each year is the presentation of leadership awards — recognizing women whose work, impact, and leadership stand out across Delaware’s business, nonprofit, and civic landscape.
This year’s honorees represented students, entrepreneurs, attorneys, community advocates, and emerging professionals — demonstrating the vast range of leadership pathways available to women.
Student Leadership Award: Billi Roman
University of Delaware freshman and Ice Hockey Team member Billi Roman delivered a heartfelt perspective on what she’s learned about leadership at a young age.
“This journey is how I finally understood what leadership means to me,” Roman said. “Leaders speak up when something matters. They ask for what they need. They advocate for themselves, not because it’s easy, but because it’s necessary.”
She emphasized that leadership isn’t only about directing others.
“There’s another side to leadership, a willingness to help,” she said. “Helping others is leadership because it shows you care.”
Young Woman Professional Award: Jacqueline Flowers
Jacqueline Flowers, Project Estimator at EDiS Company, offered one of the most personal reflections of the day — crediting her mother for instilling the foundation of her leadership style.
“Standing here today, I feel grateful, humble, and honestly a bit in awe to be surrounded by so many remarkable women,” she said. “My mom… taught me countless things, but one lesson has become the heartbeat of my life: always look for inspiration in the women around you.”
Her remarks captured the spirit of the event — women learning from women, generation to generation.
State Service Award: Lisa A. Schmidt
Lisa A. Schmidt, Director and Immediate Past President of Richards, Layton & Finger, spoke about the importance of civic stewardship and legal leadership.
“Today’s recognition isn’t just one person’s work,” Schmidt said. “It’s all about Delaware’s shared commitment to stewardship. To protecting what works, improving what we can, and ensuring that future generations inherit a system as strong as the one we have.”
Her comments provided a reminder that leadership includes sustaining systems that work — and courageously addressing those that don’t.
Impact Award: Katie Kutler
Entrepreneur and café owner Katie Kutler, of kaffé KARMA & KARMA’s korner, delivered a message centered on integrity and action.
“Impact does mean so much to me, and thank you for recognizing me today,” Kutler said. “I just think that you have to do the right thing. Even when you’re not sure somebody is going to recognize you and support you for it.”
She also spoke about the misconception surrounding “manifesting” success.
“The universe doesn’t hand you things when you manifest,” she said. “Manifestation without action is just daydreaming.”
Her story, rooted in small business resilience, aligned with broader statewide conversations about entrepreneurship, local economies, and community support.
Female Leader of the Year: Yvette Santiago
The conference’s top honor went to Yvette Santiago, Regional Director of Community Engagement and Impact at Nemours Children’s Health.
Her speech was emotional, grounded in identity, family, and determination.
“For so many reasons, this award means a lot. One of the reasons that sticks out the most is defying the odds,” she said. “As women. As women of color. As Latinas, we have to defy the odds. And that’s what sticks out to me.”
Santiago credited her parents for shaping her discipline and character.
“Their sacrifice, love, and support enabled my success,” she said. “Success… requires discipline, sacrifice, patience, and consistently working hard to achieve your goals and dreams.”
Her remarks earned a standing ovation — a fitting finale to the award ceremony.
A Conference That Builds Momentum — and Community
By the afternoon, the conference had transformed into more than a networking event. It had become a shared experience — a blend of mentorship, professional development, and affirmation for women across Delaware and the region.
The exhibitors, speakers, and award winners offered a textured narrative of what leadership looks like today: intentional, values-driven, community-minded, and grounded in real lived experiences.
For many attendees, the power of the event wasn’t just in the formal sessions, but in the connections sparked between them.
As DSU’s Dr. Monroe put it: “Stay open. Never leave the mindset of a student.”
And that sentiment — curiosity, growth, and willingness to rise together — is exactly what the Women’s Leadership Conference continues to cultivate year after year.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-26-095830.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

And though there are strict eligibility requirements for private-school scholarships, eligibility isn’t checked after the initial scholarship is awarded or for siblings of students who received a scholarship.
The revelations about the inner workings of Missouri’s private school voucher program came to light over the course of a two-day trial in Cole County Circuit Court this week.
The focus of the arguments Monday and Tuesday were over whether the state can use general revenue for private school tuition, with the attorney general’s office defending state funds as transformative for the program and Missouri’s largest teacher’s union saying the funding is unlawful.
But witness testimony pulled back the curtain on certain details about the MOScholars program that have stayed largely out of the public consciousness.
MOScholars, which is in its fourth year of operation, awards scholarships to K-12 students who meet certain criteria.
When state lawmakers created the program in a 2021 bill, they set it up to run on donations that are eligible for a 100% tax credit up to half of a donor’s tax liability. In the first three years of the program, donations totaled $33.8 million.
Gov. Mike Kehoe announced in January that he intended to bring a major infusion of funding to the program through a $50 million appropriation of general revenue. This windfall for MOScholars has allowed the state to nearly triple the amount of scholarships awarded this fall.
“If not for general revenue, would many of (the new) scholars be able to receive a scholarship?” Assistant Attorney General Peter Donahue asked the treasurer’s director of programs, Trent Blair.
“No,” Blair answered.
Loretta Haggard, an attorney representing the Missouri National Education Association, questions the State Treasurer’s director of programs in a trial challenging the constitutionality of Missouri’s funding of school vouchers Tuesday morning in the Cole County Courthouse (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Of 6,418 scholarships awarded this school year, only 111 are funded through tax credits. That includes the 2,405 students who were in the program last year. So if MOScholars did not receive the state appropriation, the funding would cover less than 5% of the renewal students going into the school year.
The State Treasurer’s Office, which oversees MOScholars, has previously admitted to problems with the timing of funding. The bulk of donations hit the accounts of educational assistance organizations — intermediary nonprofits that connect students with the funding — in December.
With tuition due in August, MOScholars had to either with eight months to award the funds or put stress on the system. Blair testified that the educational assistance organizations largely chose the latter and that the organizations themselves choose when to use donated funds. 
In 2023, two of the six educational assistance organizations acknowledged they used their private funds to pay tuition in the fall and paid themselves back once they received donations. In October, two organizations told The Independent that they were able to fund scholarships for all their renewal students and clear their waitlists with the new state funds.
The state money “stabilizes the program,” Blair testified Tuesday.
Representing the Missouri National Education Association, attorney Loretta Haggard unearthed issues with the administration of the program as she cross-examined Blair.
She honed in on MOScholars’ eligibility requirements. State law limits the program to students with an individualized education plan or those whose family makes at or below 300% of the income standard used to qualify for free and reduced price lunches.
The treasurer’s office uses an education management system called FACTS to review applications and determine eligibility. Haggard asked if the software checks if renewal students still meet eligibility requirements. 
It doesn’t, Blair said.
“So a student can receive a scholarship even though they don’t meet the IEP or income requirements?” Haggard then asked.
“Yes,” Blair said.
When a student is eligible one year, the system presumes that they retain eligibility. The siblings of renewal students are also deemed eligible.
The treasurer’s office has faced criticism before over how it has administered MOScholars, including complaints from Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck that the office wasn’t transparent about program data. And in July, a report from the State Auditor found the treasurer’s office didn’t conduct annual audits of the MOScholars program required by state law.
But Tuesday’s testimony was the first time the state has admitted to not rechecking eligibility, something that is routine for other state-funded programs like food assistance or Medicaid. 
Bryan Cleveland, an attorney with Indiana-based advocacy group EdChoice, spoke on behalf of families who say they benefit from increased MOScholars (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Any questions about the administration of the program don’t impact the legality of the appropriation, said Bryan Cleveland, an attorney with Indiana-based advocacy group EdChoice, who intervened in the case on behalf of three parents whose children have received assistance through MOScholars.
“The case does not depend on whether any one treasurer is doing a good job but rather on interpretation of statutory provisions,” he told the judge. “The rest of the discussion of what the treasurer or the educational assistance organizations do after (the appropriation) is not relevant.”
Blair, stepping off the witness stand Tuesday, sighed, head tucked as he walked back to his seat. The trial marked one of the few occasions the treasurer’s office has answered questions publicly, apart from occasional statements to the media.
When Cole County Judge Brian Stumpe denied a request for a temporary restraining order, which would have blocked the spending of the general revenue during the trial, the treasurer’s office held a joint press conference with the Missouri Attorney General’s Office but did not take any questions.
On Monday, attorneys argued over whether the Missouri NEA or its individual members had standing to challenge the state appropriation to MOScholars. 
A decision on the case is not expected until after Dec. 8, when attorneys’ post-trial filings are due.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112425_blair1-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

(Photo by Karsan Turner for Iowa Capital Dispatch) The cost of a classic Thanksgiving dinner set for 10 people, at $55.18, is 5% less than the cost in 2024, annual data from the American Farm Bureau Federation shows.
While key meal items like turkey and dinner rolls decreased in price this year, fresh vegetables and Thanksgiving dairy products are substantially more expensive. 
Overall, the report found the cost of the meal is still higher than it was in 2020, when the meal cost $46.90.
Farm Bureau said the table items with price increases reflect some of the hardships that farmers faced this year. 
Christopher Pudenz, Iowa Farm Bureau’s research and economics manager, said declining prices for some Thanksgiving staples is good for consumers, but profitability “continues to be a challenge” for farmers in 2025. 
“Iowa farmers face historically low crop prices, high input costs and tight margins, yet they remain resilient and committed to doing what they do best—caring for their land, practicing good stewardship and raising healthy animals to provide abundant, affordable food for families here at home and across the country,” Pudenz said in a statement.

Turkey
While turkey is typically the star of the show – and the top billed item on the table – turkey represented just 39% of the cost of the Thanksgiving meal this year, which Farm Bureau said is the lowest share of the meal cost since 2000. On average, the bureau said the bird accounts for 43% of the total receipt.
This year the average 16-pound turkey cost $21.50, or $1.34 per pound, which is more than 16% less than the average turkey cost last year. 
While the price has declined, popularity has not. A consumer survey from the National Turkey Federation found that 87% of Americans who celebrate Thanksgiving plan to serve turkey. The majority, 74%, serve the whole bird at the holiday and 65% choose to roast their turkey in the oven. 
The overall size of the turkey flock, according to USDA data, has declined. Farm Bureau said these flock sizes reflect the impact the highly pathogenic avian influenza has had on the industry. Since 2022, according to Farm Bureau, close to 19 million turkeys have been impacted by the bird flu. 
Iowa has only had one reported outbreak of the flu this fall – at a turkey farm in Calhoun County. 
And the fixins
Sweet potatoes, vegetable trays with carrots and celery, frozen peas, milk and whipping cream all increased in price this year. 
Cranberries, stuffing and rolls, however, decreased slightly in price for the 2025 meal. 
A 3-pound bag of sweet potatoes averaged $4, a 37% increase from the year prior, according to the report. 
Farm Bureau said natural disasters, like hurricanes in North Carolina — the nation’s largest producer of sweet potatoes —  partially contributed to the increase in cost. 
Produce costs have also increased in the country due to labor shortages, increased labor costs and supply chain or transportation setbacks, according to Farm Bureau. 
Group blames tariffs
The campaign Tariffs Cost US blamed tariffs for the increase in cost, citing farmer statements that have said increasing input costs have lead them to hike local produce costs. 
The organization also launched an ad campaign, ahead of Black Friday and holiday shopping, pinning tariffs for higher price tags. According to the group, local businesses are especially feeling the added costs and hoping the busy shopping season will keep them in the black. 
Rachel Lutz, owner of the Peacock Room in Detroit, said a $700 shipment of jewelry recently came with the added cost of $100 tariff. She worries the added fees will force more small businesses to close. 
“That adds up fast and is unsustainable in the long run,” Lutz said in a news release with Tariffs Cost US. “It has been heartbreaking to wake up so many mornings and see yet another family-owned business closing in our community because they cannot absorb these costs.”
Local business owners in Iowa have also expressed concerns about the impact tariffs will have on holiday shopping and their overall margins.
At the farmers’ table 
While consumer prices fluctuate from year to year, farmers continue to earn just a small percentage. USDA data shows farmers receive less than 16 cents for every dollar spent on food in the U.S.
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, in a news release Monday, reminded Iowans of the role farmers play in the Thanksgiving meal. 
“As we gather this week with our family and friends, I invite everyone to pause for a moment and give thanks for Iowa’s hardworking farm families who produce the delicious Thanksgiving meals on our tables,” Naig said. 
National Farmers Union’s annual “Farmer’s Share of the Food Dollar” report shows farmers receive “only pennies on the dollar” for the typical Thanksgiving fare. 
The report shows farmers earn the least amount, 6 cents or 1.3% of the price, on a 12-ounce box of stuffing. Producers also score just 6 cents per pound, or 2.4% of the sale price of turkey. 
Farmers who sell turkeys direct to consumers and with free-range or organic traits earn more per dollar, but also charge more, between $5 and $7 per pound. 
Cranberry and green producers receive the highest percentage of the Thanksgiving food dollar for their commodities at nearly 32% and nearly 25% respectively. 
Farmers Union President Rob Larew, in a news release, said there is “continuous inequality” in the food system. 
“Every Thanksgiving, the numbers tell the same story: farmers aren’t asking for a bigger slice of pie, just a fair one,” Larew said. “It’s long past time to fix a food system that works for corporations but not for the families who grow and consume our food.”

The allegations are nothing new. Mississippi has cycled through five private prison health vendors over the past three decades amid recurring concerns about staffing shortages, weak oversight, unpaid bills to hospitals and inadequate care provided to patients. One report published nearly two decades ago by the Legislature’s watchdog committee echoes many of the questions raised by state lawmakers this year. 
Meanwhile, Mississippi Today’s Beyond Bars, Beyond Care series has documented alleged routine denial of health care in Mississippi prisons: potentially thousands of people living with hepatitis C going without treatment, an untreated broken arm that resulted in amputation and delayed cancer screenings one woman said led to a terminal diagnosis. One ex-corrections official said people are experiencing widespread medical neglect in Mississippi’s prisons. 
The Legislature appropriated $690,000 this year for monitoring and review of its current prison health contract, held by Kansas-based VitalCore Health Strategies, Inc. A report is due to legislators by Dec. 15. 
Mississippi Today took a closer look at Mississippi’s contracts for medical services and asked experts what changes can be made to strengthen them. 
How long has Mississippi relied on private medical contractors?
Incarcerated people are one of the few groups in the United States with a constitutional right to health care. In the 1990s, faced with frequent lawsuits filed by incarcerated people, consent decrees and ballooning prison populations, an industry of private companies sprung up to shoulder the state’s responsibility of providing health care to people in prison. 
The Mississippi Department of Corrections began contracting out its medical services in 1998 after years of providing health care itself. The University of Mississippi Medical Center was the first entity chosen to provide the services, and since then, the department has held contracts with four other companies. 
Mississippi selected VitalCore for a three-year contract worth over $357 million in 2024. The company won out over Wexford Health Sources and Centurion of Mississippi, both companies that have held the contract for prison medical services in the past, in a competitive bidding process. VitalCore was awarded over $315 million in emergency, no-bid state contracts from 2020 to 2024.
VitalCore holds correctional health contracts in several other states, including Massachusetts, Michigan and Delaware, and it has faced legal battles and scrutiny in other jurisdictions. 
VitalCore was sued last year by its former chief officer medical of operations in Vermont, who alleged the company forged his signature on policy documents and fired him after he raised alarm bells about conditions in the state’s prisons. A 2019 lawsuit alleges that a 48-year-old with documented heart problems collapsed and died in a New Mexico county jail after VitalCore staff failed to properly monitor his condition. And significant understaffing of medical positions in Massachusetts prisons led VitalCore to pay back $1.4 to $1.7 million a month to the state, according to reporting by the Boston Institute for Nonprofit Journalism.
Dan Mistak, the director of health care initiatives for justice-involved populations at Community Oriented Correctional Health Services, described the process of states contracting corrections medical companies as a “revolving door.” 
When a new company is awarded the contract, it often rehires many of the same staff members. If controversy arises over the quality of care or another issue, the company carries the blame and either receives more money from the state to fulfill its obligations or leaves. A new company then rotates in. 
“Rinse, cycle, repeat, over and over again,” Mistak said. 
Centurion, a company previously tasked with providing health care to Mississippi’s prisoners, terminated its contract with the corrections department in 2020 amid an ongoing legal battle with prisoners, arguing that the state’s failure to invest in infrastructure and correctional staffing prevented the company from performing its duties. Centurion was brought in under an emergency contract, like VitalCore, in 2015.
The prior contractor, Wexford, was accused of funneling consulting fees to a former Mississippi state legislator, Cecil McCrory, who pleaded guilty to bribing a Mississippi corrections commissioner, Chris Epps, in exchange for Epps’ efforts to steer state prison contracts. The state collected $4 million from the company in a lawsuit. 
How have prison health care costs changed under the new contract? 
Mississippi’s per capita spending on prison health care has risen steadily over the last 25 years, according to reports by the Legislature’s watchdog branch, the Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review Committee. 
In 2000, the state spent $5.07 per day on health care for people in its custody. In 2024, the cost was three times as high – $16.03 per day. In recent years, spending on basic medical care has risen starkly while the costs of specialty care have grown more slowly or dropped. 
Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain attributed the rise in costs to inmates overusing medical services. Speaking at a legislative budget hearing Sept. 24, he likened the business of providing medical services to people in Mississippi’s prisons to caring for animals.

“It just goes up, and these inmates go to the doctor for everything,” he said. “And the problem is, it’s like being, I hate to say it, sometimes it’s like being a veterinarian to say what really, what’s wrong with you.”
The Department of Corrections did not respond to questions about why costs are rising or what Cain meant. 
Marc Stern, a faculty member at the University of Washington and former assistant secretary for health care at the Washington Department of Corrections who serves as a medical adviser for the National Sheriffs’ Association and American Jail Association, said the rise in basic care costs may be the result of rising costs for salaries and medications. 
He said health care in jails and prisons in the U.S. is often not funded as well as it needs to be to ensure that people receive quality care.
“As a result, you get what you pay for,” Stern said. “… Is it the fault of the company or is it the fault of the legislature? I guess that’s a philosophical question.” 
Mississippi’s prison population is growing older, which can result in more costly care. The portion of prisoners aged 55 or older has grown by about 10% in the past 20 years, accounting for 12% of the population in 2019. 
Mississippi has one of the highest incarceration rates per capita in the world — 661 people per 100,000. About 19,500 people are currently incarcerated in state prisons. 
How does a fixed-rate model of health spending shape the care prisoners receive? 
VitalCore is paid a flat rate adjusted to reflect the number of people in custody, regardless of their medical needs. It is required to provide onsite care, including mental health, dental, dialysis, laboratory and optometry care, and cover the costs of offsite care at hospitals or for specialty care. In the first year of the contract, VitalCore is paid about $115 million, with adjustments of $53.54 for each inmate below 19,000 or above 19,600. The payment rates grow each year. 
This means that if a contractor spends less to provide health care to people in state custody, it reaps a larger profit. But, it loses money if it exceeds cost projections.
The fixed-rate model is more predictable for the state than other models, like reimbursing a contractor for the care they provide. While the state won’t see the savings if less is spent on medical services, it also won’t be required to pay extra if more is spent. It is the most common way to structure prison health contracts among all states, according to a report from Pew Charitable Trust published in 2015. 
This model can, in theory, reward preventive care measures that keep people healthy and reduce expensive interventions. But it can also encourage delayed or inadequate care, since contractors can save money by limiting the care they provide. Strong monitoring is the key to curbing these risks, experts said. 
Because about 95% of people will be released from prison at some point, communities absorb the consequences of delayed or inadequate care in the long term through higher emergency room use, worsening population health or infectious disease spread, Mistak said. 
This can burden hospitals and state safety-net programs, like Medicaid and Medicare, down the road. 
“Those costs are going to be borne by the state and the community,” he said.  
What if a company’s bid isn’t enough? 
In a competitive process for prison health care vendors, the company with the lowest bid usually wins the contract. But when correctional care providers propose a low budget to stand out during the procurement process, they sometimes can not afford the costs of care they proposed and still turn a profit, Mistak said. 
In some cases, contractors will return to government entities that contracted them to ask for more money. This has played out in Missouri and a county jail in Wisconsin in recent years. 
“You end up paying more anyway for a lot of these contracts,” Mistak said. 
That’s what happened in Mississippi. In May, MDOC requested $4 million for a “deficit appropriation” – money to cover a shortfall – for VitalCore, according to House Corrections Committee Chairwoman Becky Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven.
How do staffing clawbacks work?
If VitalCore does not meet staffing requirements outlined in the contract, the company must pay the corrections department back the average hourly wage for each unfilled hour of work, plus a 20% fee for employee benefits, according to the contract. 
“We’re really good at that,” Cain said Sept. 24. “We take back from the money that they didn’t spend on hiring people. They don’t get to keep it.” 
He said the department has used funds recouped from VitalCore for unmet staffing requirements to pay for improvements to buildings and infrastructure. 
But returning the salaries of unfilled positions isn’t enough, Stern said. To truly motivate companies to fill the position, they must face a financial consequence beyond the value of the vacant position. 
“Those penalties have to be stiff enough to be more than what the vendor saves from not filling the position,” he said. 
Why have legislators said VitalCore is ‘slow paying’ its bills to vendors? 
At the Sept. 24 budget hearing, Sen. Daniel Sparks, a Republican from Belmont, said that VitalCore delaying payments to vendors, including the University of Mississippi Medical Center, has been a “continual issue.” 
Currie told Mississippi Today that Bolivar Medical Center in Cleveland, about 25 miles from the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, has faced similar challenges. 
Neither hospital, the Department of Corrections or VitalCore responded to a request for comment. 
Cain said Sept. 24 the issue was due in part to hospitals billing VitalCore at rates higher than the agreed-upon costs for prison medical services. Deputy Commissioner of Administration and Finance Derrick Garner said the agency is monitoring the issue and aims to increase oversight of the payments.
Sparks said that VitalCore could pay the agreed-upon rate rather than waiting to negotiate rates. 
“But to not pay the bill at all, and let the bill get into the millions of dollars when that’s a state entity that’s supposed to be paid by a state entity and the intermediary is holding up the payment, it doesn’t settle well,” Sparks said. 
What kind of oversight does Mississippi use to monitor the contract? 
The Department of Corrections performs oversight of its contract with VitalCore. Monitoring tasks include reviewing service levels, quality of care and administrative practices, meeting with VitalCore to address issues, conducting site visits and inspections and reviewing third-party reimbursements, according to the contract. 
The state examining its own contract reduces the costs of bringing in an outside monitor and allows the state more control over what it tracks, said Stern. 
But the quality of monitoring depends on how willing the state is to hold a contractor accountable, and states may be less stringent out of fear that a contractor will bail. 
“The threats of leaving can really make a state gulp,” Mistak said. “…And so sometimes they lay off the gas when it comes to enforcing their own contract.”
The Mississippi Legislature has made several efforts of its own to scrutinize the medical care provided in state prisons. 
The Legislature tasked the health department with studying the challenges of providing health care to people who are incarcerated in 2024, and State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney presented initial findings at the Capitol in January. The health department will produce a report roughly a year from now, including recommendations to MDOC, said spokesperson Greg Flynn. 
This year, the Legislature appropriated funding for the Department of Corrections to monitor and review the medical services contract, with a report due to legislators by Dec. 15. Cain said Sept. 24 that the contract for the report has been finalized.

MDOC did not respond to questions about who was awarded the contract.
Currie, who has spent the last year probing for answers as to why inmates are getting sicker as the state increases its spending on medical care, said she is curious to see the report’s finding. She authored a failed bill this year that would have tasked the health department with conducting a sweeping review of medical care for people incarcerated in Mississippi at no cost. 
“Yet, we spend $700,000 on a report,” she said to Mississippi Today. 
Does privatizing prison health care make the system better?
Most states contract all or part of their prison health services with private companies. Several states provide their own prison health services through government agencies, like Louisiana.
If a state develops a strong oversight system, they can gain the expertise to manage the contract themselves, said Stern. Providing health care in-house can reduce costs for states, he said, because contractors must make a profit margin and less duplication of services exists between the state and the contractors. 
It also creates more opportunities for continuity between prison health care and community health care, which would make it easier for health providers to care for people when they are released, experts said. 
Some evidence shows that medical services run by government agencies may lead to lower death rates. A 2020 Reuters investigation of more than 500 jails in the U.S. showed that facilities with private healthcare contractors had higher death rates than those run by government agencies. 
Currie said she would like to see prison health care run by the state or a local hospital system, which she said would ensure stronger accountability and quality care. 
“I’m just not able to sit back and watch people die and be treated badly, no matter who they are,” Currie said. 
“…Most of these people are coming out. And the new law is that most of them will come out. And you know, we need them to be healthy and ready to go to work and lower our recidivism rate.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/06114603/37b90-prisonercopy.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

(Getty Images)America’s farthest-west town, Adak, is being sued by a former employee who alleges he was denied overtime pay and pressured into resigning because of racism by city officials.
A city council member named in the lawsuit, Christian Tolliver, declined extensive comment but said the allegation is untrue. A second person named as a defendant, former city council member Elaine Smiloff, could not be reached for comment.
The lawsuit, from Xavier Charles, was filed Nov. 12 in state Superior Court at Unalaska. It names the 67-person town of Adak and two city council members as defendants. Charles is seeking an unspecified financial award, including back pay, front pay, and “compensatory damages.”
Charles, who is Black, was a public works laborer from March 2023 to April 2024, and delivered mail, did maintenance and a variety of jobs throughout the town.
The complaint alleges that a federal contractor who invited Charles to dinner at the Adak Lodge — owned by Tolliver — was told by Tolliver “that Plaintiff’s ‘kind were not allowed at his house.’”
The complaint says Tolliver repeatedly questioned Charles’ conduct and states that Tolliver told one of Charles’ coworkers that Charles “rides around the neighborhood stealing and joy riding” and said “he’s black so he must be stealing.”
The complaint alleges that Tolliver’s wife tracked Charles while he did his work, and that Charles’s supervisor called Tolliver racist.
Charles filed a formal complaint with a third-party firm used by the city of Adak. The resulting investigation “concluded with a finding that the allegations were substantiated,” the complaint states, but adds that “the city of Adak took no meaningful disciplinary action.”
In April 2024, another city council member told Charles, “if I didn’t resign they were going to figure out a way to fire me anyways,” the complaint states.
Charles filed a complaint with the Anchorage Equal Rights Commission and a charge with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the EEOC issued a “notice of right to sue.”
Charles is being represented by Anchorage attorney Isaac Zorea.
“It’s unfortunate,” Zorea said by phone. “Charles came from the Lower 48 up to Adak; you’re moving quite a distance from the South, you would think that you’d have a better reception.”
He noted that Tolliver has a Confederate flag on his truck, something mentioned in the complaint.
“I think it’s just sad, you know. It doesn’t look good for our state,” Zorea said.
Former Adak city manager Layton Lockett, who ran the city during Charles’ time, did not return two phone calls seeking comment. Adak’s current acting manager declined to comment, saying she had not seen the lawsuit.
Tolliver, reached by phone, declined extensive comment, saying that if he is formally served with the lawsuit, he will have a lawyer respond. 
“I don’t know where or who he’s trying to extort money from, but he had just gotten out of prison when he got here, and his uncle was trying to give him a new start, and it didn’t really work out,” Tolliver said. “His behavior wasn’t what many people on the island would have wished it had been, so that was more of a problem with most people that I know than his skin color, and maybe he confused the two.”
Tolliver said he is a retired Army officer and has worked with racially different people before.
“If he was here, I would tell him to his face: I don’t have a problem with his skin color, but his behavior,” Tolliver said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-90090097-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 09:57:03.026470

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Collin Tuthill, president of one of the country’s largest canned and frozen food importers and distributors, said the current state of the U.S. food industry is “like we live in some kind of alternate universe.”
The most efficient industry is being hit the hardest by tariff policies and rising costs, he said Tuesday during a video call with reporters.
“The folks that are taking the punches are the ones that can’t really afford to take the punches,” said Tuthill, president of Royal Food Import, a North Carolina-based company that distributes food to hospitals, food banks, schools and prisons.
Tuthill was part of a group brought together by Tariffs Cost US, a campaign highlighting the detrimental effects of Trump administration tariff policies.
Nick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, said costs were already rising — for consumers and farmers — before President Donald Trump implemented tariffs.
“With tariffs, they are going up more,” he said.
Families see the effects in the cost of their Thanksgiving meals, he said.
Tariffs on imported steel have increased the overall cost of canned goods. Cheeses, spices and chocolates also have become more expensive. The tariffs, which have reached the highest average rate since 1935, stack on top of higher fuel, seed, fertilizer, equipment and transportation costs, Levendofsky said. 
Then farmers see an even smaller share of profits.
For a turkey that costs $2.40 per pound, a farmer receives 6 cents, Levendofsky said. For a $6.99, 8-pound bag of potatoes, farmers receive 94 cents. A $4.49, 18-ounce package of dinner rolls gets a farmer 9 cents. A 12-ounce bag of green beans sold for $2.49 earns a farmer 62 cents.
“So when we talk about tariffs, we’re not talking about an abstract policy. We’re talking about real price increases on the foods that make up a traditional Thanksgiving dinner,” Levendofsky said. “Every added cost in the supply chain eventually shows up at the checkout line.”
The bottom line, he said, is tariffs don’t protect families or farmers.
Mary Carroll Dodd, owner of Red Scout Farm in western North Carolina, grows crops to sell through community-supported agriculture, at farmers’ markets and to local restaurants. Many of the supplies she depends upon — greenhouse materials, potting soil, tools, insect netting and produce bags — come from Canada, Mexico and China.
Costs add up quickly and profit margins are thin, she said.
“Every increase means tough choices,” Dodd said.
That can include price hikes for customers or other cost-cutting measures, which often come at the expense of fair worker pay, she said.
Because of the increase in her farm’s costs, she has raised the price of collard greens, kale and lettuce mix bags.
“We should be making it easier for family farms to survive,” Dodd said, “not harder.”
The Trump administration has touted trade deals and proposed bailout payments to mitigate low crop prices and high production costs. The administration also has claimed Thanksgiving food prices are lower this year than in past years, which the panelists said was misleading and inaccurate.
“A bailout is a Band-Aid on a bullet wound,” Levendofsky said.
Policy shifts throughout the agriculture industry are needed, he said. Kansas has piles of sorghum that are growing by the minute, but there’s no market for the farmers that grow it, he said. Farmers also need antitrust law enforcement that targets massive companies that have outsized control of markets, particularly meatpackers, Levendofsky said.
“I can honestly say farmers don’t want a bailout,” he said. “They want trade, not aid.”
Dodd said farms need long-term, sustainable solutions that are not one-size-fits-all. Existing programs within the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, such as its conservation stewardship program and cropshare programs, can provide farmers with sustainability.
Tuthill said a bailout is not going to solve farmers’ issues. The food industry needs customers outside of the country to draw dollars back into the country, he said.
For his company, tariffs and rising costs have meant fewer items going to food banks, smaller portions in school cafeterias and lower quality products in hospitals and prisons. Tariffs or taxes on food make no sense, he said.
“We’re at a pretty sad state of affairs to see that we’re raising the price of food for the most in need,” Tuthill said. “We see it every day.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Glickman-levendofsky-20250827_131619-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 09:57:03.026470

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is giving thanks for our readers and other blessings, and will return to your inboxes on Monday, Dec. 1.
Will a cap on student loans discourage Californians from becoming nurses? We may find out.
The Trump administration is proposing to restrict the amount of money nursing students can borrow to advance their education, raising worries that the change could potentially worsen California’s nursing shortage.
The U.S. Department of Education earlier this month wrapped up a rulemaking session ironing out details about new federal student loan rules from President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget bill that passed in July.
The bill eliminates two loan programs — one of which is Grad PLUS loans, a type of federal student aid for graduate students — while also creating what the department describes as the “new and simplified” Repayment Assistance Plan, or RAP.
Under RAP, which will be available in July, the total federal debt cap for students in professional programs is $200,000 and $100,000 for other graduate students. The education department is proposing to define professional degrees as degrees in medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, law, clinical psychology and other fields.
Nursing wouldn’t make the cut for the higher loan cap.
California faces a shortage of about 36,000 licensed nurses. The number of students opting to attend private, more expensive nursing programs in California is also rising. In a statement to CalMatters, the University of California, which has four nursing schools, said “limiting access to student loans … for aspiring nurses will only worsen this (shortage) crisis by undermining efforts to grow the workforce.”
The lowered borrowing cap would also make it harder for nursing students to become nurse practitioners, nurse anesthetists or other positions that require advanced degrees, nursing organizations argue.

Sandy Reding, president of the California Nurses Association union: “Nurse practitioners currently provide much-needed primary care, particularly in rural and underserved areas. If this rule went into effect, it could have a major impact on nurses’ access to graduate nursing programs. In addition, it will make it more difficult to find nursing faculty with advanced degrees to teach in nursing programs. We want to be clear that this is an attack on the nursing profession.”

The effect of the proposed loan cap for nurses could be similar to what experts anticipate about Trump’s new student loan caps for medical students: That higher financial barriers for students to pursue certain degrees would make the pool of prospective health care workers both shrink and become less diverse.
The education department released a statement Monday arguing that 95% of nursing students already borrow below the loan limit and won’t be affected by the rule change. Ellen Keast, the department’s press secretary for higher education, also told Newsweek that the plan’s definition of professional degrees aligns with “historical precedent.”

Keast: “We’re not surprised that some institutions are crying wolf over regulations that never existed because their unlimited tuition ride on the taxpayer dime is over.”

The department said it plans to finalize the student loan rules by early next year.

A setback for The Wonderful Company

From CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang:
California ag giant The Wonderful Company suffered a setback in its bid to overturn a new law that some of its workers had used to unionize when an appeal court tossed its lawsuit against state labor regulators. 
The Tuesday decision by a three-judge panel of the 5th District Court of Appeal in Fresno leaves in place a new law backed by the United Farm Workers that was meant to help it gain members. The law allows farmworkers to signal their support for union representation using a signed card, bypassing the traditional in-person, secret-ballot election usually held on the employer’s property. 
The Wonderful Company filed suit against the state’s Agricultural Labor Relations Board last year trying to overturn the law. The suit, alleging the law is unconstitutional, came after the United Farm Workers filed a petition with enough signatures to represent 600-odd workers at the company’s grape nursery in Wasco. 
Elizabeth Strater, United Farm Workers’ vice president, said the decision affirms that “every farm worker in California has rights under the law, and those rights need to be protected.” But the company’s general counsel Craig Cooper dismissed the ruling as only a matter of timing: “The decision explicitly does not address the merits of Wonderful Nurseries’ constitutional challenge.”



The latest on Trump’s immigration crackdown

Let’s get into some immigration news:

Student financial aid: The Trump administration is suing California to block its policy of offering in-state tuition, scholarships and loans to immigrant students who do not have legal status. Federal lawyers argue that California’s policy is unconstitutional, and violates a federal law that bars states from providing benefits to residents without legal status that aren’t also available to U.S. citizens who live anywhere in the U.S. An estimated 100,000 college students lack legal status in the state. California is the sixth state Trump is targeting of the more than 20 states that have some in-state tuition policy that benefits residents without legal status. The California Department of Justice said it is prepared to fight the lawsuit. Read more from CalMatters’ Adam Echelman and Mikhail Zinshteyn.


Arrests at ICE check-ins: A routine check-in with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement landed a San Diego pedicab driver in detainment — a situation that advocates say more immigrants are experiencing under Trump’s immigration crackdown. In 2022 Idris Demirtas sought asylum in the U.S. after fleeing Turkey to escape religious persecution. He received a five-year work permit and has no criminal history, according to his wife and attorneys. Last week federal immigration agents arrested Demirtas at a San Diego federal courthouse where he was ordered to appear for a check-in. He’s now being held at a detention center, and ICE did not respond to a request for comment about why Dimitras was arrested or why he’s still detained. Read more from CalMatters’ Wendy Fry.

One witness after another faced the House Oversight and Reform Committee and described their experience at the hands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which descended on Los Angeles in June, stirring discontent with a theatrical assault on the city’s immigrant communities. 
One man who has lived in Los Angeles for 23 years and is married with four children, dropped his younger kids at school on June 6 and headed to work, where ICE agents detained him. He ended up at an ICE facility in Adelanto, struggling with his health, waiting for days to see a nurse or doctor. Eventually he was released and is home in Los Angeles. 
A young woman, not present for the hearing but represented by a friend, was up early one morning to sell tamales outside a local school. ICE agents tossed her to the ground, injuring her so seriously she had to be hospitalized. She’s an American citizen and was released but now is so scared of ICE, she refuses to leave her house. She has been inside for 158 days.
Yet another man, detained on June 10 by masked men who had no identification or warrant for his arrest, remained locked up by ICE until Sept. 16, when he was released on bail. He described his 98 days of detention: rotten food, orders to stay silent when officials visited, an atmosphere of danger. 
His voice broke as he acknowledged he had been raped. The experience, he said, “reminded me of the violence that I lived through in my country, Honduras.”
Their stories were piercing, puncturing any glib stereotypes about immigrants, documented or undocumented. These were not dangerous criminals who need to be removed to protect this country. They are working men and women, laboring to support their families and loved ones. 
President Donald Trump promised to go after the “worst of the worst,” but his agents ended up harassing and devastating these decent people. And their detentions benefited no one.
Moreover, there are costs to others around them. Witnesses from local organizations made clear in their testimony that school attendance is down, church pews are half-empty, summer youth programs struggled to stay afloat and businesses are suffering for want of employees and customers.

Some people are afraid to venture out because they lack proper documentation. Others are afraid because they simply “look illegal.”
That apparently was the case for Andrea Velez. The daughter of Mexican immigrants, Velez was born in the United States and is, therefore, an American citizen. 
On June 2, her mom dropped her off at work in the fashion district. But before Velez could get inside, she was rushed by ICE officers, who took her into custody. She was not carrying any proof of American citizenship — few people do — and ICE was not interested in her driver’s license. She was handcuffed and detained.
Denied food, she was told she could only have water if she purchased a cup. She was rebuffed in her requests to contact family or a lawyer. Velez was held two days, until June 4.
To be clear, Velez had committed no crime and is a native-born American citizen. Her only offenses were to come to work and to be Latino. 
She asked the officers who arrested her for their names but was denied that, too. “They told me I didn’t need to know their names,” she said in response to questioning by Congress members who participated in the hearing.
One member questioned her more deeply, wondering if she had done anything to warrant such treatment. Velez said she had not been carrying any weapons and had neither attacked nor threatened any officer. She is 4 feet, 11 inches tall.
The treatment described by witnesses at the hearing should shock the conscience, but some consciences appear too hardened to be moved. 
As Mayor Karen Bass and Rep. Robert Garcia, who presided over the session, noted, the cruelty of these policies is not a defect — it is the point.
“It was over the top from Day 1,” Bass told me after the hearing, “the way they dramatized it by pulling up on the street and jumping out with rifles at a woman selling fruit. There’s no way in the world you can tell me they thought she was a criminal … It was designed to terrorize. It was to go in and inflict maximum damage.”
These wanton attacks on the fabric of Los Angeles life have had at least one positive effect: In a city that has sometimes seen Black and brown residents turn against each other, this episode has been unifying, something many speakers remarked on, and that was reinforced by the proceeding itself: Garcia, a native of Peru and naturalized American citizen, sat next to Bass, the first Black woman to serve as Los Angeles’s mayor.
Support for immigrants came from a broad range of speakers: from Rep. Maxine Waters to immigrant groups, from union leadership to prominent Japanese-Americans. including some who drew parallels to the 1942 internments that were carried out under the same legal authority Trump is using now for his anti-immigrant actions.
Monday’s hearing was packed, and speakers were often interrupted by cheers and applause. As witnesses concluded their sometimes-harrowing stories, others stepped forward to hug and comfort them. A session called to collect evidence became an opportunity to demonstrate solidarity.
One of the day’s loudest expressions of support came for Waters, when she used her time to denounce Trump, whom she called a “low-down, no-good, filthy president.” The audience — white, Black, Asian, Latino, old and young — cheered loudly for that. Give him his due: Trump has brought Los Angeles together.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/070725-MacArthur-Park-Feds-JW-CM-20.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

But the administration's legal argument is weak, according to top legal experts.","In summary
The Trump administration is suing California, asking the state to end its policies allowing students without legal status to access in-state tuition and financial aid. But the administration’s legal argument is weak, according to top legal experts. 



Hours after the Trump administration sued California last week, threatening to end key benefits for students without legal status, Michelle was scrolling social media when she saw a video that made her panic. 
The Trump administration is challenging California’s policy of providing in-state tuition, scholarships and subsidized loans to immigrants without legal status — including Michelle, an immigrant who is a community college student in San Mateo County. CalMatters has agreed to withhold her full name because she fears drawing attention to her legal status. 
On TikTok, rumors swirled. Michelle saw a video of a young man, around her age, asking if the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, is gone. In reality, FAFSA is still around, and while the new lawsuit could affect some students’ financial aid, some top legal experts say the Trump administration is unlikely to win. Regardless, the court process may take weeks or much longer to resolve the government’s claims against California.
In the lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges that California’s policy of granting in-state tuition and financial aid for some students without legal status is unconstitutional. Federal lawyers also argue that California’s policies violate a 1996 federal law, which bars states from providing benefits to residents without legal status that aren’t also available to U.S. citizens who live anywhere in the U.S. The Justice Department is arguing that California either needs to drop the policy or let all U.S. citizens, including those who are out-of-state, pay the same rate.
In California, over 100,000 college students lack legal status, according to one estimate by an alliance of university leaders who advocate for immigrants. Federal assistance, such as Pell grants and federal student loans, are off-limits to anyone who isn’t a U.S. citizen or does not have permanent legal status. California has its own money for college financial aid, which it distributes according to state law. 
As long as individuals meet certain requirements, such as attending three years of high school in California, they’re eligible for in-state tuition, saving as much as $39,000 of dollars each year compared to their out-of-state peers. Once they meet those requirements, students without legal status can also qualify for the state’s cornerstone financial aid program, known as Cal Grant, though only a small fraction of these students actually apply for and receive it.   
To Kevin Johnson, a law professor at UC Davis, Trump’s actions may be more about political wins than legal ones. “The Trump administration is engaged in a full-court press on undocumented immigrants and so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, and California and Governor Newsom in particular,” Johnson said. That the U.S. Department of Justice named the suit “United States of America v. Newsom” is another indication that this is political, he added.
Others noted that states have already invested in students without legal status and denying them an affordable path toward a college education is a waste of resources. Economists have pointed out that immigrants without status also are integral to the U.S. workforce and aren’t easily replaceable. 
‘We didn’t expect them to go this low’
Even weak lawsuits or outright misinformation can make students nervous during November, when college and financial aid application season is in full swing.  
On TikTok, videos of students panicking about the financial aid system surfaced last winter, after the Biden administration delayed and botched the rollout of the new FAFSA. Among its many glitches, the new form prevented students whose parents lacked a Social Security number from submitting their information.
After Trump was elected last November, fears about the total demise of federal financial aid swirled again on TikTok. Over the course of this year, as his administration targets universities and continues to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, those fears have persisted. 
In California, Trump seeks to impose a $1 billion penalty on UCLA for alleged civil rights abuses, though a federal judge recently handed the White House a temporary loss on that front. His administration is also suing California colleges and universities for alleged antisemitism violations and has sought to freeze or curtail billions of dollars in federal research funding. 
Much of those freezes have been blocked or reversed by federal judges, but hundreds of millions of dollars still remain cut off to campuses. Much, if not all, of those friction points between California and Trump could be resolved through settlements and negotiations, which are political in nature, said UCLA law professor Hiroshi Motomura in an interview.
Before Trump was elected, state leaders, including Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Chula Vista Democrat, pushed for California to offer additional benefits to students without legal status, such as the opportunity to work campus jobs. 
Now, with access to financial aid programs at risk for these students, Alvarez said the focus is shifting. “We didn’t expect it would go this low as to go after students that the president had previously said should be welcomed here.” In 2024, Trump told a podcast host that students should “automatically” receive “a Green Card,” otherwise known as permanent residency, when they get their college diploma. 
Legal scholars doubt Trump’s lawsuit will win
The lawsuit against California is the Trump administration’s sixth against states with policies allowing in-state tuition for students without legal status. The White House went after Texas first, in June. Underscoring how much of a bipartisan issue in-state tuition is, Texan lawmakers were the first in the U.S. to enshrine the policy in 2001. In all, more than 20 states passed some in-state tuition policy benefiting some residents without legal status.Trump’s legal attacks on the policy this year prompted leaders in Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas to side with the White House to terminate the benefit in those respective states. Some legal groups that want to continue in-state tuition for students lacking legal status are challenging those states’ moves.Trump has also sued Minnesota and Illinois, states with Democrats as governors and attorneys general who are challenging Trump’s lawsuits.
The U.S. Department of Justice says that the federal law in question bars students without legal status from receiving in-state tuition and financial aid benefits based on their living in the state. This, the federal lawyers argue, violates federal law since public campuses in California require U.S. citizens from other states to pay higher tuition rates.  However, California’s law, Assembly Bill 540, doesn’t extend in-state tuition based on where students live, scholars and a previous court ruling say. Instead, students generally need to prove that they attended three years of high school or community college in California; they also need to earn in California a high school diploma or obtain enough community college credits to be eligible for transfer into a public university.The Department of Justice says those three-year high school or community college requirements are tantamount to an in-state residency criteria and therefore violate the 1996 federal law.But the California Supreme Court in 2010 already struck down that interpretation. The high court observed that some students living in areas bordering California are permitted to study at California high schools. High school students from out of state enrolled in private boarding schools also satisfy the requirement; they don’t count as residents of California either. And students who were residents of California during high school but moved to a different state could still enroll in California colleges or universities paying in-state tuition. 
All of these scenarios require a student to complete the same AB 540 application as students who lack legal status. The only difference is that students without status must also complete an affidavit that they’ll pursue legal residency as soon as they can. 
In fact, the University of California enrolled more students under AB 540 who were legal U.S. residents than those who weren’t, the state high court said then. 
“If Congress had intended to prohibit states entirely from making unlawful aliens eligible for in-state tuition, it could easily have done so,” the state Supreme Court wrote in 2010. But Congress didn’t do that, the court noted.Lawmakers in California who passed AB 540 in 2001 knew what the federal law restricted, said Motomura, and they crafted a state law that wouldn’t contravene what Congress intended. “It was drafted to avoid the residency test, and it was drafted to avoid the exclusion of U.S. citizens,” he said.
What’s likely next
California has already signaled that it will fight the lawsuit. “The Trump Administration has once again missed the mark with its latest attack on California, and we look forward to proving it in court,” wrote Nina Sheridan, a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice. 
Both the UC and the community college system said their tuition and financial aid policies have always been legally compliant. The Cal State University system did not respond to a request for comment.The Trump administration may also seek a preliminary injunction to halt California’s in-state tuition law for nonresidents, which would again expose Californians to a seesaw of temporary court orders, sometimes contradictory in nature, while the full legal merits of the case play out slowly in court.Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, thinks the U.S. Supreme Court will likely side with California despite its conservative orientation if the case goes that far.A major legal question underscoring the case against California is when and how federal rules preempt or supersede state laws. The Trump White House is arguing California’s in-state policies are preempted by federal law. But the legal concept of preemption is a pillar in jurisprudence. Liberal and conservative interests benefit similarly from a consistent application of preemption as a legal concept, Saenz said. For example, businesses rely on preemption rules in situations where a state law is more progressive or consumer-friendly than a federal rule and want courts to defend them from following the more demanding state rules.The U.S. Supreme Court is “going to be very wary of making bad law in the realm of preemption, because it could then come back to bite the right wing in protecting businesses,” Saenz said. 
For Michelle and other students without legal status navigating their own financial aid applications — and the misinformation online — a series of temporary court orders could create more panic. Financial aid is top of mind, said Michelle, but she doesn’t have time to track the legal back-and-forth of her eligibility. 
In addition to being a full-time student, Michelle works four days a week at a restaurant, saving up money not only to support herself but also her family. She’s the oldest of four kids and said she sends $500 to her parents each month.
College is “an opportunity for me to be someone in life, to make my parents proud,” she said. Asked about the lawsuit at the cafeteria of her college, Michelle made a choking gesture with her hand, as though the threat of losing financial aid next year could kill her. “Trump is taking that opportunity away because he doesn’t like immigrants.” 
The deadline to submit financial aid applications for community college is Sept. 2, but Michelle is already working on her application, just in case.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112823_DACA-Students_AE_CM_20.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

The U.S. deported just five immigrants from Turkey in the 2024 federal budget year. One Turkish immigrant now fears deportation after being summoned to a San Diego ICE office.


A San Diego pedicab driver who fled Turkey after being tortured because of his religious beliefs is the latest among hundreds of people who have been arrested across California at routine immigration check-ins, according to advocates, his attorneys, and his wife. 
Idris Demirtas, 25, sought asylum in El Paso in December 2022 and was legally paroled into the United States that same month. He was issued a five-year work permit. A biomed student in Turkey, Demirtas has no criminal history in his home country or the U.S., according to his wife and attorneys. 
“He is the sweetest, most loving, and kind person. Everyone who meets him loves him. He’s very family-oriented and a fair-minded person,” said his wife, Mae Bovenzi, who was born and raised in San Diego.
His attorneys and Bovenzi said Demirtas has scars on his body from physical violence he suffered in Turkey because he is not a member of the Muslim faith. 
“He’s never told me everything about what exactly happened, but he has scars all over his body,” said Bovenzi. 
In 2023, the U.S. Department of State issued a report finding in Turkey “significant human rights issues included credible reports of: enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government or on behalf of the government.”

The United States during the second Trump administration is deporting people to countries that were mostly off-limits in the past, such as Iran. In the past, authorities have been forced to either hold those immigrants indefinitely in detention or release them into the U.S. That means immigrant communities from countries that previously did not have to worry about being deported now have renewed cause for concern.  
A review of ICE Flight Monitor housed at the Human Rights First organization shows zero deportation flights to Turkey between January 2025 and October 2025. 
In April 2022, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency reported deporting a Turkish national who they said was suspected of providing support to terrorist organizations to Istanbul. The agency reported deporting five Turkish people in the 2024 federal budget year.
Arrests ramp up at immigration court
Federal immigration agents arrested Demirtas in San Diego last Thursday at the downtown federal Edward Schwartz courthouse, where he was responding to a call-in letter he received on Nov. 19 ordering him to appear for a check-in at 8 a.m. the next morning. With less than 16 hours’ notice, Demirtas and his wife decided he would go to the check-in because he was trying to comply with the law, his wife said. Bovenzi said she has barely been able to eat since the couple received the call-in notice. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to a request for comment about why Dimitras was arrested or why he is still being detained. He is currently being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center, operated by the for-profit prison company CoreCivic, according to a federal detainee locator database.
Apprehensions at ICE check-ins have ramped up across California since the beginning of October in cities such as San Diego, Fresno, and Stockton, according to news reports and advocacy groups. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in the first hours of his second term that lifted a previous Biden-era ban on arresting immigrants at sensitive places, including courthouses, schools, and churches. 
In October, activists with an organization called Detention Resistance documented more than 100 arrests at ICE check-in appointments on the second floor of the San Diego federal building. 
Some politicians, advocates, and lawyers argue that apprehensions at ICE check-ins violate people’s due process rights by creating a catch-22 for immigrants: If they go to their appointments, they may be detained for months and potentially deported. But if they don’t appear at a scheduled check-in or call-in, ICE can issue a formal deportation order against them, effectively guaranteeing their arrest and deportation. 
U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla visited the San Diego immigration court in September and likened it to “a trap.”
“I think they’re accomplishing exactly what they want, which is basically forcing people into a really difficult decision,” said one of Demirtas’ attorneys, Tessa Cabrera. “You’re detaining someone, separating them from their family and their resources, their ability to make money and support their families … I think a lot of people are going to say, ‘I don’t want to deal with this,’ and just give up.” 
Detention conditions
Demirtas told his wife during a Sunday visitation at the Otay detention center that he was first held for 11 hours in the crowded basement of the downtown federal courthouse without access to food or water. He could hear babies crying throughout the night, according to his wife, Bovenzi. ICE did not respond to a question about whether or not infants are being held in the basement of the federal building. 
After being transferred to Otay, Demirtas told his wife he has been sleeping on the floor because of overcrowding. 
“He has now been provided with food, but none of it has been a complete nutritious meal,
the water is foul, and he has no bed, just a mat on the floor,” according to a draft court document one of his attorneys wrote on his behalf. 
 Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, said everyone at the facility has a bed. 
“Any claim of water quality issues is patently false,” he said. Otay Mesa Detention Center “gets the same clean drinking water the local utility supplies to the surrounding community. Staff at our facility drink the same water as those in our care.” 
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Demirtas’ case. 
In late July, KPBS reported the Otay Mesa Detention Center housed more than 100 people over its contractual capacity of 1,358 detainees, citing a report from Syracruse University. Nationally, detention numbers have also spiked, with more than 65,000 people detained –  a record high.  
Over the forty days between October 1 and November 10, Otay Mesa Detention Center held an average of 1,456 people on a daily basis, about 98 people above its contractual capacity, according to ICE data and the site Detention Reports, which shows detainee population fluctuations over time at each ICE facility. 
It’s nearly impossible to determine from the data how many of those arrests occurred at immigration court hearings or check-ins, but mathematician Joseph Gunther identified 2,388 cases nationwide of people (including 76 children) who were likely arrested at immigration courthouses in May, June, and July 2025. His research paper identified 141 confirmed and likely arrests at the San Diego federal courthouse, which was the fourth highest in the country. Gunther noted the actual number of arrests was likely higher. 
Bovenzi said her husband already paid more than $2,000 in fees to file immigration-related paperwork. Now, the family is scrambling to get together another $5,000 for a potential habeas petition. 
Attorneys have increasingly used these federal lawsuits during the second Trump administration to end what they argue are illegal detentions of their immigration clients.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425-Padilla-SD-Court-AH-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

The bill allows the public to request a list of voters and election history information from the Secretary of State’s Office from the previous 10 election cycles.According to the news release from the Alabama Secretary of State’s Office, it currently charges one cent per voter on the list.
“HB 67 is rooted in government accountability and transparency,” said Wes Allen, Secretary of State for Alabama. “Its passage will establish a clear standard by statutorily aligning the maximum cost for purchasing Alabama’s voter list with our neighboring Southeastern states.”
However, the information will exclude what the Alabama Secretary of State’s Office considers personal information, including people’s birthdays and their Social Security numbers.
Clete Welti, communications director for the Alabama House Democrats, said the changes could limit the usefulness of the list.
“Essentially, right now, someone without a lot of economic means can pretty much afford to get the voter files when running for office,” he said. “Once you get that voter file, you have got those email addresses, phone numbers, you have a physical address and age. Now, if you are saying all the information is ‘confidential,’ then all you are going to get from the Secretary of State’s Office, if this bill passes, is a list of names.”
The names, by themselves, are not useful, Welti said.

Sept. 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThe state’s new 24% tax on all cannabis products, which was passed as a part of the fiscal year 2026 budget package, came before the Michigan Court of Claims on Tuesday, with the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association arguing that the tax was unconstitutional.
The hearing was held in Detroit on Tuesday morning.
Since its passage, the tax has been criticized by many cannabis business owners and employees, who say that it will force small retailers out of business and boost the black market.
The association is seeking an injunction to the new law, which is slated to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2026, and is hoping that its lawsuit in Michigan Cannabis Industry Association v. Michigan will result in the tax being struck down.

Specifically, the association argued that the new law seeks to change the language of the 2018 ballot proposal that legalized cannabis in the state, the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act, which specifically included a 10% excise tax on all recreational marijuana purchases. The association said that because the new tax in the 2025 Comprehensive Road Funding Tax Act was passed by only a simple majority vote, and not the supermajority required to amend the law put in place by the ballot initiative, the change bucked the tenets of the amendment.
“As the leading cannabis trade association, we’re here in court fighting to protect the will of Michigan voters,” Rose Tantraphol, a spokesperson for the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association, said in a statement after the hearing. “Michigan voters made their voices heard loud and clear in 2018 when they passed a citizen ballot initiative legalizing cannabis, and this 24% wholesale tax was imposed in violation of provisions in the state’s constitution.” 
In a court filing responding to the complaint and request for a preliminary injunction, the Michigan Department of Attorney General, representing the state Legislature, argued that the new 24% is not an amendment to the original sales tax on marijuana products.
“Given that the (marijuana tax act’s) excise tax is directed only at a retail transaction, the (road funding act’s) wholesale excise tax does not ‘revise, alter or amend’ the (marijuana tax act),” the filing said. 
It also notes that the 10% tax is imposed “in addition to all other taxes,” according to the law, and as such, it did not directly negate or change the initial law.
The new tax was a crucial piece of the current fiscal year’s budget, and will be used to fund road repairs and new construction, a centerpiece of Gov.

(Photo: Getty Images)The Latino engagement group Somos Votantes Education Fund partnered with the national nonprofit Undue Medical Debt to write down $133 million of existing medical debt for people in Nevada.
Undue Medical Debt uses funding provided by donations to buy medical debt from health providers and collection agencies at steep discounts.
The 128,000 people who qualified are expected to get letters this week informing them which medical debts have been eliminated, Somos Votantes said in a press release.
“Eligible community members did not need to apply, and there was no application process,” the release said.
The move will give people in Clark and Washoe counties “much needed relief as the cost of health care continues to rise and health insurance premiums are expected to increase,” said Emmanuel Leal, the national communications and media director with Somos Votantes.
Individuals with medical debts that are more than 5% of their annual income or those earning at or below four times the federal poverty level ($62,600) qualified for relief. 
“Medical debt carries a very heavy burden on the shoulders of working families that often traps them in this sort of endless cycle of financial difficulty and stress,” Leal said. The group is hoping to secure additional relief in coming months. 
The high cost of health care, which will be exacerbated by the expiration of the Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums, were a central part of the recent 43-day federal government shutdown.
Nevadans who get insurance through Nevada Health Link are facing a projected average 26% premium rate hike.
The majority of Democrats refused to sign a continuing resolution to fund the government without a vote to restore the premiums or reverse Medicaid cuts from President Donald Trump’s massive tax and immigration bill passed this summer.
Nevada Democratic U.S. Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto were among the eight Democratic Senators who broke with the majority of their caucus earlier this month to reopen the government in exchange for a promised future vote on health care costs – not a guarantee the premiums would be extended.  
An estimated 177,000 people in Nevada have medical debt according to a report from Kaiser Family Foundation.
As the cost of living increases, people are often faced with a choice between paying for health care or paying for rent or food, Leal said. 
Removing the medical debt would give them one less bill to worry about. 
Paying off a medical debt won’t take it off a credit report, said Peter Aldous, an attorney with the Consumer Rights Project at the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada.
Yet, it can improve someone’s credit score and “even a small amount” of debt eliminated could be beneficial, he said. 
“That can be huge for somebody when they need to buy a car or they need to buy a house,” Aldous said. “Now they can qualify for that lower interest rate, and that’s frequently hundreds of dollars a month in savings by just bringing their credit score up a fairly small amount.”
The decision to add medical debt to credit reports “doesn’t have to be this way,” he added. 
Under President Joe Biden, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced a regulation to prevent medical debt from being included on credit reports. The Trump administration reversed that rule. 
“It’s funny because it isn’t really as strong of a political issue as you’d think or a Democrat versus Republican issue,” Aldous said. “It’s a relatively popular idea that medical debt is not something you choose to take out in the way that you take out credit card debt. You shouldn’t be punished as much for having medical debt as other kinds of debt.”
Industry, including credit agencies and lending groups, have lobbied to assure that medical debt remains on credit reports.  
Nevada Democratic state Assemblymember Max Carter proposed legislation in the regular legislative session earlier this year that sought to prohibit health care providers and collection agencies from reporting medical debt to consumer reporting agencies.
It passed in a mostly party line vote but was vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. 
Even if it did pass, Aldous said it would have likely faced pushback. 
The CPFB issued a guidance in October saying “that the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) generally preempts State laws that touch on broad areas of credit reporting”
“There are states that have laws that prohibit reporting of medical debt,” Aldous said, many which are currently being challenged. “I don’t know exactly how that’s all going to go,” he said, adding he wasn’t optimistic.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/medical-bill-past-due-getty-1024x643-1.jpeg,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

The company contends the law is unconstitutional.","In summary
The Wonderful Company sued to overturn a farmworker unionization law, but a California appeals court found the lawsuit was premature. The company contends the law is unconstitutional. 


California ag giant the Wonderful Company suffered a setback on Tuesday in its bid to overturn a new farmworker unionization law when an appeals court tossed its lawsuit against state labor regulators. 
The  decision by a three-judge panel of the 5th District Court of Appeal in Fresno leaves in place a controversial new law backed by the United Farm Workers that was meant to boost organizing in a heavily immigrant workforce. The law allows farmworkers to signal their support for union representation using a signed card, bypassing the traditional in-person, secret-ballot election usually held on the employer’s property. 
The Wonderful Company — owner of the Wonderful Pistachios brand and Fiji Water, Pom pomegranate juices and Halos oranges —filed suit against the state’s Agricultural Labor Relations Board last year trying to overturn the law, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2023. 
The suit, alleging the law is unconstitutional, came after the United Farm Workers filed a petition with enough signatures to represent 600-odd workers at the company’s grape nursery in Wasco. 
In a contentious public dispute, the company accused union organizers of tricking workers into signing cards supporting unionization and provided over 100 employees’ signatures attesting to being deceived; in turn, the union accused the company of illegally intimidating workers into withdrawing their support. Regulators at the agricultural labor board filed charges against Wonderful after investigating the claims. 
All of those allegations were being heard before the labor board last spring when Wonderful took the matter to court, arguing the new law deprived the company of due process. A Kern County judge initially halted the board proceedings, but the appeals court allowed them to continue last fall. After weeks of hearings this year, the labor board has yet to issue a decision on whether UFW can represent Wonderful employees. 
In the meantime, the company has shuttered the Wasco nursery and donated it to UC Davis, making the question of an actual union at the worksite moot. 
In the new ruling, the appeals court judges issued a sharp rebuke of the company for suing over the unionization instead of waiting for the labor board decision. 
“Wonderful filed this petition notwithstanding approximately 50 years of unbroken precedent finding an employer may not directly challenge a union certification decision in court except in extraordinarily and exceedingly rare circumstances, which Wonderful does not meaningfully attempt to show are present here,” wrote Justice Rosendo Peña. 
Elizabeth Strater, a United Farm Workers vice president, said the decision affirms that “every farm worker in California has rights under the law, and those rights need to be protected.”
But Wonderful Company General Counsel Craig Cooper dismissed the ruling as only a matter of timing:  “the decision explicitly does not address the merits of Wonderful Nurseries’ constitutional challenge.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/080322_UFWmarch_LV_CM_033.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

Teresa Leger Fernández visited the burn scar to brainstorm next steps and meet with a family whose well is contaminated with heavy metals.,"Darleen and Johnathan Ortiz have faced one challenge after another in the aftermath of the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Darleen and Johnathan Ortiz built their fire-proofed home a decade ago high in the forest in Mora County along the Rio de La Casa, which carried enough water down the mountain to feed an acequia and water the vegetables in their greenhouse. 
Early signs indicated the drinking water was as clean as the surroundings were idyllic. The Ortizes tested their private well several times, including to certify their lettuce as organic for sale at a local market, and never detected anything unusual. 
That all changed in 2022 when the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire raged through the area. While their home avoided damage, the fire destroyed 19 structures higher in the watershed and post-fire debris flows carried ash and contaminants down the river. Flooding also changed the path of the river, making it bypass the acequia’s headgate. 
Over the last few years, with the help of various state and federal agencies and nonprofit organizations, the Ortizes restored a level of normalcy. A 10-foot-deep concrete wall that replaced an eroding embankment helped reconnect the river and acequia. Crews downed and removed 800 burned trees, and in their place grew mint, yerba buena and wild raspberries, welcome surprises that the Ortizes enjoyed this summer.

Martin Zamora (R-Clovis), right, around her property, where recent tests discovered contaminants in the groundwater. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)
“We tried to do the best that we can,” Johnathan told Source New Mexico on Tuesday as the Rio de la Casa trickled along the brand new concrete below him. “But it just seems that once you get a little bit ahead, there’s just another blow, which is now the well water situation. Now we’re eating on paper plates and really not drinking the well water and that kind of thing. So it’s just one hurdle after another.”
The Ortizes’ private well stands among 72 in the area that recently tested positive for dangerous levels of heavy metals. Kate Zeigler, the independent geologist who discovered the contaminants, has pointed to fire suppressants as the likely culprit. Recently, Zeigler hand-delivered the couple results of her latest round of testing, showing their well had high levels of arsenic, aluminum, manganese and antimony. 
According to a presentation Zeigler gave Tuesday at a library in Mora, at least 400 private wells exist in the burn scar, including about 100 that are not registered with the state. The county also has public wells. County officials have said that the latest samples show no contaminants in public drinking water wells, though they noted Tuesday they are waiting for updated test results from the United States Geological Survey.

Testing the remaining burn scar wells, as well as soil and surface water testing, emerged as a key next step during the meeting, which U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández convened. She joined a handful of state lawmakers from both parties, along with local elected officials and advocates, to discuss the potential sources and extent of the contamination, along with where money might come from to pay for testing and remediation. 
FEMA says NM fire victims will have to prove ‘causation’ to get payment for well contamination

Zeigler said the best tests to capture all of the potential contaminants cost as much as $2,000 a sample, though efforts are in the works to provide free testing, she said. State Environment Department officials collected names of private well owners at a recent community meeting, and they pointed well owners to a list of companies that provide testing. 
Drew Goretzka, a spokesperson for the Environment Department, told Source New Mexico in an email the agency is conducting additional testing, which Zeigler said Tuesday should begin “soon.” Lawmakers like Sen. Pat Woods (R-Broadview) also suggested the Legislature could approve new funding at the 30-day session beginning in January.

Leger Fernández also reiterated her criticism that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees an office with a $5.45 billion compensation fund for fire victims, stop “hedging” about whether it will compensate fire victims for the newly discovered contamination. She called on them to join an emerging partnership between state and local entities, along with her office, that is trying to find solutions. 
FEMA officials told Source New Mexico on Friday that the claims office would consider claims for damages related to the contamination, but only if claimants prove “injuries and causation.” What exactly that could mean is one of many uncertainties attendees described Tuesday. 
New Mexico officials, Mora residents say feds should respond to groundwater contamination

“I wrote that darn law,” Leger Fernández said of the bill creating the compensation fund. “And this is the kind of thing they should have been covering.”
In the meantime, the Ortizes’ are now afraid of their drinking water and wondering how far the contaminants have spread, perhaps even to the raspberries that at first seemed a post-fire blessing. Meeting attendees stopped by the Ortizes’ property as the last stop on their visit Tuesday, where Darleen wondered aloud about how she’ll handle the latest crisis since the fire three and a half years ago. 
“Without water, gosh, I don’t know,” Darleen said. 
“I thought about the mint that I had picked there,” she said, pointing toward one of the wellheads Zeigler tested. “And I was making little tea bags for my family for Christmas, and I’m thinking to myself, is it okay to give it to them?”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1370-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 07:57:07.332772

(Photo by Lauren Sausser/KFF Health News)BOILING SPRINGS — Near the back corner of the local library’s parking lot, largely out of view from the main road, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened a pop-up clinic in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children.
Spartanburg County, in South Carolina’s Upstate region, has been fighting a measles outbreak since early October, with more than 50 cases identified. Health officials have encouraged people who are unvaccinated to get a shot by visiting its mobile vaccine clinic at any of its several stops throughout the county.
But on a Monday afternoon in Boiling Springs, only one person showed up.
“It’s progress. That progress is slow,” Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health, said during a recent press briefing. “We had hoped to see a more robust uptake than that in our mobile health units.”
As South Carolina tries to contain its measles outbreak, public health officials across the nation are concerned that the highly contagious virus is making a major comeback.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied more than 1,700 measles cases and 45 outbreaks in 2025. The largest started in Texas, where hundreds of people were infected and two children died.
For the first time in more than two decades, the United States is poised to lose its measles elimination status, a designation indicating that outbreaks are rare and rapidly contained.
South Carolina’s measles outbreak isn’t yet as large as those in other states, such as New Mexico, Arizona, and Kansas. But it shows how a confluence of larger national trends — including historically low vaccination rates, skepticism fueled by the pandemic, misinformation, and “health freedom” ideologies proliferated by conservative politicians — have put some communities at risk for the reemergence of a preventable, potentially deadly virus.
“Everyone talks about it being the canary in the coal mine because it’s the most contagious infectious disease out there,” said Josh Michaud, associate director for global and public health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “The logic is indisputable that we’re likely to see more outbreaks.”
Schools and ‘small brush fires’
Spartanburg’s vaccination rate is among the lowest of South Carolina’s 46 counties. And that was true “even before COVID,” said Chris Lombardozzi, a senior vice president with the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.
Nearly 6,000 children in Spartanburg County schools last year — 10% of the total enrollment — either received an exemption allowing them to forgo required vaccinations or did not meet vaccine
requirements, according to data published by the state.
Lombardozzi said the county’s low vaccination rate is tied to misinformation not only published on social media but also spread by “a variety of nonmedical leaders over the years.”
The pandemic made things worse. Michaud said that fear and misinformation surrounding COVID-19 vaccines “threw gasoline on the fire of people’s vaccine skepticism.” In some cases, that skepticism transferred to childhood vaccines, which historically have been less controversial, he said.
This made communities like Spartanburg County with low vaccination rates more vulnerable. “Which is why we’re seeing constant, small brush fires of measles outbreaks,” Michaud said.
In Spartanburg, the overall percentage of students with required immunizations fell from 95.1% to 90% between the 2020-21 and 2024-25 academic years. Public health officials say a minimum of 95% is required to prevent significant spread of measles.
150 Spartanburg County students quarantined as measles continues to spread in SC

Children who attend public and private schools in South Carolina are required to show that they’ve received some vaccinations, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, but religious exemptions are relatively easy to obtain.
The exemption form must be notarized, but it does not require a doctor’s note or any disclosure about the family’s religious beliefs.
The number of students in South Carolina who have been granted religious exemptions has increased over the past decade. That’s particularly true in the Upstate region, where religious exemptions have increased sixfold from a decade ago.
During the 2013-14 school year, 2,044 students in the Upstate were granted a religious exemption to the vaccine requirements, according to data published by The Post and Courier. By fall 2024, that number had jumped to more than 13,000.
Some schools are more exposed than others.
The beginning of the South Carolina outbreak was largely linked to one public charter school, Global Academy of South Carolina, where only 17% of the 605 students enrolled during the 2024-25 school year provided documentation showing they had received their required vaccinations, according to data published by the Department of Public Health.
No one from Global Academy responded to interview requests.


‘Health freedom’
In April, after visiting a Texas family whose daughter had died from measles, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He made a similar statement during an interview on “Dr. Phil” later that month.
But these endorsements stand at odds with other statements Kennedy has made that cast doubt on vaccine safety and have falsely linked vaccines with autism. The CDC, under his authority, now claims such links “have been ignored by health authorities.”
“What would I do if I could go back in time and I could avoid giving my children the vaccines that I gave them?” he said on a podcast in 2020. “I would do anything for that. I would pay anything to be able to do that.”
Throughout 2025, he has made other misleading or unsupported statements. During a congressional hearing in September, Kennedy defended his past claims that he was not anti-vaccine but affirmed his stated position that no vaccines are safe or effective.
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told KFF Health News that Kennedy is “pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.” Hilliard said HHS is working with “state and local partners in South Carolina” and in other states to provide support during the measles outbreaks.
Meanwhile, Kennedy has frequently championed the idea of health freedom, or freedom of choice, regarding vaccines, a talking point that has taken root among Republicans.
That has had a “chilling effect all the way down through state and local lawmakers,” Michaud said, making some leaders hesitant to talk about the threat that the ongoing measles outbreaks poses or the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccine.
Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, said the governor was not available to be interviewed for this article but referenced McMaster’s comment from October that measles “is a dangerous disease, of course, but in terms of diseases, it’s not one that we should panic about.”
On a separate occasion that month, the Republican governor said he does not support vaccine mandates.
“I know measles is a serious disease and is highly contagious, but the answer to that is to make sure that the people, the parents, have all the information they need and have accurate information and let them make what they think is the right decision,” he told reporters, adding, “We’re not going to have mandates. And I think that we are responding properly.”
Even though the South Carolina Department of Public Health has repeatedly encouraged measles vaccines, the push has been notably quieter than the agency’s COVID-19 vaccine outreach efforts.
In 2021, for example, the agency partnered with breweries throughout the state for a campaign called “Shot and a Chaser,” which rewarded people who got a COVID-19 vaccine with a free beer or soda.
By contrast, the pop-up measles vaccine clinic at the Boiling Springs Library featured no flashy signage, no freebies, and wasn’t visible from the library’s main entrance.
Dr. Edward Simmer, McMaster’s appointed interim director of the Department of Public Health, would not speak to KFF Health News about the measles outbreak.
During a legislative hearing in April, Republican senators voted against his permanent confirmation to lead the newly separate agency amid false allegations about his response to the COVID-19 pandemic and his promotion of vaccines.
One lawmaker specifically criticized the agency during that hearing for the Shot and a Chaser campaign.
‘Outrageously false’: Nominated SC health director defends COVID response over opponents’ claims

It was a stark contrast to Simmer’s first confirmation process in 2021, when senators voted 40-1 amid the COVID-19 vaccine rollout to put the retired Navy doctor in charge of what was then the Department of Health and Environmental Control.
Public health officials in other states have been blocked from new roles because of their COVID-19 response.
In Missouri, where MMR vaccine rates have declined among kindergartners since 2020 and measles cases have been reported this year, Republican lawmakers rejected a public health director in 2022 after vaccine opponents protested his appointment.
Following South Carolina senators’ 5-12 vote in April to reject Simmer’s confirmation, McMaster continued to back his nominee, leaving Simmer on as interim director indefinitely.
Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort was the only Republican on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee who voted to confirm Simmer. He told KFF Health News that his Republican colleagues raised valid questions about Simmer’s past support for COVID-19 vaccines.
But, Davis said, it would be “tremendously unfortunate and not beneficial from a public health perspective if the Republican Party became just reflectively against vaccines as a matter of policy.”
The Department of Public Health had administered 44 doses of the MMR vaccine through its mobile health unit from October to mid-November. The last mobile vaccine clinic was scheduled for Nov. 24.
But health officials are encouraged that patients are seeking vaccines elsewhere. The agency’s tracking system shows that providers across Spartanburg County administered more than twice as many measles vaccines in October as they did a year ago.
As of mid-November, more than 130 people remained in quarantine, most of them students at local elementary and middle schools. Cases have also been linked to a church and Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport.
“We’re reminding people that travel for the upcoming holidays increases the risk of exposures greatly,” said Bell, the state epidemiologist. “Due to that risk, we’re encouraging people to consider getting vaccinated now.”

Photographs by John Partipilo/Tennessee LookoutFederal officials announced a new crime hotline for residents of Memphis public housing Monday, the latest facet of a task force that deployed federal and state law enforcement in the city starting in early October.
U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Scott Turner said the hotline is meant to provide residents of HUD-funded housing a direct line to report “criminals, illegal aliens, sex offenders, human traffickers and those guilty of gang activity, drug distribution and fraud.”
Calls will go to the HUD Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, waste and abuse in government-subsidized housing. The office will coordinate with the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI, and state and local law enforcement, Turner said.
Turner specifically singled out immigrants lacking permanent legal status in his remarks. 
“We will clean up our public housing so that they can fulfill their function of sanctuaries for the most vulnerable people in our country, where American citizens can get a temporary hand up and then gain independence from government help — specifically American citizens,” he said. 
“Illegal aliens have no place in public housing,” Turner continued. “It’s outrageous that people who should not be here come across our borders and now usurp spots in housing units that should support American people.”
Immigrants without permanent legal status are ineligible for federal housing programs under current federal law, with narrow exceptions for emergency or disaster services, according to the National Immigration Law Center, an immigrant advocacy organization.
Mixed-status families — families with members of different immigration statuses — can still receive housing assistance from HUD, so long as the household has at least one eligible member. The amount of assistance these families receive is prorated, so a household with ineligible members will receive only a portion of the rent subsidy that a household would receive if every member were eligible, according to a HUD report published in 2019.
These mixed-status families make up less than 1% of all households receiving assistance in the United States, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank based in Washington, D.C. HUD’s 2019 report records roughly 25,000 mixed-status households, with the majority consisting of three eligible members and one ineligible member.
Federal, state officials tout task force numbers, but do not provide detailed data
U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said Monday that the Memphis Safe Task Force has tallied more than 3,100 arrests, seized 501 firearms, and located 121 children reported as missing. Federal charges have been filed against 157 people, Bondi said.
Gov. Bill Lee and U.S. Sens. Bill Hagerty and Marsha Blackburn also heaped praise on the task force, which was convened by the Trump administration in September.
But various agencies involved in the task force, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the Tennessee Highway Patrol, have yet to publicly release the names of all of the individuals arrested under the task force’s purview, or provide details about their charges.
Arrest counts provided by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Marshals Service initially included a breakdown by category, including homicides, sex offenses, narcotics, firearms, probation/parole violations, ICE administrative warrants, “other” and “warrants.” In the task force’s first week, ICE administrative warrants made up roughly 25% of reported arrests. The agencies have since stopped providing counts for immigration-related arrests.
A data dashboard published by the Shelby County General Sessions Court shows that, while the number of new cases involving traffic violations and drug charges has risen since the task force began, the number of new cases involving violent crime charges has fallen. 
The number of warrants served has increased, and University of Memphis Center for Community Research and Evaluation Associate Director Jonathan Bennett, who worked on the dashboard, told MLK50: Justice Through Journalism earlier this month that arrests connected to pre-existing warrants are “likely a key focus of the task force’s efforts with respect to violent offenders.”
The task force cleared more than 1,000 warrants as of Nov. 9, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. The agency periodically posts news releases announcing task force arrests for select individuals facing charges involving drugs, violent crime and illegal firearms, among other charges.
The Department of Homeland Security provided names and photographs of 11 “criminal illegal aliens” that it described as “some of the worst of the worst” arrested by the task force in October, but recent reporting from the Institute for Public Service Reporting shows some of the individuals were misidentified and others had charges that were unable to be verified through an independent search of court records. 
One of the people identified was Christian worship singer Delmar Gomez, whom authorities falsely claimed had been arrested on an aggravated assault charge. Gomez’ record shows only minor motor vehicle violations.
Officials address cost and strain on criminal justice system
Hagerty said he wants the Memphis Safe Task Force to act as a template for law enforcement surges in other U.S. cities. He acknowledged that additional funding will be needed to sustain the operation. 
A federal memo submitted in a legal challenge to the National Guard’s presence in Memphis estimated salaries and benefits for up to 1,000 National Guard members present in Memphis as part of the task force could cost $226 million per year. Additional costs associated with the task force are unclear. A Nashville chancellor temporarily blocked the Guard’s presence, but her ruling remains on hold while the state appeals.
Hagerty addressed Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who will “have a big job in this as a member of the Appropriations Committee.”
As speaker, Sexton can sit on any House committee, but he does not have a fixed seat on the House Appropriations Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Bud Hulsey, a Kingsport Republican.
“At the federal level, we’re going to be doing everything that we can to make certain that we have the proper resources going forward so that we’re able to maintain the safety of Memphis, to bring back the greatness of this wonderful city,” Hagerty said.
Representatives for Hagerty and Sexton did not respond to a request for clarification on these remarks.
The influx of arrests is straining local court systems and adding to overcrowding at the Shelby County Criminal Justice Center, according to District Attorney General Steve Mulroy. 
The task force has “substantially increased the caseload of our office,” Mulroy wrote in a Nov. 21 newsletter. “Daily General Sessions Court dockets are up about 50%. We’ve started to see significant rises in other areas as well. We’re reassigning prosecutors from regular duty to Traffic Court duty to deal with the deluge of traffic cases soon to hit our court.”
Several prosecutors have volunteered to work evenings, weekends and extra hours, Mulroy reported.
Gadyaces Serralta, director of the U.S. Marshals Service, said Monday that the task force is “taking every case we can federal” in an attempt to relieve some of the strain on local courts. 
Serralta also said that criminal cases are “taking too long to see their way through the wheels of justice” in state courts, and his agency is “open to working with the state prosecutor’s office in order to shorten that period of time.”
“If we don’t speed up the process, it’s going to continue to back up,” he said. “Because we can’t put them through the criminal justice system does not mean that it’s a free pass to commit crimes, so we’re going to keep arresting folks. They keep committing crimes, we’re going to keep arresting them.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC05728-copy-DeNoiseAI-clear-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-11-26 07:57:07.332772

I’m writing in response to VTDigger’s recent article about the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department’s proposal to charge a public access license in recognition of declining hunting, fishing and trapping licenses.
I would support this proposal if Fish & Wildlife were also willing to reexamine and reform the outdated and unrepresentative Fish & Wildlife Board. As VTDigger has noted, in this article, S.258 would modernize the Board’s composition and decision-making — a critical step toward fairness and accountability.
There is no reason the Fish & Wildlife Board should continue operating like a private game club where a small minority controls the process.

READ MORE

Many Vermonters, myself included, used to attend Board meetings and offer public comment, but stopped participating after realizing that those in charge had little interest in listening to non-consumptive voices. Some of the Board members referred to us as “bunny huggers,”, in what appeared to be an attempt to further marginalize us.
If the Department truly wants to update its model in recognition of the fact that fewer people are hunting, fishing and trapping, then it must make a good-faith effort to work collaboratively with non-consumptive Vermonters. By all means, charge us a reasonable fee — but give us a seat at the table where decisions are made. Only then can we work together on the future of conservation in Vermont.
Transformation isn’t just about collecting new fees from the public; it’s about showing Vermonters that their values matter. The Department must address the widespread lack of trust in its leadership and demonstrate that it represents all who care about Vermont’s wildlife and natural lands.
Sincerely,
Sophie Bowater,
Coalition lead at the Vermont Coyote Coexistence Coalition

(Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)Indiana’s application for a share of the federal government’s $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program lays out a sweeping, multi-year plan to stabilize struggling hospitals, expand essential local services and overhaul primary care in health systems across the state’s 64 rural counties.
The 167-page submission — obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle — details the state’s strategy, branded “GROW: Cultivating Hoosier Health.”
The plan is described as a “collaborative effort” to be jointly led by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration and the Indiana Department of Health.
It outlines 12 major initiatives, including a statewide patient-transfer coordination hub, significant upgrades to Indiana’s health information exchange, and large new regional grants intended to reshape how rural care is delivered.
The proposal was submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Nov. 4, one day before the deadline for all 50 states, as required under the law creating the program. Awards must be issued to states by Dec. 31.
The Rural Health Transformation Program is a five-year federal initiative, with states receiving annual allocations of both formula and competitive funding throughout that period.
Half of the annual $10 billion in federal funding will be divided evenly among states with approved plans. The rest will be awarded competitively based on need, program design and federal scoring criteria.
Urgent needs in rural communities
Indiana has 52 rural hospitals, 25% of which have already cut services, according to the Centers for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. Rural Hoosiers experience higher rates of chronic disease, fewer local specialists and repeated closures of maternity and emergency services.
The state also conducted a large rural health survey — drawing more than 2,100 responses — to assess local challenges around access, provider shortages, technology gaps, food insecurity and transportation barriers.

Respondents cited long travel times to care, lack of specialty access, difficulty managing chronic conditions and limited behavioral health services as top concerns.
Story continues below.
RHTP Narrative (State of Indiana) FINAL
 
Indiana’s proposal is organized around 12 multi-year initiatives aimed at expanding care access, modernizing technology, improving outcomes for chronic disease, strengthening emergency and maternity care, supporting behavioral health workforce development and distributing large regional grants.
Proposed “Make Rural Indiana Healthy Again Regional Grants” are the plan’s largest investment. The state’s application proposed awarding $600 million over five years across eight regions, with each receiving $40 million to $100 million.
The grant program would require each regional coalition to file a unified application that includes a needs assessment, data-sharing plans, service-delivery innovations, detailed budgets, letters of support and measurable health-performance objectives. 
Required outcomes include improved maternal health, reduced preventable emergency department visits, increased telehealth utilization and better chronic disease control.
Regions would be judged competitively, with awards based on population served, strength of partnerships, evidence of innovation and sustainability and plans to reduce duplication in services. A dedicated state support team would train regions, review data, and provide ongoing technical assistance.
Improved technology and training
A different initiative would create a Medical Operations Coordination Center, described in the state’s application as a “24/7 hub for day-to-day hospital operational reporting, patient transfer coordination, and EMS resource alignment.”
The initiative also includes analysis of a Medicaid payment model tailored to rural hospitals.
(Presentation slide from the Indiana Rural Health Transformation Program Grant Application Working Group’s November 2025 meeting)
The estimated cost is $56.2 million over five years, according to the application.
Another initiative seeks to modernize Indiana’s health information infrastructure. The state’s health information exchange, or HIE, is the central network that allows hospitals and providers to share patient records electronically. It currently connects about 120 hospitals but leaves roughly 700 rural facilities outside the system, creating major gaps in care coordination.
Indiana officials proposed connecting 450 of those facilities and testing artificial intelligence tools for predictive analytics, natural language processing and reducing medical errors.
The initiative carries an estimated cost of $66.5 million over five years, which includes incentives to help rural facilities adopt required technology and fully integrate with the HIE.
States hope to use rural health money to keep doctors, combat chronic disease

The application further outlines a plan to launch eight rural cardiometabolic care sites statewide through a “collaborative care model” and training programs, targeting Indiana’s high rates of diabetes, hypertension and obesity. The initiative is budgeted at $15.3 million over five years, covering staffing, care-team development and the establishment of new rural treatment sites.
Amid widespread loss of maternity units, a different part of the plan supports hospitals and EMS agencies seeking “Pediatric Ready” and “OB Ready” designations.
Pediatric Ready status means an emergency department has the staff, equipment and protocols to stabilize and treat critically ill children, and the OB Ready designation reflects similar preparedness for obstetric emergencies and coordination with perinatal centers, according to state health officials.
The application noted that pediatric readiness is associated with a reduction in pediatric mortality risk by up to 76%.
The effort would cost an estimated cost of $45.4 million over five years.
Also in the pitch is an expansion of Indiana’s rural behavioral health training tracks and workforce stipends. The goal, according to state officials, is to increase the “local hire rate in rural communities” and support graduates who “work locally post-graduation for the required five-year period.” The behavioral health workforce initiative is budgeted at $5.3 million.
An emphasis on collaboration
The application repeatedly stressed stakeholder involvement and cited application input from multiple Hoosier offices and groups, including Indiana’s Office of Community and Rural Affairs, Department of Transportation, Department of Homeland Security, tribal groups, managed care entities, the Indiana Rural Health Association, hospital systems and numerous clinical and community organizations.
The federal rural health program was created alongside sweeping federal Medicaid reductions.
Federal spending is projected to fall by about $1 trillion over 10 years, with rural areas expected to lose $155 billion. Nationally, more than half of rural hospitals are operating at a loss, and states across the country are submitting similarly expansive proposals as they compete for the same pool of competitive federal funding.
Health groups warn that Indiana’s rural hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid and often operate on thin margins due to low reimbursement rates.
If the federal government approves Indiana’s plan, grants and formula funds will begin flowing in 2026. The state’s internal schedule shows regional grant applications opening in March 2026, with awards finalized by October.

(Photo by Susan J. DemasMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will soon be in her final year in office, and a crowded field of candidates have stepped in to stake their claim as the state’s next executive. 
There is a deep bench of candidates from both parties, and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has set aside his lifelong affiliation with the Democratic party to launch an independent bid for the state’s top office. The dynamic has led some to question whether a third party candidate could garner enough support to secure the governorship. 
Although control of the governor’s office has flipped back and forth over the past 40 years, a strong showing among Democrats this November amid frustration with President Donald Trump’s policies could signal a potential shift in that dynamic.

Here’s the Advance’s breakdown of the race thus far, with details on each candidate and current fundraising totals.
The Democrats
Heading into election year, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla. Mayor Marni Sawicki make up the slate of Democrats aiming to hold onto the executive seat in Lansing.
Benson has emerged as an early favorite amongst Democrats, retaining a cash advantage over her opponents as well as a commanding lead in internal polling with strong recognition over Gilchrist and Swanson.

Jocelyn Benson
Over her tenure as secretary of state, Benson has overseen elections with record-setting turnout and helped implement new laws initiated by Michigan voters aimed at improving access to the ballot box. She has focused on protecting voting rights, to ensure all Michiganders can cast a vote regardless of their race, gender, faith or sexuality.
Benson has also secured endorsements from several state lawmakers, as well as the campaign finance reform group End Citizens United, EMILYs List, Vote Mama PAC,  the Progressive Women’s Alliance, and labor groups including the Michigan Laborers District Council, the Association of Flight Attendants, UA Local 174, Teamsters Local 243 and 406 and UFCW 876 and 951.
Campaign finance reports filed with the state in October show Benson’s campaign has raised the most of any Democratic candidate, bringing in $4.75 million and spending $1.76 million, leaving her with $2.98 million on hand.

Garlin Gilchrist
Serving as Whitmer’s second-in-command since 2019, Gilchrist is the state’s first Black lieutenant governor. If successful in the primary and the general election, Gilchrist would also be the state’s first Black governor. 
A Detroit native and former software engineer for Microsoft, Gilchrist has carried forward the Whitmer administration’s goals of growing businesses and economic opportunities in the state to attract families and retain Michigan graduates. Gilchrist also broke with his competitors in calling Israel’s war on Gaza a genocide, pledging not to accept campaign funding from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, the largest pro-Israel lobbying group in the U.S. 
He has won endorsements from U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) and Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), Democratic National Committee Black Caucus Chair Virgie Rollins and several state lawmakers.Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Gilchrist’s campaign has raised just under $1.13 million and spent $748,632, leaving the campaign with $378,457 on hand.

Chris Swanson
Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson made national headlines in 2020 after taking off his riot gear to walk alongside protestors speaking out against police brutality after the killing of George Floyd. Now he’s looking to be Michigan’s next governor.
Swanson has pledged to protect, serve and unify, telling attendees at his campaign announcement that he would bring a “customer service mindset” to state government. Swanson has also called for support to small business by creating an Office of Innovation, and for the adoption of a statewide model of his office’s  Genesee County Human Oppression Strike Team, which works to combat human trafficking.
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Swanson’s campaign has raised $1.36 million and spent $975,997, leaving the campaign with $385,189 on hand.
Marni Sawicki
A Battle Creek native, Sawicki announced her campaign for governor in March, promising a focus on government transparency. 
In her announcement, Sawicki offered her transparency plan, which would  include regular public performance dashboards for all state departments, livestreamed and recorded board/committee meetings and decision-making sessions, a searchable database of all state contracts and expenditures, mandatory ethics training for all elected officials and state employees and require public lobbying logs documenting all meetings between elected officials and lobbyists. 
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Sawicki’s campaign has brought in $15,930, and spent $14,605, leaving the campaign with $1,324 on hand.

The Independent
Mike Duggan
Breaking away from the Democratic Party, Duggan is looking to shake up an increasingly divided political system citing the “toxic and personal” nature of today’s politics in his decision to forgo a campaign from within the two major parties.
Duggan has pitched his campaign as a balm to the partisan arguments barring government from addressing the issues facing the state, but his split from the Democrats has brought plenty of hurt feelings, as members of Duggan’s former party have gone on the offensive, accusing him of cozying up to Republican donors and labelling him a spoiler candidate who could draw votes away from Democrats. Polling released in October showing Duggan closing the gap with the top Democratic and Republicans candidates. 
He has also secured the support of the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce, Lansing Regional Chamber, the Southeast Michigan Chamber of Commerce, several Detroit area unions and former U.S. Rep. Dave Trott (R-Commerce Township), among others. Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Duggan’s campaign has brought in nearly $4.38 million and spent more than $1.96 million leaving the campaign with more than $2.4 million cash on hand.
The Republicans
With a crowded slate of candidates and no clear frontrunner, signs are pointing to a messy primary for Republicans headed into 2026. 
While U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) emerged as an early frontrunner in the race, but interest in the second term Republican could be fleeting. A straw poll conducted among members of the Michigan Republican Party placed James at fourth amid his competitors and other names floated for governor.
James was notably absent from a gubernatorial forum hosted by the Michigan Republican Party at its biannual conference on Mackinac Island, and his absence from the Michigan Republican Party’s first gubernatorial debate prompted immediate criticism from his opponents, with supporters of Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) bringing milk cartons bearing a missing poster with James’ likeness on the side.

John James
Opting against a third term in the U.S. House, James announced in April that he would instead seek the top spot in Lansing, arguing that “It’s time to get Michigan’s government out of fantasyland and back to common sense,” while touting his ties to Trump. 
If elected, James would be Michigan’s first Black governor.
James’ campaign lists affordability as his top priority, with the representative  promising a focus on kids and families in education, a reduction in regulations on business and support for law enforcement while opposing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives within government. 
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show James’campaign has brought in $3.65 million and spent nearly $1.38 million, with more than $2.27 million cash on hand.

Aric Nesbitt
As the top Republican in the Michigan Senate for the previous three years, Aric Nesbitt has been an outspoken critic of both Whitmer, and Democrats in the Legislature, and has repeatedly criticized Democrats for their approach to education, business regulation and government spending.
As a supporter of President Donald Trump, Nesbitt’s campaign platform shows some overlap with the president’s policies, opposing electric vehicles and calling on law enforcement to partner with the federal government to deport undocumented immigrants. He also supports cutting taxes, eliminating government spending and protecting the Second Amendment.
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Nesbitt’s campaign has brought in $2.7 million and spent $616,869.34, with more than $2.1 million on hand.

Mike Cox
Emulating the president’s campaign slogan, Mike Cox, who served as Michigan’s attorney general from 2003 to 2011, has pledged to “Make Michigan Great Again.”
Cox supports eliminating the state income tax and restoring Michigan’s Right to Work laws, a series of policies enacted under Snyder and repealed under Whitmer’s administration. He has also called for an end to corporate subsidies and to “DOGE” state government, referencing the now defunct U.S. Department of Government Efficiency.
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Cox’s campaign has brought in more than $4.58 million and spent $757,638, with more than $3.78 million on hand.

Tom Leonard
A three term state representative and former Michigan Speaker of the House, Tom Leonard sought the Republican nomination for attorney general in 2022 but came up short against fellow attorney Matt DePerno.
As part of his campaign, Leonard has put forth proposals to improve ethics and accountability in state government, including subjecting the Legislature and the governor’s office to Michigan’s Freedom of Information Act and a state-level version of the federal Hatch Act, which bars government employees from politicking while on duty, in uniform or utilizing government vehicles or facilities. He has also proposed eliminating the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, which oversees subsidies to attract businesses to the state, eliminating regulations on farmers and the agriculture industry and investing in recruitment for law enforcement. 
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Leonard’s campaign has brought in $937,023 and spent $227,730, with $709,293 on hand.
Karla Wagner
After years of spearheading efforts to eliminate state property taxes, AxMITax founder Karla Wagner is making the same issue the central issue of her campaign for governor.
Wagner owns Aunt Belle’s Kitchen in Rockford, and has listed promoting and protecting small businesses among her campaign priorities. Wagner also supports a reassessment of the state’s clean energy law, promoting farming and homesteading and a reform of public school funding, which is primarily sourced from property taxes. 
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Wagner’s campaign has brought in $2,875 and spent $2,619 with $255 cash on hand.

(Photo by Michele Jokinen, House Public Information.)Three-term state Rep. Sandra Feist, DFL-New Brighton, recently announced she will not seek re-election in 2026.
Feist was known for her willingness to take on some of the Legislature’s most complex tasks, sorting through thorny issues like property tax forfeiture laws. 
Feist was a vice chair on the Public Safety Finance and Policy committee. She authored laws including a ban on mandatory juvenile life sentences without parole; modernizing Minnesota’s community supervision funding formula; and updating Minnesota’s guardianship system.
Feist is a member of the Legislature’s Civility Caucus, a group of Republican and Democratic-Farmer-Labor lawmakers who meet regularly to socialize and find common ground. 
As an immigration attorney, she works with both employment-based cases — professionals, medical researchers, athletes — and families seeking to sponsor relatives to become legal residents. 
The Reformer spoke with Feist about her decision to leave the Legislature, her ideas about how to fix the U.S. immigration system and her advice for future lawmakers. 
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. 
Why did you decide not to run for re-election? What are you planning to do with the time you will get back from not being in the Legislature?
I have basically been doing two full-time jobs for the last five years, and I just feel that my immigration practice really is demanding all of my time and emotional energy. I don’t believe in doing anything halfway, and I didn’t want to be a legislator who wasn’t able to make the commitment that my constituents deserve — to have my full attention and all of my energy, so I had to make that decision.
In addition to refocusing my energy on my immigration work, I also have two kids and I’m looking forward to spending more time with them. I used to think that every politician who retired and said they wanted to spend more time with their family were lying, and there was some sort of sex scandal behind it, but now I’m realizing that it’s a huge sacrifice — and it’s a worthy sacrifice — but it’s a sacrifice that the whole family makes. 
I also write romance novels, and I’m looking forward to writing and reading and being a creative person again. The work of the Legislature and the work of being an immigration lawyer and doing both of those at the same time really doesn’t leave you with a lot of creative time.
What are you hearing from immigrants these days, especially from professionals who have existing visas? Are they feeling under threat right now?
Yes, absolutely, every single one of them and all of their employers. The visible parts of the immigration crackdown get most of the attention, but there are so many ways in which people who are coming here for work, who have been here for their work for decades, are having the rug pulled out from underneath them, and are being told that they are no longer wanted and that their extensions of status for the 10th time are going to be scrutinized and maybe not approved anymore. So it’s really dire for all types of immigrants.
In your mind, what does the best version of the U.S. immigration system look like?
What I would love to see is an immigration system that can breathe — so expand and contract strategically to address the modern realities. 
So what that means is that when we look at humanitarian immigration, what is the percentage of displaced people in the world right now? What are the factors that are driving people to flee from their homes? Then adjusting our refugee admissions based on that. 
It also means looking at unemployment rates in the United States. Where are there sectors of the economy, such as agriculture or technology, where we don’t have enough workers, or we don’t have the right workers, and how can we expand our immigration system to address that? 
A system like that would also then contract if it’s a situation where we don’t need certain types of immigrants in certain areas of the economy. If we could create a system that adjusts, say, every 10 years, then we wouldn’t have to wait on Congress to develop the political will and consensus to make those adjustments over time. Right now, we have an immigration system that was created in large part in 1965 and updated somewhat in 1990 and really hasn’t been adjusted to adapt over the decades otherwise. And that’s bad.
What are you most proud of from your time in the Legislature?
I am really proud of the work that I’ve done on really gnarly issues where there are many stakeholders and impacted people, and they all have different priorities and concerns, and I bring people together to have productive conversation and negotiations and come to a consensus around workable solutions. 
In 2023 the U.S. Supreme Court found Minnesota’s property tax forfeiture laws unconstitutional and said they had to be totally recreated. And that is a really huge issue that impacts counties. It impacts people who are advocates for the constitutional protections against the government just taking your property and not compensating you. It has a huge impact on the work that local governments do around environmental remediation, and it’s just had a huge financial impact on local governments. So when we were told that our entire property tax forfeiture system needed to be recreated, that created just a lot of heartburn and headache and complexity. 
So I was able to bring together all of these parties who had really strong opinions and concerns. And every single decision we made, we had to re-read the Supreme Court decision and make sure that what we were doing was constitutional, and then we had to talk to the judicial branch and make sure that everything was practical. We came up with a structure that is workable and constitutional and everybody was happy with, and it’s one of those things that, like, people won’t see. They won’t understand what was done and how it impacts them, but they will never have their property taken without being compensated, and counties won’t go bankrupt because of the way we did it. And it’s just and we’re not violating the Constitution anymore, and that’s good. 
The property tax forfeiture reform that I led — (the late Rep.) Melissa Hortman asked me to. She said, this is like a Sandra thing, you know, bringing together a bunch of people over a really complicated, technical, legal issue.
Really complicated, thorny, not-very-sexy bills were kind of my specialty. I did some sexy ones too. But I’m most proud of the technical bills.
My former colleague Deena Winter wrote about your involvement in the Civility Caucus in 2024, before President Donald Trump was elected to his second term. There’s a sentiment among some people on the left who would say that given the actions of the Republican Party and the Trump administration — for example on immigration — that now is not the time for civility or bipartisan collaboration. What’s your response to that?
I feel very passionately that civility is always the answer, and I think that when we have disputes, it’s because we’re defining civility differently. So civility does not mean that we do not acknowledge and confront the differences of opinion and the things that people say that are hurtful or hateful. Civility means that we have dialogue with people who have differences of opinion and build relationships with them so that we can have that dialogue. 
No movement has ever succeeded by berating and insulting and ostracizing the people that they disagree with. If we are not in dialogue — if we cannot see one another’s humanity — then we can’t succeed in ever changing hearts and minds. And so I feel very strongly that if I am able to have a meal with colleagues with whom I passionately disagree on certain issues, that that builds a level of trust and mutual respect that allows us to have more difficult conversations. This is not theoretical. Like, I have seen this happen — I am able to have really difficult conversations with people with whom I disagree, because we’ve built a base of understanding of one another. I think it is counterproductive to say that we need to ostracize the people with whom we passionately disagree.
What is your advice for future legislators?
One of the things that I have found most rewarding in my time as a legislator is corresponding with constituents and hearing from them. That’s one of those things that you don’t see in the news. It’s not a passionate floor speech, it’s not a press conference, it’s not even a bill — but I have received emails from people who said I was the first politician who ever responded to them, and I have a lot of email correspondence with people with whom I disagree that has been really productive and thought provoking, hopefully on both sides. I hope that whoever comes next to my seat, and all legislators, will remember that communication with constituents and making them feel seen and heard and lifting up their voices in our work is a central aspect to being a legislator.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Feist031224-0219MJ-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-26 07:57:07.332772

The U.S. government has caused massive food waste during President Donald Trump’s second term. Policies such as immigration raids, tariff changes and temporary and permanent cuts to food assistance programs have left farmers short of workers and money, food rotting in fields and warehouses, and millions of Americans hungry. And that doesn’t even include the administration’s actual destruction of edible food.
The U.S. government estimates that more than 47 million people in America don’t have enough food to eat – even with federal and state governments spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on programs to help them.
Yet, huge amounts of food – on average in the U.S., as much as 40% of it – rots before being eaten. That amount is equivalent to 120 billion meals a year: more than twice as many meals as would be needed to feed those 47 million hungry Americans three times a day for an entire year.
This colossal waste has enormous economic costs and renders useless all the water and resources used to grow the food. In addition, as it rots, the wasted food emits in the U.S. alone over 4 million metric tons of methane – a heat-trapping greenhouse gas.
As a scholar of wasted food, I have watched this problem worsen since Trump began his second term in January 2025. Despite this administration’s claim of streamlining the government to make its operations more efficient, a range of recent federal policies have, in fact, exacerbated food wastage.
 Immigration policy

Supplying fresh foods, such as fruits, vegetables and dairy, requires skilled workers on tight timelines to ensure ripeness, freshness and high quality.
The Trump administration’s widespread efforts to arrest and deport immigrants have sent Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Border Patrol and other agencies into hundreds of agricultural fields, meat processing plants and food production and distribution sites. Supported by billions of taxpayer dollars, they have arrested thousands of food workers and farmworkers – with lethal consequences at times.
Dozens of raids have not only violated immigrants’ human rights and torn families apart: They have jeopardized the national food supply. Farmworkers already work physically hard jobs for low wages. In legitimate fear for their lives and liberty, reports indicate that in some places 70% of people harvesting, processing and distributing food stopped showing up to work by mid-2025.
News reports have identified many instances where crops have been left to rot in abandoned fields. Even the U.S. Department of Labor declared in October 2025 that aggressive farm raids drive farmworkers into hiding, leave substantial amounts of food unharvested and thus pose a “risk of supply shock-induced food shortages.”
 Foreign aid cuts

When the Trump administration all but shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development in early 2025, the agency had 500 tons of ready-to-eat, high-energy biscuits worth US$800,000, stored to distribute to starving people around the world who had been displaced by violence or natural disasters. With no staff to distribute the biscuits, they expired while sitting in a warehouse in Dubai.
Incinerating the out-of-date biscuits reportedly cost an additional $125,000.
An additional 70,000 tons of USAID food aid may also have been destroyed.
 Tariffs

In the late 20th century, as globalized trade patterns grew, U.S. farmers struggled with agricultural prices below their production costs. Yet tariffs in the first Trump administration did not protect small farms.
And the tariffs imposed in early 2025, after Trump regained the White House, severed U.S. soybean trade with China for months. Meanwhile, there’s nowhere to store the mountains of soybeans. An October 2025 agreement may resume some activity, but at lower price levels and a slower pace than before, as China looks to Brazil and Argentina to meet its vast demand.
Though the soybeans were intended to feed the Chinese pig industry, not humans, the specter of waste looms both in terms of the potential spoilage of soybeans and the actual human food that could have been grown in their place.
 Other efforts lead to more waste

Since taking office, the second Trump administration has taken many steps aimed at efficiency that actually boosted food waste. Mass firings of food safety personnel risks even more outbreaks of foodborne diseases, tainted imports, and agricultural pathogens – which can erupt into crises requiring mass destruction, for instance, of nearly 35,000 turkeys with bird flu in Utah.
In addition, the administration canceled a popular program that helped schools and food banks buy food from local farmers, though many of the crops had already been planted when the cancellation announcement was made. That food had to find new buyers or risk being wasted, too. And the farmers were unable to count on a key revenue source to keep their farms afloat.
Also, the administration slashed funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency that helped food producers, restaurants and households recover from disasters – including restoring power to food-storage refrigeration.
The fall 2025 government shutdown left the government’s major food aid program, SNAP, in limbo for weeks, derailing communities’ ability to meet their basic needs. Grocers, who benefit substantially from SNAP funds, announced discounts for SNAP recipients – to help them afford food and to keep food supplies moving before they rotted. The Department of Agriculture ordered them not to, saying SNAP customers must pay the same prices as other customers.
Food waste did not start with the Trump administration. But the administration’s policies – though they claim to be seeking efficiency – have compounded voluminous waste at a time of growing need. This Thanksgiving, think about wasted food – as a problem, and as a symptom of larger problems.

A preliminary report on New Mexico’s Nov. 4 local elections found that Election Day voting in general went smoothly in every corner of the state — and offered suggestions on how election officials can improve next year. The findings came just hours before the State Canvass Board unanimously certified the official results of this year’s elections and ordered automatic recounts in 34 races throughout the state.
The findings from Observe New Mexico Elections, a nonpartisan nonprofit that advocates for transparency in elections, reflect the observations of 111 volunteers at 106 polling sites across 11 New Mexico counties. The organization’s full findings are expected to be issued in a more exhaustive January report.
“In general, polls opened and closed on time and experienced minimal disruptions to voting in the locations we observed,” Observe New Mexico Elections co-leader Carmen López said in a statement. “Of course, there are always areas for improvement. Observers noted that counties generally did not train poll workers on how to meet federal and state requirements related to translation and interpretation services, posting clearer signage, and providing required accommodations for people with disabilities. That’s why this effort is so important — nonpartisan observation helps show what’s working well and where election processes can be improved and made more consistent and accessible.”
Report: NM 2024 election well-run, but overwhelmed by same-day registration

The report focused on five key areas of elections: logic and accuracy testing, poll worker training, absentee ballot processing, early in-person voting and Election Day voting.
Logic and accuracy testing refers to the computers that tally and read voters’ ballots. Before an election, county clerks test their voting machines to ensure they count without any errors. The Tuesday report from ONME found that election officials clearly followed standard procedures on these tests and noted that, in a few instances, polling locations lacked a space where members of the public could comfortably observe this process.
Poll worker trainings across the state were “professional, organized, and welcoming,” according to the report, and workers learned “how to open and operate polling locations, issue and process ballots, and close the polls.” While the overall quality of the trainings was strong, the report said that observers saw some trainers truncating the sessions when many of the poll workers had served in previous elections. Trainers also rarely fully explained accessibility and language-related voter accommodations, the report said.
Absentee ballot processing was “well-organized, transparent, and secure in all three locations observed,” according to the report. It noted that physical accessibility to the facility was limited in Las Cruces.
Early in-person voting largely went smoothly, though observers noted that some voting sites “lacked instructions inside voting booths about how to cast a ballot or information about spoiled and provisional ballots.” Also of concern: Such information was not always posted in several languages, even in areas where the Voting Rights Act requires it. 
Voting on Election Day generally went well, but observers reported that some locations did not display information “about how to complete a ballot, what to do if they made a mistake, or how to contact election officials” and that some only posted information in English. In a handful of cases, voters did not clearly understand district boundaries and left without voting, according to the report.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Voting-booths-UNM-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 07:57:07.332772

Under Acting U.S. Attorney Robert McGuire, the federal government filed motions in U.S. District Court to vacate a 30-month sentence against Cade Cothren and a 36-month sentence for Casada when President Donald Trump granted them pardons Nov. 7.
The move by prosecutors to vacate the convictions isn’t considered necessary because the presidential pardon leads to the same outcome.

They were set to report to prison this month after U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson sentenced them for a litany of convictions stemming from a fraudulent campaign vendor called Phoenix Solutions that targeted state lawmakers’ constituent mailers. 
Federal prosecutors started investigating Casada and Cothren in 2019 when the New Mexico-based company hit the scene after Cothren resigned his post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal and Casada exited the speaker’s office after a no-confidence vote.
Without pardons, Casada and Cothren were to report to prison Nov. 21 and Nov. 14, respectively.

With enhanced subsidies due to expire on Dec. 31, many Missourians are weighing their options for coverage in 2026 (krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images).Until last year, Roberta Ross-Fisher had never been in a hospital except to visit friends and family.
The self-employed higher education consultant from Franklin County was so diligent about cleaning her teeth she had a gum graft several years ago to repair where she overbrushed.
Then, on May 5, 2024, she received a phone call. She had cancer in her lower jaw.
She took time off work and underwent surgery to remove the cancer and reconstruct her mandible with bone from her fibula. Now in remission, she gets CT scans and sees her oncologist every few months.
“That’s non-negotiable, whether I have insurance or whether I don’t,” Ross-Fisher said.
What is also non-negotiable is the premium she’ll pay to remain in a health insurance plan she purchases through the federal marketplace. This year, it’s $295 per month. Next year, if Congress extends current subsidies, it will be $479. 
And if the subsidies go away Jan. 1, the price will be $1,216 per month, a 312% increase.
It is enough to give her pause, despite needing cancer follow-up care. Ross-Fisher in 2026 will qualify for Medicare, the federal insurance program for older and disabled adults.
“I’ve been having conversations with my husband,” she said. “What do I do? I’m now a cancer patient. Do I risk going for six months without insurance?”
The conversation Ross-Fisher is having with her husband is the same one being held in thousands of households across Missouri.
The open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act plans opened Nov. 1 and ends Jan. 16. For some, the extra costs for 2026 will mean they go without coverage. 
Others may look for alternatives, such as Missouri Farm Bureau health coverage that does not qualify as an insurance plan under federal definitions. Backers promised it would be cheaper when lawmakers passed the law this year, but no one interested in buying into the plan will know if they will truly save money until it launches Jan. 1.
And the uncertainty makes financial planning more difficult for medical providers.
Care for people on marketplace plans represents about 2% of the revenue for University of Missouri Health Care, said Greg Damron, chief financial officer for MU Health Care in Columbia. 
“That doesn’t sound like a lot,” Damron said, “but if you think about it, when you’re trying to get to a 4% margin or something, 2% of your revenues is kind of a big deal.” 
 Enhanced subsidies

For 43 days, Democrats in the U.S. Senate used the filibuster to keep the federal government shut down in an effort to preserve the enhanced subsidies enacted as a COVID-19 emergency measure in 2021. 
Under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the actual premiums paid by lower-income people purchasing individual health plans through the federal marketplace were capped as a share of their income. At the lowest end of the income scale, the cap was 2.1%, rising to 9.96% for people between three and four times the federal poverty level, or between $46,950 and $62,600 for a single person.
The enhanced subsidies reduced those caps so people at the lowest end paid no out-of-pocket premiums and no person purchasing an individual plan paid more than 8.5% of their income.
The enhanced subsidies expire Dec. 31. The U.S. Senate will vote in December on a bill extending the subsidies, but there’s no promise of a similar vote in the U.S. House and no indication President Donald Trump would sign it if passed.
Missouri health premiums to rise as much as 30% for 2026 amid uncertainty over subsidies

One result of the enhanced subsidies was dramatic growth in the number of Missourians covered by ACA plans at the same time Medicaid enrollment declined as eligibility reviews began following a freeze tied to the COVID-19 emergency.
In 83% of Missouri counties, an analysis from Washington University shows, new enrollments in marketplace plans exceeded the decline in Medicaid enrollment.
“The rapid growth in marketplace enrollment likely was influenced by enhanced premium tax credits (EPTCs), which were passed in 2021 and significantly lowered the out-of-pocket premiums recipients pay for the marketplace plans,” the analysis states. 
There are more than 417,000 people in Missouri covered by marketplace plans, up from 257,000 in 2023. Faced with double-digit increases in base premiums and the loss of enhanced subsidies, many may drop health insurance entirely.
“Without that premium support, the belief out there is that it’s largely going to hit younger, lower-income people,” Damron said. “They’re likely going to be the folks that also decide to opt out of insurance coverage altogether.”
 Small business worries

Small businesses that provide health insurance are also facing tough choices — whether to pass more costs to employees or stop offering coverage altogether, said Brad Jones, Missouri lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
The small group rates approved this fall by the Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance show average increases of 10% to 19% for 2026.
“For a business with seven or eight employees, it is like buying a suit off the rack,” Jones said. “They don’t have any negotiating power.”
For almost 40 years, the cost of health insurance has been No. 1 among the “10 most severe problems for small business owners” identified by the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Conducted every four years, the Small Business Problems and Priorities survey ranks 75 issues facing businesses with fewer than 100 employees. The cost of health insurance was cited as an issue by 41% of employers, more than 20 percentage points higher than the second problem on the list, the cost of inventory and supplies.
In 2000, the report shows, almost half of all small businesses offered health insurance, with an average annual cost of about $2,600 per employee. Now, with the average cost greater than $8,000 per employee, fewer than one in three small employers provide coverage.
“When premiums go up, there are hard decisions that have to be made,” Jones said. “Deductibles go up to keep costs down. There are a number of things businesses try to do and not drop it all together.”
The smallest businesses may not survive if owners decide to seek employment that provides health coverage, said Marie Murphree, executive director of the Kirksville Area Chamber of Commerce.
“We might start seeing some of those go away,” said Murphree, who estimated that a fifth of the about 300 businesses in her chamber are individual entrepreneurs.
Higher premiums could be especially damaging in rural areas, Murphree said, where “we already see businesses who struggle to recruit people.” 
“Now one of the recruitment tools that you have,” she said, “you really can no longer offer, because it’s out of your ability to afford it.”
Rob Gilligan, president of the Cape Girardeau Area Chamber of Commerce, said the “vast majority” of the chamber’s 800 members have 50 employees or less. While he said they’d like to offer insurance to employees, the cost can be “prohibitive” with fewer staff to share costs.
The Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry offers an insurance plan to businesses with fewer than 50 employees allowing them to pool together to share risk and ideally get more competitive rates.
Gilligan said that while some small business owners have expressed that they will be looking at higher deductible plans in anticipation of much higher premiums this year, they’ve already had to adapt to rising insurance costs in recent years.
“You just know that the cost of health is one of those things that’s going to continue to rise,” said Gilligan, whose chamber offers insurance to its employees. “We just have to kind of know that every year we’re going to look at that as something that we need to plan for and adapt to.”
 Farm Bureau alternative

The Affordable Care Act mandates that every plan offered by an employer and every plan on the health care marketplace provide minimum essential coverage. The 10 essential benefits range from hospitalization and office visits to maternity care, mental health treatments and preventive tests.
This year, legislators passed a law allowing the Missouri Farm Bureau to offer coverage that does not include all 10 benefits. 
Many farmers and other members of the Farm Bureau, proponents said, are uninsured because they can’t afford to buy an individual plan on the marketplace or make too much money to qualify for subsidies.
Members will be able to start buying plans on Jan. 2, with coverage set to begin Feb. 1, said Garrett Hawkins, president of the Farm Bureau. The website will be available starting Dec. 1, he said.
Spiraling health insurance costs stymie members of US Senate panel

That will leave only about 15 days remaining in the open enrollment period for prospective purchasers to decide if they will sign up with the Farm Bureau, buy a marketplace plan or go without coverage.
Because prospective purchasers will choose from a menu of services, the price for each plan must be individually quoted, Hawkins said.
“We’re working feverishly to get the plan up and running,” Hawkins said, “but we’re just not quite there yet.” 
The Farm Bureau is a nonprofit agricultural membership organization which partners with for-profit companies to sell various kinds of insurance to its members. 
To buy Farm Bureau health coverage, a person has to be a member for 30 days. Anyone can join — the fee is $30 per year.
So far, Hawkins said, the new coverage does not seem to be driving an increase in membership. There are several hundred members who have indicated they are interested in getting a quote, he said.
Once the plan starts accepting applications, Hawkins said, there will be no “open enrollment” period. The coverage will be available for purchase at any time.
Hawkins has big ambitions for the coverage. Affordable health coverage can mean more people will stay in farming and pass their land on to a new generation.
“My goal is that this helps bring young people home to the farm,” Hawkins said. “My hope is it will allow a spouse to return home to the farm who is working off the farm solely to get benefits for the family.”
 A tough choice

Ross-Fisher said the insurance plan she purchased on the federal marketplace established by the 2010 Affordable Care Act was a “godsend” during her cancer treatment. 
And when her business suffered during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the enhanced premium tax credits passed by Congress in 2021 had kept insurance coverage within reach for her and her husband and allowed her to keep working for herself.
With those tax credits set to expire, Ross-Fisher is again considering giving up her business for a job with benefits.
Most people turning 65 are eligible for Medicare, which has its own premiums for the various coverages offered. For Ross-Fisher, the nearness of her 65th birthday in 2026 makes it tempting to drop coverage.
And before her cancer, she said, she would have chanced those six months. 
Now she’s leaning toward seeking full-time work.
“That would mean the end of my consulting business, which I dearly love,” she wrote in an email, “but under the circumstances I think it would be the most financially prudent thing to do.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gettyimages-2211388790-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 06:57:51.006408

Activists fear immigrant workers are sitting targets there. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Advocates say they worry immigration agents are targeting undocumented immigrants working at New Jersey warehouses that store imported goods.
Called bonded warehouses, these facilities are either owned or leased by the government or privately owned locations where companies can house imported goods for up to five years without paying duties. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is responsible for cargo security, can inspect them at any time.
As the Trump administration has ramped up its efforts to detain and deport millions of undocumented residents, immigrant advocates say customs and border agents have teamed up with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to round up warehouse workers because ICE agents can enter them without showing warrants.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials “hold the door open for ICE, and all of a sudden, people are taken away from their job sites,” said Li Adorno, an activist with Movimiento Cosecha, an organization that responds to immigration raids.
This happened most recently on Oct. 29. That was when ICE agents descended on the Savino Del Bene warehouse, a shipping and logistics facility in Avenel. Workers there were already on edge after signs were posted a few days prior describing the facility as a bonded warehouse.

“Warning,” one sign read in all caps. “Under the Customs and Border Protection laws of the United States, this bonded facility is under the custody and control of Customs and Border Protection.”
No other information was shared with workers, and many don’t speak English fluently. Federal officials said they arrested 46 workers, and advocates said the detainees were transported to detention centers in Elizabeth and Newark.
“Folks are going into work thinking that, ‘I’m going to come home.’ Especially if they’re temp workers, they’re being assigned to a workplace, so this sign popped up a few days before, and workers were unaware,” said Viri Martinez of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, who arrived at the warehouse shortly after the raid started.
The arrests carried out by ICE marked the state’s third known enforcement operation at a bonded warehouse. Another 13 workers were detained at a raid in Edison on Aug. 20 at the Smart Supply Chain warehouse, and 15 people were detained on July 8 at Alba Wine and Spirits in Edison.
Immigrant advocates fear that many of the workers at these warehouses don’t know they are taking jobs at facilities that are controlled in part by federal agents. Some of the employees are temporary workers assigned to the warehouses by staffing agencies.
The advocates say they have identified at least 600 bonded warehouses across the state, in port cities like Elizabeth, Newark, and Bayonne, and in towns like Cranbury and Edison.











People are taking whatever job is available if they have families to support ... I think economic survival overrides the fear


– Sally Pilly, First Friends board member



Roughly 475,000 undocumented immigrants are estimated to live in New Jersey. And 1 in 4 residents is an immigrant, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
Immigration raids at bonded warehouses are not new. Under President Obama, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees customs and immigration agents, said joint operations between 2005 and 2008 led to the detention of more than 350 undocumented immigrants.
Sally Pilly, a board member of Kearny-based immigration advocacy group First Friends, said she believes federal agents are using their ability to make unannounced inspections of bonded warehouses to help ICE “fill their quota.” Now, she said, “families don’t even know where their loved ones went.”
At the August raid in Edison, Pilly said, workers said they were told customs agents were coming in for an inspection to verify compliance with employment regulations. But immigration agents came instead, Pilly said, adding that she believes the inspection announcement was a ploy to “round up people.”
“We are very, very concerned that ICE is abusing the bonded warehouse designations,” Pilly said.
Immigration arrests and detention have surged to an all-time high under President Donald Trump. In May, the Trump administration set a quota to arrest 3,000 people a day nationwide, which translates into more than 1 million annually. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security bragged that it held a record 65,000 migrants in custody, with arrests and deportations reaching a record pace.
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.
After the Oct. 29 raid, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the action was part of “ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with customs and immigration regulations, safeguard the integrity of the supply chain, and verify that warehouse operators are adhering to all applicable security requirements.” 
Calls to the warehouses on Tuesday went unanswered.
Pilly thinks protections granted by the state temporary workers’ bill of rights could help here. That’s a law that requires staffing agencies that arrange employment for third-party companies to provide basic information to temporary workers ahead of their shifts.
While the law doesn’t require staffing agencies to inform workers if they’re being assigned to a private warehouse overseen by customs and border agents, activists allege workers don’t know which warehouses they’re assigned to until they show up that morning, and because of that, some workers don’t know they could be taking jobs where federal agents could be present.
“The big gap is that agencies are not providing the information to workers for the warehouses, and we’re trying to raise the awareness to people so they know,” said Adorno.
While some workers without documentation are unaware that working at a bonded warehouse could increase the chances that they get detained and deported, others know and take the risk because they need to care for their families, Pilly said. Undocumented immigrants are often fleeing poverty and violence in their home countries, she added.
“People are taking whatever job is available if they have families to support. Rent at home is high. They are sending money back home. So I think economic survival overrides the fear,” she said.

“There were a million choices, but none of them were about keeping the money,” says Nancy Braus, who just donated a seven-figure inheritance to a Brattleboro center offering temporary housing.

BRATTLEBORO — Activist Nancy Braus has protested nearly a half-century on area streets to tax the rich and feed the poor. But townspeople here still did a double take when they learned she was giving a local family shelter her recent inheritance of $1 million.
“It was a bit of a shock and really takes your breath away,” said Chloe Learey, executive director of the Winston Prouty Center for Child and Family Development that will use the money to host up to 10 households at a time.
It’s just one way Braus has defied expectations.

“I don’t believe in inherited wealth,” the 71-year-old said in an interview. “I always knew I wanted to learn how to take care of myself and take care of others. I live in a small house. I shop for clothes only when I need underwear. I have no interest in going on a Caribbean cruise. For me, there were a million choices, but none of them were about keeping the money.”
Braus rewinds to 1984, when she opened an alternative bookstore — Everyone’s Books — near a Brattleboro shop that was such a literary landmark, it boasted an appearance by artist Norman Rockwell and an autograph photo from poet Robert Frost.
Braus, countering with such titles as “Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge and the Teachings of Plants” and “On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century,” turned her store into a downtown anchor by the time she sold it and retired in 2023.
Most locals now recognize Braus for her protest signs and Substack posts. What they didn’t know until recently: She’s the daughter of the late Jay Braus, founder of a namesake Manhattan real estate firm before his death in 2014, and Jane Wolbarst Braus, his wife of 63 years.
As a matriarch, Jane was a “dynamo” in her own right, her obituary noted upon her death on Feb. 6 at age 99. Braus remembers her mother requesting separate checks at a diner, only to bequeath a family fortune to four children and charitable causes including Planned Parenthood and Doctors Without Borders.
Soon after, Braus spoke with her three daughters — one who’s a Brattleboro public school teacher — about the challenges faced by students without housing.
“They get mocked, they’re hungry and without clean clothes, they don’t come to class for whatever hardships the family is having,” she said.
Braus then reached out to the Winston Prouty Center, located at the old Austine School of the Deaf once attended by her youngest daughter. The current nonprofit had run a temporary shelter for families before its state contract expired this summer. The center still had space and staff. Braus had money.

“It felt like everything aligned,” she said. “It was a really perfect fit.”
The new shelter, which debuted this month in a renovated dormitory, offers private rooms for up to 10 families who share kitchens, bathrooms and common living areas.
“I got teary,” Learey recalled of Braus revealing her gift. “It’s amazing when somebody steps up to make a difference like this.”
The money will allow the shelter to operate for at least two years as its host center — situated on a 184-acre campus — aims to develop 300 units of affordable housing in a proposed “Village at Winston Prouty.” 
“The Village will be a model for how rural communities can address interconnected challenges — child care, housing and workforce stability — by bringing people and services together,” Learey said. “The family shelter is a critical first step, but it cannot be the last.”
Braus, for her part, has declined pomp or plaques, although she’s allowing herself to be identified.
“Anonymity is a lot easier, but I wanted people to be aware that activists can also be donors,” she said. “If people can look at this and say, ‘I don’t need to keep all this money that I’m being left,’ I’ll feel like it was worth it. Obviously, if you’re living in dire poverty, you’re going to keep it. But I’m hoping that other people will decide that maybe society could use the money more. There are so many who need so much.”

Eagleton U.S. Courthouse in St. Louis, home of the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Missouri (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).ST. LOUIS — A federal judge promised Tuesday that he would decide whether or not to block a referendum on Missouri’s gerrymandered redistricting map before petitions to force a vote are submitted.
The state is asking U.S. District Judge Zachary Bluestone, a recent Trump appointee, to declare the U.S. Constitution precludes any popular effort to overturn the new map that was muscled through by Republicans in a September special session. People Not Politicians, a political action committee that has until Dec. 11 to submit enough signatures to force a vote on the map, wants Bluestone to dismiss the case and leave it to state courts to sort out.
Told in court that the signatures would be turned in Dec. 9, Bluestone said he would have a decision by that date.
Using the new map, Republicans hope to win seven of the state’s eight congressional seats by adding enough GOP votes to flip the 5th District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City. It is part of a national battle over drawing new lines begun when President Donald Trump pushed Texas to redistrict to win five new GOP seats in the narrowly divided Congress.
The case is one of eight — two in federal court and six in state court — that wrap the redistricting plan in multiple layers of litigation. One, argued Nov. 12 in Cole County and challenging the constitutionality of redistricting when there is no new census data, is awaiting a decision from Circuit Judge Christopher LImbaugh.
The latest lawsuit was filed Nov. 11 by Advanced Micro Targeting, the company gathering signatures for People Not Politicians, accusing competitors of “poaching” employees and “gathering intelligence” on its operations.
In the case before Bluestone, the state argues the federal constitution directs state legislatures to determine the boundaries of congressional districts. And without a clear statement in the Missouri Constitution’s referendum clause allowing votes on redistricting  plans, it is prohibited.
Lou Capozzi, state solicitor general, told Bluestone that he should intervene because the people are trying to infringe on the prerogatives of the General Assembly and it is costing the state money and employee time to process the referendum.
“From start to finish, the defendants’ actions impose significant burdens,” he said.
Jessica Amunson, representing People Not Politicians, said the costs are just employees in three state offices — secretary of state, attorney general and state auditor — doing their jobs. And future costs, for verifying signatures and an election, are speculative because the petitions have not been submitted yet.
The case, she said, is unprecedented. The plaintiffs — the General Assembly and Secretary of State Denny Hoskins — “are suing their own citizens to prevent them from petitioning their government.”
There are very few court precedents on the question of whether citizen referendum power extends to congressional district maps. Missouri voters rejected a redistricting plan in a 1922 referendum but that vote produced no guiding legal cases.
The attorneys did argue over the meaning of a 1916 U.S. Supreme Court decision in an Ohio case that found a referendum on a redistricting plan was a constitutional use of the power. 
Capozzi said the courts found the Ohio Constitution had a “clear statement” granting the power. 
Amunson disagreed. The Ohio referendum power is essentially the same as Missouri, allowing “any law” to be subject to a vote while Missouri says “any act” passed by lawmakers can be sent to a vote.
“In none of those cases was there a clear statement rule required,” she said.
Bluestone seemed more skeptical of Amunson’s arguments at times than Capozzi, but directed pointed questioning to both.
While he promised a decision by Dec. 9, at the beginning of the hearing he said the decision may be to hold the case without acting while other lawsuits play out in state court. 
In state court, Missouri is defending the redistricting plan by arguing the inverse of the argument in federal court —  the absence of words granting or barring lawmakers authority to revise district lines between census reports means it is allowed. Before Bluestone, the state is arguing that the absence of words granting or barring petitioners from seeking a referendum means it is not allowed. 
Richard von Glahn, executive director of People Not Politicians, said after the hearing that he’s not surprised by the apparent contradiction.
“What I saw in the hearing was, frankly, clarity from the state about how afraid they are of voters getting the final say on this,” von Glahn said. “If you think what you did is a good thing, you have nothing to fear from a referendum.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fedeal-courthouse-STL-1024x632.png,,,2025-11-26 06:57:51.006408

(Photo by Wagner Meier/Getty Images)I had the privilege of representing Minnesota at the recent United Nations Climate Conference of Parties. I’ve been attending these summits alongside Minnesota’s educators, elected officials and business leaders for the past 10 years. It is as important as ever that states like Minnesota step up and play a vital role in advancing the goals of global climate action.
Over 50,000 people from 193 nations gathered at the mouth of the Amazon in Belém, Brazil, for a two-week summit to spur further action to limit the planet’s warming and protect vulnerable people and places. Indigenous peoples were present in overwhelming numbers at this COP, with banners that read “Not about us without us” — demanding inclusion in decision making. 
For the first time in the 30-year history of COP climate summits, the U.S. did not send a single federal government official to the talks. The other missing nations were Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino. Even North Korea sent a delegation to Brazil. 
As the U.S. has shirked away from international cooperation, China has stepped into its vacuum, sending nearly 800 delegates to Brazil. From plenary sessions to back corridors, I heard praise upon praise for how Chinese industrial policies have brought down the costs of solar panels and electric vehicles for all.
While the federal government’s presence was lacking, the U.S. was not entirely absent from COP30. A coalition of 100 local leaders, governors and one sole member of Congress — U.S. Sen.Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. — delivered a singular message: Our cities and states are working to be reliable and stable partners in the fight for climate action. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom stole the stage at COP30, moving from venue to venue declaring his climate ambitions. Taking the torch of international cooperation from the federal government, Newsom went on to sign technology agreements with Brazil, Columbia and Nigeria.
Newsom’s leadership should resonate with Minnesotans and our elected officials. As Fresh Energy has calculated, if the Midwest were its own country, we would rank as the fifth-largest emitter globally. Compared with other U.S. regions, our transportation, agricultural and electricity generation systems disproportionately rely on fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. 
But Minnesota is also the exception of the region. We lead the Midwest with our 100% clean electricity by 2040 law, and other states in our region are following our example.   
Given this, I was disappointed that Gov. Tim Walz and members of his administration did not attend COP30 and spread our successes. Minnesota often has one of the largest delegations — representing the private, public and nonprofit sectors —  at these climate summits. There were over 60 of us from Minnesota in Scotland for COP26. This year would have been a golden opportunity to showcase our progressive policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net-zero emissions, particularly our unique critical minerals reserves and our metals recycling industries. 
While COP30 did not achieve wide consensus on the phasing out of fossil fuels, it did result in some important milestones, including the first references in the draft action plan to the social and environmental risks associated with mining critical minerals. More than half of the minerals needed for the global energy transition are located on or near Indigenous lands. Brazil’s President Lula da Silva told leaders gathered in Belém that it is “impossible to discuss the energy transition without talking about critical minerals, essential to make batteries, solar panels and energy systems.”

While this initiative was supported by dozens of countries, it was ultimately left out of the final declaration in large part due to opposition from China. Nonetheless, this COP showed us mineral diplomacy will be a key part of climate diplomacy in the future. The material realities of the clean energy transition — including the need to sustainably source lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper — can no longer be ignored.
Minnesota can be a global example of responsible mineral production that prioritizes Indigenous peoples’ participation. We can also be at the forefront of developing a circular economy for energy transition minerals so that we can protect our treasured places. 
At COP30, the International Energy Agency highlighted evidence that the market value of critical minerals recycling could reach $200 billion by 2050. In 2024, the Minnesota Legislature created a Critical Materials Recovery Task Force to advise policymakers on how to increase the recovery of critical materials — including aluminum, cobalt, copper, nickel and silicon — from end-of-life products. These are the kinds of initiatives that can help Minnesota lead on the global climate stage.
I came home from Brazil with a renewed commitment to fighting climate change here at home. This work starts by channeling the leadership of other nations, and key U.S. states, to move forward on emissions reductions while pursuing economic opportunities. 
Charting a path on responsible mineral production in Minnesota could demonstrate to the world how we can meet our global challenges with integrity.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray is in the midst of the greatest political maelstrom of his seven-plus years as the chamber’s leader, facing President Donald Trump’s ire over congressional redistricting.
A deeply divided Senate voted last week to scrap planned December meetings to consider redrawing Indiana’s current U.S. House map — under which Republicans have a 7-2 majority — to improve the GOP’s chances of capturing all nine seats. Bray maintains that too few Republican senators support redistricting for it to clear the Senate.
Things to know about Bray:
As Senate president pro tempore, he is leader of the Senate’s majority party (which has been the Republicans since 1979). Bray presides over Senate sessions when the chamber’s president, Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, is absent. But Bray’s true Statehouse power comes from his authority to pick committee chairs, direct bills to particular committees and broadly set the Senate’s agenda.
Republican senators chose Bray as president pro tem in 2018 following David Long’s decision to step down after 12 years in the office. Bray’s been officially elected by the full Senate to the position each two years since then, with Democrats, by practice, not opposing the Republicans’ pick.
Bray was first elected to the Senate in 2012 and rose quickly within its ranks. Long bypassed many more-senior senators to pick Bray for the No. 2 position of majority floor leader in 2017. That set the stage for his jump into the president pro tem post the following year.
The 56-year-old Bray’s typical calm demeanor obscures his resolve, a former Senate colleague says. “Rod has a quiet confidence about him,” said Jim Merritt, an Indianapolis Republican who served 30 years in the Senate until resigning in 2020. “When he became pro tem, I think a lot of people thought that he was too nice. I think they judged it wrong. I think when people step out of line, if you will, he has quietly disciplined, I’m not going to say punish, but disciplined them.”
Bray is from Martinsville, graduating from Martinsville High School and Indiana University before receiving a law degree from Valparaiso University. An Indiana attorney since 1994, he joined his now-retired father’s law firm before running for office and maintains a Martinsville law practice. He is married with two sons.

Politics is the family business. Bray succeeded his father, Richard Bray, in the Senate seat. The elder Bray served 18 years in the Indiana House, followed by two decades in the Senate. Rodric Bray’s grandfather, William Bray, served 24 years in the U.S. House before losing a reelection race in 1974.
The impact of the redistricting fight on the Legislature colors Bray’s decision making. “I have a deep and abiding regard for this institution and our democratic process, and that’s a result of my grandfather, my father and my family,” Bray told reporters last week. “I always want to treat it with the utmost respect, which is what I’m trying to do here.”
Why not just hold a Senate vote on redistricting? “When there’s an issue, if we know we don’t have the votes for it, we don’t typically come in (for a vote),” Bray said. “This, I recognize, is a little bit of a different issue. It’s got a little more attention than some of our even more public bills. But that is typically how we handle that when we don’t have the votes to pass it.”
Bray represents a heavily Republican district in central Indiana that includes all of Morgan County, where Martinsville is the county seat, and parts of Johnson, Greene and Putnam counties. 
Bray won reelection last year to a term running until November 2028. That puts Trump’s threat to support a Republican primary challenger to Bray on hold for a while. Bray faced an active 2024 primary opponent but won with 63% of the vote.
He’s held off a previous challenge to his Senate leadership. That happened in 2022 when Bray removed then-Sen. Mark Messmer of Jasper from the majority floor leader position after disagreements over handling of the near-total abortion ban bill. Bray defeated Messmer a few months later in a vote among Senate Republicans to remain their top leader. Messmer left the Senate last year for his successful race for a U.S. House seat.
On dealing with Trump about redistricting (and arguing that Republicans should, instead, focus on trying to defeat Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan in northwestern Indiana’s current 1st District): “I’ve had a couple conversations with the president. Honored to talk to the president, frankly. I know that he’s passionate about this issue. I’ve explained to him … that we want to be helpful. We want to see a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, and this is the best way forward, as we see it.”

The Idaho Department of Labor on Friday released the full 2025 Profile of Rural Idaho, a comprehensive report examining population growth, migration, industry shifts, and other characteristics of Idaho’s rural counties. 
The report shows that, while the Gem State has retained the same ratio of rural-to-urban counties over the years, the demographics, economics, crime and opportunities have all changed dramatically. 
Thirty-five of Idaho’s 44 counties are considered rural — defined in the report as a county that does not have a city with at least 20,000 residents. 
However, amid booming population increases to the state over the past several years, just 28% of Idaho’s residents lived in rural counties in 2023, down from 36% in 1990. 
The report was the culmination of a yearlong process by state labor economists, Idaho Department of Labor Director Jani Revier said during a webinar held Tuesday. The first and second installments of the three-part report were released in May and July respectively. 
 Education, child care and internet drive barriers to employment in rural Idaho

The third section of the 98-page report emphasized “critical trends” in rural Idaho, including evaluating employment challenges, education, aging demographics, and transportation and broadband access. 
Between 2022 and 2024, Idaho overall had record-setting low unemployment rates. However, over the past few decades, Idaho’s overall labor force participation has been declining. The number of people working or actively seeking work as a share of the working age population peaked in Idaho in 1998 at over 70%, the report said. In 2024, it was 64%. 
In the last five years of labor participation data, the 20 Idaho counties that had labor force participation rates below 60% were classified as rural. The state’s nine urban counties had a labor participation rate of 64.1%. 
The report points to a combination of an aging population, lack of child care, and lower education rates as potential factors leading to lower labor force participation. 
Between 2019 and 2023, 11.6% of adults aged 25 and older in rural counties did not finish high school, as opposed to 7.1% of those in urban counties. This is an improvement from 2009 to 2013, when nearly 15% of adults in that age group in rural Idaho counties did not get a high school diploma. 
“Continued focus on targeted workforce education programs within rural areas, such as in-school career technical education programs, registered apprenticeships and Idaho LAUNCH, may provide the greatest training benefit to rural areas with high workforce needs that are not within close proximity of a public postsecondary institution,” the report said. 
Idaho Launch refers to a program spearheaded by Gov. Brad Little which provides grants to graduating Idaho high school seniors to use for tuition, job training or an apprenticeship program for in-demand careers.
Rural counties also had much lower ratios of child care employees to children under the age of 5. The report also highlighted that the number of counties where at least 20% of households who don’t have a broadband internet subscription is much higher in rural areas. 
 People in Idaho’s rural counties are aging, including farmers, leaving the future of agriculture in question 

Idaho, following national trends, is facing an aging population as birthrates decline and the baby boomer generation gets older. 
“As birth rates look poised to continue falling and a higher share of the resident population hits retirement age, this is likely to result in a chronic labor supply shortage for many of Idaho’s counties — most drastically in the rural areas,” the report said.
What are called “open country counties,” defined as those with no urban area of at least 7,500 people and no strong commuting ties to a metro area, have the lowest birthrate in Idaho, at 11 births per 1,000 residents. These open country counties have the highest median resident age, at over 44 years old. 
Of the 20 top counties with the highest median age, the majority of them also had labor participation rates below 60%. 
Idaho’s share of agriculture producers aged 65 and older has increased 123% since 2002, the report said. 
The price of agricultural land has also skyrocketed in that time, while revenues have lagged. 
(From the 2025 Rural profile of Idaho)
The number of farms in rural Idaho has decreased 9.8% between 2002 and 2022, the report said, while the price per acre of land increased 151%. These two factors could mean an uncertain future for much of Idaho’s agricultural land. 
“As farm acre prices continue to rise while cost inputs remain elevated,” the report said, “these decisions may tip in favor of farmland being sold and transitioning to other competing uses for a higher monetary return, such as residential or commercial land development.”

 Poverty rates had declined across Idaho, but many rural families struggle to afford cost of living 

Idaho’s poverty rates declined significantly from 2019 to 2023, the report said, but rural counties experienced a more “subdued drop.” 
The poverty rate between 2019 to 2023, compared to the five years prior, dropped 5% in Idaho’s urban counties and 4.1% in rural counties. 
The urban counties still had the highest poverty rates, at 12.7%. The open country counties had the second highest at 12.6%. 
Rural counties saw a slight increase in the poverty rate of residents 65 and older from 9% in 2013 to 9.9% in 2023. 
(From the 2025 Rural Profile of Idaho)
The report also looked at incomes versus cost of basic necessities, like housing, food and transportation. Rural counties had lower expenses for housing and child care, but less access to grocery stores and had longer commutes, the report found. Rural families also tend to have more children than urban families, the report said, “further highlighting the living wage challenge of raising a family in rural Idaho.” 
“While the cost of living is cheaper in rural counties, only 31% of rural households earn incomes high enough to support a family of four, compared with 49% of urban households,” the report said.
 Most crime dramatically decreased in rural Idaho, except drug offenses 

Across Idaho, property and violent crimes have reduced dramatically over the past 20 years. 
Between 2003 and 2023, property crime reduced 72% in rural counties and 55% in urban areas. Violent crime overall dropped 18% in rural areas and 11% in urban counties at that time. 
(From the 2025 Rural Profile of Idaho)
“The cause of this decrease can be partially attributed to the long-term downward unemployment trend,” the report said. “… As more people are able to earn employment income through legitimate means, there may be less incentive to engage in criminal acts which carry a high risk of penalties like incarceration.” 
Drug offenses have increased in both urban and rural areas. 
In rural counties, drug offenses increased 44% between 2003 and 2023, and were up 26% in urban areas. 
Open country counties had the highest drug offense rate of any county type, at 693 per 100,000 residents. 
 Broadband improvements and renewable energy present economic opportunities for rural areas

Access to broadband internet has been highlighted as a “critical labor force trend,” since the 2005 Profile of Rural Idaho, the report said, “that need has only intensified since.” 
“High speed broadband creates opportunities for the highly skilled rural labor force to train or work remotely with less reliance on an employer’s specific location,” the report said.
Between 2019 and 2012, 24 rural and three urban counties had at least 20% of households without internet subscriptions. 
The most up-to-date benchmark set by the Federal Communications Commission for high-speed internet was 100 megabits per second, the report said, and 28 rural Idaho counties are unable to meet those benchmarks with existing infrastructure.  
The report also identified renewable energy projects, amid growing electricity demands, as an area of potential growth in Idaho. 
Idaho produces around 20% of its own energy needs, the report said, and 60% of its annual energy consumption. Idaho contains no significant sources of coal or oil. 
“Renewable energy production and transmission is likely to be another stronghold industry in rural Idaho going forward,” the report said. “Modern technology adoption, such as a higher penetration of electric vehicles, construction of large regional data centers, and continued implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) will be highly dependent on rural Idaho for electricity generation.”

(Courtesy photo)Vivacious and full of life, Dylan Cheatwood was a thrill-seeker with a big heart who enjoyed motorcycles, surfing and riding bulls.
Perhaps it was because he was diagnosed with epilepsy at a young age, but Dylan was determined not to let his illness rob him of anything. He not only embraced life’s experiences but tried everything to curb his unrelenting seizures: a combination of countless medicines, a vagus nerve stimulator implanted in his chest and even a brain surgery that proved unsuccessful.
At just 25, Dylan died unexpectedly of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is identified as a cause of death when an individual with epilepsy dies unexpectedly and in the absence of a seizure. His loss revealed a devastating truth about the lack of epilepsy awareness and care in Oklahoma, a reality shared by more than 41,000 individuals across the state.
SUDEP is a leading cause of death among the 2.9 million Americans living with epilepsy. In Dylan’s case, the seizures began when he was very young, at just two years old: he experienced movement seizures along with day- and nighttime seizures, and unfortunately, he was never able to achieve seizure control.
Despite Dylan having every risk factor, we were never informed of the risks or treatments that could help reduce the likelihood of SUDEP. Risk factors include early-onset epilepsy, tonic-clonic and nighttime seizures, and the inability to achieve seizure control even with medications, surgeries or implanted devices.
While everyone’s epilepsy is different, SUDEP risk may be reduced by achieving seizure control, night monitoring (through devices, co-sleeping or even an epilepsy service dog), avoiding alcohol and stimulants, and talking with a doctor about options like the ketogenic diet. However, patients can’t take steps to prevent something they’ve never been told about. That’s why better reporting — and awareness — is vital.
Passed earlier this year, House Bill 2013, known as Dylan’s Law, represents a major step forward for individuals and families living with epilepsy in Oklahoma.
The law, which went into effect Nov. 1, creates awareness around SUDEP among first responders by providing an option for individuals living with epilepsy to include a special designation on their drivers’ license, an identifier that could lead to faster treatment in an emergency.
Dylan’s Law also directs the State Commissioner of Health to make training about SUDEP available to physicians among continuing medical education credits — a move that will enhance awareness about SUDEP among physicians in the hopes that doctors will be better equipped to share that information with individuals and families living with epilepsy.
The bill also encourages SUDEP investigation in autopsies, effectively creating the nation’s most comprehensive epilepsy legislation. This is important, because while it’s estimated that we lose 1,000 Oklahomans each year to SUDEP, true figures aren’t known due to poor data tracking, a lack of education by health professionals and public stigma that prevents patients with seizures from seeking treatment. Too many people suffer in silence, and too many families are left without answers.
Dylan’s bravery in the face of epilepsy was an inspiration, and as his friends and family, we couldn’t let his death be in vain. In the years since his passing, we have turned grief into action by advocating for greater epilepsy and SUDEP awareness and working with lawmakers to craft legislation designed to better support individuals suffering from recurrent seizures.
In honoring Dylan’s life, we hope that no other family has to suffer a loss like we did and that Oklahoma now has systems in place to support those living with epilepsy. Dylan’s Law ensures his story will not be forgotten and that his legacy will make a difference for thousands of Oklahomans.

Though worker advocates cheer more affordable premiums, some scoff at ""safe workplaces"" claims and say the state is too stingy with its $2.8 billion fund when it comes to helping injured workers.
The post Wyoming employers get a break on workers’ comp premiums for third straight year appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming employers participating in the state’s workers’ compensation program will experience a 15% break in premiums next year, the third rate reduction in as many years. 
That will result in a combined annual savings of $66 million, according to the Department of Workforce Services. Employers in good standing, and with three or more years in the program, may enjoy even bigger savings.
“By lowering workers’ compensation costs, we are helping employers invest in their workforce, strengthen their operations and continue to build safe, resilient workplaces across our state,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement announcing the rate reduction.
All employers of businesses in Wyoming classified as “extra hazardous” are required to participate in the state’s workers’ compensation program, which is administered by the Department of Workforce Services. Others may voluntarily enroll, which typically entitles them to legal immunity for workplace injuries. The program is funded by premiums paid by employers to cover lost wages and medical bills for their employees who are injured on the job.
Wyoming is one of the few states that does not offer workers’ compensation benefits to undocumented workers.
$2.8 billion fund
The state can afford to offer lower premiums, Workforce Services Director Elizabeth Gagen suggested, because “Wyoming’s strong safety culture and responsible business practices are paying off, creating lasting benefits for both our workforce and our economy.”

A September report to the Legislature’s Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee indicates the workers’ compensation fund is growing at a rate that surpasses expenditures and liabilities.
“The average annual rate of return on the [workers’ compensation] investment portfolio over the past five years is approximately 6.8%,” Workforce Services Deputy Director Jason Wolfe told WyoFile via email. “Coupled with year-over-year declines in the number of injuries, as shown in the report, and sound cost containment and case management strategies, this means we’re typically spending a bit less than we’re making.”
The state’s workers’ compensation fund has risen steadily from $1.8 billion in 2015 to more than $2.8 billion at the end of fiscal year 2025, according to the state’s report. During the same period, annual claim expenditures have grown from $178 million to nearly $194 million.
Critics dispute safety claims
Worker advocates question assertions that expenditures remain moderate due to safe workplaces and a decline in work-related injuries. They say not all injuries are reported, while pointing to Wyoming’s chronic worst- or among-the-worst workplace fatality rates in the nation.

Yes, Wyoming’s workers’ compensation program works well when it comes to acute injuries with an easily defined recovery prognosis, some say. But the state tends to fight against expensive and prolonged claims related to things like back injuries, chronic pain and illnesses.
Any notion that Wyoming’s flush workers’ compensation fund is due to a strong workplace safety track record is “bullshit,” Wyoming AFL-CIO Executive Director Marcie Kindred said.
“I mean, we may have [fewer] claims,” Kindred told WyoFile, “but we still kill more people than any other state.” And she suggested that the state’s moderate workers’ compensation expenses might derive from Wyoming’s bootstraps mentality, which discourages injured workers from making a claim or fighting a challenge to a claim.
“I’m just picturing my guys having to, again and again, go to hearings and court cases in front of anybody in power and say, ‘I need help,'” Kindred continued. “It’s insurmountable, and it’s hard to get people to admit they need help.”
Asked to respond to such criticism, Wolfe, of workforce services, said, “The evidence actually shows our denial rate of claims to be fairly steady, with a slight decline over the last five years. The denial rate is approximately 5%-6% of annual claims.”
“Because the state is not a for-profit insurance company, it is perfectly appropriate to make sure that Wyoming businesses are paying a fair amount,” Lawyers and Advocates for Wyoming Director Mark Aronowitz told WyoFile. 
“At the same time,” Aronowitz continued, “I believe that ‘sound cost containment and case management strategies’ should include a detailed analysis of all workplace fatalities and serious injuries in order to prevent similar incidents from ever occurring again.”
That type of deliberate, all-inclusive analysis is not happening in Wyoming, according to worker advocates. 
“Resources wisely spent on injury prevention could help save the fund, and employers, millions of dollars over time,” Aronowitz added, “while, more importantly, reducing our perennially unacceptably high workplace fatality rate.”

A recently passed resolution to limit free speech demonstrates how little the state Republican Party believes in the First Amendment, writes columnist Rod Miller. 
The post Charlie Kirk and the hypocrisy of the Wyoming GOP appeared first on WyoFile .","Among the many freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution, there is one freedom that is conspicuously absent. Nothing therein guarantees your freedom to not be annoyed, shocked, scared shitless or offended by what someone else says.

Opinion

Pluralism, as we Americans enjoy, almost guarantees that someone WILL be offended by something that someone else says. I’m here to testify that is a good thing. It guarantees that we will not become a nation of frightened intellectual pantywaists.
Censorship in favor of anyone’s tender feelings indicates a lack of faith in our freedom of speech, our collective mental resiliency and in our basic American liberty. I wish the Wyoming Republican Party would realize that.
A hadith is a fundamental precept of the Islamic faith, but one that does not necessarily issue from the Quran. A hadith is a sort of apocryphal truism that has found its way into the Muslim canon by repetition. An example would be the Islamic law that nobody can make an image or draw a picture of the Prophet. Such an act is considered offensive to the faith, and can and has resulted in the artist’s death.
When the Wyoming Republican Party recently passed a resolution to investigate, condemn and punish people who cheered or spoke inappropriately when Charlie Kirk was killed, they created a new hadith that is blasphemous to our constitutional canon. And they demonstrated publicly how little they believe in our First Amendment freedoms.
Apparently, the nasty rhetoric spouted by Kirk’s opponents after he was killed shocked and appalled the Wyoming GOP, and they determined that they had to put a stop to it. But they forgot that the First Amendment to our Constitution contains no penalty for shocking or appalling speech. Nor does it place conditions on speech or mention consequences for speaking freely. It just says that, in our country, speech is free.
In passing the aforementioned resolution, the Wyoming GOP also ignored the “Timeless Truth” in Plank 22 of its own platform, which states, “Freedom of speech includes the freedom of the individual to express his or her beliefs, ideas and opinions without fear of retaliation, censorship or legal sanction by government.”
The Wyoming GOP’s resolution says that those who celebrate and condone political murder, such as the murder of Charlie Kirk, should be investigated and punished. Yet, just a few days ago, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman was in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump. This is the same Saudi crown prince who ordered the murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post reporter whom the Saudi royal considered an enemy.

When a reporter at the meeting asked Trump about the murder, he shrugged and said, “Things happen.”
Will the Wyoming GOP investigate and punish Trump for condoning political murder? Don’t hold your breath.
For a once-proud political organization like the Wyoming Republican Party to dishonor itself by passing a resolution that is clearly contrary to our Constitution, as well as to its own platform, causes us to ask why such forked-tongued hypocrisy occurred. I have a couple of thoughts.
I smell the influence of the Freedom Caucus on this one. This looks like a continuation of their Sharia-esque power grab in the Cowboy State, and their my-way-or-the-highway attitude toward anyone who doesn’t buy into their bullshit.
This resolution also suggests that power has gone to the Wyoming GOP’s head, and their hubris is showing. For a political party to try to supplant the Constitution through its own internal pronouncements appears just a tad bit despotic.
The First Amendment says what it says, and means what it means, and there’s not a thing the Wyoming GOP can do about that, no matter how many hadiths they write to the contrary.
They’ll probably consider this column some sort of unpatriotic hate speech directed toward a tender spot in their insecure self-identity, and call for me and anyone else who points out their hypocrisy to be investigated and punished. Screw ‘em!

(David Espejo/Stock photo via Getty Images)Four members of the West Virginia Legislature signed onto a national bipartisan letter this week opposing a policy under consideration by Congress that would allow the federal government to preempt state regulations on artificial intelligence.
The letter was signed by 280 state lawmakers from across the country, including West Virginia’s own Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, and Dels. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha; Bill Ridenour, R-Jefferson and Margitta Mazzocchi, R-Logan. 
In the letter, lawmakers expressed their “strong opposition” to any federal policy that would prohibit states from implementing and enforcing their own regulations on AI. They also shared concerns over how federal preemptive measures on the technology could undo and undermine laws already in place.
“As state lawmakers and policymakers, we hear regularly from constituents about rising online harms and the growing influence of AI on their lives,” the letter reads. “… In the years ahead, AI’s impact will require lawmakers to consider consequential public policy questions, making it essential that states retain the authority to act.”
The opposition to federal preemption over AI comes after a similar provision to stop state regulation was pulled out of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act due to bipartisan opposition earlier this year. That provision would have implemented a 10-year moratorium on state and local AI regulations.
Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson
“I was one of the people that wrote in protest of the provision that would have preempted AI regulation in the Big Beautiful Bill, so when I saw that they’re attempting to do it again, obviously I still feel the same way. Not much has changed here in the past few months,” Rucker said. “I still feel that it is not acceptable that the federal government is trying to co-opt state’s rights when it comes to this, and no, I am not okay with that.”
After its failure in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, national news outlets reported last week that the Trump administration was considering an executive order to ban state regulation on AI. On Nov. 21, Reuters reported that the executive order effort was being put on pause. 
Instead, according to Punchbowl News, the executive branch and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., want to see the same preemption provision included in the National Defense Authorization Act. That legislation sets the budget and policy priorities for the nation’s military and defense infrastructure over the upcoming fiscal year.
Currently, there is little to no oversight for AI nationwide. Some localities have already passed their own laws to regulate the technology and, in some cases, ban it from being used for certain purposes. They’ve also implemented certain penalties for individuals who use the technology to promote harmful deepfakes, misinformation and more.
Proponents for federal preemption over AI regulation have said they don’t want there to be a patchwork of different policies state-to-state regarding the technology. AI industry leaders — specifically companies that create the AI technology in question — support federal control over regulation as opposed to state control. They worry that state regulation could stifle innovation. Under the current administration, it’s likely that federal regulation would be more lax compared to the approach taken in some states. 
Rucker said she’s concerned over the AI industry — dominated by deep-pocketed tech companies and venture capitalist firms — benefitting from a lack of regulation that could ultimately harm regular citizens.
“I know that this push is, again, being pushed by big-money interests and that is very hard for the average American to fight,” Rucker said. “I worry that they’re trying to take advantage of the average citizen not really paying attention to [the National Defense Authorization Act].”
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha
Young said she holds similar concerns. She said it’s easy to boil an issue like this down to politics, but the concerns are much deeper than that and it’s clear that both President Donald Trump and his administration are betting big on AI development as well as political support from the industry’s leaders.
This week, the White House signed an executive order to “accelerate” the use of AI in scientific research. That followed numerous other executive orders meant to increase the use and dependence on AI in numerous sectors, including education, energy and more.
And Trump, as well as other political leaders, have grown closer to those who head AI companies and others that create the hardware they rely on to operate.
“I don’t want to be hyper-political, but Trump has all the billionaires in his pocket on this. This is why they [the federal government] want to regulate it,” Young said. “They want to be able to do whatever they want to do, and a lot of times they want to do it with state and federal dollars, but they don’t want any safety provisions. That’s a problem and it’s one we should be able to confront as elected lawmakers.”
Young and Rucker both said they were grateful that the fight against federal preemption continues to be so bipartisan. None of the concerns around the industry are partisan, Young said. Rucker said it “gives [her] hope” to see pushback come from both sides of the aisle in time of high political polarization.
“It shows that at the end of the day, people can really win if they put special interests aside, then if we just all focus on putting the people forward — which is our job to do as the government and what we’ve been elected to do as state [lawmakers],” Young said. “We’ve seen that happen and be successful in bipartisan ways. There’s bipartisan AI bills all over the country … that shows that we can just put the politics aside and put people first, but we need to have the right to do that.”

Georgia’s state Capitol in Atlanta underwent its annual winter transformation last week, with some workers hanging wreaths around the building’s numerous lampposts, and others attending to the monumental task of installing the Capitol Christmas tree.
The tree will eventually be decked out with over 35,000 lights, and ceremonially illuminated during the annual tree-lighting ceremony with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. But the process of installing the tree takes a coordinated effort from a number of Santa’s helpers — along with more than a few hardworking Georgians.
This year’s tree, which is sitting in the rotunda at the state Capitol, measures a whopping 26 feet tall. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
This year’s tree, which is sitting in the rotunda at the state Capitol, measures a whopping 26 feet tall. According to the Georgia Building Authority, it is an eastern red cedar that was donated by a resident of Lindale, which sits about 60 miles northwest of Atlanta. 
Taylor Willingham, a chief ranger at the Georgia Forestry Commission, has helped with the process of transporting the Capitol Christmas tree for the past several years. He said harvesting the tree is typically a three-hour process that begins early in the morning and requires the combined efforts of the Georgia Forestry Commission, the Georgia Building Authority and Georgia State Patrol. 
The process, he said, “is fairly intricate, because you definitely want to deliver a beautiful Christmas tree for everyone to see.”
Once the chosen tree is loaded onto a truck from the Georgia Forestry Commission, it begins the long journey to the heart of Atlanta, with members of the Georgia State Patrol leading the way and the Georgia Building Authority bringing up the rear. This part of the trip, Willingham said, can be precarious at times.
“You have to be extra careful with the tree so it doesn’t catch on signs or anything as you travel,” he said.
But it is also among the most memorable parts of each year’s sojourn to the Capitol, as Georgia residents get the chance to catch glimpses of the tree’s journey.
“You can see the excitement in people’s eyes,” Willingham said. “You can see how people just light up when they realize what’s going on.”
Workers use a crane to lift the tree inside the building, then stand it upright and secure it to the third floor balconies.
A tree lighting ceremony will be held in December, though the exact date has not yet been announced.
Chuck Berry, the owner of Berry’s Tree Farm and the president of the Georgia Christmas Tree Association, said a Georgia-grown red cedar is a natural choice for a place like the state Capitol.
“To me, the red cedar is a traditional Christmas tree,” he said. “It’s what most people, years ago, grew up with.”
However, he added, commercial Christmas tree farms tend to favor faster-growing cypress trees over cedars, so Georgia residents may be unlikely to find one at their nearest tree farm. 
For families who are shopping for a tree this year, the Georgia Department of Agriculture recently published a map of Georgia-grown Christmas trees that includes nearly 100 farms across the state. 
“The advantage of a Christmas tree farm is you actually get to know when [the tree] was cut, so there’s no question as to how fresh it is,” Berry said. “Most Christmas tree farms in the state now offer activities for families and children, so you’re not necessarily just getting a Christmas tree, you’re actually building memories.”

(Photo by Kirk Fisher/Getty Images)Those of us who love Priest Lake cannot help but notice the increased intensity of logging activity on the east side. 
Driving along the east side road, we encounter clear cuts down to the road. Streams such as Cougar Creek and Bear Creek have had extensive logging and road building throughout their watersheds. To explain the changes, I think it is useful to explore how the endowment lands came to be as well as their intended and current use.
With westward expansion after the American Revolution, Congress sought to regulate the acquisition of land in the old Northwest Territories (consisting of lands west of the Appalachians, north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi). Townships were established as 6×6 miles with 36 one by one mile (640 acres) sections. 
Thomas Jefferson felt that an educated electorate was necessary for the new democratic republic and designated section 16 of each township for the benefit of the public school. Prior to this, education was a privilege of the elite with most ordinary children having to work from the moment they could carry a hoe or churn the butter. Income from section 16 went into a fund to support the school. 
The system was workable because farmland in the old Northwest was and remains highly productive. With an increasing population, the land became much more valuable and was sold off. The proceeds went into a school endowment fund. And even today, profit from those state funds goes exclusively to public schools. 
With further expansion of the population westward the landscape changed considerably where there were many areas that were not economically productive. For instance, a section of land in Owyhee County might support one cow, a dozen jack rabbits and a few rattle snakes.  
Recognizing the geographic diversity in the West, the states were allowed to consolidate their section 16’s into contiguous areas. In Idaho, the most productive endowment lands are in the north. These lands do not belong to the state, but to the school endowment. 
They are governed by the Land Board, consisting of the five highest-ranking public officials and managed by the Idaho Department of Lands. Sale of lands, logging and lease arrangements provide money that goes into the endowment fund. The endowment lands, described by the Land Board as their “sacred trust,” are constitutionally mandated to maximize revenue for the benefit of the schools. Each year the Land Board decides how much money goes to public schools. 

 Managing Idaho’s forest lands

Prior to 2000, the Idaho Department of Lands managed the forest with the understanding that from the time to harvest to regeneration and re-harvest was 80 years. This was the standard of practice in the Northwest for the U.S. Forest Service as well as private companies such as Weyerhaeuser. 
In 2006, an industry sponsored nonprofit organization, Forest Biometric Research Institute, was established to study forest inventory, growth and management in Oregon. This organization views their forests as working forests. 
With the logging mills adapting to smaller diameter logs, the institute has determined that a crop rotation of 40-45 years is adequate. They have developed their own proprietary software to facilitate management toward this goal. 
Over time, timber companies all over the West have followed along in lock step. Just in the last few years, this includes the Idaho Department of Lands. What we see now rolling down Highway 57 are large logs that are clearing the senescent forest to make way for the tree farm. Ultimately, after this burst of intense logging of large trees, the steady state working forest will produce logs of 8-10 inches’ diameter. The tree farm will look very different from the forest we have known.
We have concerns. One is that the endowment lands cannot sustain a re-harvest interval of 45 years. Another is that the annual contribution to our public schools is a token amount. We also feel that the Land Board may not be living up its fiduciary responsibilities as trustees.
In the Northern Rockies ecological zone, the growing season is short and winters are long. Therefore, it takes a considerable number of years for a conifer to mature compared to the same species in the milder wetter climate of the Oregon Coast (home to Forest Biometric Research Institute).
 Our soils are young, only established since the last glaciation. The soils are nutrient poor, easily erodible and the terrain is mountainous with steep slopes in many locales. Given these conditions, a rapid crop rotation may deplete the soil of nutrients and abet soil erosion. 
For the last five seasons, the Selkirk Conservation Alliance has monitored the stream chemistries of 18 Priest Lake tributaries. Watersheds that have experienced limited human impact have very low levels of the nutrient phosphorus; however, Cougar Creek which flows into Cavanaugh Bay has consistently demonstrated high levels. We are certain that high levels of phosphorus can be used as a proxy for soil erosion. 
Examining the Cougar Creek watershed, there has been intensive road building and logging over the last 10 years. With GIS modeling, we can predict the intensity of soil loss in a drainage, and we are actively exploring the possibility of engaging a GIS expert to pursue this project. This will help determine the quantity of soil loss over time. Soil loss can occur quickly, but in our region the rebuilding of soil can take 30-100 years.
 Idaho schools face real funding needs

Thomas Jefferson envisioned that section 16 would fund public education. Maybe 200 years ago that was workable, but the population is ever increasing, education for kids is 13 years instead of eight and the amount of information needed to navigate a modern world is much greater. 
In the West Bonner County School District, the cost of educating one student is about $13,500 per year. The state contributes about $10,500, and it is expected that the district will come up with the balance. Unfortunately, the school district has had trouble with passing school bond levies such that last year the local Priest Lake Elementary School was threatened with closure. Fortunately, the last levy passed, although not by a large margin. 
It is not like our district is fiscally irresponsible. Our teachers are poorly paid. Of the 115 school districts in Idaho, our teachers’ salaries are fifth from the bottom. The infrastructure also is in bad shape. So you might expect that the endowment fund would provide a substantial amount of fiscal relief, but in reality, the fund provides each K-12 student in Idaho with a whopping $200 (2024).
The Idaho Land Board is the trustee for the endowment lands. As such, members must act as fiduciaries to invest wisely in order to maximize returns. And they must never erode the corpus of the trust which includes the endowment fund and the endowment lands. 
The current balance in the fund is $3.3 billion. Last year the board allocated around $100 million to various recipients to include $63 million to public schools, $3.6 million to Idaho State University, $12.8 million to the University of Idaho and a lesser amount to Lewis-Clark State College. Appropriately, these recipients are educational institutions, but money was also given to State Hospital South, the Capitol Commission, Veterans Home and to Juvenile Corrections. 
These latter recipients were no doubt worthy, but why should they receive funding from the endowment fund? This looks like mission creep. Altogether, the distribution represents about 3% of the fund, and yet in the last 20 years, the fund has kept track with the S&P 500 earning about 9% per annum.
In January 2023, 18,000 acres of timber land were purchased mostly in Bonner and Boundary counties with the expectation that the lands would generate 4% per year. The $50 million came mostly from the purchase of cottage sites at Priest and Payette Lakes. 
Given the proven successful track record of the fund, would it not have been more judicious to direct the windfall money to the widely diversified general fund? No financial adviser worth his salt would recommend putting all your eggs in one basket. 
With reliance on timber sales, the board is at the mercy of a highly cyclical industry which may not have a bright future. So far, engineered wood products have not reached the point where they can compete with traditional wood products, but they offer tremendous long-term advantages. Some products are as strong as steel, fire resistant and can be made of inferior wood such as southern yellow pine which currently is not used for general construction because it lacks strength. 
The ICCU basketball arena at U of I is made from engineered wood as well as the newly remodeled PDX airport. The aesthetic is warm and inviting, and these structures will lock away carbon for a very long time. The purchase of more timber land with the hope of generating 4% is a giveaway. 
So you ask: Who benefits from the school endowment fund; is it Idaho schools or is it the forest products industry of Idaho? Is the Land Board a fiduciary for the endowment lands or for the industry? 
Our school children’s sacred trust is being profaned.

(Photo: Dollywood)We are a nation and state divided — on paper anyway. 
The last presidential election was decided by a difference of 1.47%. Here in Tennessee, Republicans have held a supermajority in the state legislature for a little over a decade, but when given a choice statewide and gerrymandering is taken out, our Tennessee values are a lot less divided than our legislature would reflect. 
If you look at polling from Vanderbilt University, Tennesseans in clear majorities support recreational marijuana, red-flag gun safety laws and exceptions to the abortion ban for rape, incest and the life of the mother. Our Republican-dominated legislature may not do anything about it, but Tennesseans agree on a lot more than we disagree. 
Another thing Tennesseans share in wide agreement? Our complete adoration of singer, songwriter and Tennessee icon Dolly Parton.
Dolly Parton is universally beloved. In 2019, the New York Times put out a piece entitled “Is There Anything We Can All Agree On? Yes: Dolly Parton”  She has always been a topic that could be brought up around a dinner table or in mixed company and agreement can be found. 



				We’d be a lot better off if we saw each other the way we all see Dolly: familiar, human and worth a little grace.			


I grew up on the Cumberland Plateau and spent my birthdays as a child at Dollywood. When I came out as gay, she was an affirming fixture. I have always called her the patron saint of the Southern Queer. She was never loud about her politics — what once was a Tennessee tradition — but she always made clear where she stood. On her recent “Rockstar” album, a song called “World on Fire” has a line:
“Greedy politicians, present and past / They wouldn’t know the truth if it bit ’em in the ass.”
If there’s ever been a bipartisan sentiment, that is it. 
I’m so tired of division. Not disagreement, which is healthy and part of a strong democracy, but the division that we’ve been experiencing for so many years. I’m a Tennessean. I have Republican friends. I don’t always understand their lifestyle or reasoning for their beliefs, but they are my neighbors and I’d really like to be able to acknowledge their presence in Kroger without wondering if I’m safe to be around them.
We’d be a lot better off if we saw each other the way we all see Dolly: familiar, human and worth a little grace.
We’re starting to see a crop of gubernatorial candidates pop up. When the Aftyn Behn/Matt Van Epps race for Congressional District 7 winds up in a few days, I expect we’ll see some more. For any of the candidates, considering running, I’d point them to Dollywood.
Writer Eric Patton gets a little Dolly Parton magic — and cinnamon sugar in his beard. (Photo: Submitted)
As someone who holds a Dollywood season pass, I’m there often. I love going, because the experience reminds me of what is still good about my home. On any given trip to Dollywood, you’ll see a church youth group next to a group of gay men decked out in Dolly shirts. Newlyweds on their honeymoon shopping for knicknacks. A rural family on the only vacation they can afford this year waiting patiently for their time on board Wild Eagle. Immigrants and folks here on tourist visas, all excited to share in home-spun fun and down-home goodness. 
We need a governor who will ask themself “What Would Dolly Do?” She’d make sure Tennesseans are fed, educated and breathing clean air. She’d make sure they’re getting along. She’d make sure they have access to cutting edge healthcare they don’t have to go into bankruptcy over. She’d make sure if something bad happened to their community, she’d fight for everything she could to take care of them. 
I know we can’t get Dolly herself, but whoever it’ll be needs to be as close as we can get. 
Our next governor should be someone who understands the job is more than policy. It’s about restoring the basic social adhesive we’ve let disintegrate. We will need someone who can walk through Dollywood and see the same thing you’ll see on any given day there: people worth loving, not voters worth dividing. 
And if we’re in need of something to get us to stick together, I’m pretty sure there’s some cinnamon sugar stuck in my beard from the last trip.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)This Thanksgiving, families across West Virginia will gather around the table and bow their heads in gratitude. But for too many of us, it’s getting harder to find something to be thankful for.
We are, of course, thankful for what matters most — our friends and families, the people who stand by us when times are tough. We’re grateful for the roof over our heads, the food on our tables, and the laughter that fills our homes, even when the world outside feels uncertain. We’re thankful for neighbors who lend a helping hand, for the church dinners that make sure no one goes hungry, and for the resilience that runs deep in West Virginia’s hills and hollers. These small blessings — love, community and connection — are what carry us through the hard times and remind us what we’re fighting for.
But times are hard right now. Really hard, and under H.R. 1 — the Big, Beautiful Bill — it will only get harder for West Virginians. People are working full-time jobs — sometimes more than one — and still can’t make ends meet. The cost of living has soared, while paychecks have barely budged. A trip to the grocery store evokes a glimpse at one’s bank balance before completing the clicklist. Gas prices creep higher. Rent keeps climbing. The electric bill is a shock every month. Families are cutting corners just to stay afloat — skipping meals, rationing medicine and hoping nothing goes wrong, because one unexpected expense can send everything crashing down. It’s something I’ve been hearing everywhere lately — the same frustrations, the same fears — especially over the last six weeks.
It shouldn’t be this way in America. It especially shouldn’t be this way in West Virginia, where people pride themselves on hard work, faith and taking care of their neighbors. But instead of finding relief this holiday season, we’re watching Congress make choices that will make things worse.
While families are struggling to put food on the table, our leaders in Washington are choosing to take health care away from millions of Americans — including tens of thousands of West Virginians. Cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act subsidies will push people out of coverage, forcing parents to choose between taking a sick child to the doctor or keeping the lights on.
And this isn’t abstract — it’s happening right now. When I re-enrolled in my own ACA marketplace plan earlier this month, my premium had increased by 410%. Let that sink in. Four hundred and ten percent. The same plan — except without dental and vision insurance that I have today — but now costing over four times more. I’m not alone. More than 67,000 West Virginians rely on the ACA for health insurance, and many are seeing staggering increases they simply can’t afford. These are real people — neighbors, teachers, small business owners — now forced to decide between health care and survival. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. These are policy choices — deliberate decisions to favor the wealthy and powerful over ordinary people. Congress found the money for new tax breaks for millionaires and big corporations, but somehow there’s “not enough” to help working families see a doctor or afford their prescriptions.
The truth is, this Thanksgiving, West Virginians are paying more and getting less. Grocery prices are up. Gas is up. Rent is up. Prescription drug prices are up. But wages? They’re not keeping up. And when families finally do reach for help — for Medicaid, SNAP, housing assistance or affordable coverage through the ACA marketplace — they’re told, “sorry, you’re on your own.”
That’s not gratitude. That’s greed, dressed up in a suit and tie.
When Congress votes to take away health care from people who clean their offices, deliver their mail, care for their children and stock their grocery store shelves, they’re not balancing a budget — they’re breaking a promise. They’re saying the lives of ordinary Americans are expendable. They’re saying it’s acceptable for a child’s asthma to go untreated, for a parent to skip insulin, for a senior to face eviction because medical bills drained their savings.
West Virginians know better. We know that gratitude isn’t just about counting blessings — it’s about sharing them. It’s about making sure everyone has enough to eat, a safe place to live and the ability to see a doctor when they’re sick.
This Thanksgiving, as our leaders in Washington pat themselves on the back for “fiscal responsibility,” let’s remember who’s really paying the price. Not the wealthy. Not the lobbyists. Not the corporations that got yet another round of tax breaks. It’s the single mom in Beckley who lost her health coverage. The retired miner in Logan who can’t afford his blood pressure medication. The family in Charleston wondering how they’ll pay next month’s rent.
So, this year, let’s tell the truth: there’s not a lot to be thankful for when our leaders choose cruelty over compassion. But there is still something to fight for.
Because West Virginians don’t give up easily. We believe in looking out for one another. We believe that every person deserves health care, dignity and a fair shot at a good life.
And we’ll keep fighting — through every cut, every challenge and every broken promise — until compassion guides policy again.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)PRESTONSBURG — BeLinda Click shivered in the cold fog as she greeted each person in a long line of cars, checking each one’s referral letter saying they’d been pre-approved for a free Thanksgiving meal. 
By 10 a.m. on Monday, the line of cars stretched deep into the parking lot at Big Sandy Community and Technical College in Prestonsburg. 
About 100 people signed up to get boxes at this location through God’s Pantry’s Sharing Thanksgiving program, which for 31 years has given people in need the ingredients to make a traditional holiday meal for up to a family of eight — turkey, cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes, corn, stuffing mix and more. 
Between Monday and Tuesday, God’s Pantry distributed around 7,500 Thanksgiving meal boxes at various sites in Central and Eastern Kentucky. 
“Have a happy Thanksgiving!” Click called out to the passengers in car after car. She knows what it’s like to need help. That’s why she’s here.  
In 2022, the deadly flood that devastated much of Southeastern Kentucky destroyed her family home. 
“We had such a downpour all at once,” she said. “It caused a mudslide behind our house, and it pretty well rotted out the whole back half of my house, and we had to move.” 
She and her family have lived in an apartment ever since. She got very little help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), she said. When the government failed her, though, her community stepped up. 
Saint Vincent Mission in David helped her — with food, supplies to help her rebuild and volunteers who helped her and her husband with the rebuilding. In turn, Click started volunteering with the Christian organization and now works as the food pantry director.

Click, 39, has also had benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for years. The Wayland woman’s benefit was paused during the recent government shutdown, along with roughly 600,000 other Kentuckians who need the benefit to buy food. 
“That was pretty scary,” said Click, “not knowing how you’re going to feed your family.” 
During the shutdown, Saint Vincent’s food pantry saw about 15-20 new clients in need of food who came in with the “panic of not knowing where their next meal is going to come from.” It made her job as a worker and volunteer at the pantry “that much more important,” she said. 
The shutdown is over, but the fallout from decisions made in Washington could continue for a while. And as the holiday season kicks in, many Kentuckians will need even more help. 
“There’s probably a higher demand of people (who need) holiday meals,” Click said. “Because what they live on now… they probably really can’t spare.” 



How to help:
Halligan said people who want to help neighbors dealing with food insecurity can help in a variety of ways — through donating time, money or food and through advocating for anti-hunger policies. 
“I think it’s up to a household; it’s up to an individual to decide where they can make the most impact, and if somebody can do all three, great, and if they can’t do one, or if they can only do one, pick the one that you can do and lean in,” Halligan said. “And if it’s not with God’s Pantry Food Bank, it’s with some other organization that is part of the hunger safety net — help them. It’s not about God’s Pantry Food Bank. It’s about 280,000 people who need the hunger safety net to work for them.” 
How to get help: 
People in Central and Eastern Kentucky can go to https://www.godspantry.org/help and search for the food pantry nearest them, by ZIP code. Anyone in Kentucky can search for help by county at https://feedingky.org/get-help/.



An ‘unconscionable level of increased food insecurity’

Michael Halligan, the president and CEO God’s Pantry Food Bank, said the hunger safety net has gotten an energy boost in 2025 thanks to public awareness of hunger that increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“I see community leaning in more than I’ve ever seen. Volunteers, neighbors experiencing hunger, sponsors, businesses, elected officials, I see community leaning in more than I’ve ever seen, and some of that is the circumstances of the time,” Halligan said. “We often talk about Kentuckians being resilient. What I see is the blessings of people helping people that allows that resiliency to become apparent, that allows that resiliency to happen, and if it’s not for community engagement, I’m not sure where we would be.” 
During the recent government shutdown, God’s Pantry saw a 40% increase in food insecurity in the 50 counties the organization serves, Halligan said. Before the shutdown, about 280,000 people in Central and Eastern Kentucky were living with food insecurity, he said. From the first week of October to the first week of November, around 400,000 people needed food help.
“Those were federal workers without paychecks. Those were folks who had never experienced hunger before that, all of a sudden, were asking, ‘What do I do? How do I get food?’” Halligan said. “Those were folks that lost SNAP benefits, even for a short period of time, and we’re still seeing the impact of that. It will take a while to recover. It will take a while for everything to kind of restabilize.” 
This increase in food insecurity in an already hungry state was daunting, Halligan said: “The instantaneous impact of that unconscionable level of increased food insecurity was difficult to deal with.”

The organization was able to bump up food distribution thanks to financial and food donations, he said, but food pantries can never replace SNAP benefits, which provide roughly nine meals for every one meal food pantries can offer, according to Feeding America. 
God’s Pantry, part of the Feeding Kentucky network, also got some of the funds from the $5 million pot Gov. Andy Beshear allocated to food banks from the rainy day fund. 
Still, God’s Pantry and other food pantry networks could see increased demand even beyond the holiday season.  
On Nov. 1, changes to the SNAP program passed in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act went into effect.  Veterans, the homeless, recent foster care youth and adults ages 54-64 are no longer exempt from work requirements to receive food benefits for themselves and their families. 
“We’re prepared to be able to do the things that we need to do to provide assistance, but we don’t know exactly what the number is yet,” Halligan said. 
The expanded work requirements, mandated by the federal budget bill, are expected to cost 114,000 Kentuckians their food assistance, policy experts have estimated. 
‘I hate to see people hungry.’

Volunteers keep the food safety net wheel turning, Halligan said. In 2024, more than 5,000 volunteers contributed about 33,000 hours of work to God’s Pantry. 
“Imagine if we had to pay for all of that,” he said. “We would not be able to distribute as much food, because we would have more payroll costs.” 
At the Sharing Thanksgiving event Monday, at least 30 volunteers were spread across the parking lot to greet meal recipients, check people in, load cars and more. 
Joey Waddell, the chief operating officer at Highlands Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH), was among the volunteers loading turkeys and Thanksgiving meal staples into vehicles.
“We try to be involved in as many community giving events that we can to help those that don’t have the means that maybe other folks do,” Waddell said, crediting his Christian faith with the desire to help others. He also recently participated in a dancing fundraiser for unhoused people and a coat drive for children. 
“Everybody’s appreciative and thanking us,” he said. “Putting others first, that’s where my heart is.”

Phil Mills, a respiratory therapist, God’s Pantry volunteer and the director of Fishes and Loaves, a community food pantry associated with St. James Episcopal Church in Prestonsburg, said he’s always found himself in a “helping role.” Mills was also out at Big Sandy on Monday to help keep the line of cars moving. 
“I do enjoy helping people,” said Mills, 56, who grew up in Martin County. “There’s a big need. There’s a lot of people that need. I always thought I grew up poor, until I’ve seen some other families and (realized) I had a lot. Probably not everything everybody wants, but there’s always somebody in worse shape than you.” 
His father worked in the coal mines, Mills said. He and his four siblings got a small, meaningful present or two at Christmas.  
“Now, I see all these people coming in. We have mothers come in with children; they can’t feed them, they don’t have toys for them,” he said. At Fishes and Loaves, staff try to find little toys and snacks for the kids — something extra to make them happy. 
“I’ve always been a helper. I’ve been a caregiver for parents, partners, relatives that needed other things. It’s just the caregiver in me,” Mills said. “People say I have a big heart. I don’t know if it’s a big heart. I just like helping others. I hate to see people hungry.” 
Anyone can find themselves in a position where they need food assistance, Halligan said. They could lose a loved one or a job, be in a traffic accident or find themselves caught between the politics of a government shutdown. 
“What I see right now is community understanding that more than they’ve ever understood it,” Halligan said. “We often talk about sharing the blessings of life around the Thanksgiving table, and that’s what sharing Thanksgiving is about. But I see people starting to understand the importance of sharing those moments 365 days a year, not one.”

(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)A months-long budget stalemate, resolved earlier this month, netted increases for both the Pennsylvania State Police and Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency — which plan to boost staffing and invest in technology updates.
State police will get an additional $69.3 million for operations, enough to fund four new cadet classes to increase its ranks. Staffing is critical for the 1,279 municipalities that don’t have police departments and rely solely on troopers for their law enforcement needs. 
“Our focus is firmly on safeguarding the public and ensuring that every community within the Commonwealth receives the support it requires during critical times,” said State Police Commissioner Col. Christopher Paris. “These investments are crucial in providing our members with the tools and resources needed to respond promptly and effectively to urgent situations, ultimately enhancing our collective resilience.”

Emergency management will receive $40 million in its disaster response fund, up from $20 million, “to offset (the) sudden loss in federal support,” according to a press release from the agency. The Trump administration has sought to transform the Federal Emergency Management Agency and publicly discussed shifting more responsibility to the states. 
Another $5 million bump to the Commonwealth Disaster Recovery Assistance Program will increase direct support to impacted Pennsylvanians.
“Programs like DRAP make an immediate and meaningful difference for our communities. After the May 13th flooding, many Somerset County residents were able to rely on DRAP to help begin their recovery when they needed it most. This support filled a critical gap for families who were facing unexpected losses,” said Somerset County Emergency Management Agency Director Joel Landis.

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas voters have a good bit to be grateful for this Thanksgiving holiday, as the 2026 election season picks up steam.
Voters in Senate District 26 and House District 70, especially, can thank the state Supreme Court for denying Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ request to delay compliance with two circuit court rulings that ordered special elections in those districts be held sooner than Sanders previously set them.
Voters in both districts sued after Sanders set special elections for June 9 to replace a deceased senator and a representative who resigned to take a job with Arkansas PBS. The plaintiffs argued the election date, coming well past the end of the Legislature’s fiscal session, deprived them of representation in violation of the state and federal constitutions.
In defiant Nov. 16 proclamations, Sanders reluctantly rescheduled the general elections in the two legislative districts for March 3, the same day as the 2026 party primaries elsewhere in Arkansas. She set the primaries in the two districts for Jan. 6, barely six weeks from today.
Sanders said she complied with the two court orders she’d tried to stop “under duress.” She stubbornly insisted that the court’s decision was “unlawful” and said she remained confident she’d prevail as the appeal continues.
That confidence requires faith that the Arkansas Supreme Court will reverse itself and the two lower court judges before Jan. 6. I find it hard to believe the state’s high court will halt an election it’s already said needs to be held sooner rather than later. I find it even harder to believe that the justices will declare an election null and void once the votes are cast. Not impossible, but unlikely.
Regardless, voters in Senate District 26, many of whom oppose a Sanders-backed plan to put a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County, have a surfeit of candidates to choose from come Jan. 6 as five Republicans vie to replace the late Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch. Stubblefield had been a staunch opponent of the administration’s choice of the site for the prison.
The winner of the primary will face independent candidate Adam Watson, a founding director of Gravel & Grit, a nonprofit dedicated to opposing the prison.
District 26 includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties.
Voters in House District 70, which had been held by Republican Rep. Carlton Wing of North Little Rock, get to choose between two Democrats on Jan. 6, with the winner facing a Republican candidate on March 3. District 70 lies entirely within Pulaski County.
 The bigger picture

Those aren’t the only Arkansas voters who should feel thankful this year, as Democrats field 75 candidates across executive, legislative and congressional races in hopes of loosening the Republican lock on the state’s congressional seats and reducing the GOP supermajority in the General Assembly. 
Those candidates provide voters ample opportunity to decide whether they want “change or more of the same,” to steal a phrase longtime political observer Skip Rutherford used in reference to the national political stage a week ago.
The former dean of the Clinton School of Public Service characterized the election of Democrats with widely divergent political views — from the Democratic Socialist mayor of New York City to the moderate governors of Virginia and New Jersey — as “send-a-message” elections.
From a national standpoint, the dissatisfaction of voters over the price of groceries and the rising cost of health insurance will be a message that Republicans and Democrats ignore at their peril in 2026’s midterms, Rutherford said at an Arkansas Times-sponsored lecture.
Rutherford, an adviser to Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, drew comparisons between the recent Democratic victories and that election’s “It’s the economy, stupid” slogan, attributed to campaign consultant James Carville.
I think Rutherford’s right, but Republicans can also use the economy card, and it’ll be interesting to see how that plays out in legislative races next year, especially with Sanders’ active involvement in several races.

But Gov. Jared Polis seems to have a different idea.
For some mysterious reason, he appears to think there might be some merit to the request. No matter how he comes down on the matter, he has already undermined the rule of law and insulted every local official who helps manage honest elections in the face of right-wing extremist threats.

Peters is serving time in state prison, and for good reason: The Republican former Mesa County clerk was the linchpin in a plan to breach the security of her own election equipment to prove the “big lie” that the 2020 election was stolen. She was convicted in state court of multiple counts related to the scheme, including four felonies, and sentenced to almost nine years behind bars.
The local district attorney who prosecuted the case was a Republican in a county that favored Trump by 28 percentage points, and there is no credible reason to think the conviction was unjust or compromised by politics.
But in MAGA America, what matters more than anything is personal loyalty to President Donald Trump, which Peters offers in ample measure. That’s why the president has repeatedly demanded that she be released, claiming preposterously that “she did nothing wrong, except catching the Democrats cheat in the Election” and promising “harsh measures” if Colorado fails to comply.
In March, J. Bishop Grewell, then the acting U.S. attorney for Colorado, and Peter McNeilly, then an assistant U.S. attorney for Colorado, were among three Justice Department officials who told a federal judge in Colorado they were reviewing the state’s prosecution of Peters. This month, Trump’s Bureau of Prisons formally made a request to the Colorado Department of Corrections to transfer her to federal custody.
The request is corrupt and deserves no consideration. Trump wants to aid a criminal ally, as he’s already done so many times since January.
“One is only left to assume that either the Trump administration wants her moved to federal custody so that they could somehow then release her outside of the jurisdiction of Colorado, which would be a blockbuster obstruction of justice by the U.S. government against a lawful state criminal order, or they want to put her in federal custody to give her some improved conditions,” lawyer Marc Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, said during an interview with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen.
Yet more than a week after the Trump administration sent its request to the state, Polis’ office in a statement to Newsline said he was still “reviewing” the request.
There’s nothing to review. As stated by Phil Weiser, the Democratic Colorado attorney general, and Dan Rubinstein, the Republican district attorney who prosecuted Peters, in a joint letter last week imploring Polis to deny the administration’s request, Trump “has no legal basis to interfere with the sentence in this case,” and the request is an attempt “to circumvent Colorado’s sovereignty.”
Even if Polis ultimately decides to deny the request, his long silence in the face of such brazen lawlessness has already made him look weak, and it has done real damage. During a Tuesday press conference, when a bipartisan group of local election officials from around the state exhorted Polis to deny the request, county clerks said they have experienced an “immediate uptick in concerns about safety” in relation to the Peters case.
The clerks said they have yet to even hear from Polis, even though they sent him a letter last week requesting a meeting with him about Peters.
This is hardly the first time Polis has appeared to accommodate Trump or fully sided with team MAGA. His administration has been all too eager to supply sensitive information about Colorado residents to ICE as part of Trump’s inhumane mass deportation program. 
In the Peters case, he risks undermining the rule of law and fueling doubts about voting in a state where brave Democratic and Republican officials have done so much to defend free and fair elections.
He owes it to anyone who hopes systems of justice can withstand authoritarian attacks to quickly, forcefully and publicly tell the Trump administration that Peters isn’t going anywhere.

The measures come as Virginia ramps up for the expected increase in traffic, which is also being driven by travelers avoiding air travel as the federal government cuts back on flights due to a shortage of air traffic controllers. 
An additional 1.6 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home over the holiday period between Nov. 25-Dec. 1, compared to the previous record of 80.2 million, according to AAA.
 Buckle up before taking off

Last March, Virginia passed a new traffic law requiring all passengers, whether in the front or back seats of the vehicle, to be properly buckled up. The previous law only required adults to wear seat belts when occupying the front seat, which contributed to Virginia raking the worst in the nation for seat belt use in 2023 with just 73.2% of residents buckling up, far below the national average of 91.9%, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
After tragic losses, mothers push for stronger driving laws in Virginia

“We are literally the worst at wearing our seat belts,” said Christy King, a Virginian resident, on a recent episode of the Responder Safety podcast. King advocated for the law change last January, following the death of her son, Christopher, in a car crash.
The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles advises rideshare drivers and passengers to comply, as well.
Last year, five of the eight people who died in crashes during the holiday period were not wearing a seatbelt. Virginia also recorded 768 traffic-related injuries in the same time frame. The new law follows the annual nationwide Click It or Ticket campaign, which raises awareness about seat belt use.
“Whether you’re traveling across the commonwealth to visit family or just heading down the street, remember that everyone wants to make it home safely for the holidays,” said DMV Commissioner Gerald Lackey, the governor’s highway safety representative, in a statement. “Be patient, be courteous, and buckle up. The best gift you can give your loved ones is your safe arrival.”
 Express lanes, closures

On Friday, the 2.5-mile extension of the Interstate 495 Express Lanes in Northern Virginia opened, which officials say will ease congestion in the area. The new lanes have already created some concern about the possible bottleneck the traffic would create going into Maryland.
The extension starts near the Dulles Corridor Interchange and terminates just before the American Legion Bridge, and includes new connecting ramps. The extension also includes new bridges carrying sidewalks and a shared-use trail parallel to Interstate 495, upgraded noise walls to protect nearby neighborhoods, and express bus service connecting Virginia to Maryland via the American Legion Bridge.
The extension is part of the $660 million 495 NEXT project between Virginia and Transurban, private partner and operator of the existing I-95, I-395 and I-495 Express Lanes. Construction began in March 2022. Final completion is expected to occur mid-2026.
Beginning Wednesday at noon, the Virginia Department of Transportation will suspend many highway work zones and lift temporary lane closures on interstates and other major roadways statewide until noon on Dec. 1. The transportation agency said motorists may encounter semi-permanent work zones. 
Travelers can check VDOT’s list of travel advisories for notices around the commonwealth.
Express-lane directionality on Interstates 95 and 395 will be adjusted for holiday traffic, providing a cost benefit for motorists. On Thanksgiving, the lanes will operate southbound all day.
Drivers with three or more people in the car and an E-ZPass Flex set to “HOV ON” can ride for free. 
Travelers who need to cross bodies of water between the Hampton Roads Peninsula and Southside during construction of the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel Expansion Project are encouraged to use alternate routes such as the I-664 Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel, the Route 17 James River Bridge, the free Jamestown-Scotland Ferry or I-95 to minimize potential delays.
Motorists using Route 17’s George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge should expect delays between 45 and 60 minutes due to mechanical issues. No work requiring lane closures will be conducted at any of the water crossings during the Thanksgiving holiday.

(Photo by Getty Images)On Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, George Washington woke early. Assisted by his enslaved valets – William “Billy” Lee and the young Christopher Sheels – he powdered his hair, put on his favorite black velvet suit, tied his white neckwear and donned his yellow gloves.
Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.
He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
 Devotion in the service of unity

It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The firsttook place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621 – Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving – which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-General Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November – it became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.

Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”
The president had prepared for the occasion. He also contributed a sizable sum of his own money to buy beer and food for prisoners confined for debt in the New York City jail. The donation was deemed to be a magnanimous and moving gesture, suitable to the spirit of the holiday. A week later, in an advertisement in the Dec. 3 issue of the New York Journal, those very prisoners returned their “grateful thanks” to their president “for his very acceptable donation on Thursday last.”
Washington’s first Thanksgiving as a president may have not been tremendously successful, given the scarce attendance at the church service.
Yet, as a scholar writing a biography about Washington, I believe it was an important step in his much larger political plan to bring the executive branch to the people’s doorstep.
What Washington wanted was a virtuous kind of populism in the new country he led. Washington’s populism wasn’t about inciting an angry mob; it was about sharing in their rituals, worshiping their God, speaking their own language. And he did so in the sole interest of the American people.
Thanksgiving 1789, for Washington, was at once religious and more than religious. Washington’s proclamation invoked devotional language, literally. The upcoming festivity, in his words, could “be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”
But Washington’s main concern was political. The nation was recently formed, and he feared that it could easily collapse. Its many internal divisions and separate interests could be lethal. Consequently, the president wanted this holiday to be a civic celebration in which “we may then all unite.”


Washington’s proclamation was printed in newspapers throughout the country. George Washington’s Mt. Vernon
 ‘Pardon our national…transgressions’

As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws. Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.
He was a slave owner, a relentless pursuer of African American fugitives and a destroyer of Native American villages. He was also a warrior who deployed brutality against enemies. He was a commander who resorted to corporal punishment with his own soldiers. Washington believed that he was not a saint to be mindlessly imitated. This made him humble in his duties.
More importantly, Washington also grasped the power of his symbolic position as president. He sought to leverage that for the good of the nation.
As president, Washington could not advertise his actions effectively via Twitter and social media. He had to show himself around constantly, no matter the weather. He had to painstakingly attend balls, plays, dinners, public receptions and of course the church. Every occasion, every Thanksgiving counted.
Through his outings, Washington met with a diversity of people, including those who were second-class citizens or were not citizens at all. Women, for example, greeted Washington at nearly every stop of the extended presidential trips he took between 1789 and 1791. Textile workers in New England, Jewish leaders in Newport, many enslaved persons in the South and churchgoers everywhere did the same.
These women and men, in bondage or free, believers or skeptics, played a part in the invention of a new political theater. Maybe, it was just a theatrical illusion. But these individuals – just like the prisoners in the New York City jail – thanked President Washington because they felt they were voices in a larger political culture.
Washington made sure his Thanksgiving message – not simply a message, but a “proclamation” – sounded clear and strong: May God “render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed.”

The center is trying to get a handle on industry-wide financial issues. (Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin)At first glance, The Growing Years Early Childhood Center in Manchester doesn’t look like it’s financially struggling. The parking lot is full, and the hallways are loud with the sounds of infants and playing toddlers. But the main hall leads to an empty classroom because Kitty Larochelle, the center’s executive director, can’t afford what’s necessary to reopen it. 
“That could fit up to 14 toddlers,” Larochelle said. “We would need four teachers for that classroom, and right now that’s just not feasible.” 
Despite being at capacity and having a waitlist, The Growing Years and other early childhood education centers in New Hampshire are struggling to stay afloat. Even centers in the state’s more populated areas are finding it difficult to make ends meet.
Centers barely, if at all, break even because they cannot charge “the true cost of care” without raising already-expensive tuition. The most recent data shows that the average annual price for an infant in center-based child care was $17,250, and the average price for an infant and a 4-year-old was $31,868 in 2023, according to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute. 
Meanwhile, low salaries for child care workers have contributed to a workforce shortage and exacerbated capacity issues as a result. According to Larochelle, it is a “balancing act” for her and other center directors to get a handle on the challenges, as everything goes hand in hand.  
“We have to be highly, highly aware that most of our income comes from our families, so we can’t overcharge our families and feel good about that,” said Larochelle. “But at the same time, we’re trying to get our staff wages to a reasonable amount so that we maintain our workers.” 
Expensive expenses
Nearly everything that goes into running a child care facility carries a high price tag. 
“We’re broke all the time,” said Marianne Barter, executive director of Merrimack Valley Day Care Service, a nonprofit in Concord and Boscawen that prioritizes care for children at risk of abuse and neglect.  
Salaries and benefits are the biggest expense of most centers, Barter said. Additionally, providing healthy food and diapers, paying the mortgage or rent on their five locations, utilities, and building maintenance contribute to tight finances. 
“I have horrible buildings,” Barter said, including one that experienced heating and plumbing issues in late October. “Many child care facilities are in buildings that were not intended to be child care facilities. … [It] is a constant nightmare.”
Additionally, businesses must have insurance and keep up with state child care licensing standards, both of which providers say are expensive. Centers struggle to find affordable liability insurance because agencies offer it sparingly, and those who do can charge high premiums due to the risk.  
Barter almost had to close her center’s doors when her former insurance agency stopped offering child care insurance, but ended up securing a policy from a different insurer.
“You’d be out of your mind not to have liability insurance,” Barter said. In New Hampshire, child care businesses are only required to have workers’ compensation insurance. “Kids get hurt all the time. You could get sued at any time. These are other people’s children. This is the most important thing in someone’s life and they’re entrusting it with you every single day. The risk involved with that is incredible.” 
There is a financial difference between nonprofit and for-profit centers, but both Barter and Larochelle said it is small and comes down to taxes and grant eligibility. Across the industry, employers are managing employees who are struggling to pay rent, fix their cars, and care for their own children. 
“I assume it’s on average with everyone else,” Barter said about how running a nonprofit early education center is different. “Even if we’re doing a little bit better, it’s like being the skinniest kid at fat camp. Nothing glorious about it.”
The Growing Years raised tuition for the first time in two years this year to try to combat their financial challenges. Larochelle said it is “extremely difficult” to balance her budget. 
“Even though we are a for-profit center, I can tell you it’s like for very little profit, because we are taking care of our staff the best that we can and are still being mindful of the families we serve,” she said. 
Workforce shortage ripples
For the past decade, the child care industry has experienced high employee turnover, and businesses are struggling to recruit workers due to low wages. According to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, the median yearly salary of child care workers is $32,490, less than that of preschool teachers, kindergarten teachers, and almost all other occupations in the state. 
A bachelor’s degree, an associate’s degree, or a certificate in the field is required for early childhood education providers. People with degrees can make more at a pre-school than at an early learning center, which draws them away from the field. 
“There’s not a lot of people who want to enter the field making $15 an hour,” said Shannon Tremblay, director of New Hampshire’s legislatively enacted Child Care Advisory Committee. 
The inability to pay employees properly is a personal burden for child care directors. When asked about it, Larochelle could not put it into words. Barter said said she wasn’t sure she could describe it.
“The fact that I cannot pay these incredible people what they are worth is just constant frustration,” she said. “As a person who runs this agency, it feels awful when I know one of my staff is struggling. God, I hate that and my board hates it, too.” 
As a result, businesses lack a sufficient number of employees to maintain the legally required child-to-adult ratios, resulting in a capacity shortage. There are more children needing care than spots available, even if a business has the classroom space in its building. Without the staff, those classrooms stay closed. 
“They may have one or two classrooms that they’re not filling and they can’t fill them because they don’t have staff,” Tremblay said. “They could fill it with their wait list, probably threefold, but they can’t bring in those kiddos because they don’t have the staff.” 
The empty classroom at The Growing Years has been that way since the COVID-19 pandemic. Larochelle said that hiring new employees is a “gamble” because if they quit, families could risk having care stripped away. 
“We don’t want to open up a classroom and then find out that employees don’t stay more than two months because that puts in jeopardy care for 14 families,” she said. “We want to make sure that we have a solid base and that we can provide care on a daily basis, and even if someone calls out that we have someone who can fill in and we can still meet our ratios.” 
To address staffing issues, Larochelle said she tries to “cultivate” her own staff by hiring and mentoring interested people at the center while they earn their degree or certification in early childhood education. She said it’s necessary because “early childhood education is not really promoted as a sustainable income to live off of.” 
For veteran providers, Larochelle has tried to increase the incentives. Providers have a half-day off each week, leaving by noon. In the past, the center has held fundraisers for families and employees to help during difficult times. Larochelle said the center’s owner has helped with household expenses, such as new car tires.
“We care for our staff as if they were family. We support each other, we’re always checking in,” she said. “It’s an extremely difficult and challenging job if done right,” said Larochelle. “Those who don’t care don’t stay in the field.”
State investment is low but growing
The state offers the Child Care Scholarship Program, but it helps families, not businesses. The CCSP reduces the cost of child care for eligible families by providing direct payments to qualified providers. 
While the program is great for easing a family’s access to early education for their children, Barter said it does not help businesses, since the state is not paying them the actual cost of care, just the average. 
“We do not collect a cost share, we just bill the state and this is a gap,” Barter said. “From an affordability standpoint, when the state moves over to a cost-of-care model instead of a market rate model, that’s going to be hugely impactful for child care centers, because it’s going to mean that the rate they pay for scholarship students is going to be based on the actual cost, not just the average of what we all charge, which is never enough.”
The Department of Health and Human Services has made child care a priority for the biennium, but has also left $15 million in funding for child care employers in limbo by trying to fund it with federal dollars. 
In the 2026 legislative session, legislation is proposed to give businesses a tax credit for expanding child care, to use state funds for $15 million in child care for employers, and to ease municipal zoning requirements that are making it hard for new businesses to open. However, there is also legislation to repeal the state’s $15 million allocation to child care employers. 
“When we don’t show up, there’s an awful lot of people who do not show up for work. That on its own should have more value than it does in this state,” Barter said. “For every person I hire, eight other people get to go to work. I can’t think of any other job that’s like that.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/growingyearsbiz-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 05:56:18.786224

One of the main debates at the Ohio Statehouse this year has revolved around how to fix and reduce the skyrocketing property tax burdens.
“People are suffering, they’re losing their homes,” Lakewood resident Beth Blackmarr said.
But the legislature has to remember they need to support public schools, Parma Schools Superintendent Dr. Scott J. Hunt said.
“We continue to need operating dollars,” Hunt said.
Lawmakers passed four bills that Republicans say deal with the first issue, providing help for taxpayers.
“These are very, very important reform bills that are really the most consequential in almost half a century,” state Rep. David Thomas (R-Jefferson) said.
House Bills 186 and 335 limit how much money school districts can get from rising home values — tying tax increases to inflation. These bills passed both chambers in a bipartisan fashion.
H.B. 309 allows county budget commissions to reduce property tax levies. It mainly passed along party lines, but a few Democrats joined the Republicans to pass it, while several members of the GOP voted no.
H.B. 129 implements a check on tax increases from school levies. In the House, it passed overwhelmingly, but in the Senate, all Democrats and state Sen. Bill Blessing (R-Colerain Township) voted no.
“We will no longer have huge increases in people’s property tax bills if they did not vote for that,” Thomas said.
Schools have been arguing for months now that these bills take away much-needed dollars for kids, when they are already facing cuts from the state in expected funding.
“We’ll talk about [cutting] staffing, which impacts what programs we might consider to remain here at Parma and those that we might not be able to support,” Hunt told me. “Certainly, those things impact the quality of education we can provide for our students.”
The district will need to dramatically reduce its services if its levies continue to fail, he added.
“Everything will be on the table: transportation, potentially participation fees, we’ll be looking at our buildings,” Hunt said.
But Lakewood homeowner Beth Blackmarr, who is fighting to abolish property taxes altogether, said she doesn’t want to hurt the schools. Lawmakers aren’t doing enough to actually provide relief, she said.
“They knew they were supposed to do something,” Blackmarr said. “They ignored it in favor of pet projects like the Browns stadium.”
Instead of spending months focusing on how to use unclaimed funds to move the Browns to Brook Park, she said, affordability should have been the legislature’s focus.
Thomas said it has been his priority, and he plans to continue that.
“It is not enough,” Thomas said. “We need to do much more.”
It’s unclear how much money this legislation would actually save taxpayers like Blackmarr. But she said one thing is clear — these bills needed to pass years ago to actually impact her bills.
“This is a huge problem, and, by the way, a problem of the legislation’s own making,” Blackmarr said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-26 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT begins broader debate over vanishing federal funds,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/26/ct-begins-broader-debate-over-vanishing-federal-funds/,State leaders now must decide whether CT should indefinitely dedicate millions to reverse gaps created by retreating federal funding.,"State officials recently reserved $500 million, on paper, to bolster federal human service programs for roughly two months.
But this emergency funding really represents the start of a much broader debate.
Gov. Ned Lamont and the Democratic-controlled General Assembly now must decide whether Connecticut should indefinitely dedicate state dollars — potentially for several years — to reverse new gaps in health care, nutrition, and energy and housing assistance created by retreating federal funding.
“The need to be looking holistically, long-term, at these things is important,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, told the Connecticut Mirror this week.
“We don’t know how dire the [federal funding] crisis will be,” said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, who noted Connecticut could be dealing with a devolving federal funding situation for an array of core programs for years to come. “Are we really going to go over a cliff?”
At the bottom of that potential cliff are more than 140,000 enrollees in Access Health CT, the state’s health insurance exchange, who stand to lose federal subsidies that cover all or a portion of their premium costs. The New York Times reported this week that President Donald Trump is weighing a possible extension of those benefits but hasn’t reached a decision yet.
Also at risk are an estimated 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness who are at risk of losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits between Dec. 1 and March 31 because of new work requirements and other rules changes.
Both stem not from the 43-day federal government shutdown, which ran from Oct. 1 through mid-November, but rather from ongoing cutbacks ordered in July by the Republican-led Congress and Trump.
Most of the federal funding cuts in that bill, particularly those centered on Medicaid, don’t take effect until 2027 or 2028.
But there are others, besides nutrition assistance and health insurance subsidies, that will be felt sooner.
Since federal funding for the thousands of Connecticut students who receive free and reduced price school meals is determined partly by SNAP caseloads, school districts could be facing reductions there.
And to help pay for federal tax cuts also enacted as part of that omnibus July measure, the Trump administration has recommended cuts in 2026 to some forms of affordable housing assistance for many more.
So, while state officials agreed to use $500 million from last fiscal year’s surplus to potentially mitigate federal cutbacks in human service programs between now and Feb. 4, when the regular 2026 General Assembly session starts, the populations at risk now still could be in jeopardy two months from now and likely long after, absent state intervention.
“What’s more, excessive tariffs have made life more unaffordable — from groceries to housing to holiday gift-giving,” said Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children. “Connecticut must be vigilant and proactive so that our residents are protected.”
Lamont, who has sole authority to propose disbursements from the $500 million response fund this winter, already has begun talks with legislative leaders on how to use that money.
The governor, a fiscally moderate Democrat, traditionally been wary of using state funds to supplement programs normally funded by the federal government.
But Lamont also said last week that “we’re going to take care of people in need.”
When asked earlier this month whether he would support a state-funded SNAP benefit to protect the 36,000 recipients affected by recent federal rules changes, the governor was open but noncommittal, saying only “we’re looking at that.”
He also said his administration is working with state Comptroller Sean Scanlon to develop a new option to help residents and small businesses buy affordable health insurance. The governor last week tapped Scanlon’s chief health policy aide, Josh Wojcik, to become the administration’s new budget director.
But regardless of whether Lamont dedicates portions of the $500 million reserve to bolster weakened federal human service programs this winter, legislative leaders say they expect many Democratic state legislators next year will want to commit state funds on an ongoing basis toward this social safety net.
“This is just not a normal situation,” Ritter said, predicting Connecticut and many other states may spend the next few years deciding what degree of federal cutbacks are intolerable. And if so, Ritter added, states also must decide how much of their own funds they can afford to spend to improve the situation.
But while Lamont and top state lawmakers also say Connecticut never can afford to reverse all federal cutbacks, they also note it has more options financially than do most other states.
With more than $4.3 billion in its rainy day fund, equal to 18% of the annual General Fund, Connecticut has one of the larger budget reserves in the nation.
And unlike most other states, Connecticut also has a complex series of budget caps that force large annual surpluses.
Surpluses here since 2017 have averaged more than $1.8 billion per year, about 8% to 9% of the General Fund. Connecticut has used those dollars to build reserves and whittle down its considerable pension debt.
And if Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly seek to bolster federal human service programs by scaling back those surpluses somewhat, they could face strong opposition from minority Republicans.
GOP leaders during the federal government shutdown last month, when state aid from Washington was stalled temporarily, endorsed using $500 million from last fiscal year’s state budget surplus to prop up federal nutrition and heating assistance programs.
But if Connecticut is going to launch new state spending, year after year, to replace vanishing dollars from Washington, it shouldn’t come at the expense of local efforts to pay down pension debt, Republicans say.
Connecticut entered this fiscal year with $33.5 billion in unfunded pension obligations, a burden created by more than seven decades of improper savings prior to 2011, and still carries one of the highest debt levels in this category nationwide.
If Connecticut is going to start providing nutrition benefits, heating assistance or health care subsidies on an ongoing basis, said state Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, then officials here should pay for them through matching spending cuts elsewhere in the state budget.
“We always need to make sure everyone is fed and everyone’s home is heated,” he said. But “it’s about prioritization.”
Harding added that “it’s a very dangerous precedent to set if we basically say we as a state government are going to address every single cut that comes our way from the federal government.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_6004.jpg,,,2025-11-26 05:56:18.786224

States have gotten creative in trying to lower patients’ prescription drug copays by targeting different parts of the drug supply chain. (Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)Fruth Pharmacy, a small chain that once had more than 20 stores in southeastern Ohio and nearby towns in West Virginia and Kentucky, has announced that it is closing and selling its prescriptions to Walgreens next month.
Given Walgreens’ own financial woes, the news could add to the growing problem with pharmacy deserts in rural areas of both states. 
Lynne Fruth, president of the 73-year-old chain, has been a vocal critic of pharmacy middlemen owned by giant health conglomerates. Each is among the 15 largest corporations in the United States, and together, their middlemen control nearly 80% of prescription drug transactions.
The middlemen are called pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs. Their owners — CVS Health, UnitedHealth and Cigna-Express Scripts — have pharmacy operations of their own, and their middlemen determine how much to reimburse their competitors and affiliated pharmacies for the drugs they dispense.
That’s an obvious conflict, Fruth has maintained.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“By reimbursing pharmacies less money than a medication costs, PBMs have caused the closure of thousands of pharmacies across America,” Fruth said in a written statement that was reported by WCHS in Charleston. “The continued closings of pharmacies must be a wake up call for lawmakers to hold PBMs accountable before all pharmacies disappear.”
Andy Becker, the chain’s CEO, said that it’s been under stress from PBMs for years, but a cyberattack against a company owned by one of the conglomerates was the proximate cause of the demise of Fruth Pharmacy.
Change Healthcare, which is owned by UnitedHeath Group, handles payment and prescription processing for thousands of pharmacies. It was the victim of a ransomware attack in early 2024.
It meant that Fruth couldn’t fill any prescriptions for six days. Then it couldn’t fill electronic prescriptions for another week.
“That’s 90% of our new prescriptions that were coming in,” Becker said in an interview. “Then for another eight to 10 days, our controlled substance prescriptions weren’t coming in. We couldn’t win. If I can’t fill your prescription, you’re going to Walmart or wherever. And once somebody moves somewhere else, they’re not coming back until they get mad at Walmart or Walgreens or wherever they move. In that three or four-week period, we lost 15% of our customers.”
The Fruth closing comes after 223 other Ohio pharmacies shut their doors last year, according to the Ohio Board of Pharmacy. The number still in operation dropped below 2,000 for the first time in memory.
In addition to small chains and independent pharmacies going out of business, Rite Aid declared two bankruptcies and closed all its stores — including hundreds in Ohio and Michigan.
Pharmacy closures can be particularly hard on the poor and elderly in small communities such as Wellston, Ohio, where a Fruth store closed earlier this year. If customers’ prescriptions are transferred to the Walgreens in Jackson, that means they have to find a way to travel 10 miles each way. That”s not an easy task if you can’t drive or if you lack reliable transportation.
For many such customers, a pharmacist can be the only medical professional to whom they have ready access. A pharmacist can help them manage chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension.
Fruth is transferring prescriptions to Walgreens, which has faced troubles of its own. In March, the pharmacy chain announced that it was selling itself to Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm. Such businesses are known for aggressively cutting what they see as underperforming assets.
Unlike CVS, Walgreens doesn’t own a PBM. Such middlemen decide which drugs are covered by insurance, and they negotiate huge, non-transparent rebates in exchange for putting drugmakers’ products on their formularies. That’s a mechanism that pushes up list prices of drugs, according to the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Center.
The conglomerates that own the big-three PBMs also own top-10 insurance companies. 
In addition, CVS owns the largest retail chain. And it, UnitedHealth and Cigna-Express Scripts own mail-order and specialty pharmacies as well. Their PBMs decide how much to reimburse their own pharmacies and those of their competitors — raising suspicions that they favor their affiliated stores.
In January, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report accusing the big PBMs of wild price hikes and possibly steering patients away from competing pharmacies.
But the term expired of the FTC chair who led the effort. Then President Donald Trump tried to remove two Democratic appointees who also supported scrutinizing PBMs.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Though still in high school, Katya Fromuth has long been involved in activism for various causes, including speaking at the No Kings protest in Portland this fall.
That was where Maine Morning Star first met the 17-year-old Yarmouth High School senior, as she weaved through the crowd handing out flyers about her youth organization that is now scheduled to have its first meeting in December. 
“Members of my generation want the ability to shape our future,” Fromuth said in an interview this month. “It’s really important to bring them together and give them hope, get them aware, get them angry, but also say, ‘Hey, we’re in this together, and we’re going to be in this together until we get the job done.’” 
Since Donald Trump was reelected, she’s been joining actions, such as those organized by her local chapter of Indivisible, a progressive organization initiated as a reaction to Trump’s first presidency. And, while she respects the work being done, when she looks around at those leading it, she sees people twice her age. 
So she decided to start The Franklin Project — named after U.S. Constitution drafter Benjamin Franklin — a network of 16 to 35-year-old Mainers united to fight authoritarianism through non-violent protests and canvassing. 
“It’s our future,” Framuth said of her and the handful of other young Mainers who have joined her effort so far. 
Framuth intends to shape that future using two distinct methods: demonstrations and one-on-one conversations. 
The project will have a human rights rapid-response team that works with local groups to stage protests, such as immigrant advocacy organizations to respond when someone in the community is mistreated by federal immigration authorities. But these won’t be typical protests with signs and chants, she said. 
While the group will eventually come up with its methods together, Framuth said she’s inspired by groups that push for change through financial pressure. One example is recent protests against Elon Musk’s role in the Trump administration through boycotts of his company Tesla and demonstrations in showrooms. The company’s stock has since plunged. 
Closer to home, Framuth is inspired by the tactics used by the group that organized against the Wells Police Department’s contract with federal immigration authorities, specifically sun-up to sun-down protests, which she thinks show determination. The police department ended its contract in October after months of objections through local protests and comments at select board meetings. 
The Franklin Project will also organize what Framuth calls the citizen’s canvass, which will involve its members knocking on doors in their communities to speak with their neighbors about their broad concerns with what’s happening to American democracy, rather than a specific issue or candidate. 
“In most cases, I’m sure they will say ‘no’ at the start,” Framuth said, “and then we will just recalibrate and figure out, ‘OK, what are the ways in which we can communicate better?’” 
When Trump began his second term in January, Framuth had been taking classes abroad through the School for Ethics and Global Leadership, a semester-long residential program for high school juniors focused on ethical thinking skills and leadership development. 
She was placed in an apartment with people of various political ideologies, as the school selects a diverse cross section of students from across the U.S. to attend, and she said that experience taught her that everyone has more in common than they think. 
“These people, who before that program I thought gotta be somewhat out of their mind, turned out to be very good friends of mine,” Framuth said. “We worked through a lot of our political differences — we are still working through those differences.” 
She’s now hoping to scale up her own personal experience through the citizen’s canvass, which she sees as an antidote to authoritarianism.  
“That’s one of the ways that an authoritarian government succeeds, is when it really divides the population,” Framuth said. “If you want to prove them wrong, then say, ‘Hey, you actually can’t divide us.’” 
The first meeting of The Franklin Project will occur at 6 p.m. on Dec. 7 in Portland at a location to be determined.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Katya_no-kings-portland-2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-26 04:57:20.259765

Ohio has 24 counties without an OB-GYN, including two that border Union County — Champaign and Hardin, according to the nonpartisan nonprofit KFF, an independent source of research and information on national health issues. The data they used was from 2021.
The 24 counties without an OB-GYN according to KFF are: Adams County, Athens County, Belmont County, Carroll County, Champaign County, Fayette County, Fulton County, Hardin County, Harrison County, Hocking County, Jackson County, Meigs County, Monroe County, Morgan County, Morrow County, Noble County, Ottawa County, Paulding County, Perry County, Pike County, Putnam County, Shelby County, Vinton County, and Wyandot County. 
“We do have patients that travel 30 plus minutes from Champaign County, they either travel to us or they travel to Springfield,” Martter said, who has been an OB-GYN in Marysville for 16 years. “There’s also Hardin County, which is a maternity care desert. I have patients that travel from Kenton to see me, which is probably 45-ish minutes.”
Patients might have to take time off work to get to their appointments or might need to get a babysitter to watch their other children. A lot of times patients driving farther distances have to rely on back roads, Martter said.
“There’s no freeway,” she said. “We’re hoping that the roads are safe to travel on, that there hasn’t been an accident that puts them behind even more trying to get back to their job or their children. It does really impact them and their availability to come to us.”
Critical situations can happen during delivery. 
“You need to get to a hospital in a pretty short span of time in order to have the baby and mom still be viable, still actually surviving and being not just the baby living in the NICU,” said Maya Dunson, a second-year medical student at Ohio State University.
Those long distances can sometimes prohibit patients from getting prenatal care.
“I have a lot of patients that share a car with their partner, and they can’t always drive the 30 to 45 minutes or afford the gas money to come see us for adequate prenatal care, which obviously affects not only the mom, but the baby at that point,” Martter said. 
Despite the challenges, she enjoys practicing in a smaller town. 
“There’s something to be said about a small town … and knowing that when you go to the grocery store, you’re going to potentially see multiple patients that you’ve delivered,” she said. “I take care of entire generations of families.”
Nationally, there were 38 practicing OB-GYNs per 100,000 women in the United States and nearly half of the nation’s counties had no OB-GYNs in 2021-22, according to KFF’s data. Nearly 80% of rural counties had no OB-GYNs, according to KFF. 
“The biggest issue is obviously access,” said Ohio state Rep. Anita Somani, D-Dublin. “What happens is people don’t get care.”
Telehealth appointments increased in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the lack of bandwidth in rural areas can get in the way of telehealth appointments.
“They have dial up and so you can’t really have adequate visits with them,” Martter said.
Ohio has 13 counties that are maternity care deserts — meaning they lack hospitals with obstetric care, birth centers and obstetric providers like OB-GYNs, according to the March of Dimes.
“If you’re in one of those areas, you’re traveling anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes to get care,” said Somani, who has been an OB-GYN for more than 30 years and works in Columbus. “It’s going to take a long time to rebuild and improve maternity deserts.”
The 13 counties that are maternity care deserts are Belmont County, Carroll County, Champaign County, Fayette County, Hardin County, Jackson County, Meigs County, Monroe County, Morrow County, Noble County, Perry County, Putnam County, and Vinton County. 
“The situation is only getting worse,” said Maya Neidhart, a second-year medical student at Ohio State. “There are still patients in those areas that need access to prenatal care. … Minutes do make the difference.”
Neidhart is from Meigs County and hopes to return to southeast Ohio after graduating to practice as an OB-GYN.
“It has always been my goal to be able to return to the community I’m from and serve it, but it really just depends on if I feel safe to practice in the state,” Neidhart said. “Not having access to abortion care also leads to poor maternal mortality outcomes when people terminate pregnancies in unsafe ways.”
Abortion is legal in Ohio up until 22 weeks of pregnancy. Ohio voters passed a ballot measure in 2023 that added protections to abortion care and reproductive rights to the state’s constitution.
Ohio has six surgical abortion clinics located in Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Bedford Heights, Cuyahoga Falls, and Dayton. Toledo’s abortion clinic switched to just a medication abortion facility in 2019.
The state had 45 abortion clinics in 1992, Somani said. 
“There’s been just a huge decrease in a lot of those clinics,” Somani said. “The bigger problem is, when you restrict abortion, you can’t train the next generation to be able to do the care that they need to.”
Dunson and Neidhart are both members of Medical Students for Choice, an international advocacy organization focused on educating medical students about reproductive health care, including abortion. They have more than 300 chapters on medical school campuses. 
“Med Students for Choice is there to make sure that medical students get the training that they need to become abortion care providers,” Neidhart said. (Abortion is) part of full spectrum obstetric and gynecology care, so it’s absolutely something that it is health care, and it’s needs to be part of the conversation when we’re talking about access to reproductive health care.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)In June 2024, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump charged on his social media platform that “much of Higher Education has lost its way, and is now corrupting our Youth and Society with, SOCIALIST, and ANTI-AMERICAN Ideology.” He vowed to remove such “wokeness” from U.S. education.
Trump has primarily targeted elite private universities in his attacks on higher education, but Kansas state universities may not escape collateral damage. For example, Kansas State University, not known to be a hotbed of “socialist and anti-American ideology,” has taken on more than its fair share of flak.
A bit of history is in order.
Upon his first day in office this past January, Trump took his first stab at terminating “wokeness” in education. He declared by executive order that the words “diversity, equity, and inclusion” were “illegal and immoral” in their application throughout the federal government, including in grants and contracts with colleges and universities. He ordered the threatening words and related practices to be banned.
A few weeks later, the national office of Young America’s Foundation filed a detailed civil rights complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, asserting: “On behalf of our YAF members at Kansas State University and all truth-seeking students on that campus, YAF requests that you open a formal investigation into Kansas State for its promotion of DEI, racialism, and gender ideology in violation of the First Amendment, civil rights laws, and President Trump’s executive orders.”
YAF, likely an organization most Kansans have never heard of, promotes itself as “the leading organization for young conservatives” and has an active chapter on the K-State campus.
In the meantime, Kansas Republican state lawmakers were considering how Trump’s demands could be applied to higher education in Kansas. They finally settled on attaching a directive to an omnibus appropriation bill with financial penalties for state universities that failed to:

Eliminate any positions that relate to DEI.
Eliminate any mandates, policies, programs, preferences and activities relating to DEI.
Eliminate any training requirements in DEI for any employee.
Cancel any state grants or contracts relating to DEI.

For good measure, state lawmakers also outlawed gender-identifying pronouns or gender ideology in email signature blocks on state email accounts and any other form of communication.
The Kansas Board of Regents provided guidance to state universities on the matter, and the universities, including K-State, dutifully complied. The forbidden words were scrubbed from their websites, program descriptions, and personnel. In some cases, potentially offending units were eliminated or consolidated, or rebranded to avoid being a target.
For the conservative students at K-State, this cleansing had not gone far enough. The K-State chapter of YAF claimed the university’s actions were a “shell game,” and there was “much work to do.”
Then, in early September, former Gov. Jeff Colyer, now a gubernatorial candidate, saw an opportunity to score political points with Trump’s MAGA base by calling for the firing of a “far-left extremist” on K-State’s staff. Colyer issued a formal campaign statement, asserting: “Kansas State University has made a serious mistake hiring far-left extremist Derron Borders into its Office of Civil Rights.” According to press reports, K-State suspended Borders.
Next, days after the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Colyer found another opportunity to target K-State. He posted on social media a video in which Kirk called out K-State as “the worst” university in the country for infringing his free speech. The video reminded followers of an incident one year earlier in which university officials had cut Kirk’s microphone during his “You’re Being Brainwashed Tour” to the campus. In fact, Kirk had arrived late and spoke for an hour but had exceeded university time limits for blasting loud speakers in the student plaza during class time.
Colyer promised that if he were elected governor, students at state universities would be protected from “woke overlords” that seek to silence them.
Then, a couple weeks ago, state Senate Majority Leader Chase Blasi claimed that state lawmakers were hearing complaints from parents of K-State students. According to Blasi, “some of the universities are rebranding these programs to do the same things that the Legislature has explicitly prohibited.” State lawmakers are now investigating course syllabi in selected academic units at K-State and other universities.
Does the banning of forbidden words mean that our state universities will now be committed to becoming less diverse, less equitable, and less inclusive? I doubt that. I doubt further that most Kansans want state universities characterized by homogeneity, inequity, and exclusiveness. Our state universities have long histories as powerful equalizing forces in American life, and I expect that to continue.
With experience as a student, alum, faculty member, and administrator at three state universities in Kansas over a period of 50 years, I do not believe one would find much “wokeness” in our state universities. Nor are those universities corrupting students with socialism, nor with anti-American ideas, nor with left-wing or right-wing ideologies.
K-State’s experience this past year provides a cautionary tale for all state universities in this Trump era. I forewarn my faculty colleagues that they are ripe targets for agents near and far if they wander outside their respective disciplines into this political quagmire. University officials should remain agile, diffuse incidents that arise, and protect their faculty and staff. And the Kansas Board of Regents should continue its strong defense of academic freedom.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)Every Thanksgiving there is a brief (underscored) kumbaya moment in my household before everyone digs into the traditional spread. We join hands to acknowledge the benevolence and beseech the blessings of the Almighty. 
In recent years, I started tacking on an addendum to our prayer, a petition for divine intervention to save the country we love. 
Sure, my one-more-thing entreaty has irked some in the motley crew gathered, but it has become ever more pertinent as America stares into the abyss. 
Even the most apathetic among us know something is deeply wrong in the nation we pledge allegiance to from an early age. 
People are noticeably on edge, worried, broke. 
Sticker shock at the grocery store has blown a gaping hole in monthly budgets. Rent increases are ridiculous. Electric bills have spiked. 
Paychecks do not keep up with inflation. Wages are down for Ohio’s most common occupations.  
It is impossible for many to get ahead in a state that ranks 18th in the country for financial hardship. 
To make things worse, Trump’s erratic tariffs are raising prices for Ohio consumers and businesses. 
Commerce has slowed. The labor market has softened. Company layoffs surged to a two-decade high in October across the country. 
Pessimism is only growing about the state of the economy. Agriculture, Ohio’s largest industry, has been bankrupted by the trade war Trump started. 
It has left Ohio farmers, who depend on foreign market demand, in the red.  
The promised “golden age” from the convicted felon rings hollow for family farms going under. 
It also rings hollow for low-income MAGA faithful left adrift with shredded safety nets after food stamp and Medicaid funding was slashed by hundreds of billions to offset trillions in Trump tax cuts to the ultra-rich.

Working class Trump supporters, who augment their meager take-home pay with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to buy groceries, got a rude awakening recently when their hero callously let SNAP benefits lapse for the first time in the program’s history. 
Food aid for the poorest Ohioans was delayed in the longest government shutdown on the books while the Republican-controlled U.S. House left town, the Republican-controlled  Senate killed time, and the Republican president preoccupied himself with destroying the East Wing of the White House to build a glitzy ballroom as families went hungry. 
Trump fixated on his marble remake of the bathroom off the Lincoln bedroom as more than half a million Ohioans feared being priced out of affordable health insurance if cost-saving subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans were not extended. 
But Trump wants to scrap Obamacare altogether and Republican majorities in Congress prefer padding the portfolios of the wealthy to helping constituents who could lose health coverage when the ACA subsidies expire at the end of December. 
Meanwhile, when the convicted felon isn’t consumed with garish vanity projects and pocketing $1.8 billion in cash and gifts since his 2024 reelection, he is bent on militarizing U.S. cities with boots on the ground. 
Ohio National Guard troops, deployed on nebulous grounds to Washington D.C. in August by a spineless governor, have (inexplicably) had their landscaping and trash removal deployment extended by Mike DeWine until the end of February. 
Simultaneously, Trump is presiding over aide Stephen Miller’s unspeakably cruel (and unconstitutional) campaign to brutally terrorize largely law-abiding undocumented and documented citizens with masked goons operating without constraint (or warrants) as the regime’s secret, unaccountable police on a mission to fill deportation quotas with brown people who speak Spanish.
As a child sex-trafficking scandal involving Trump’s longtime wingman inches closer to the adjudicated sexual abuser dozing behind the Resolute desk, Trump is throwing whatever distraction sticks to the wall. 
He’s siccing the Justice Department on political opponents, calling for the execution of congressional Democrats, conducting extrajudicial killings of alleged drug smugglers with blown up fishing boats in the Caribbean, threatening an unprovoked attack on a sovereign country (Venezuela) with a massive military build-up off its coast, and rewarding Russia for invading Ukraine.
It’s a lot. 
Trump and his sinister Project 2025 architects are moving with all deliberate speed to establish tyrannical rule in America 250 years after Americans fought to the death for freedom from absolute power. 
They fortified themselves with the armor of inalienable rights that were non-negotiable. 
It was a lot. World-changing. But somehow, enough colonists summoned the courage of their convictions to live free and wrested independence from a despotic monarchy. 
They risked much to secure “the Blessings of Liberty” for themselves and their posterity. Until now.
This imperfect union, founded on the intrinsic worth of every human being and rooted in ideals from self-determination to equal protection under the law is hanging by a thread in 2025. 
But somehow, those lucky enough to inherit what past generations died to preserve have summoned the courage to push back, to mass protest, to litigate injustice, to hold power to account, to resign on principle, to decry vindictive prosecutions, sadistic ICE indignities, denied due process, threats against judges, election workers, the press. 
They often risk much to stand up. But their fearlessness inspires others to follow and secure “the Blessings of Liberty” for Americans not yet born. 
At least that’s what I pray for this Thanksgiving and always.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-26 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Academic freedom should extend to UConn graduate assistants,Robert T.F. Downes,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/26/academic-freedom-should-extend-to-uconn-graduate-assistants/,"Graduate assistants following UConn’s values by speaking clearly, honestly, and frankly in class or as a private citizen deserve the same protection as any full professor.","The University of Connecticut, the state’s flagship public university, prides itself on its R1 research status — a status built heavily on the commitments, contributions, and labor of graduate student employees (also known as Graduate Assistants, or ‘GAs’). 
Currently, GAs are fighting to protect academic freedom in their workplace, as the Graduate Employee Union (GEU-UAW) continues bargaining its contract with the university.
In labs and classrooms, graduate student employees teach undergraduates, run experiments, conduct surveys, and generate much of the scholarship credited to UConn. They are not casual “students” on the sidelines living by the motto of “C’s get degrees.” They are employees who keep UConn’s research and teaching enterprise running. As dedicated researchers, curious scholars, and paid employees, GAs perform essential research, writing, and teaching labor that faculty, given other commitments and time constraints, cannot shoulder on their own.
Although UConn’s Graduate School does not yet have its own academic freedom policy, the UConn Law School approved its own Policy on Employee Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression in May 2025. The law school’s academic freedom policy makes clear that protections apply to every law school employee, “without regard to their status” — i.e., tenured or adjunct, student-worker or professor. Indeed, the law school’s policy explicitly extends to student-workers in their capacity as employees. The policy states that, to serve its “mission,” the law school “should not insulate students from ideas because they may find them controversial, offensive, or disagreeable.”
On the basis of this policy alone — one that resembles the very same language proposed by the GEU-UAW, and one that has been approved within the very same university — it makes no sense for the university to deny graduate student employees either the same freedom to teach and discover that it grants to full professors or the same protections that it affords a select group of student-workers in the law school.
In effect, the GEU’s proposed Article XX on academic freedom would write into the existing contract what the law school’s policy — and both the U.S. Constitution and state law — already imply. That is, graduate student researchers and instructors deserve the same freedom in teaching and research as anyone else on campus. Crucially, for graduate student employees, academic freedom is not merely an intellectual value — it is a workplace protection that ensures research and teaching are governed by scholarly judgment rather than managerial preference.
Academic freedom in the classroom and in the law
Academic freedom means that students, professors, instructors, and researchers can pursue and discuss ideas freely and in the open — even controversial ideas. High courts have long held that students enjoy this right. For instance, the U.S. Supreme Court famously ruled in Tinker v. Des Moines (1969) that students may wear anti-war armbands because “[i]t can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”
By the same token, a UConn graduate assistant, professor, or student should be able to investigate or speak up about any relevant topic in class or research. As both John Stuart Mill’s ‘Harm Principle’ and decades of free speech case law make clear, limits on open thought and discussion in a democratic society should kick in only when the speech in question threatens a material disruption to the educational environment, or incites violence and causes direct harm.
What this means in a democracy is that speech, expression, and inquiry cannot be curtailed because they might merely provoke discomfort or disagreement. As Justice Fortas wrote for the Court in Tinker, “Any variation from the majority’s opinion may inspire fear. Any word spoken, in class, in the lunchroom, or on the campus, that deviates from the views of another person may start an argument or cause a disturbance.” Nonetheless, this potential for contention does not constitute grounds for suppression.
We can (and universities have) set reasonable rules, such as requiring classes to end on time or banning in-class interruptions. However, another important point emerges: any restriction must be viewpoint-neutral. In constitutional terms, “time, place, and manner” regulations on political speech must be content-neutral and narrowly tailored. The law school’s policy reflects these constitutional principles, making a public commitment to “protecting the rights [of employees] as provided by law.”
Beyond the U.S. Constitution, the law school’s academic freedom policy notes its compliance with Article 1 Section 4 of the Connecticut Constitution: “Every citizen may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.” It also cites Connecticut General Statute Section 31-51g,[6] which both protects employees from retaliation for exercising their federal and state constitutional rights to free speech. It further notes that its rules comply with articles XIV and XV of UConn’s by-laws, which contain the university’s provisions on “academic freedom for faculty and professional staff” and “the expression of dissent” (as described in the law school’s policy).
Academic freedom: a policy and a principle
The Graduate Employees Union’s proposed Article XX on academic freedom would write into the contract what UConn’s mission already implies: that every scholar can teach, research, and speak freely. The GEUs proposed language states that GAs may “present and discuss all relevant matters in and beyond the classroom” and “speak or write without any censorship, threat, restraint, or discipline by the University” in the performance of their duties. It similarly affirms GAs’ right to openly express themselves on any issue, including university policy or governance.
What does this mean? It means, per the proposed language in Article XX, that graduate instructors could cover any course-relevant topic or pursue any line of research without fear that unpopular conclusions will lead to lost funding. Instead, controversial questions would be fair game for study and debate. Graduate students could write articles, testify in public forums, or post on social media about social or political issues without fear of retaliation by the institution.
In a serious R1, scholars should not worry that open-ended inquiry will jeopardize their degrees or appointments. As Albert Einstein said, “The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence… Never lose a holy curiosity.” Indeed, as one learns from the famous philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, science is supposed to be disruptive, perhaps even revolutionary.
The UConn Law School’s academic freedom policy evidently echoes this sentiment in its commitment that the university “should not insulate students from ideas because they may find them controversial, offensive, or disagreeable.” But it is not enough for these principles to sit on paper. They need clear, enforceable language in our agreements and in our relationships so that existing policies carry real weight in practice.
So where do we go from here? The answer: “shared governance.” This is the answer put forward in a CT Mirror op-ed authored by Political Science Professors Jeffrey Dudas and Jeremy Pressman. Dr. Dudas is the current president of UConn’s American Association of University Professors (AAUP) chapter, while Dr. Pressman serves on the chapter’s executive committee.
GAs are not asking for much in the proposed language of Article XX. They are simply asking to be met and heard in good faith during this bargaining process and in future negotiations. These are not radical demands; they restate the core principles of academic freedom, open discussion, and transparency in public institutions. UConn’s own by-laws, state law, and the First Amendment already underwrite these guarantees. Writing them into the union contract would affirm that UConn genuinely values free inquiry at every level of the university.
Upholding UConn’s public mission
Academic freedom, open debate and discussion, access to information, and spaces for contestation and experimentation are not luxuries. They are the vital organs of higher education, if not of democratic society at large. A public university that disciplines scholars for inconvenient truths or compels instructors to sanitize their syllabi abandons its fundamental commitments to dialogue, learning, and the common good.
UConn’s reputation depends on independence from partisan influence, a willingness to innovate by taking intellectual risks, and a steadfast commitment to truth even when it is uncomfortable. Attempting to polish its image or placate critics through brand management is, as a philosopher might say, a preoccupation with form over substance. Put differently, no amount of messaging, fed hand-to-mouth from consultants to administrators, can ever substitute for the real work of protecting free inquiry, open discussion, and the people who carry them out.
GAs following UConn’s values by speaking clearly, honestly, and frankly in class or as a private citizen deserve the same protection as any full professor. For example, a teaching assistant in an American politics course should not fear discipline for answering a student’s question about gerrymandering, immigration policy, or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to the best of their knowledge and ability. When even one instructor — from a senior professor to a first-year TA — is chilled or pushed out for doing their job, the intellectual life of the entire campus diminishes. And when such pressures accumulate, the prognosis is clear: the fall of academic freedom leads to an intellectual anemia that weakens the entire institution.
If UConn truly values its position as the state’s flagship public research university and its central role in shaping Connecticut’s future professionals and leaders, then it must do more than count publications or measure productivity by the spreadsheet. As Professors Jeffrey Dudas and Jeremy Pressman remind readers, the university must begin listening to the academic departments, faculty, and student-employees, who are “the beating hearts of the UConn community.” That means supporting fair pay, due process, and unequivocal academic freedom for graduate employees. Graduate employees are not asking for perks. They are asking for parity with existing university policy and with the values UConn professes publicly.
At the end of the day, defending academic freedom is defending democracy. UConn must be a marketplace of ideas, not a walled garden for the ivory tower. Granting GAs the protections in Article XX is not a labor concession. It reaffirms, as Justice Oliver Wendall Holmes said, that “the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas.” That is a lesson worth teaching every student.

The Prince George’s County Democratic Central Committee chose Del. Kevin Harris (D-Charles and Prince George’s) on Tuesday night to fill the District 47 Senate seat vacated this month by Michael Jackson, who is now the State Police superintendent.
Tbe Democratic Central Committee in neighboring Charles County also selected Harris last Saturday. The Calvert County Democratic Central Committee is still set to meet Saturday for the seat, which includes parts of all three counties, but with two counties already in Harris’ corner, Calvert cannot change the outcome.
Once a majority of county central committees have decided on a candidate, that one name needs to be forwarded to the governor’s office, according to an Oct. 21 letter from Attorney General’s office that summarized the process.
Of the 26 Prince George’s committee members, 16 chose Harris and the remaining 10 nominated Del. Jeffrie Long Jr. (D-Calvert and Prince George’s). Attorney Jason Fowler of Calvert County received no votes Tuesday.

“We have three great candidates. Greatly appreciate all the people who came out in the rain,” Harris said after the vote. “Always remember we’re still one community … [and] still going to work together as one team, no matter what.”
Harris had two major supporters who spoke on his behalf: Jackson, the former senator, and Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D).
“I know that we need a leader who can be effective in Annapolis, and I know that Del. Harris is that leader,” Braveboy said. “He’s a good person. He’s a great leader, and he knows how to bring people together.”
Tuesday’s more than one-hour public hearing in Prince George’s included a break while the committee checked on whether Fowler’s paperwork had been received on time. It had and he was able to participate.
All three candidates answered eight questions that included opinions on data centers, strategies to help Marylanders who lost their jobs and benefits due to Trump administration policies and how would they balance the needs of a district with three counties that each govern differently. The candidates were interviewed one at a time while the other two were out of the room, so they could not hear each other’s answers.
All three said they would support continued funding for the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan.
In terms of immediate priorities, each candidate offered a different answer.
Fowler, who has experience in tax law, said he would figure out how to decrease a nearly $1.5 billion deficit state lawmakers are expected to face in next year’s budget.

“How do we derive tax revenue, and how do we do it the most efficient way?” he asked. “That’s some experience that I can bring to the table, and I believe that that’s what we need.”
Harris said he would continue to focus on education and economic development. He highlighted his work on the state’s Promise Scholarship, which is for eligible high school graduates, or those who earned a GED, to attend a community college.
“I believe when folks get certifications, they can actually get in the workforce on day one,” he said. “You still go back and finish your degree, or at least you have in some cases, a full-time job [and] be able to support your family and still go to school.”
Long said he would work to unite the entire legislative district, and to secure investment in rapid transit for Southern Maryland. He also said he would work to diversify “our income tax base to ensure that we can give our seniors that break that they so rightfully deserve.”
Once Gov. Wes Moore (D) receives a nominee’s name, he has up to 15 days to officially appoint him to represent District 27 in the state Senate.
With Harris appearing to get the nomination, his District 27A House seat, which represents parts of Prince George’s and Charles counties, would become vacant.  That means the Democratic Central Committees in those counties will need to meet again soon to nominate someone to fill Harris’ District 27A seat.
The General Assembly convenes for next year’s 90-day session Jan. 14.

Brown/Maryland Matters)Baltimore’s new district court building has been open since last month, but a ribbon-cutting Tuesday was for more than just the building – it was to mark its new name, for the first Black woman to ever serve on any bench in the Maryland.
State officials and family members were on hand to rename district courthouse to honor the legacy of the late Judge Mabel Houze Hubbard. John Hubbard, son of the trailblazing judge, said he was “elated” that his mother’s memory and legacy would be honored with the building’s name change.
“She wanted everybody to have a fair chance and to really feel like they were heard,” he said. “I think people really remembered her and she stuck with people because of the way she made them feel … I can understand why people really, really appreciated her.”
The new courthouse, located at 500 Calvert Street, opened for public use in mid-October. After a push from district court judges to have it named after Hubbard and her legacy, state officials approved the name change later that month.
A newly opened district courthouse in Baltimore was renamed to Mabel H. Hubbard District Courthouse, honoring the first Black woman to be appointed to any bench in Maryland
Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D), on hand for Tuesday’s ribbon-cutting event, said the new courthouse represents a “safer, modern, more accessible system of justice for Baltimore.”
“The fight for justice … takes on an even deeper meaning when people who were once denied access to justice, equality and opportunity rise to the highest levels of the system itself – as Judge Mabel H. Hubbard did,” Miller said.
“She was a barrier breaker and a history maker … at a time when people who looked like her walked into courtrooms only to be told, in ways spoken and unspoken, that they didn’t belong,” Miller said.
Born in Detroit in 1936, Hubbard first worked as an English teacher and administrator in Pennsylvania before receiving her Juris Doctorate degree at the University of Maryland School of Law in 1975, according to state documents.
In 1978, she was appointed as a master-in-chancery for the Supreme Bench for Baltimore City, what is now called the Baltimore City Circuit Court, marking her as the first Black woman to be appointed to a bench in Maryland.
District Court Administrative Judge Geoffrey Hengerer said that Hubbard brought “style and perspective” to District 1, donning bright red lipstick and bright red glasses and using humorous turns-of-phrase in the courtroom that became known as “Hubbard-isms.”
“But ultimately, Judge Hubbard had a calm, deliberate demeanor that resonated,” Hengerer said at the ribbon-cutting.
In her career, Hubbard served on both the District Court and the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, retiring from the latter in 1999. During that time, she was also known for mentoring other Black woman attorneys.

The new five-story 168,000-square-foot courthouse houses eight courtrooms, a detention area and multiple state and local agencies, among other features.
General Services Secretary Atif Chaudhry said the facility was a “huge achievement” for the state in both construction and in adhering to energy and carbon neutrality goals.
“We accomplished something really remarkable here in this facility, without acquiring additional land or disturbing the surrounding community,” Chaudhry said. “We took an old state building which was at the end of its useful life … and pulled it back to its steel frame. We then built it back up stronger, safer. More efficient and more accessible.”
The facility’s name change was approved by the Board of Public Works in October, when the facility was only known as the New Baltimore City District Court.
During that meeting, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said the name change would honor Hubbard’s “service … her leadership, and her commitment to the people that that court will serve for generations to come.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_november25_hubbardcourt_ribboncutting_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 03:56:54.161759

Brown/Maryland Matters)It’s the not-so-giving season for a group of climate advocates who are losing faith with the Moore administration’s promises to promote clean-energy policies, and they demonstrated their displeasure Tuesday by sending Gov. Wes Moore a “Thanks … for nothing” card.
“We were thinking about what we wanted to thank this governor for,” said Jorge Aguilar with the group Food and Water Watch, as he held the snarky greeting card outside the Department of the Environment in Baltimore. “Our membership could not think of many things, because we think he has not delivered on many of his promises.”
Aguilar and 10 other advocates walked over from a nearby park with the large card in hand to deliver it to the environment department, where they were greeted by the department’s chief of staff, Scott Goldman.
Aguilar handed Goldman the card, walking him through the group’s many criticisms of the Moore administration. Those concerns largely centered around what the advocates see as a lack of follow-through on Moore’s energy platform that he campaigned on. They also worry Moore has backed policies that actively backtrack on clean-energy efforts.

“He signed the Next Generation Energy Act, which is going to promote new gas plants and new power plans,” Aguilar told Goldman. “This is after he promised to reach 100% clean energy by 2035. Instead, we’re going in a different direction.”
Aguilar said Moore has been “promoting data centers” which will “demand a lot of energy and a lot of water” at the expense of Maryland residents. He also pointed to the governor’s veto of a bill that would have studied the potential financial, environmental and energy effects of data centers in Maryland.
“So our hope is that in 2026, the administration rights these wrongs and does better for Maryland,” Aguilar said. “We’re here really to deliver the message that we’re pretty upset.”
Aguilar said there’s “a lot of good stuff” happening at the department, but the advocates lay the blame on Moore for “not showing leadership” in his climate policies.
Goldman respectfully listened to the group’s concerns and accepted the card.
“I will take this in, and thank you for doing all this, being out in the rain,” Goldman told the advocates. “I know we all want the same thing, I know the governor does as well.”
The Other Kevin Anderson
Gov. Wes Moore on Tuesday tapped Kevin Anderson to be the new delegate from Lower Shore District 38A.
For those scratching their heads about now, we’re not talking about the Kevin Anderson who served as Maryland secretary of Commerce until January and still works in the administration. This is Howard “Kevin” Anderson, a Somerset County Republican who is the third generation to run the family farm and seed business.
Anderson fills the seat left empty by the sudden death last month of Del. Charles Otto (R-Lower Shore) who had just filed to seek election to a fifth term when he died.

Anderson was one of five candidates from the district, which includes Somerset County, southern Worcester County and a bit of Wicomico County south of Salisbury. He was chosen by the three counties’ Republican Central Committees earlier this month and forwarded to Moore.
In making the announcement, Moore called Anderson “a son of the Eastern Shore, with deep roots in Somerset County and a lifelong commitment to growing Maryland’s agricultural sector.”
“He understands the needs of his community firsthand, and I am confident that he will serve his constituents with dedication and distinction,” Moore said in a statement. “I look forward to working in partnership with Kevin to build a Maryland that leaves no one behind.”
Anderson owns and operates Wimberly Farms in Somerset County, growing corn, soybeans, wheat, and barley together with his father, wife, and two daughters, according to the announcement from the governor’s office. It said Anderson and his father also operate a seed conditioning facility where they clean, treat and bag soybean, wheat, and barley seeds, the third generation to do so.
He earned the National Young Farmer Achievement Award in 2002 from the American Farm Bureau Federation, and was named a National Outstanding Young Farmer by the Outstanding Farmers of America in 2007.
Anderson sits on the Maryland Grain Producers board of directors, and serves as vice president of the Maryland Crop Association, in addition to serving on various statewide boards, local civic clubs, and organizations to promote the seed industry.

Braveboy names Okoye to planning board
Prince George’s County businessman Billy Okoye was sworn in last week as the newest member of the Prince George’s County Planning Board of The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, succeeding Dorothy Bailey, the former vice chair of the board.
Okoye, who was appointed by County Executive Aisha Braveboy and confirmed by the County Council, joined his first board meeting last week.
“His experience in business, community advocacy, real estate, and technology will offer a new dynamic to our forward-thinking Planning Board and award-winning agency,” said Prince George’s County Planning Board Chairman Darryl Barnes.
Okoye, who has real estate broker’s licenses in Maryland and the District of Columbia, was founder and principal broker of Sold 100 Real Estate Inc., according to a planning board press release, as well as group managing director of BMO General Contractors. He serves as chairman of the United African Advisory Board which works to strengthen community engagement and representation under Braveboy’s office.
“My professional journey has given me a practical ground-level understanding of our County’s vision for growth as outlined in the 2035 plan – the guiding framework for sustainable and equitable development across communities,” Okoye said in a statement. “I look forward to our collaborative work to revitalize the inner-Beltway neighborhoods into vibrant, transit-oriented economic hubs that attract jobs and opportunities.”
The five-member Prince George’s County Planning Board oversees planning and zoning in the county, as well as administering the county’s public recreation program. Together with the Montgomery County Planning Board, the two bodies operate as the Maryland-National Capital Parks and Planning Commission, which oversees land use, planning, zoning, and parks and recreation in the suburban Washington counties.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)As he argued in Baltimore’s federal courthouse Tuesday, attorney Harris Eisenstein pulled a bright orange hunting vest from his bag and hoisted it into the air.
“This is all that it takes,” he said.
If power line surveyors from PSEG Renewable Transmission simply don the fluorescent orange and pink that hunters are well accustomed to, they won’t face any real danger completing environmental inspections in rural Maryland during hunting season, Eisenstein said.
PSEG, the company behind the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, a 67-mile transmission line planned through Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties, doesn’t think it’s quite so simple.
Surveyors for the proposed line could be crouched in the underbrush, rummaging about, making them difficult for hunters to see, even if they wore bright colors, said Kurt Fischer, an attorney representing PSEG.
The company is asking U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson to prevent landowners from hunting, or allowing hunting, on their property on any days when PSEG has indicated that it plans to come and survey — unless they contact the power company to request permission.
The landowners, who number in the hundreds, oppose any court-ordered hunting ban, “even for a minute,” Eisenstein said.
“They are creating a recipe for a tragedy,” Fischer said.
Abelson declined to rule immediately after Tuesday’s hearing, but acknowledged arguments on both sides: The surveyors have a right to enter private property to conduct their inspections, as required by the Maryland Power Plant Research Program, he said, but landowners have a right to hunt on their own land during the proper season.
US marshals won’t be used for protection during Maryland power line surveys — for now

“What we have are competing rights,” Abelson said Tuesday. “I’m trying to put these competing rights together and find a reasonable solution.”
Attorneys representing several hundred landowners proposed that PSEG give 72 hours notice of survey activities during any Maryland hunting season, and provide specific details about their activities so hunters can prepare for their arrival. That, in addition to requiring that surveyors wear the bright-colored gear.
The two sides were in the same courtroom in May, when the power company and the landowners sparred over whether the court could require property owners to allow the surveys over their objections.
Abelson concluded in June that PSEG has the authority to complete the surveys, which will ultimately inform the Maryland Public Service Commission’s decision whether or not to allow construction on the power line to begin. The landowners have appealed his ruling to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
On Tuesday, Abelson gave PSEG that same authority over a third group of landowners, over protests from their attorneys, who said new information has emerged since Abelson’s June ruling, calling into question the urgency of the power company’s requests for land access.
Namely, the PSC issued a procedural schedule in September saying it will not make a final decision on the power line until February 2027, at the earliest. PSEG had said it needed surveying authority to meet a deadline from power system regulators to have the line in service by June 1, 2027.
“Their … application is stuck in the mud no matter what happens in this case,” Eisenstein said.
Despite the new PSC schedule, power company attorney Emily Wilson said time “very much remains of the essence here,” citing a letter from regional electric grid operator PJM Interconnection that calls for the line to be placed in service as soon as possible to avoid possibile grid failures.
Review for Piedmont power line will take until at least February 2027, Maryland regulators say

Eisenstein also argued that PSEG will need to conduct geotechnical boring surveys, but Maryland law does not allow it to compel that more invasive surveying, making it unlikely the company can meet its obligations.
Wilson argued that the Maryland Power Plant Research Program could determine that the geotechnical surveys are not necessary. Whether they are or not, it doesn’t change the fact that state law is on PSEG’s side with regard to property access, she said.
“What this case is focused on is the land access,” she said. “They do not have a right to exclude the company in this way.”
David Wyand, another attorney for the landowners, argued that the legislature only gave eminent domain powers to companies that have already been granted permission to construct their line. Technically, a state government entity, such as the Maryland Power Plant Research Program, could conduct the surveys, Wyand said, but PSEG can’t — as a private company.
“The General Assembly has specifically not said that PSEG has that right,” Wyand said.
But Abelson said that none of the new information changed his mind that PSEG should be able to collect its survey data, unimpeded by the landowners who disagree.
It’s unclear whether landowners will sway Abelson on the hunting issue, which they argue is urgent. Maryand’s firearm season for white-tailed deer, for instance, begins Saturday, and runs until Dec. 13.
Matt Moran, an Adamstown landowner in the path of the power line, said after Tuesday’s hearing that he recently received a notice from PSEG advising him that it plans to survey in the weeks ahead. If Abelson rules that landowners cannot hunt on any day when PSEG might  survey, Moran said he would only have one day open to hunt.










They are out-of-state. And they are out of touch.


– Harris Eisenstein, attorney for Maryland landowners, of New Jersey-based PSEG


“That leaves me with one day to go out and get the venison that I need to feed my family, because I rely on venison to feed my family,” Moran said. “If you look in the freezer at my home, you’ll see that there’s more venison than there is beef, pork, chicken and fish combined.”
Attorneys for the landowners argued that hunting is not just a valued pastime for many rural Marylanders, but a relied-upon method for gathering food and reducing the number of animals that eat their crops.
“They are out-of-state,” Eisenstein said of New Jersey-based PSEG. “And they are out of touch.”
Eisenstein said PSEG’s practice of sending one notice to warn landowners about “multiple weeks” of surveying, even though actual surveys may only occur on particular days, “cloud” landowners’ lives. PSEG’s proposed hunting order could restrict the activity for weeks at a time, infringing on hunters’ rights, Eisenstein said.
PSEG’s attorneys argued that the company routinely coordinates with landowners who call with concerns about specific days, and that the company would “ideally” be able to come to agreement with landowners regarding hunting days.
But not all landowners are willing to work with PSEG. Some will not even correspond with the company, Wilson said. On at least one occasion, a landowner referenced hunting season in a Facebook post that PSEG perceived as a threat.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We need that protection in place to protect our surveyors and their assistants,” Wilson said, “so that a really unfortunate accident does not occur.”
Wilson argued that Abelson needs to universally bar hunting during the survey work, and allow exceptions for particular properties. Eisenstein countered that hunting bans should be the exception — not the rule.
Nancy Gardetto, owner of Copper Penny Farm in Adamstown, said she, her husband and their two children are eagerly awaiting Saturday’s opening of deer season, which they also use to stock their freezers with venison, and cut down on the deer population to protect crops.
Gardetto also got a surveying notice from PSEG overlapping with the weeks of the hunt. She said she called PSEG to advise the company that it should not survey her property during that period because there would be hunting, and she feels the company should oblige. She made sure to emphasize that she was not making a threat, she said.
“They claim to have great coordination with all the property owners,” Gardetto said. “If that’s the case, I don’t understand why we need to ask permission to hunt our own farmland. I don’t understand why they can’t contact us and say: ‘Hey, we’ve got guys coming out tomorrow. Is anybody going to be there hunting?’”
“I don’t know why we had to be dragged into court to be forced into this,” Gardetto said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9664-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-25 22:56:40.832612

In a time of limited resources and inequitable access, maybe we should try, writes Kalman Hettleman. But he also says that, despite challenges, now is not the time to abandon GTE, but to reform it.","Gifted and talented education is essential, but also divisive, writes Kalman Hettleman, who says the programs need to be reformed in the name of equity and resource allocation. (Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)What could be wrong with public schools providing instruction tailored to fulfill the potential of “gifted and talented” students (GTE)? Our nation has a vital interest in gifted and talented citizens and workers.
The National Association for Gifted Children states that education for gifted and talented students must move students “at an educational pace matching their abilities and readiness for advanced curriculum rather than restricting them to a set of grade-level standards based on their age.”
That’s the persuasive case for more GTE. Nonetheless, the New York Times reports that GTE is “one of the most volatile issues in public education.” A leading analyst finds that “there is no issue in American education that is more fraught.”
Why is GTE so controversial? Why, despite strong support from parents and vigorous national and state advocacy movements, is progress lagging?
There are two huge obstacles. One is cost. The second is even more fundamental: It’s widespread criticism that GTE is inequitable and elitist; only a small percentage of students found eligible are Black, Latino or poor.
That makes it a political hot potato. Identification is pivotal, and requirements are being revised to replace subjective parent and teacher referrals with, as stated in Maryland’s model, “universal screening … and multiple indicators of potential.”

One dilemma is finding the right age for identification. A recent journal article concludes that giftedness is mobile: It can be influenced by nature or nurture. Policies vary. Maryland requires identification “as early as possible, but no later than Grade 3.”
Beyond identification, the lack of earmarked federal and state funds for GTE is a major barrier. The uncomfortable policy question is: Given very scarce funding for public schools, what priority should GTE get?
When I was a member of the Baltimore City school board in the early 2000s, there was an 8-1 vote to reallocate funds to gifted and talented students. I was the lone dissenter. I reasoned that – because city schools were extraordinarily underfunded and the overwhelming majority of students, predominantly Black and poor, weren’t coming close to meeting reading and math standards, we couldn’t afford the reallocation.
I think back on my vote uneasily. Highest priorities can’t be exclusive priorities. A balance must be struck between extra instruction for low-performing students and other valuable school programs, from art and music to career and technical education to GTE, and so on.
The leading national proponent of GTE is the Fordham Institute education think tank. Its president, Michael Petrilli (a policy star), has written  “How can we depolarize ‘gifted education’?” He points out the U.S. not only trails other countries in basic reading and math proficiency; we are far behind in “advanced” achievement. And his chief recommendations parallel the Maryland model.
But what’s actually happening on the ground? Data is limited but each local district does pretty much its own thing, subject to state guidance on best practices. Among the practices:  professional learning, enriched instruction, grouping, co-teaching, GTE specialists and self-contained classes.
A Hechinger Report in 2021 stated that Maryland’s 16% participation rate in GTE is highest in the nation. Still, Maryland reports that children living in poverty are the most underrepresented group in gifted and talented programs. Even the most committed GTE educators and advocates agree there’s a long way to go.
So now, should we come down on the side of more or less GTE? In a more moral nation, the problem would go away. There would be enough money to provide all students – from low-performing to gifted and talented – with an adequate, equitable education.
Of course that’s a cop-out. In the real world, the inescapable issue is whether the equity issues are so knotty that GTE, as some critics argue, should be abandoned altogether. I don’t think so.
Instead, even without more funding, GTE can be improved in various ways. For example, more data and evaluation of what’s working best. Another is to target scant money to what are called “talent development programs“ that seek to expand the number and racial balance of students qualifying for GTE.
Still, in the near future, I can’t support more funding because of the multiple competing needs. Advocates must, in the midst of the state’s fiscal crisis, set limited priorities.
For now, sorry to say, the best we can do is forcefully advocate for brighter prospects in the years ahead.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-52077072-1024x624.jpg,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

Richard Blumenthal sees a “flagrant abuse” of norms and traditions throughout President Donald Trump’s first year back in the White House, the Connecticut Democrat said during an appearance on The Connecticut Mirror’s “In The Room” series.
Appearing Tuesday night from West Hartford Town Hall with host John Dankosky, Blumenthal was peppered with questions about the temporary hold on federal nutrition assistance, Trump’s recent threat to Democratic members of Congress and the dismissal of criminal indictments of officials who have clashed with the president.
As he answered each of these questions, Blumenthal essentially started with a caveat about how he views the administration.
“We are living with an administration that is cruel and stupid in a lot of what it does,” Blumenthal said when discussing the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s unprecedented hold on SNAP benefits during the government shutdown.
The hour-long conversation delved into familiar themes and issues that Blumenthal has waded into in recent months, including his concerns of politically motivated prosecutions and investigations. 
The three-term Democratic senator questioned U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi at a Senate hearing last month about any conversations she may have had with Trump regarding the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. That line of inquiry landed him in hot water with Trump, who issued a threat of an investigation into the senator over a past characterization of his military service.
On Monday, criminal indictments of Comey as well as of New York Attorney General Letitia James were dismissed as the judge found that Trump’s appointment of the interim prosecutor was unlawful.
Blumenthal, who formerly served as Connecticut’s attorney general, said that other than the Watergate scandal during the Nixon administration, there has generally been a tradition to keep the Justice Department independent from the White House.
“What we’re seeing is the most kind of flagrant abuse of that tradition and norm. Theoretically, the president could say and he has said ‘go after so and so’ regardless of the evidence, but here’s what happens: The cases are dismissed,” Blumenthal said, referring to the dismissals this week of the Comey and James cases.
He has proposed various bills as a counter, including one aimed at preventing political prosecutions that “would essentially prohibit these kinds of contacts between the White House directing the Justice Department.”
But Democrats have little recourse as the minority party in both chambers of Congress. And Blumenthal was candid about the likely fate of some of that legislation.
“I’m very clear there is not a chance that we’re going to have this legislation adopted any more than my legislation on the Insurrection Act that would prohibit the use of military troops against American citizens without some congressional review,” he said. “There are a lot of measures where guardrails and safeguards should be imposed that we will not see in this administration.”
Blumenthal also aired concerns about the start of investigations into some of the members of Congress who posted a video addressing U.S. service members and encouraging them to protect the Constitution, even if that means defying illegal orders. The video featured six Democratic lawmakers who are all veterans of the military and intelligence services.
Trump called it “seditious behavior, punishable by death.”
“I was just aghast. I would have been astonished, but it is President Trump, so we’re accustomed to hearing pretty astonishing things from him,” Blumenthal said Tuesday.
Blumenthal pointed to the bipartisan reaction a mere two months ago “when all of us agreed to lower the temperature” after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot. He said he expects those members of Congress to face a deluge of threats.
During an appearance on Fox News, Trump walked back the comments about the video, saying he wasn’t calling for the lawmakers’ execution. “I’m not threatening death, but I think they’re in serious trouble,” Trump said. 
Connecticut Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said he didn’t agree with Trump’s comments, but he believed people on both sides of the aisle have contributed to the growing political violence in the country.
Blumenthal agreed with the sentiment that political violence has intensified in the U.S. and emanates from both ends of the political spectrum.
“There was a point where I received the intelligence briefings on threats to this country where they shifted from fears about extremists from outside the country to extremists within the country, and this is not limited to [the] right or left,” he said.
Blumenthal was originally supposed to sit down for the “In the Room” event last month but needed to stay in Washington for Senate votes in the early days of the government shutdown. After a record 43 days, the federal government reopened after the Senate struck a deal.
The Connecticut senator reiterated his disappointment over the deal since it didn’t meet Democrats’ demands over health care, specifically on the extension of enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans.
Congress remains locked in a fierce debate over the fate of the tax credits, which were established under Democrats’ pandemic relief bill in 2021 and later extended through the end of 2025.
The subsidies were intended to be temporary, and when they were extended for another two years in a different Democratic bill in 2022, the party at the time had control of the White House and all of Congress. Shouldn’t they have made it more permanent when they had the chance instead of subjecting it to budget fights?
“It’s probably more frequent than not that government programs go for a period of time and they have to be reauthorized. So that’s not too unusual. But the point here is these subsidies were expected to be wildly popular, and guess what? They are wildly popular, and you know where most of the people who benefit from them live — in red states that Donald Trump won,” Blumenthal said.
He said if Democrats win the majority in the 2026 midterms, there’s “no question that we will try to adopt a more permanent solution.”
But as things currently stand, the enhanced subsidies are set to expire on Dec. 31. And without congressional action, premiums are expected to rise for many in 2026.
Reports suggested Trump was warming to a temporary extension of the subsidies for another two years in a plan that was expected to be released on Monday. It would also limit eligibility to those who make up to 700% of the federal poverty line.
While an announcement was never officially scheduled for Monday and the details were light, the forthcoming proposal was delayed as the framework started to get pushback from some congressional Republicans skeptical of the Affordable Care Act, according to MS Now.The Senate is expected to take a vote on extending the subsidies by the second week of December. But Blumenthal isn’t holding his breath on the outcome.
“Donald Trump over the weekend said, ‘OK we’ll extend the subsidies for a couple of years,’ and he was immediately deluged by his right wing with criticism, so I think you have to recognize that we’re up against MAGA here,” Blumenthal said. “I think there will be a vote, and, unfortunately, I think Republicans will be bludgeoned into voting against health care tax credits extensions.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/blumenthal-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-25 21:57:01.301727

Twelve score and nine years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  
Now we are engaged in an uncivil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and dedicated, can long endure. Each day we are met with a new battle in this war. We acknowledge the heavy price paid by generations that this nation might live in freedom. It is altogether fitting and proper that we do this. We cannot rest until the principles of democracy, decency, and the Constitution are restored.  
But, in a larger sense, we cannot venerate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow our great institutions while the president desecrates and dismantles them. The brave and wise who came before expected that we would add not detract from their unfinished work. The world may little note, nor long remember the falsehood and cruelties now spoken and texted, but it will never forget the lasting damage being done here. 
It is for us the living, who still believe in democracy to be dedicated to advancing this unfinished work. We must take increased devotion to this noble cause for which so many have given their last full measure of devotion. Only by doing so can we be resolved that they did not do so in vain.

Dorene Lorenz of Juneau filed the suit on Friday in Juneau Superior Court, seeking damages from Jeff Landfield and the other owners of the Alaska Landmine, a popular Alaska political website that publishes a mixture of news, commentary and parody.  
Landfield, who backed Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, also publishes the Alaska Political Report, a sobersided news digest priced at $1,299 per year for lobbyists and others interested in activity at the state Capitol. 
Lorenz’s suit stems from a social media post in which Landfield ridiculed a recent appearance by Lorenz at a United Nations event in Switzerland. 
Landfield went beyond that appearance, which he labeled “bizarre,” and said, “This woman is an absolute nut. Remember when she got in trouble for using … state money for the Jesse Lee Home for herself?”
Lorenz asked for a retraction. Landfield refused, and reiterated his belief in a video posted on Facebook.
Lorenz filed her lawsuit in response, saying Landfield’s claim is false. She asked for financial damages for slander and defamation, a correction and retraction. 
Lorenz, who has experience representing herself in court, filed the lawsuit on her own behalf. 
“She’s a f***ing lunatic,” Landfield said of the lawsuit on Tuesday. 
“Anyone who has themselves as a client is a fool, as the old saying goes,” he said, adding that he looks forward to the discovery process and showing what happened with the Jesse Lee Home.
That building was a former orphanage and the home of Alaska Flag designer Benny Benson in the early 20th century.
During the administration of Gov. Bill Walker, state lawmakers allocated almost $7 million to restore the building, but grants given to a Lorenz-chaired nonprofit called the Friends of the Jesse Lee Home were terminated after a series of “reporting issues and accountability issues.”
Lorenz said by text on Tuesday that most of the grant money was never disbursed to the nonprofit she administered.
In 2018, Fred Parady, then deputy commissioner of the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development, told Alaska Public Media that he didn’t think anyone involved with the project stole money. 
In her legal complaint, Lorenz notes that Landfield was aware of that reporting and repeated his claim anyway.
Under Alaska law — which mirrors federal law — a public official filing a defamation claim needs to prove that someone knew what they were saying was a lie or that they willingly ignored evidence that their statement was a lie. 
By text message, Lorenz said the 2018 reporting by Alaska Public Media shows that the state believed that the Friends of the Jesse Lee Home were spending too much money on classes within the school and not enough on the building itself. 
“Landmine has asserted otherwise, with actual malice, and continues to do so,” she said. “Not cool.”

Department of Veterans Affairs)Caring for South Carolina’s elderly veterans has been one Upstate company’s focus for nearly three decades. A recent state contract will further extend that streak.
Anderson-headquartered HMR Veterans Services operates four of South Carolina’s six nursing homes for veterans.
The company started with the Richard M. Campbell Veterans Nursing Home, located in Anderson and named for the brother of the late former Gov. Carroll Campbell. Richard Campbell was a sergeant in the U.S. Army killed in action during the Vietnam War.
HMR has run Campbell’s namesake home since 1998 and will continue to do so through at least February 2033, along with Veterans Victory House in Walterboro. HMR has held contracts on the Lowcountry home since 2007.
For its services at the two homes, HMR will receive an estimated $375 million, paid by state and federal taxes. HMR was the lowest bidder of three finalists — at a rate of $333 per bed per day, compared to the high bid of $425 per bed per day — for seven-year contracts starting March 1.
Contracts for two other homes HMR runs — one in Gaffney and one in Florence — are out for bid now.
Outside the Palmetto State, HMR also runs all five of Alabama’s veterans homes and six out of 10 in Texas.
That brings the company’s total to 15 homes with 3,000 employees across three states.
SC’s investment in veterans
In SC, hundreds of veterans go homeless. These groups received state money to help.

For all six homes in South Carolina, state taxpayers spend about $80 million annually to collectively care for 800 veterans, according to Heyward Hilliard, director of veterans’ homes for the South Carolina Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
In a state with 400,000 veterans, the homes always have a waiting list, he said.
Future expansions, including new homes planned for Orangeburg and Horry counties and a replacement of a Columbia home with a newer facility planned for Lexington County, will eventually increase capacity to more than 1,080 veterans.
The construction timeline of those new homes depends on congressional spending, since federal taxes cover 65% of the cost. South Carolina must kick in the other 35%. Total funding could five years away, Hilliard said.
A focus on veterans
Operating homes for veterans is the only thing HMR does, which makes the company unique nationwide, Russell Keogler, vice president of corporate operations, told the SC Daily Gazette.
“There are competitors out there, but their main focus is on traditional nursing homes,” Keogler said. “For us, this is all we do and all we do every day.”
That gives HMR an advantage when it comes to meeting the unique needs of veterans, according to Keogler.
HMR has specialists on hand to treat illnesses more common to veterans, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. As Vietnam and Korean War veterans are aging, they are also facing more health complications from exposure to toxins, such as Agent Orange used during the war to remove trees and foliage in the dense jungle battlegrounds.
A company history
Still, HMR wasn’t always just a veterans-based company.
Michael McBride, a nursing home administrator, founded it as Health Management Resources, Inc., in 1993, after leasing his first six nursing homes.
Its first veterans’ home, the Campbell facility, became part of the portfolio in 1998, seven years after it opened. That’s also when Army veteran William Biggs, the husband of freshman U.S. Rep. Sheri Biggs, joined as CEO. He had been the administrator of the home in Anderson when HMR took over the contract.
At one point, HMR had as many as 27 veteran and non-veteran facilities across five states, according to McBride’s biography on the company website. In 2010, the company sold 21 hospice, rehab and pharmacy locations to a private equity firm but held on to the veterans’ services side of the business.
McBride continues to sit on HMR’s board of directors, as does the widow of another HMR co-founder, Ed Childress.
William Biggs retired and Ladeeb Diab replaced him as CEO in May 2023. Eight months later, Biggs’ wife launched her campaign for the ruby red congressional seat being vacated by Rep. Jeff Duncan, who chose not to seek an eighth term. Sheri Biggs, a nurse practitioner, emerged the winner of a seven-way GOP primary contest in June 2024. Her 3rd District win last November sent two South Carolina women to Congress for the first time ever.
William Biggs declined to comment for this article, citing a noncompete agreement he signed upon retirement that prevents him from speaking about the company.
The congresswoman, in financial disclosures filed last month, reported more than $4 million in income  from the sale of her husband’s minority interest in HMR businesses.
Members of Congress are required to annually disclose their finances. But they’re only required to report a range of how much their assets and liabilities are worth, so the couple’s exact earnings are unknown. But she valued the capital gains for each of four HMR businesses at more than $1 million.
‘Push the envelope’
Keogler said HMR has sought to “push the envelope” in other ways as well.
For example, at the request of states it contracts with, HMR began running its own pharmacies at its homes, instead of calling in prescriptions from elsewhere.
“We can do all of our medication reviews right in house, and our pharmacists actually know the residents,” he said. “It’s no longer just filling a prescription. It’s taking care of a veteran who you see every day.”
HMR also weathered staffing shortages exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It does so through a scholarship program, paying for the education of any certified nursing assistant employed by the company who wants to pursue a higher-level licensed practical nursing degree.
New SC law aims to ensure no veteran dies without proper recognition

“We help cover the cost of their tuition and books. We provide them a mentor to help guide them through the program, all while they can continue to work on this flexed academic schedule that builds professional growth for the individual and provides us a constant source of new nurses,” Keogler said. “I think it’s those innovative practices, which we’ve accelerated over the last two years, that really caught the attention of our state partners.”
A huge cost benefit
There are other reasons South Carolina’s more than 386,000 veterans and their families may choose a veterans home.
“It’s really camaraderie and connection,” Keogler said. “There’s a true brotherhood that exists in the service and that comes out later on in life.”
Also, there’s a huge cost benefit to families when they select a state veterans home. With military service benefits, the cost is far less than that of a traditional nursing home.
The federal government pays states a daily rate which can cover up to 50% of the homes’ operating costs. For veterans deemed at least 70% disabled due to injuries related to their military service, their cost is covered in full, according to Heyward Hilliard, director of veterans’ homes for the South Carolina Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
The remaining costs are covered by state taxes or by the veterans themselves, said Hilliard, who was previously HMR’s executive vice president of operations. He joined the state agency in April 2024 after it took over the homes’ operations from the state mental health agency.

Above average
South Carolina also is in the minority of states — one of 13 — that pay private contractors to run all of its homes, though more states are trending that direction, Hilliard said.
While private contractors run the homes, the state public health agency and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are tasked with inspecting them. And the state veterans agency employs someone on site at each home, Hilliard said.
“Our homes consistently perform at or above national averages,” he said.
Three of the four HMR-run homes in South Carolina have recently received high marks.
State and federal regulators inspected the Anderson and Walterboro homes seven times over the past four years. Some reviews were the result of complaints and required the homes to make improvements. But each received a government rating of four out of five stars.
The Gaffney home has gone through four inspections and one improvement plan in that time and has a perfect rating.
The Florence home, however, sits at a two out of five. Federal reports site shortfalls in a handful of patient treatment plans for residents with medical issues including diabetes, a feeding tube and ulcers and bedsores.
The Columbia home, which is run by Avalon Health Care Group rather than HMR, also has a two-star rating. The same group also runs the state’s newest veterans’ home in Sumter, which opened in January. It hasn’t been rated yet.

HMR also made headlines in 2018, when the wife of a U.S. Air Force veteran alleged her husband suffered repeat infections, hospitalizations and unexplained bruises while he was in the Walterboro home, the Independent Mail reported.
And in May 2018, HMR settled a $425,000 lawsuit involving a veteran at the Anderson home who had a latex glove lodged in his airway. He died five days later.
Hilliard, who was still working for HMR at the time, told the Independent Mail: “Health care is a very litigious environment. A settlement does not constitute an admission of liability.”
State Department of Public Health investigations around this time found 13 violations involving “policies and procedures, staff training, resident records, resident care and medication administration.” The agency fined HMR $3,600.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RICHARD-M.-CAMPBELL-VETERANS-NURSING-HOME.jpg,,,2025-11-25 20:58:03.536232

Spencer Cox said he’s in favor of adding more justices to the Utah Supreme Court and more judges to the state’s Court of Appeals.,"Gov. Spencer Cox responds to a reporter’s question during the governor’s news conference broadcast by PBS Utah at the Eccles Broadcast Center in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2025. (Pool photo by Tess Crowley/The Salt Lake Tribune)Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Tuesday he’s in favor of adding more justices to the Utah Supreme Court and more judges to the state’s Court of Appeals. 
“It’s something that I do support,” Cox told reporters Tuesday during his monthly news conference hosted by PBS Utah.
The governor also said he doesn’t see growing the benches as court packing, a practice members of Utah’s congressional delegation denounced when it was proposed at the federal level by Democrats.  
State lawmakers considered making the move earlier this year as they grew more frustrated with recent Utah Supreme Court decisions, including one maintaining a stay on a ban they passed on abortion while it’s challenged in court. Another decision limited the Legislature’s power to undo and replace voter-approved government reform initiatives.

Rather than citing dissatisfaction with the courts’ written opinions, lawmakers at the time pointed to growing caseloads and complex legal arguments. The governor echoed those reasons Tuesday, saying it makes sense to expand Utah’s Supreme Court from five justices to seven to “start moving justice quicker through the system. I think that really matters.”  
Data provided by the Utah court system points to the appeals’ courts growing caseload, with legal filings at the Utah Supreme Court reaching a high of 270 in the state’s 2025 fiscal year, which ends in June. The Court of Appeals fielded 1,143 filings in the same time frame, up 7% from a year earlier. 
But two Utah Supreme Court justices have said growing their panel won’t help them.
Justice Paige Petersen said earlier this year that it’s “misinformation” and “absolutely false” to say “we need more members of the court because they have a backlog.”
“We haven’t had a backlog for years,” Petersen said in a Utah Judicial Council meeting in February.  
Utah Supreme Court disputes lawmakers’ allegations that it’s not productive enough

Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told The Salt Lake Tribune in October that adding more justices could lead to more deliberation, delaying timelines further. He told the newspaper he and his colleagues care about being efficient “but more than anything else, we want to get it right under the law, under the Constitution.”
When Democrats in Congress proposed expanding the U.S. Supreme Court in 2021, Utah’s Republican U.S. senators condemned it as an attempt at court packing, saying legislators were trying to undermine the independence of the judicial branch. 
Asked if expanding the appeals courts in Utah would be court packing, Cox said, “I’ve never looked at it that way.” He told reporters he does not share the same consternation lawmakers have with the courts. 
A majority of states have at least seven justices. That includes neighboring Colorado and Nevada. Idaho and Wyoming have five. 
Cox said he also supports setting aside more resources for district court judges, who oversee criminal cases and lawsuits throughout the state. 
“I’ve seen their dockets,” Cox said. “They’re really backed up.” 
The governor last month signed a bill into law last month that allows him to pick the Utah Supreme Court’s chief justice every eight years. Cox had vetoed an earlier version that set the term at four years.

(Courtesy of Union Omaha)OMAHA — Omaha city officials are taking steps to unlock a state incentive to help pay for two multimillion-dollar sports complexes, touting the public value of the projects in drawing tourism and other dollars.
But as the City Council on Tuesday gave its full throttled, 7-0 support to request help via the Sports Arena Facility Financing Assistance Act, Gov. Jim Pillen doubled down on his resistance.
Pillen, whose approval is required to tap the incentive, told the Nebraska Examiner this week that the state has been “duped” for too long in approving sales tax exemptions he believes only shift the burdens to property taxes.

“Our state sales tax has been Swiss cheese for 45 years plus,” he said. “We don’t have a sales tax base to afford to do very much of anything.”
The governor has said he will not consider approval of any SAFFAA application until June at the earliest — after the next legislative session during which he hopes lawmakers will pass property tax relief. 
Omaha City Council members pushed back on any notion that the turnback tax incentive for the two Omaha projects would harm the state’s financial picture. Councilwoman Aimee Melton, a Republican, called it a “win-win.” 
“This will be revenue positive,” Melton said. “The state will see an increase in revenue from Day One.” 
 Governor support needed

At issue is a state incentive for arenas and sports complexes previously approved by the Nebraska Legislature. Applicants go through a state board that includes the governor, who must be among the majority for a project to be approved. Nine projects not including the two Omaha athletic complexes already are pending.

Here’s how the financing incentive generally works for qualified Omaha ventures: Up to 70% of new state sales taxes generated within 600 yards of a sports facility goes to help pay off bonds for construction. The “new” tax revenue refers to sales at the facility or at retailers that sprout in the designated zone for a certain time after the project is announced. 
In most cases, city voters must approve the use of such bonds.
Omaha officials Tuesday expressed doubt that the two athletic complexes in question would move forward without the SAFFAA turnback tax approval. If all hurdles were cleared, the state incentive would help cover costs for:

Up to 16 multi-purpose athletic fields, a concession area and parking facilities at Tranquility Park near 120th and West Maple Road. The joint SAFFAA application will be submitted by the city and the nonprofit Omaha Public Facilities Corp. Public records show the city will seek up to $65 million in revenue bonds to pay up front costs. Initial documentation does not indicate how much of the turnback tax is being sought.
An open-air soccer complex owned by the city and used by the Union Omaha professional team near 11th and Izard Streets. Soccer officials project the overall stadium will cost $140 million, including $114 in “hard” costs and the rest for infrastructure. Partners in the application are the city and Downtown Soccer Stadium, a nonprofit affiliated with the Union Omaha ownership group. The city says it will request $25 million from the state turnback tax.

Jennifer Taylor, deputy Omaha city attorney, said if the turnback tax was not granted, Omaha would have to stop and reevaluate.
“We’ll have to put the brakes on,” she told the council.
 New ‘gateway’ to city 

David Levy, an attorney representing the Union Omaha project, described the 6,500-seat stadium as “a milestone in a long and really exciting journey.” It would be home to both the men’s professional soccer “Owls” team and a new women’s soccer team.
New $140M Union Omaha soccer stadium, mixed-use village could hinge on paused state sports incentive

Other community uses, including games by high school teams, are envisioned for the stadium, which would be owned by the city and leased and managed by Union Omaha. 
Levy said that projections show the stadium generating more tourism-related and other revenue for the city and state than the $25 million sought from the turnback tax over 20 years. Other sources, including tax-increment financing and program revenue, also would help pay for the stadium.
Partners expect new private housing, retail and commercial development of between $300 and $400 million near the complex. 
“This will be a great gateway and front door to our city at that location,” Levy said.
Melton said the land on which the stadium would rise currently is largely vacant and draws little property tax revenue. She said new tax revenue to be generated in that stadium zone would not exist if not for the project.
The city is seeking to buy the roughly 25 acres around 11th and Izard Streets from Union Pacific Railroad for $18.7 million for the soccer stadium project. 
In a move not necessarily related to the stadium, the railroad seeks to buy back from the city long-vacant land at 1441 Capitol Ave. That square block, priced at $7.3 million, was once Union Pacific’s headquarters. The railroad told the Nebraska Examiner in a statement Friday that it is considering developing the property, but no firm decision has been made.
Public hearings on both land purchase agreements are to take place next Tuesday.
 Tranquility growth

In an effort to safeguard taxpayers, both sports complex agreements are to include assurances that partners have sufficient funds before the projects move forward, Taylor said. 
City Councilman Pete Festersen, a Democrat, said he was excited to support the projects he sees as a lure for families and young athletes and hoped that state partners would look favorably on the ventures.
At age 50, Omaha’s Tranquility Park athletic complex is getting $54 million makeover

The turnback tax application, he said, “is very important to the overall picture.” 
Around the Tranquility Park campus, which is a half century old, the Mulhall family proposes to build a mixed-use private development — contingent on the new additional sports facilities, council members said. 
The City of Omaha began talking years ago about upgrading the park to draw regional and national tournaments. The park is managed by the Omaha Parks and Recreation Department.
In early 2024, the city selected JEO Consulting Group for planning development and design. The city tapped Kiewit as construction manager.
City Councilman Brinker Harding, a Republican running for Congress in the Omaha-based 2nd District, urged state decision-makers to approve all turnback tax projects if they’re revenue positive. He said he sees benefits to athletic activities beyond physical exercise. 
“It teaches our kids responsibility, dedication, accountability, sportsmanship and those are all good values we want to instill in our youth,” he said. “I’m a big believer in that youth sports can be a great pathway for that.”

But as we transition away from fossil fuels, energy demand will increase as we electrify our lives and as energy-intensive industries proliferate.  
This complicates our state’s path to decarbonization.
As part of the transition, solar energy in Washington could cover tens of thousands — possibly hundreds of thousands — of acres in the coming years.
Where all those solar panels go is a serious question.
Rooftop solar is great. However, the most ambitious estimates show that, at best, it would meet less than 30% of the state’s energy needs.
Farmland is a prime target for solar developers because the land is typically flat, already cleared, relatively accessible and sunny.
But the prospect of farmland conversion to solar energy has created tensions in rural communities and led to roadblocks on agricultural solar arrays.
Rather than converting farmland to solar facilities, we could build solar arrays and continue growing crops and raising livestock beneath the gentle shade of the panels. This approach is called “agrivoltaics,” and it could be one way to ease competition between the agriculture and solar energy sectors.
Solar arrays cast a shadow but don’t fully shade the land beneath.
This means some crops and smaller livestock can be grown and raised underneath and between the panels. And if you raise the panels a few feet higher, beneath them you can grow taller crops, trellised fruit trees, or graze cattle.
Even better, the partial shade from the solar panels can reduce sunburn and heat stress for fruits and vegetables and improve animal welfare. The shading can also reduce irrigation needs.
Solar panels and support posts can be used to replace some farm infrastructure as well, like trellising and shade cloth.
Through a collaboration between American Farmland Trust, Washington State University, The Nature Conservancy, and colleagues at University of California, Santa Barbara, we recently published a report on the feasibility of agrivoltaics in Washington for the state Department of Commerce. The research was funded by Climate Commitment Act revenue.
Our work included cutting-edge modeling to assess the joint production of solar energy and crop yield and quality at the field scale for apples, lettuce and berries. And we surveyed more than 100 farmers statewide to learn about their perspectives on solar energy, including agrivoltaics.
Our discoveries show incredible potential for the future of clean energy in Washington.
Farmers surveyed were substantially more supportive of agrivoltaics than converting farmland to solar arrays without maintaining agricultural production.
Fifty-five percent of the farmers surveyed were more interested in marrying solar and agricultural land when they learned about the idea of agrivoltaics and 57% of the farmers surveyed were moderately or very interested in hosting an agrivoltaics system on their lands.
Washington residents deeply value protecting both agricultural and natural lands. They also value rapidly transitioning to renewable energy sources.
In 2025, the state Legislature passed Senate Bill 5445 to encourage a diversity of distributed energy systems, including agrivoltaics.
This is a great start, and we need more. Farmers and ranchers, solar developers, scientists and policy makers can build on this momentum to support Washington’s agricultural communities, protect our lands and build the renewable energy future we need without losing valuable agriculture and natural lands.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/solar-farm-agricultural-land-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-11-25 19:57:14.864780

Jim Pillen’s reelection bid at a momentthat some hope might prevent a bruising GOP primary for governor with former Trump donor Charles Herbster.
In a social media post Tuesday, the president gave Pillen his “complete and total Endorsement for re-election.” Trump pointed to Pillen “working tirelessly to Champion Nebraska Values” and other reasons.

“A very successful Veterinarian, Businessman, former Nebraska Cornhuskers football player under the LEGENDARY Coach Tom Osborne, and now, as Governor, Jim has a Proven Record of Success!” Trump posted on Truth Social. 
The president ended the post as he does most of his GOP endorsements on social media, writing, “HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!”
Pillen, in a Monday afternoon response to the president on social media site X, wrote that he was “deeply honored to have earned” Trump’s endorsement. 
“Conservative leadership matters, as he has proved time and again,” Pillen said on social media. “Thank you, Mr. President.” 
The endorsement comes as Herbster has increasingly sharpened his criticisms of the governor online. Herbster has said he is considering a rerun of his 2022 GOP gubernatorial bid, which he lost to Pillen, finishing second in a three-way race at the top with then-State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, who is running for the U.S. House in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District.

Herbster told the Examiner recently that, “Pillen’s shortcomings make it hard to say no” to running in 2026 and that he will decide closer to the new year. He had criticized Pillen for, among other things, not listening to the business community, for not selling the state aggressively enough to business leaders elsewhere and for resisting voter-approved medical cannabis. 
Herbster, in a statement, said while he is disappointed in Trump’s endorsement, “it is entirely reasonable that he would endorse the incumbent Republican governor.” He said he is still committed to exploring a run for governor. 
“This race is not about President Trump,” Herbster said. “It is about hard-working Nebraskans trying to make ends meet. It is about our farmers and ranchers, who have been asked to sacrifice for far too long. It is about the businesses trying to grow and bring jobs to our state, only to be met with roadblocks and mismanagement from this administration.”

Trump backing Pillen is a dramatic change from the last time Herbster faced the former University of Nebraska regent. In that race, Herbster had Trump’s endorsement, and the governor was backed by then-Gov. Pete Ricketts, whom Pillen appointed to the U.S. Senate in 2023. Herbster was the president’s first major endorsed Republican candidate to lose in a 2022 GOP primary.
Pillen cruised to a general election victory against then-Democratic State Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue after beating Herbster. 
The governor worked hard to earn Trump’s endorsement, taking far more trips to Washington, D.C., and the White House than his predecessors. He also vocally supported the Trump administration locally, including volunteering the state to host a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement jail for migrants awaiting deportation proceedings at a state prison facility in McCook.
Pillen has taken some criticism at home from Democrats and some in his own party for what they said was putting Trump’s interests ahead of Nebraska’s.
Local political observers were buzzing Tuesday about the endorsement and what it might mean for the potential GOP primary. GOP consultant Perre Neilan of Neilan Strategy Group of Lincoln said the endorsement might make Herbster reconsider running. Most endorsements are “nice to have but not critical.” Trump’s endorsement in a GOP primary is a “big get for Governor Pillen.”
“The Trump endorsement will definitely give Herbster pause,” Neilan said. 
Jacy Todd, another GOP candidate for governor, said, “It’s not about President Trump’s endorsement. It’s about the people of Nebraska endorsing me.” 
“Makes me wonder what President Trump sees in Pillen with the way he has poorly run our state,” Todd said. 
This week, former State Sen. Lynne Walz launched an exploratory committee to consider a 2026 run for Nebraska governor on the Democratic side. 
Republicans outnumber Democrats in Nebraska by roughly 2-to-1, with about 22% of the electorate either registered either nonpartisan or with a third party. The primary is May 12. The general election is Nov. 3.

NorthWestern Energy said a portion of the new Colstrip shares it will acquire on Jan. 1, 2026, will be transferred to a new subsidiary — one the utility said is not under the authority of the Public Service Commission.
In a recent letter to regulators, NorthWestern Energy also said the deal does not require approval by the Public Service Commission.
NorthWestern sent the letter in response to questions from the Public Service Commission about an October filing the utility made with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission about the new shares.
In the filing, the subsidiary, called NorthWestern Colstrip 370 Pu LLC, requests federal approval for selling electricity on its own as a separate and “unregulated” entity.
The filing has raised questions from not only the Public Service Commission — charged with regulating monopoly utilities in the state — but also a Montana energy watchdog.
For starters, does the filing leapfrog a critical step?
Does the transfer of assets from a regulated utility — whether Puget Sound Energy or NorthWestern — to a NorthWestern holding company subsidiary require federal and state regulatory approvals?
And either way, what does it mean for existing customers?
In a unanimous decision Friday, the Public Service Commission voted to hire outside counsel to intervene in the docket, and in subsequent motions on Monday, it revised the deal to spend as much as $25,000 on the intervention.
“The Commission felt it was important to intervene because we have deep concerns about whether the actions of NorthWestern Energy were in the public interest and what the impacts to customer bills will be based on these decisions they’ve made,” said Public Service Commission spokesperson Alana Lake.
Acquiring more Colstrip shares
In the last couple of years, NorthWestern Energy announced two deals to acquire additional shares of the coal-fired plant at Colstrip, taking its ownership from 15% to 55% of the plant as of Jan. 1, 2026.
NorthWestern announced the price tag for the acquisitions at Colstrip units 3 and 4 to be zero dollars, even as other companies back away from coal, facing state restrictions on carbon emissions and steep upkeep for old plants. (Units 1 and 2 were shuttered in 2020.)
NorthWestern Energy announced in July 2024 it would acquire Puget Sound Energy’s 370 megawatts of the Colstrip Plant.
The utility said that acquisition, coupled with a previously announced deal to acquire Avista’s 222 megawatts, would ensure Montana customers have “cost-effective generation” available during a transition to a “cleaner energy future.”
NorthWestern said the acquisition of the Puget shares would provide a benefit to existing customers starting on Jan. 1, 2026.
But in its letter to the Public Service Commission, NorthWestern described a different plan for the Puget shares. It said its subsidiary, NorthWestern Colstrip 370 Pu LLC, intends to sell the energy on the wholesale market under federal jurisdiction until NorthWestern customers need the capacity.
“To that end, Colstrip 370Pu entered into a 21-month contract with Mercuria Energy America, LLC, for the sale of all the output of the Puget Share,” NorthWestern said in its letter.
Bloomberg describes Mercuria as an energy and commodity trading company.
Separate from this case, but at the fore in Montana, is significant demand from data centers on the near horizon, a controversial issue that’s unfolding in communities and at the Public Service Commission.
NorthWestern acknowledged it included the Puget shares in its own capacity forecasts, but also said analyses, both before and after the announced acquisition, show it could meet its energy obligations without those shares.
So setting the asset aside is a benefit to customers, NorthWestern said.
“Holding the Puget Share outside the Montana Utility (NorthWestern Energy) relieves customers of responsibility for any costs or liabilities associated with the asset prior to it being required to meet utility load, while allowing the company an opportunity to offset O&M (operations and maintenance) costs through wholesale sales,” NorthWestern said.
Is it indeed a good deal for existing customers, as the utility said?
Anne Hedges, head of the Montana Environmental Information Center and one of NorthWestern’s outspoken critics, said other utilities have created similar setups, and the deal isn’t unusual.
But NorthWestern submitted the proposal to the feds just last month, and with the shares set to transfer come 2026, there’s little time to tell how customers will be affected.
“This deserves a whole lot more attention than NorthWestern is allowing, and that is what is so frustrating,” Hedges said.
Energy conservation group moves to intervene
Problems already are apparent in the filing in the federal case, however, said the Montana Environmental Information Center, a nonprofit and conservation watchdog, in its request to participate in the federal case.
For one thing, the nonprofit argues the subsidiary doesn’t show it secured federal authorization for the planned transfers in the first place.
In the absence of that authorization — or, alternatively, an explanation for why one isn’t necessary — the subsidiary’s filing to get approval for selling energy wholesale is “fatal,” the nonprofit argues.
Secondly, in the filing, the NorthWestern subsidiary has not shown existing customers aren’t getting shorted, the Montana Environmental Information Center argued.
The subsidiary’s filing is a request for a pricing structure for the plan to sell energy on the wholesale market. But the nonprofit said evidence suggests existing customers are getting a raw deal compared to anyone who might benefit from the wholesale sales.
For example, the maintenance costs the subsidiary provides in the filing are historical ones, lower than future projected costs, the nonprofit said. Additionally, it said, a new fuel agreement increases those costs at Colstrip as of Jan. 1, 2026.
In other words, the NorthWestern subsidiary “significantly underestimates” actual maintenance and operations costs, the nonprofit said. And it said the subsidiary itself describes its pricing structure as representing “ceiling rates,” meaning actual rates paid by wholesale customers could be lower.
“This means that NorthWestern’s retail customers will likely pay more than the affiliate’s wholesale customers for Colstrip-generated power, and risk being charged the affiliate’s unrecovered costs to maintain and operate the plants,” the nonprofit said.
Citing a statement by NorthWestern Energy, it also said the utility appears to have transferred transmission capacity to the new subsidiary “on terms that may reflect a subsidy by the utility’s retail customers.”
(In the meantime, NorthWestern continues to argue its transmission infrastructure is “severely constrained” and requires additional capital for reliable service, the nonprofit said.)
Hegdes said the cost of operations and maintenance for the Puget shares might be close to $25 million. NorthWestern earlier said the Avista shares would cost $18 million in operations and maintenance, and it asked to temporarily tap a customer credit to pay.
To ensure existing customers aren’t picking up the tab for costs that aren’t theirs, Hedges said state and federal regulators need data from NorthWestern, evidence of firewalls, and time for a rigorous assessment.
Instead, she said NorthWestern is offering a “shell game” and short shrifting the federal review process.
“We need transparency to show that NorthWestern and its market customers are the ones who are going to be shouldering those costs,” Hedges said.
Public Service Commission ponies up to intervene
In a Nov. 5 letter, the Public Service Commission asked NorthWestern Energy questions about the federal filing and pointed out its own role in overseeing utilities.
“The Commission has consistently exercised authority over mergers, sales, and transfers of utilities and utility property,” the letter said. But it said “it appears that NorthWestern Energy intends to transfer property that it has characterized as utility property.”
The letter asked NorthWestern to clarify whether it would seek approval from the Public Service Commission, and it asked for a “comprehensive explanation” if the answer was no.
In its response, NorthWestern Energy said it doesn’t own the Puget shares nor is it acquiring them “at this time,” and a separate “non-utility subsidiary” will acquire them on Jan. 1, 2026, so there’s “no basis” for the Public Service Commission to assert jurisdiction.
“Neither the Puget Share nor the Puget Agreement (the contract to acquire the Puget shares) has ever been used to serve Montana customers, placed in rate base, or recovered through Montana rates,” NorthWestern said. “The transfer of ownership will occur directly between Puget Sound Energy and Colstrip 370Pu, which is not a regulated public utility.”
But Lake, executive director for the Public Service Commission, said the Commission continues to have questions about the deal, including whether NorthWestern’s assertion the Puget shares transaction isn’t subject to state regulatory authority has merit.
Lake said she expects the Commission also will open a docket to investigate that question. For the time being, however, she said the priority is to ensure the Public Service Commission is able to intervene in the federal case given the risk the deal poses to customers.
The Public Service Commission is seeking late-intervener status in the case.
In one of its filings, the NorthWestern subsidiary explains why the call for federal approval of the transfer should be rejected. In part, it asserts the transfer of shares isn’t relevant to its pending request — for a wholesale pricing structure — and the amount of money at stake doesn’t hit the threshold for approval anyway.
Friday, Mike Green, a NorthWestern official, apologized to commissioners for not keeping them better apprised of its plans with the Colstrip plant.
“We’ve had some discussion about whether or not we should have come to the commission and sought your approval,” Green said at the meeting. “I will submit to you, we probably should have told you what we were doing, but I will also respectfully submit we didn’t need to, and there was no basis for us to ask for approval.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1248907535-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 19:57:14.864780

The bridge, which stands 165 feet over Vermont’s deepest gorge, draws hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.

This story by Lukas Dunford was first published in Valley News on Nov. 25, 2025.
QUECHEE — Traffic on the Quechee Gorge Bridge will continue to be limited to one alternating lane this winter due to delays in the ongoing $23.9 million bridge rehabilitation project. This will be the second winter in a row in which traffic on the bridge, which carries Route 4 some 285 feet across the Ottauqueechee River, has been restricted to one lane.
“I think it’s under two minutes … before the light will change,” said Nick Tsouknakis, owner of the nearby Quechee Pizza Chef. “So, you know, once people realize that, then it’s not that much of an issue.”
While the delays may be minor, Tsouknakis does attribute a decrease in the numbers of passersby to the bridge construction, which has been ongoing from spring to late fall since 2023.
“We’re going on 32 years here, and we’ve had constant gains over the years,” Tsouknakis said. “But less so since the bridge has been worked on.”
Route 4 is a primary connector between the Connecticut River Valley and destinations further west, from skiers traveling toward Killington to trucks driving to the New York Thruway. The bridge, which stands 165 feet over Vermont’s deepest gorge, draws hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.
Originally expected to be completed in 2024, the project has been extended by delays due to supply chain issues and staffing shortages, according to the Vermont Agency of Transportation, or VTrans.
Work has included rehabilitation and cleaning of the structural steel arch and its framing, which support the bridge deck, according to VTrans. In addition, railings and new sidewalks will be constructed.
In the construction season that is now concluding, workers completed a driving lane and walkway on the bridge’s south side, according to VTrans. Work on the north side, however, won’t be finished by the end of this year’s construction, as was originally planned.
The delay stems from the discovery of “additional deterioration of critical components of the steel arch” in the summer of 2024, according to a news release from VTrans last week. The development required additional design and detailing, the release said.
The extra work required traffic to be restricted to one alternating lane last winter, and is also the cause of this winter’s inability to open both lanes, according to the release. The bridge sits beside the Quechee State Park, which has closed certain trails during construction. Pizza Chef is among several nearby shops and restaurants that have experienced decreased traffic during construction.
Still, Tsouknakis understands the need for the bridge construction.
“It was something that needed to be done,” he said. “At the end of the day, I think it’ll be really nice.”
Although the north side has no accessible sidewalk, the contractor has vacated the southwest parking lot, which is now open to the public for parking, according to the project website. There is a protected sidewalk from the lot to the accessible bridge sidewalk.   
Construction will resume in March 2026 under the project contracted by the Glenmont, N.Y.-based Harrison & Burrowes Bridge Constructors, Inc. VTrans expects the project to be completed with two lanes of traffic and both sidewalks open for public use by late June.

The allegations center on how the state’s email management system handles Honor Wyoming’s emails to lawmakers. 
The post Dark money group questions transparency of Wyoming lawmakers, legislative staff appeared first on WyoFile .","Honor Wyoming, a conservative political group in Wyoming, has alleged since at least January that the state is blocking and censoring constituent emails to lawmakers, threatening to take legal action as a result. 
The allegations have led to the creation of a legislative panel to examine the matter, and even prompted some critics to accuse the group of pushing for transparency while not being open about its own leadership.
Since the organization made an expensive entrance into the state’s political landscape in 2024 via social media ads and billboards, Honor Wyoming has offered a convenient way for its website visitors to bulk email Wyoming lawmakers. 
When that resulted in thousands of emails landing in lawmaker junk or quarantine folders due to the state email management system’s default security settings, Honor Wyoming cried foul, describing the situation as a free speech violation. 
“Whether wittingly or unwittingly, the Wyoming Legislative Services [sic] Office has been censoring communications with legislators,” the group posted on its website in March. Three months earlier, the group had sent a letter to the state, threatening legal action if the situation was not remedied. 
In April, the Legislature formed a subcommittee to evaluate the group’s concerns in the off-season, also known as the interim, and to better understand the inner mechanics of Microsoft Outlook, the email management system used by the state of Wyoming. Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, co-chaired the subcommittee with Sen. Barry Crago, R-Buffalo, alongside members Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, and Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson. 
Ultimately, the four lawmakers split on whether legislation was necessary, and tensions flared last week as the Management Council discussed the subcommittee’s findings. 
“All of the emails are being delivered,” Crago said at the meeting in Cheyenne. “Every one of us in this room and all of our colleagues are receiving the emails from the group that has showed up here to testify and asked for transparency, oddly enough, but can’t even tell us who their board of directors is. I find that somewhat ironic — asking for transparency when unwilling to tell us who’s paying the bills back home.”

Because Honor Wyoming is a nonprofit, it is not legally required to publicly disclose the details of its funding. When the source of political money isn’t known — unlike funds raised by politicians and political action committees, which are required by law to be publicly disclosed — it is referred to as dark money. According to The Center for Public Integrity, nonprofits and corporate entities, such as limited liability companies, are the two most common vehicles for dark money in politics. 
At the meeting, Sen. Gierau asked the group’s attorney, Drake Hill, about the organization’s makeup.
Hill is married to former Superintendent of Public Instruction Cindy Hill, and has previously served as chairman of the Wyoming Republican Party. 
“Can you tell me a little bit about Honor Wyoming? Like, who’s the board of directors? Who’s in charge of this outfit, Mr. Hill?” Gierau asked. 
“I know that’s been a question that has been directed, and I know you’ve been interested in that question through the press yourself,” Hill said. “Honestly, I’m not aware of who the board members are, but I do know that the scope of their mission is to bring awareness to issues.”
Meanwhile, Rep. Bear led the charge on a bill to require legislative staff to produce a list of emails received by legislators. That way, Bear said, constituents concerned that lawmakers were not receiving their emails could confirm with staff. 
“There’s another side to this story. And that is that our constituents would like to contact us via email, and I’d like to be an advocate for those constituents,” Bear told the council. 
Ultimately, the council voted 5-5 to sponsor the legislation. Without a majority, the bill failed, but an individual lawmaker is likely to sponsor it for the 2026 budget session.

Staff explanation
The Management Council’s discussion began with a presentation by Legislative Service Office staff members. 
“I think maybe just to start off with, it’s important for everyone to know that these emails in question were all being delivered to legislators,” LSO Director Matt Obrecht said. “It was just a question of whether they’re going to your inbox, your junk folder, or your quarantine folder, all of which legislators have access to.”
Since the subcommittee met in July, “LSO has done a tremendous amount of work,” Anthony Sara, deputy administrator of operations, told lawmakers. 
“We’ve done a deep dive into our legislative email system and probably spent more time on this than anything else this [legislative off-season,]” Sara said. “It’s something that we obviously take very seriously and understand that you have to have your legislative email for important communication with your constituents.” 
That work included extended discussions with Microsoft and education with lawmakers about how to check junk folders and how to release quarantined messages into their inboxes. Staff also updated the Legislature’s website to inform constituents of who to contact if they’re concerned their emails are not being delivered. 
While some changes were made to the system settings, Sara said LSO “also learned that a lot of this is out of our control.
“The scores that Microsoft gives each email for spam, what’s called the spam confidence level, cannot be adjusted by users and is 100% determined by Microsoft,” Sara said. 
Senate President Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester, asked LSO about Honor Wyoming’s accusations. 
“It’s been insinuated online and on billboards that our staff and certain legislators are purposely censoring emails and content thereof. Is that true?” Biteman said. 
“No, I can assure you that nobody within our IT section is selecting where emails go, nor do we have the resources to do that with the amount of emails that you all get,” Sara said. 
Lawmaker debate
Bear told the council that emails that land in a junk or quarantine folder are less likely to be seen. And as a lawmaker, he said he wants to “hear from everybody that I can.” 
A bill to require legislative staff to publish a partially redacted list of quarantined email addresses each working day of the legislative session and once a week otherwise, Bear said, would help solve that problem. 
“I’m here today to try to come up with a solution so that even though we have [security] risks that we live with, the First Amendment opportunity of our constituents to contact us and discuss things with us via email is continued,” Bear said. “There are people like the good Vice President of the Senate and myself who have fought, many have died, so that we would have a First Amendment, a right for the people to bring their grievances to their government.” 
Throughout his testimony, Bear referred to constituent emails as being “blocked” — a characterization that several members of the committee disputed.

“We’ve established the fact that no emails have been blocked. So you’re being disingenuous when you use the term ‘blocked,’” Biteman said. 
Bear said he would “attempt not to use the word,” but “I will tell you that’s my perception. That’s the perception of probably 99% of people out there.”
Whatever term the Legislature finds appropriate, Hill, Honor Wyoming’s attorney, said, the objective is “that we allow for constituents to be heard in whatever manner” the constituent uses to communicate.
“None is more important than another and none is less important than the other,” Hill said. 
Neiman also spoke in favor of the bill, arguing that the issue is much larger than Honor Wyoming. 
“As I’ve listened to this, I guess the thing that kind of resonates with me is, this really isn’t because of one organization’s issue,” Neiman said. “This wasn’t specific — I mean, we have one organization that came and spoke to us today, but there were multiple organizations that were discussed, [American Gun Owners Association], and others.” 
The bill “isn’t for one organization, it’s for the citizens of the state of Wyoming,” he said. 
But if the issue was one of importance to Wyoming residents, Biteman said, “this room would be full of people testifying. Nobody showed up. Not a single person other than the group who’s caused this whole thing to be before us today.”
Sen. Tara Nethercott, R-Cheyenne, took things further, arguing that the bill was about something else entirely. 
“The conversation we’re really having here today is about Wyoming being taken over by large political, well-funded organizations that have the ability to control your elected [officials] through fear and misinformation, wittingly or unwittingly, creating confusion and fractionalization of our great state,” Nethercott said. “It must come to an end.”
In the meantime, Nethercott encouraged residents “to keep communicating with your legislators directly” using the contact information provided on the Wyoming Legislature’s website. 
Sen. Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, and Reps. Bear, Neiman, Jeremy Haroldson, R-Wheatland and Scott Heiner, R-Green River, voted in favor of the bill, while Sens. Biteman, Crago, Gierau, and Nethercott and Rep. Mike Yin, D-Jackson, voted against it.

(Gerald Herbert/The Associated Press)Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham, who rolled back government vaccine distribution as the state’s top public health official, has been appointed to the second highest position at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Abraham, a 71-year-old medical doctor, lives in rural Richland Parish and served as a Republican congressman representing Northeast Louisiana from 2015-21. He could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
Abraham has espoused skepticism about vaccines for years. After becoming appointed surgeon general last year, he scuttled the Louisiana’s longstanding vaccine promotion program, shutting down its advertising campaign and eliminating mass vaccination events the state has conducted for decades for the flu and other diseases. 

Recently, Abraham also drew criticism from other public health experts for waiting several weeks to make a public statement and offer guidance on whooping cough after two babies in Louisiana died from the illness earlier this year. 
Gov. Jeff Landry, who has also expressed skepticism about vaccines, praised Abraham’s appointment to help lead the nation’s leading public health organization. 
“While we are certainly sad to lose Dr. Abraham here in Louisiana, we are thrilled to see the CDC gain a selfless leader,” Landry said in a prepared statement Tuesday. “There is no better advocate for health freedom than Ralph Abraham.”
Prior to his government roles, Abraham worked as a veterinarian treating animals for a decade and then returned to school and earned his medical degree in 1994 at age 40. He operated a general practice  and still treats patients on a part-time basis at a rural health clinic in Louisiana’s Mississippi Delta region, one of the poorest sections of the country. 
Gov. Jeff Landry tapped Abraham to be Louisiana’s health secretary for the first several months of Landry’s administration in 2024. The governor and state lawmakers then created the position of state surgeon general specifically for Abraham last year. In that job, the former congressman has been in charge of the state’s public health efforts and said he planned to focus on preventing diseases such as diabetes and obesity in Louisiana. 
In addition to casting doubt on the need for vaccines, Abraham has also promoted COVID-19 treatments that infectious disease experts have widely debunked. They include taking hydroxychloroquine, a medication used to prevent malaria, and ivermectin, a drug used for parasitic infections. 

As recently as last month, Abraham cited talking points promoted by anti-vaccine groups in a public appearance. At a press conference, he highlighted a Cleveland Clinic study that skeptics use to cast doubt on the usefulness of the flu vaccine. 
Staff at the Cleveland Clinic and other disease experts have pushed back on the interpretation of the study Abraham reiterated and emphasized the study doesn’t prove the flu vaccine is ineffective.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/surgeon-general.jpg,,,2025-11-25 19:57:14.864780

A federal employee who drove into two buildings in Waitsfield early Sunday morning was charged with drunken driving and negligent operation of a vehicle, according to Vermont State Police.
Eric McCarthy, 45, of Essex, was driving a 2016 3-series BMW that went off the road, hit the deck of a building and crossed through a yard before crashing into the side of yet another building, according to first responders.
“This person threaded the needle,” said David Darr, who owns one of the buildings. His son lives in an apartment on the top floor and heard the crash in the middle of the night, he said.
He said the crash took out a “substantial” Darrad Services business sign on a post, in addition to a 6-by-6 column that holds up the porch. The front stairs were “ripped to shreds,” he said.
The car then sped over the side of the building, missing a large elm tree, before launching into a second building, where the car remained, hanging off the first floor, Darr said.
A Vermont State Police report said troopers found McCarthy with “signs of impairment.” He was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and negligent driving, and later released with a notice to appear in Washington County Superior Court on Jan. 15, according to the police report.
A spokesperson from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, confirmed the person involved in the crash is a department employee but declined to comment further.
“DHS holds its employees to the highest standards of integrity and professionalism,” spokesperson Matthew J. Tragesser said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “USCIS is aware of an employee who was involved in a crash near Waitsfield. We are unable to comment further as the investigation is ongoing.”
According to McCarthy’s online profile, he works as an operations support specialist at USCIS and a management and program analyst at DHS. He did not respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment.

Emergency teams responded to the car crash on Main Street in the small Washington County town at about 12:42 a.m. on Nov. 23 and found a car embedded in the side of a red wooden building that houses three local businesses.
A passenger, identified as Katylyn Ruhl, 47, of Colchester was taken to Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin with serious injuries, said Sgt. Tylor Rancourt from the state police Berlin barracks. She has since been discharged.
Emergency personnel responding to the scene said they found two buildings damaged. 
Jared Young, chief of the Waitsfield-Fayston Fire Department, said the car first struck a building at 4457 Main Street and then crashed into the first floor of a  second building at 4429 Main Street. His department assisted the Mad River Valley Ambulance Service in securing the crashed vehicle and extricating the passenger. 
When the fire department left the scene around 2 a.m., the vehicle was still embedded in the building, Young said. State Police coordinated with a wrecker service to extract the vehicle from the structure later, he said.
The ambulance crew found the passenger in the car and the driver standing by the car in the building, which was stuck on the first floor, hanging over the lower level of the building, said Kevin Van Schaick, department head for rescue at the ambulance service, in an email.
“We had to gain access to the room below to support and stabilize the vehicle before it fell the rest of the way through the floor, as nearly all the joists were broken. The vehicle was kind of balanced on a stairwell wall. We installed some rescue struts to take the weight of the front of the car and forced the rear to rest on the foundation,” he added. The passenger was then safely removed from the car, he said.
Business owners said they were grateful there weren’t more injuries.
“Just the logic of that happening during the day or when there are people around, it would have been terrible,” said Darr, the owner of the first building that was struck, from where he runs Darrad Services, a 33-year-old computer service family business.
Jen Service, who rents a space in the second building for a massage service and a retail shop called Bridge &Main, said she learned about the car crashing into the building on Sunday morning when a friend texted her.
She and her husband headed over to check it out and initially thought somebody had just clipped the building. “But when we pulled around into the parking lot and saw the gaping hole in the side of the building, we were both just kind of struck,” she said.
While it’s not ideal to have to close for a few days right around the holidays, Service said she is glad the damage wasn’t worse. The retail shop and the massage room remain intact.
Kellee Mazer, who has owned the second building since 2022, has three tenants there. She said she is relieved no one was hurt and none of the merchandise was damaged despite the severity of the crash. She said she is waiting for insurance and engineering estimates and plans to “figure out what it takes” to fix the building.

(Courtesy image)University officials at Carroll College announced this week that Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Jennifer Glowienka will become the college’s 20th president, beginning next July.
Glowienka has served as interim co-president of the college since June.
“I am deeply honored to be chosen as the 20th President of Carroll College, and I am humbled by the tremendous outpouring of support from the Carroll community,” Glowienka said in a statement. “I have dedicated my professional career to this remarkable institution, which prepares ethical leaders who engage the world with purpose and hope. I look forward to strengthening and expanding the ways Carroll fulfills its mission, serving learners across all stages of their educational journey. It has been a privilege to serve alongside Bishop Vetter over the past five months, and I look forward to continuing our strong partnership and shared leadership in the year ahead.”
Carroll’s last president, John Cech, retired at the end of the school year in May.
The university previously had announced that its seven-month national search for a new president had been successful with William Ruud, who had most recently served as president of Marietta College of Ohio from 2016-2023, named as the school’s 19th president.
However, less than a week before Ruud was scheduled to begin his tenure at Carroll, university officials announced that “due to unforeseen events,” he will not become the college’s next president.
The Carroll College Board of Trustees appointed Glowienka and Bishop Austin Vetter, Bishop of the Diocese of Helena, to serve as interim co-presidents for the 2025–26 academic year.
Glowienka’s elevation to college president makes her the first woman to hold a fully-appointed presidential role in the college’s 116-year history, according to the university.
Through a press release, the board of trustees stated her selection was unanimous, and drew broad support form the Presidential Search Committee comprising trustees, faculty, staff, alumni, students and community members.
“Dr. Glowienka embodies the values, mission, and future of Carroll College,” Joyce Stewart, Chair of the Board of Trustees and Co-Chair of the Presidential Search Committee, said. “Her deep understanding of higher education, her compassion, and her unwavering commitment to the people of Carroll have been evident throughout her more than twenty years of service. She leads with humility, wisdom, and purpose, and has earned the confidence and respect of the Carroll community.”
The university release said that during her brief tenure as co-president, Glowienka had “demonstrated strong, forward-looking leadership and a clear readiness to guide Carroll into its next chapter,” and that she understands the community and the school’s mission and potential.
“Dr. Glowienka has a real heart for Carroll College,” Bishop Vetter, said. “She’s wise, sincere, and faith-filled in how she leads. She listens well, brings people together, and always keeps what’s best for Carroll at the center. I truly believe the college’s future is bright with her guiding the way. Dr. Glowienka embodies what St. John Paul II hoped, that ‘Carroll College is meant to be a beacon to the Church in the Northwest.’”
Glowienka attended Boise State University for her undergraduate degree and holds a Ph.D. in evolutionary botany from the University of Colorado at Boulder.  She began her academic teaching career at Carroll in 2003 as an assistant professor of biology.
She was named the James J. Manion Endowed Professor in the Biological Sciences in 2018 and received Carroll’s Distinguished Scholar Award in 2008. Over her career, she has helped secure more than $1.5 million in external research grants and has played a key role in obtaining funding for infrastructure projects and programmatic start-up costs, strengthening Carroll’s academic offerings and long-term institutional capacity.
In 2018, Clowienka was named Assistant Dean of Instruction and she became Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs the following year.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JenniferGlowienka-top-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-25 18:59:04.102732

All three Teton County resorts have postponed their planned openings because of little snow and warm temperatures that have frustrated snowmaking.
The post Jackson Hole latest Wyoming ski area to delay opening for lack of snow appeared first on WyoFile .","All three Teton County ski resorts have delayed their season-opening dates due to a lack of snow and warm temperatures that have limited snowmaking.
The Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, the largest resort in Wyoming, announced Tuesday that it would not open its 60th anniversary season as scheduled on Friday. That followed news from Snow King Mountain and Grand Targhee Resort that they would postpone their season-opening dates because of limited snowmaking and little natural snowfall.
Ski runs across the county look sad, with only patches of man-made snow dotting the otherwise brown slopes. Grand Targhee above Alta delayed last Friday’s planned opening indefinitely and Snow King, the Jackson “Town Hill,” has backed off its commitment to a Dec. 5 start.
“Luckily, we have so many other assets that people can enjoy,” said Rick Howe, president of the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce. “I know a lot of the hospitality partners are talking about putting together some specials.”
At Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, officials painted a bleak picture.
“We have received 26 inches of snow mid-mountain through November, and warm conditions have affected snowmaking efforts, resulting in insufficient coverage to open terrain,” the resort posted on social media.
“It could still end up snowing, there just isn’t a whole lot of confidence right now.” Alan Smith
Workers will make snow when possible, monitor the snowpack as usual and announce an opening date “when conditions meet our standards for guest and staff safety,” officials stated. As the 60th anniversary year of the ski area, the resort anticipates the 2025-26 year to be a “milestone winter.”
At Grand Targhee, officials reminded old timers that they retired their tag-line “snow from heaven, not hoses” some time back. The resort turned to Open Snow forecaster Alan Smith last week to explain.
“November has been unseasonably warm with temperatures running 8-10°F above average through the first 16 days of the month,” he wrote. “This warmth combined with minimal natural snowfall since October has prevented an early season snowpack from building as is typical at this time of year.”
He predicted colder weather in the coming weeks, but perhaps still warmer temperatures than average, and some light snow. “It could still end up snowing,” he said of changing forecasts, “there just isn’t a whole lot of confidence [in that] right now.”
At Snow King, manager Ryan Stanley told the Jackson Hole News&Guide last week that it usually takes three weeks of snowmaking before the slopes are fit for skiing. None of the resorts have set a firm new opening date.
Across the rest of Wyoming, the Snowy Range Ski Area near Centennial has planned a Dec. 5 opening date, as has the White Pine ski area above Pinedale. Hogadon Basin Ski Area above Casper plans to open Dec. 6, according to its website.

About what’s known and who knows it. About why what’s known has never moved out of the realm of rumor and into the investigatory record.
Savannah Standing Bear’s family and friends have plenty of rumors, but not many answers. It’s been eight months since she disappeared from the Parmelee community on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, and the only thing that feels certain, they say, is the feeling that someone knows something.
 

 Telling their stories: MMIP in South Dakota

South Dakota Searchlight and ICT have partnered on a long-term project, funded in part by a grant from the Fund for Investigative Journalism, that aims to provide a snapshot of Missing and Murdered Indigenous People cases by combining multiple sources of data.
The publications have also created a form for people to share a tip about their missing loved one, for possible inclusion in the project.



There’s also a nagging suspicion that something either won’t be shared with authorities, or won’t bring resolution if and when it’s reported.
“The feeling around here is you can murder a Native woman and get away with it,” said Hollis Flowers, a family friend who’s helped lead the push to keep Savannah’s story in the public eye as temperatures drop and another season of uncertainty begins.
There’s still hope, though, that an answer will emerge — especially after a celebration last week in Parmelee meant to mark Savannah’s 23rd birthday and keep her name on the tip of the community’s tongue. 
About a week before the event, Savannah’s mother, Gayla Smith, said the eldest of her two daughters has a heart for those who suffer. It’s a personality trait that’s been evident for as long as Smith can remember.
“She’d see people on the street, like when we would go to Rapid City,” Smith said, referring to the homeless population. “She’d see people like that, she would always want to go and help them.”
It’s Smith who’s suffered since March 24. That was the last day she heard from Savannah, setting off a police investigation and a series of searches that’s continued into the fall.
60% of missing South Dakotans are Native Americans
Savannah is one of an unclear number of Native Americans who’ve gone missing or been killed in the state of South Dakota. Nationally and internationally, the movement to draw attention to Indigenous people who disappear or die under violent circumstances is commonly called Missing and Murdered Indigenous People. 
South Dakota has taken some steps to track the cases in recent years. The South Dakota Missing Persons Clearinghouse, which launched in 2020, lists the names of those whose disappearances have been reported to law enforcement locally and passed along to the South Dakota Attorney General’s Office. On any given day, the list has at least 100 missing people, though the names shift in real time as people are found or go missing.
On Tuesday morning, Native Americans made up 60% of the 112 listed names. Of 59 missing females, 66% were Native American. The percentages, as compiled periodically by South Dakota Searchlight, typically fall in or near that range.
Around 8.5% of South Dakotans are Native American, according to census data.
Ten of the cases in the state missing persons clearinghouse as of Tuesday morning — Savannah’s among them — came from the Rosebud Sioux Tribal Police Department. That’s approximately 9% of current missing persons cases. Residents of the Rosebud Reservation represent less than 3% of South Dakota’s total population.
A mother’s warning
The last time she saw her daughter, Smith remembers warning her to stay at home and stay out of trouble. 
“But when I got up, she wasn’t in her room,” Smith said. 
In the days following, Smith said she heard different things from different family members. Some said that Savannah had ended up in the tribal jail and would be out later, but when Smith looked into it, her daughter hadn’t been in jail. 
So Smith went to check in with other relatives around the Rosebud Reservation. One relative in Parmelee said Savannah had “walked off” with a friend, Smith said, but it wasn’t a friend she recognized. 
‘Truly a homebody’
Smith and Standing Bear are close. They’ve always been.
One of Savannah’s distinguishing features, noted on the missing persons posters hung up around the Rosebud Reservation and posted to social media, is a tattoo of her mother’s first name under her right eye.
It’s now been eight months since Smith last heard from her daughter, since Savannah played with her nephew and since Savannah logged into the social media accounts where she loved to chat.

“She has a really big heart,” Smith said. “She’s my baby.”
She loves to listen to music, take photos and just hang out, Smith said. Her absence has left a void for her family. 
“She loved the sunset, taking pictures of it,” Smith said. “It’s really hard for me to see the sun go down without her.”
Tips don’t yield results
Tips have yet to aid in the search for Savannah, the family said.
Early this year, reports that Savannah was sighted at a Maverik gas station on the north side of Rapid City — two and a half hours from where she was last seen — led investigators to switch gears and focus on the Black Hills city. 
Police spent days combing over footage from the gas station, only to find the “sighting” was a different Native American woman, tribal officials said. 
“There’s no proof she ever left,” Flowers, the family friend, said in May. 
More frightening tips have emerged, as well. 
Once, the family heard that a body was found on the reservation. Family members jumped in to respond alongside law enforcement, but it turned out to be animal remains that had previously been reported and documented, according to officials with Rosebud Sioux Tribe Emergency Services.
Frustration grows
That all-for-naught excursion over animal bones was just one entry on a long list of disappointing searches for Savannah’s father, Severt Standing Bear, who was among those to accompany police when the alleged human remains were discovered. He told South Dakota Searchlight this month that he’s lost track of how many trips he’s made through the areas he thinks Savannah might be. It’s been that way since March.

“When I first heard it, my thought was, ‘Let’s go. We’ll go find her,’” he said.
He’s also passed along more tips than he can remember to the Rosebud Tribal Police and the detective assigned to Savannah’s case.
“I can’t say that I call them every day, but I bug the s— out of them,” Severt said. “To no avail.”
Rosebud Police Chief Waycee His Holy Horse did not reply to South Dakota Searchlight requests for an interview on Savannah’s case this month.
Having spent as much time searching as he has, Severt said, he’s come to understand the frustration felt by other families that go months, years or longer without knowing what happened to a missing loved one.
“These officials are always coming up and saying, ‘We’re doing these things,’” he said. “But I’ve learned and lived it now, and watched these other people that are missing their precious ones, too. They’re having the same darn problem.”
Communication, collaboration
Dolores “Totes” Waln, a Rosebud Sioux Tribal Council member, said her experience helping the family has exposed gaps in communication between emergency managers, police and the volunteers who’ve pitched in.
“When they were going to drain the dam, nobody knew about it until we heard it live on the air from the tribal president,” Waln said of a summer search effort from the tribe around a stock dam about 6 miles east of Parmelee, which was discussed on the radio. “And we’re all like, ‘What?’”
‘We can’t breathe until we know:’ One more search planned for missing member of Standing Rock Tribe

Shelby Lorenzo Homer, of the 4Corners K9 Search And Rescue nonprofit, said collaboration and communication has been a struggle for months. Recently, however, she worked with agents from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs on a search in October. 
“That’s when we really started seeing some communication and some collaboration,” Homer said.
In a statement, a BIA spokesperson said the agency is working closely with the FBI and Rosebud Sioux Department of Public Safety on Savannah’s case, coordinating search operations, offering a $5,000 reward through its Missing and Murdered Unit and “actively supporting Savanah’s family during this difficult time.”
After Savannah’s birthday celebration and candlelight vigil in Parmelee over the weekend, the hope is that extra attention can be combined with improved collaboration to yield results.
The hope goes all the way to the top in Rosebud. Tips sometimes land in the inbox of Rosebud Sioux Tribal President Kathleen Wooden Knife. When that happens, the president said, she passes them along to police.
Then, like everyone else, she waits.
“And my hope is that ‘OK, this time will be the time we’re going to find her,’” Wooden Knife said. “It hasn’t happened yet.”
The BIA’s $5,000 reward is open to anyone with information that can lead authorities to Savannah. The BIA can be reached at (833) 560-2065, by email at OJS_MMU@bia.gov, or by texting keyword BIAMMU and a tip to 847411.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled_Artwork-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-25 18:59:04.102732

(Getty Images)Idaho state and local health officials are investigating a recent increase in illnesses after people drank raw milk.
Since August, more than two dozen Idahoans have reported they’ve become ill after drinking raw milk, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare says.
At least 23 of those cases were from the bacteria Campylobacter, six of which were in kids under 12 years old. Three cases were from infections from the Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, also known as STEC.
Raw milk isn’t pasteurized, a process that involves heating the milk to kill bacteria — like Campylobacter, E. coli, Listeria and Salmonella — that can be present in raw milk. 
 What are the symptoms of infections linked to raw milk?

Symptoms of infections from bacteria that can be in raw milk include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and dehydration. Complications can be severe, especially in people at higher risk such as young children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems. 
Health officials encourage people who are feeling symptoms after recently drinking raw milk to seek medical care promptly. To report an illness or get more information, officials encourage people to contact their local public health district.

(Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images)The State of Iowa is being sued by an attorney who claims she was fired from the Office of the State Public Defender for online comments made in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder in September.
Maria Ruhtenberg, an attorney for the State Public Defender, is suing the State of Iowa and State Public Defender Jeff Wright in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, alleging violations of her First Amendment right to free speech.
According to the lawsuit, the state hired Ruhtenberg in October 2010 as a trial attorney for the Story County division of the Office of State Public Defender. In May 2013, Ruhtenberg became an assistant appellate defender based in Des Moines.
The lawsuit alleges that throughout her employment, Ruhtenberg’s performance reviews indicated she consistently met or exceeded expectations and that she was never subject to discipline until she was terminated.
The lawsuit alleges that on Sept. 15, 2025, she argued a case before the Iowa Supreme Court and later that day saw the news about the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Judge rules in favor of teacher facing dismissal for Kirk-related posts

According to the lawsuit, Ruhtenberg, on her own time and using her own computer, posted a message on her private Facebook account about Kirk and engaged with other citizens on Facebook about Kirk’s political views.
In her posts, Ruhtenberg indicated her disagreement with the views Kirk had expressed about the Second Amendment and also indicated Kirk’s killer should go to prison.
On Sept. 15, according to the lawsuit, Ruhtenberg’s boss, Appellate Defender Martha Lucey, asked her to join a video conference with First Assistant Public Defender Kurt Swaim and Waterloo Public Defender Office Supervisor Aaron Hawbaker.
During the conference call, the lawsuit alleges, Swaim indicated someone had reported Ruhtenberg’s online comments and provided screenshots of some of her Facebook posts. About one hour after the conference call ended, according to the lawsuit, Lucey told Ruhtenberg she’d been fired and asked her to return all state-owned equipment to the office that afternoon.
According to the lawsuit, the letter Ruhtenberg was given notifying her of her termination stated that she weas being fired due to statements posted on social media — particularly the comments, “Live by the sword, die by the sword,” and, “You reap what you sow,” which were drawn from the Bible.
The state “did not fire Maria for any reason other than her statements posted to social media,” the lawsuit alleges, adding that the online comments “did not impede the performance of her job duties,” damage relations with her coworkers, or cause turmoil within the office.
According to the lawsuit, Ruhtenberg appealed her termination through the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which later issued an order finding the state had failed to prove its interests in the efficient provision of public services outweighed Ruhtenberg’s interests in privately commenting on a matter of public concern.
According to the lawsuit, DIAL ordered the Office of State Public Defender to immediately reinstate Ruhtenberg.
The lawsuit claims the public defender’s “retaliation against Maria was part of a broader attempt by the state to suppress and punish free speech on the issues surrounding Charlie Kirk and his death.” It notes that several conservative Iowa legislators and Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds openly called for public employees to be fired for comments that were critical of Kirk or his views.
“Such deliberate and intentional actions are repugnant to the First Amendment and echo the political repression of the age of McCarthyism, when manufactured lists of ‘subversives’ were used to destroy the lives and reputations of people based on their political views,” the lawsuit alleges.
Ruhtenberg’s lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for violations of freedom of speech through retaliation.
The state has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The Iowa Attorney General’s Office said it does not comment on pending litigation.

After it was legalized in Vermont in 2015, natural burial remained encumbered by cemetery regulation — from grave depth to casket standards. Then in 2023, some advocates opened their own graveyard.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rewilding burial at the Vermont Forest Cemetery.","This story by Will Lindner was first published in The Bridge on Nov. 25, 2025.
She lies at the head of a path into the woods, deceased, supported by a low table and swathed in a white shroud adorned with images of nature. A homemade wreath of autumn leaves, ferns and flowers has been placed upon her. Loved ones gather under a gray October sky, their conversation subdued, but not darkened, by the task before them. They are resolute. In a moment they’ll shepherd her — their mother, grandmother, great-aunt, friend — deeper into the woods to her burial site. Her time upon the earth has ended; her time within the earth, and of the earth, will begin.
Paul Acciavatti, who serves as sexton, or cemetery manager, at the Vermont Forest Cemetery high above Roxbury village, provides instruction. They’ll use straps that pass beneath the body and the board she lies on, and will drape across the necks and shoulders of the bearers on either side. Four volunteers step forward — two young men and two young women. They prepare themselves, then lift. Someone quickly steps forward to support the rear, Paul withdraws the low table, and they set off, followed by the rest of the entourage — 15 or 20 people in quilted vests, sweaters and caps, jackets and jeans; clothing suitable for the season and the moment.
The path descends gradually, then bends to the left. They stop for a rest. Then soon they’re at the gravesite, which Paul has prepared. The mound of dirt beside it is covered with a tarp, and then by a dozen branches in golden foliage. 
“And look,” says someone, peering into the grave. “There are soft leaves on the bottom. It’s so pretty.”
The bearers set the board, and the shrouded figure whom they are honoring, across planks that span the opening. They step back. 
And there is silence. It lingers. … The moment has come. The forest is still.

Natural burial, legalized in Vermont in 2015, is a custom as old as the human race, but provisions have crept into cemetery regulations — such as a requirement to encase the deceased in concrete boxes to stabilize the ground surface — that thwarted the practice. Not that there was much demand for standard burial practices like embalming; and the use of formidable hardwood caskets reflected an entrenched revulsion at the thought of decomposition.
The 2015 law responded to more recent perceptions of our relationship with the environment. Through natural burial, those who wished could purposely merge with nature, helping sustain it as it sustains us. A summary of the law describes the practice as “the burial of unembalmed human remains . . . that rest in either no burial container or in a nontoxic, nonhazardous, plant-derived burial container or shroud [which thus] accelerates conversion of human remains to soil.”
But a problem remained: Vermont’s requirement that graves be at least five feet deep. The mycelial network — fungi that break down organic matter and convey the nutrients to surrounding organisms — operates closer to the surface. The five-foot depth defeated the purpose of legalizing natural burials.
Advocates rallied to amend the law. Among them was Michelle Hogle Acciavatti, a 2005 graduate of Bennington College who later worked in neuroscience and ethics at Boston Children’s Hospital. There, she developed an interest in aiding families facing the loss of a loved one. Over her career she has pursued both conventional and innovative paths to provide these services, working as a funeral director at Guare & Sons Funeral Home in Montpelier, and privately as a death doula.

“What I came to specialize in was less the dying,” she says, “and more what happens after people die, returning to people the skills for caring for their own dead instead of calling in a funeral director. And then I was really fascinated with natural burial and the ability to give our bodies back to the earth.”
When a bill emerged in 2017 to change Vermont’s minimum grave depth to three-and-a-half feet, Michelle (who is married to Paul Acciavatti) lobbied legislators and traveled around the state giving educational presentations on natural burial.
“I would say, like, ‘If you want this for yourself you have to contact your representative and say please pass this bill.’” she said. “We got it to the House floor, and to the Senate floor, and it passed overwhelmingly, because we had a ton of popular support.”
With natural burial now legal, and shallower mandatory depth consistent with its objectives, towns began offering this option in their municipal cemeteries. Calais, where resident Jennifer Whitman had championed the legislation, was one. In Montpelier, Green Mount Cemetery created a section for natural burials. It became a regional movement and now more than 70 cemeteries in New England permit it. 
Yet there’s a difference — irrelevant to some potential customers, but hugely significant to others — between a designated section in a town-maintained cemetery and an undeveloped setting where a body can merge with a robust natural environment. Nothing like that existed in Vermont. With the relevant laws changed, Michelle Acciavatti assumed someone would fill that void.
“I was off to mortuary school,” she says, “because I had this big idea that if I work in a funeral home I’ll be able to reach more people. I was working at Guare’s in Montpelier; we were the first funeral home in the state to have a natural-burial package, and Green Mount, right in our community, was adding a section. 
“Then COVID hit.”

People typically mourned together in funeral homes, but the pandemic quashed indoor gatherings. This dilemma for the aggrieved broadened Michelle’s thinking: natural burials, in safer outdoor spaces, could allow mourners to take upon themselves the ritual of burying the dead, personalizing the ceremony and meeting their own emotional needs.
“So,” she says, “in the summer of 2020, I left the funeral home to start a cemetery.” (As she speaks, with leafy graves near at hand, she sways her 10-month-old son, Nico, in the baby strap around her shoulders. He coos. The cycle of life vibrates like silver around us.)
The Acciavattis (returning to 2020) began looking for land. Real estate prices, besotted by the pandemic, careened wildly, but in the spring of 2021, a logging company that had planned to develop 56.7 acres on Beaver Meadow Road above Roxbury as a source for Norway spruce decided to sell it instead. 
“It had everything we needed,” Michelle recalls, “and it was reasonably priced.”
They used money that Paul’s late mother had left to him unexpectedly. They formed a nonprofit to own and operate the cemetery (headed by an active, participating board drawn largely from supporters whom Michelle had met while advocating for the legal reforms). There were some regulatory hurdles; neither the Act 250 district commission nor the Roxbury selectboard had encountered a land-use proposal like this before; Michelle recalls fielding a question about whether, if a tree blew down in a storm, it would catapult bodies out of the ground.

In the end, their applications were successful. Lots of work lay ahead of them (and still does): developing the gravel parking area at the entrance, the wooden shed there that serves as an office, the curvy dirt road down to another parking area that’s the main gathering spot, and trails that wind through the woods so that people can reach the places within that speak to them of solace and solitude, regeneration and kinship, soil and fungi and roots, and perhaps the spirits they perceive in the ecosphere. 
The Vermont Forest Cemetery opened on Oct. 7, 2023. Three days later, on Oct. 10, a person named Ron was buried there, the cemetery’s first permanent resident.

The cemetery’s property, which is proceeding toward conservation through Vermont Coverts, spans two hillsides that straddle the Third Branch of the White River. Its contours, and statutes applicable to all Vermont cemeteries, leave some areas unusable.
“We probably have about 20 burial acres,” Michelle estimates. 
But it’s all one forest. Michelle (now listed as its founder and head cemeterian), Paul (vice president and sexton), and Michelle’s father, Jim Hogle (formerly chair of Harvard’s biophysics program, but now the president and outreach coordinator for the forest cemetery) have noticed that a gravesite often becomes less central to returning visitors; they partake of the whole forest that has incorporated the person they loved. 
It’s also true that as seasons pass gravesites become less distinct. Conventional headstones are not permitted. People find ways to adorn graves, but the cemetery’s emphasis on natural materials means that eventually nature will take them over. Sometimes, Michelle acknowledges, “we have to compromise between the needs of the forest and the needs of the people.” 
A Marine veteran was buried recently, and the memorial coming from the Veterans Administration will not entirely conform to the cemetery’s standards. The forest will deal. 
Inevitably, then, there’s a degree of anonymity implicit in forest interments. But Paul Acciavatti or Treasurer and Cemeterian Bailey McLaughlin bury a detectable bronze marker, stamped with identifying information, in the center of each grave. 
“We keep track of everybody,” Michelle says. “It’s required. We maintain a map, which is duplicated in the town of Roxbury. Plus, it’s in the cloud.”
And the graves may not forever be distinguishable, but she doesn’t want people’s stories to disappear. There are plans to generate long-form obituaries to accompany the cloud map, recounting the lives of the people who have chosen an inconspicuous resting place.

This is a comparatively inexpensive form of burial, especially if the family conducts most aspects of it (cemetery staff prepares the gravesite). A current ballpark cost is about $2,700. Costs increase as the staff provides more labor, and winter burials cost more. The cemetery can connect people with artisans who offer appropriate wooden or wicker caskets if they prefer something more substantial than a shroud.
Buying in ahead of time — even when there’s no hint of mortality — helps the organization meet its expenses. It is not possible, however, to select a precise spot until death is nearing, for the forest is ever-changing and the cemetery must be able to respond to immediate, seasonal demand. But for family members who wish to lie close together, room can be left for a partner or partners once the first person is interred.
The VFC website also addresses questions about cremains, pet burial, and other concerns. Jim Hogle and Michelle Acciavatti are responsive to calls and emails.
In all, the VFC projects that there will be room for perhaps 2,000 burials in their woodland cemetery. As of mid-November, there were 37.
Most importantly, they hope they’re in the forefront of a movement.
“We’re not right for everybody,” Michelle acknowledges. “Some people tell us. ‘This is too rustic,’ or ‘It’s too far for us.’ Or, ‘I want to be buried where my friends are.’
“Also, I say that grief is a participatory emotion that demands action. We encourage you to come and help carry the body to the grave, to lower it down and to fill that grave. It’s healing. We have volunteers to support you if you can’t or don’t want to do that. But there are cemeteries, like Green Mount, where it’s more full service.
“My hope, though, is that every community will have a place dedicated to natural burial that responds to the need of the community. I hope we don’t remain the only site for long.”

The contemplative silence, and the soft weeping that accompanies it, ends as naturally as it had begun. Recognizing that it’s time, Paul says, “When you’re ready, and only when you’re ready, have folks lift on the straps and Bailey and I will pull the boards out from under, and then you can slowly let her down.”
He waits for a moment; then, “One, two, three, lift.”
They remove the planks, and her descendants ease her to the leaf-strewn bottom, three and a half feet below. Then Paul shows people how to take up the beech boughs from atop the dirt pile and place them down upon her. It’s almost festive, with the golden leaves flickering in the air.
Someone calls out, “We love you, Mom.” 
Then people take up the shovels and hoes the cemetery has provided, and begin filling the grave. The first shovelfuls weigh heavily, but as she fades from view the pace quickens, and within a few minutes the dirt has reached ground level. They finish by spreading the topsoil the staff had set aside when they prepared the grave, which has more nutrient value than the deeply subterranean dirt and will help reconnect the surface vegetation.
The burial is done. 
Now the decoration starts! They pile shimmering green spruce and pine boughs on the grave, and overspread the boughs with sunflowers, baby’s breath, and leaves of red, brown, and orange. They’ve brought lemon balm and lavender from her garden, small fragments of nature that ornamented her home. They build delicate stone spires. 
They have transformed the somber grave into an artistic creation, and they’ve done it together. They stand silently for a moment, regarding their work, then one of the daughters clasps her hands and says, “She really would have loved this.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Nearly half of likely Democratic voters still aren’t sure who they’d choose in Rhode Island’s 2026 gubernatorial primary, according to the latest Ocean State Poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. 
A sizable 42% of Democratic primary voters considered themselves “undecided” in the survey released Monday. But former CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes holds a slight, early lead in a hypothetical Democratic primary with Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and incumbent Gov. Dan McKee. 
Of the 359 respondents who are likely to hit the polls in the Democratic primary slated for September 2026, 29% said they would back Foulkes.
Shekarchi, who has not publicly committed to a run but has expressed interest in media interviews, secured 13% of support from the surveyed respondents.
Limping along with slightly lower polling numbers is McKee with support from only 11% of primary voters — his latest dismal showing in a string of polls, especially in concert with the poll’s other numbers for McKee, which demonstrate a broad and more diffuse dissatisfaction with his leadership both within and across party lines.
How low can McKee go? Poor polling numbers continue to dog governor

“McKee is very unpopular among likely Democratic primary voters and suffers from low job approval among Rhode Islanders overall,” the survey’s introduction notes.
McKee’s 11% share of potential voter support is a drop from the 19% he garnered in the survey center’s previous poll released in September. 
The current governor was also viewed less favorably by survey respondents than his two potential opponents, with only 15% of Democratic primary voters saying they approved of him as a gubernatorial candidate. Another 54% said they disapproved, while 22% of respondents were neutral about McKee.    
As for McKee’s current performance, only 21% of respondents expressed satisfaction, while another 72% disapproved. The report notes that McKee’s approval has gone “relatively unchanged” since the September poll. 
McKee’s net favorability — defined as the percentage of respondents with a favorable opinion minus those with an unfavorable opinion — was the lowest of all three potential candidates, at -39. 
Shekarchi’s net favorability was +5 and Foulkes’ was +2.
The poll also asks respondents to identify their ideological leanings. McKee saw the lowest amounts of favorability in the primary — 3% — from both “socialists” and “conservatives/libertarians,” as the poll labels them. His campaign’s highest level of support came from “moderate” primary voters, at 27%, followed by “progressive” voters at 11%. 
McKee’s campaign spokesperson Christina Freundlich said in an emailed statement Tuesday, “Rhode Islanders don’t govern by polls, and neither does Governor McKee.”
“While Donald Trump continues to tank our economy and gut Rhode Islanders’ healthcare, Governor McKee is doing the job — lowering school absences, reducing overdose deaths, and driving real economic growth,” Freundlich said. “Polls come and go, but Governor McKee is focused on delivering for Rhode Island families.”
Less in the thick of the fray was Shekarchi, who respondents viewed generously, as he had the lowest percentage — only 16% — of respondents who viewed him unfavorably. But the House speaker was also the least known to respondents, with 38% saying they don’t know enough about him. Another 21% of potential voters said they viewed Shekarchi favorably.    
Shekarchi, in an emailed statement Monday, did not explicitly affirm his candidacy but said that the race remains “wide open even though the two announced candidates have previously run statewide.” 
“In 2026, I will continue bringing people together to address affordability in health care, housing, cost of living, and attracting and retaining good jobs in Rhode Island,” Shekarchi wrote.
Foulkes attracted almost equal shares of like, dislike and disinterest: 23% viewed her favorably, 21% unfavorably, 28% were neutral, and 27% were unsure what to think of her.  
Jon Romano, a spokesperson for the Foulkes campaign, wrote in a Tuesday statement that the poll “confirms what Helena already knows from countless conversations across our state: people are hurting, they’re being priced out of the lives they’ve built, and our leaders aren’t stepping up.” 
The numbers didn’t change drastically when pollsters asked respondents to decide based on a race with only two of the three candidates. Without Foulkes in the running, 29% of potential voters said they would go for Shekarchi, while McKee would inch up to 15%. But most voters would remain undecided at 50% — numbers not dissimilar from scenarios in which either McKee or Shekarchi exited the race, with more than 40% undecided voters in both circumstances, according to the poll. 
Bridge and hospital concerns inform McKee numbers
Pollsters also revisited the Washington Bridge closure which continues to darken people’s perceptions of the McKee administration.  
Among respondents, 68% rated the McKee administration’s public communications about the bridge issue as “poor” or “very poor.” Another 21% rated the McKee administration’s performance as “fair” and only 6% called it “good” and 1% “very good.” 
‘Fish or cut bait,’ federal bankruptcy judge tells prospective buyers for Roger Williams and Fatima

Another ongoing issue examined by pollsters was the protracted sale process of two of the state’s safety net hospitals: Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in North Providence and Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence. Current owner Prospect Medical Holdings has not been able to finalize the sale process first approved in 2024 and is now threatening to close the two facilities.
While only about 7% of respondents reported that they or a family member used either hospital in the past year, respondents were still keen on the idea of state intervention, with 67% saying state officials should “definitely” or “probably” intervene to keep Roger Williams open. Another 25% were not in favor of state intervention, and said the state should “definitely” or “probably” not get involved.
Numbers were similar in the case of Fatima, with 67% in favor of state intervention and 27% opposed.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)On Monday night at Temple Emanu-El in Helena, more than a dozen volunteers packed boxes filled with a lesson plan called “Standing Up to Hate,” created by the Montana Jewish Project.
The 50-to-90-minute lesson includes a book based on a true 1993 incident in Billings where neo-Nazis threw a brick through a Jewish family’s window, which was displaying a menorah.
This came during a high level of violence and hate directed toward multiple minority groups in Billings. In response to the brick being thrown, many community members cut out paper menorahs and put them in their windows, regardless of whether they were celebrating Hanukkah or not.
The lesson plan also includes discussion questions, activities and links to other resources. Teachers request the boxes on their own, Montana Jewish Project executive director Rebecca Stanfel said. The organization makes 50 per year and the demand is high, she said, adding that cities and towns across Montana have requested their materials as well.
“It’s really important to our mission to not only anchor and build Jewish community life, but to do education and outreach,” Stanfel said. “The curriculum is not about anti-semitism, specifically, it’s about not bullying.”
The work is having a real impact, organizers said, with teachers expressing excitement about teaching the lesson. It also includes instructions for a Dreidel game, which volunteers packaged up in a small kit as well.
The age ranges for the classrooms are all over the place, they said, and the curriculum can be adapted to a variety of situations.
“It’s just really nice to see the sorts of curiosity in the comments from teachers that are requesting these boxes because they’re so excited about the opportunity,” said Kaelie Giffel, MJP’s event coordinator. “They’re writing these mini essays where they’re like, ‘I’m going to teach all of my students about these things.’ And I’m like, wow, that’s actually so cool.”
The event also drew volunteers from outside the Jewish community, including Kathy Chambers, a member of First Presbyterian Church in Helena.
She’s a former school teacher too, and pointed to how things like this can help out educators.
“It’s invaluable,” Chambers said. “As a teacher there’s so many things to do and if someone can make it easier for you, that’s great.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MJPBoxes1-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-11-25 18:59:04.102732
,DC,2025-11-25 23:01:20+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Suit to block Education Department closure expanded amid agency transfers plans,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/suit-block-education-department-closure-expanded-amid-agency-transfers-plans,,"WASHINGTON — A coalition suing to block President Donald Trump’s efforts to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education expanded its lawsuit Tuesday to include objections to recent interagency agreements to shift the department’s responsibilities to other Cabinet-level agencies.The alliance of unions and school districts also added a major disability rights advocacy group to its ranks in the amended complaint that detailed how the department’s Nov. 18 announcement of six interagency agreements could harm students.The agreements to transfer several Education responsibilities to four other departments drew swift backlash from Democratic officials, labor unions and advocacy groups, who questioned the legality of the transfers and expressed concerns over the harms that would be imposed on students, families and schools as a result. “Scattering Department of Education programs among agencies with no expertise in education or lacking key agency infrastructure will reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs and will prevent the type of synergy that Congress intended to achieve by consolidating federal education activities in one cabinet level agency,” the coalition, represented by the legal advocacy group Democracy Forward, wrote in the amended complaint. The expanded suit asks for declaratory and injunctive relief against what it describes as the administration’s “unlawful effort to dismantle the Department of Education,” pointing to the interagency agreements, mass layoffs at the department earlier this year and implementation of an executive order that called on Education Secretary Linda McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department.  The Education Department clarified in fact sheets related to the agreements  with the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services and State that it would “maintain all statutory responsibilities and will continue its oversight of these programs.”Axing the Education DepartmentTrump has sought to take an axe to the 46-year-old department, saying he wants to send education “back to the states.” Much of the funding and oversight of schools already occurs at the state and local levels.The original lawsuit, filed in March in Massachusetts federal court, was brought by the American Federation of Teachers, its Massachusetts chapter, AFSCME Council 93, the American Association of University Professors, the Service Employees International Union and two school districts in Massachusetts. The Tuesday filing adds The Arc of the United States, an advocacy group for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, as a plaintiff. Earlier this year, the case was consolidated with another March lawsuit from Democratic attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin.  “It’s no surprise that blue states and unions care more about preserving the DC bureaucracy than about giving parents, students, and teachers more control over education and improving the efficient delivery of funds and services,” Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the department, said in a statement shared with States Newsroom.Supreme Court temporarily greenlit Trump planIn May, a federal judge in Massachusetts granted a preliminary injunction in the consolidated case, blocking the administration’s efforts, including a reduction in force effort at the agency that gutted more than 1,300 employees, Trump’s executive order calling on McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department and a directive to transfer some services to other federal agencies.A federal appeals court upheld that order in June, prompting the administration to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. The nation’s highest court in July temporarily suspended the lower courts’ orders, allowing the administration to proceed, for now, with those dismantling efforts.",,,,2025-11-25 18:59:04.102732

Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, speaks to the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce on Monday. He said the sweeping budget bill known as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" holds numerous benefits for Alaska. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, delivered a vigorous defense on Monday of the Trump administration’s controversial budget and tax bill and its resource development decisions.
The bill, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is a cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s policies. In a speech to the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce, Sullivan said it is so beneficial to Alaska that it could be called the “Alaska Opportunity Act.” 
“I think it’s going to turn out to be one of the most important pieces of legislation for our state in a very long time,” he said.
Congress passed the bill over the summer, and Trump signed it into law on July 4.
Sullivan, in his speech to the chamber, listed several funding commitments in the bill that he said will benefit Alaska, including commitments to the U.S. Coast Guard and its icebreaker fleet, to the military branches and to the Federal Aviation Administration.
But much of Sullivan’s speech was devoted to arguments trying to counter criticism of the bill’s impacts to federal health and public assistance programs.
Accusations that the bill cut Medicaid and other health care programs, in Alaska and elsewhere, are inaccurate, said Sullivan, who has already been the subject of political attack ads on the subject.
“This bill, we are very confident, is going to strengthen, not weaken, Alaska’s health care system,” he told the chamber audience.
Rather than cut benefits, the bill cuts waste, Sullivan said. There are several special provisions that protect Alaska from some of the biggest changes in the safety net, he added.
Those changes that do apply to Alaska, such as a 20-hour-per-week work requirement for benefits, are fair, he said. Alaska expanded eligibility to its Medicaid program under Gov. Bill Walker.

	“If you’re a young man and you’re able-bodied, you have no dependents and you’re 28 years old, and you’re on the Medicaid expansion population, and you’re told to go work or train or volunteer for 20 hours, and you don’t do it, you lose your Medicaid,” Sullivan said. “That’s not a cut. That is a choice.”
But several experts say the cumulative effects of the bill will force people off of health coverage through price increases and bureaucratic requirements.
“HR1 was designed to push Americans out of Medicaid in order to reach cost savings,” state Rep. Genevieve Mina, D-Anchorage, said by email, referring to the bill number. Mina, who chairs the House Health and Social Services Committee, listened to Sullivan’s speech.
The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 25,000 Alaskans will lose health insurance coverage through the combined provisions in the bill. That amounts to a 3% reduction in the insured population. Nationally, about 10 million people are expected to lose health insurance coverage, according to the foundation.
Mina said the state will face increased costs through a different provision: the requirement that eligibility redetermination decisions be made every six months instead of annually, as is the case now. Requiring the state Division of Public Assistance to make those determinations twice a year instead of annually will add to the administrative burden and potentially increase backlogs that are already a problem in the state, she said.
In an August presentation at a conference in Juneau, the head of the Alaska Hospital and Healthcare Association also warned of thousands of people losing health coverage simply because they will be priced out of it.
Jared Kosin, president of the association, and others speaking at the event said the failure of Congress to extend tax benefits for people insured under the Affordable Care Act will cause premiums to skyrocket and prompt people to drop coverage.
Those benefits, known as enhanced premium tax credits, are in addition to the original tax subsidies provided by the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Pending expiration of those credits has already caused Affordable Care Act policy premiums to rise dramatically for small businesses and self-employed Alaskans. Without an extension of the credits, which expire at the end of the year, premiums for insurance obtained under the Affordable Care Act will more than double nationally, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The issue was a major factor in the recent record-long federal government shutdown. Congressional Democrats tried unsuccessfully to extend the enhanced credits.
‘Aggressive’ oil leasing schedule
Energy development was another theme of Sullivan’s pitch for the bill.
He touted its mandatory oil and gas lease sales for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, on the western side of the North Slope, and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, on the eastern side of the North Slope, as well as in federal waters of Cook Inlet.

Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, touted an “aggressive” lease sale schedule for federal waters of Cook Inlet and federal territory on the North Slope. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)
 

	Those lease sales will be held on a near-annual basis, Sullivan said, a schedule that he termed “very aggressive.” He said the bill will prevent future administrations from cutting back on leasing.
“The feds have to do it,” he added. “So if there’s another president coming along in three years saying, ‘Hey, I want to shut down Alaska in terms of executive orders,’ can’t do it, right? This is in the law for the next 10 years.”
That was a reference to former President Joe Biden, who Sullivan said “probably killed thousands of jobs on Day One” through environmental executive orders. The Biden policies were immediately reversed by President Donald Trump on the first day of his second term, notably in an executive order titled Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential.
“Whether you like President Trump, whether you don’t like President Trump, doesn’t matter. Read this executive order. This is an unmitigated good for our state,” Sullivan said.
He also touted the bill’s provisions providing incentives for natural gas infrastructure. That will help advance the pipeline project that has been long desired by generations of Alaska leaders and would take now-stranded natural gas from the North Slope to a tidewater terminal in Southcentral Alaska for shipment by tanker to Asian markets from there.
Sullivan credited Trump with pushing for the gas pipeline, a megaproject proposed and promoted since the 1970s but never deemed economic. The administration has “just been pedal to the metal” on pressing Asian governments to support the project, the senator said.
“And, I will tell you, I’ve never seen more momentum and us closer,” he said.
He acknowledged public skepticism about the gas pipeline’s prospects. “I know I get the eye roll here, again. We’ve been talking about this for half a century, true, but what’s the alternative?” he said. Imported natural gas, he said, will be much more costly than natural gas produced in-state.
But renewable energy development, long considered important for supporting Southcentral Alaska communities facing possible shortages in Cook Inlet natural gas supplies, fared poorly in the bill.
The bill gutted federal support for renewable energy development that is keenly desired in much of Alaska, especially rural areas where fossil fuel-based energy prices are high and supplies are precarious. The bill mandates a phase-out to tax credits that help make wind and solar energy projects affordable. And the bill’s provisions added to Trump administration actions that canceled $280 million in previously awarded Alaska environmental grants, about half of which was for renewable energy projects. Some of those projects had been destined for remote rural communities otherwise dependent on diesel fuel delivered by barge or airplane.
Sullivan’s colleague, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, negotiated a compromise that kept the renewable energy tax credits in place for 12 months rather than repealing them outright. However, shortly after President Trump signed the bill, he and members of his administration issued orders that reduced federal support for renewable energy projects. Murkowski later said she felt “cheated” because it undermined her compromise.
Environmentalists have been particularly critical of the energy provisions.
“This legislation is regarded as one of the most destructive environmental bills to date,” the Alaska Center, an Anchorage-based conservation group, says on its website. The bill “puts an end date on tax credits for wind and solar energy, and repeals millions in unspent funds for everything from pollution control to displacement assistance for those on the front lines of the climate crisis.”

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner says reforms are needed to fix what he describes as a “Biden-era slush fund.”
These clashing perspectives will soon be tested in federal court. 
Washington and other states on Tuesday sued the Trump administration, challenging changes it made this month to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Continuum of Care program.
The administration wants to shift funding away from permanent supportive housing to transitional housing assistance with work or service requirements. 
Permanent supportive housing assists people with disabilities in getting stable housing and resources, while transitional housing is temporary help before people move into something more permanent. 
Before the change, about 90% of Continuum of Care funding went to permanent housing. Now, it would make up 30% of the nearly $4 billion program.
The federal change risks sending 170,000 people across the country into homelessness, according to Politico, citing internal agency documents. Washington stands to lose tens of millions of dollars from the federal government.
The decision is also a blow to so-called housing first policies, which focus on getting vulnerable people into permanent housing before addressing their other needs, like mental health or substance use treatment and finding a job.
Washington, along with 19 other states and Washington, D.C., filed suit over the move in federal court in Rhode Island on Tuesday. The states are seeking a preliminary injunction to block it temporarily while litigation proceeds. They argue the Trump administration needed to get congressional authorization and that rulemaking was required to make such a policy change.
“These funds help people in Washington going through some of the most difficult situations that you can possibly imagine,” Brown, a Democrat, said in a press conference Tuesday. “But the changes that HUD is attempting to make will throw so many people into crisis.”
Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, also a Democrat, said in a statement it was “yet another cruel attack by the Trump administration on our most vulnerable Washingtonians.”
Turner, the Housing and Urban Development secretary, said in a statement earlier this month that the changes would “promote independence and ensure we are supporting means-tested approaches to carry out the President’s mandate, connect Americans with the help they need, and make our cities and towns beautiful and safe.”
About $120 million per year in these federal grants comes to Washington to provide permanent supportive housing. Most of the money goes to the state’s most populous counties: King, Pierce, Snohomish, Spokane and Clark. The remaining $25 million is spread across more rural counties.
Seattle and King County, for example, receive $67 million per year to house about 4,500 residents. City and county officials are making contingency plans. 
But “there is no possible way that the state of Washington or all of these organizations could fill the holes that are going to be created,” Brown said.
When news of the Trump administration’s plans leaked in late September, housing leaders in the state Legislature said the move would loom over next year’s short legislative session.
Turner’s agency also added requirements for accessing the competitive funding, including not awarding applicants that “use a definition of sex as other than binary in humans.” And locales will be dinged if they don’t enforce the Trump administration’s favored homelessness policies, like bans on public camping. 
Applications for the funding are due Jan. 14, with awards likely in the spring. The grants could arrive long after organizations have already seen their previous funding expire. 
Some congressional Republicans have also expressed concern.

In a letter late last month, nearly two dozen GOP lawmakers told Turner that major changes “should be implemented carefully to avoid destabilizing programs that serve individuals with severe disabilities related to mental illness, chronic health conditions, or substance use disorders, as well as seniors with disabilities.”
The money goes to state, local and tribal governments, as well as public housing authorities and nonprofits. Across the country, about 7,000 awards are expected to be issued.
Washington has now brought 45 lawsuits in the first 10 months of President Donald Trump’s second term.

Two months after the job offer, the former library director has not signed a contract due to an unresolved lawsuit against the town and a former Board of Trustees chair. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trouble in the stacks: Pawlet divided over rehiring of library director and resignation of staff.","Libraries are normally an oasis of calm but the Pawlet Public Library lately has been the center of a yearslong drama.
The community rift is centered around a former library director Lyndsi Barnes’ tenure,  which ended in 2023 after the Library Board of Trustees decisively voted to dismiss her. Two years later, the Pawlet Library Board of Trustees voted three to two on Sept. 16 to offer Barnes back her job, the Manchester Journal first reported.
At issue is whether Barnes was wrongfully terminated, with her supporters arguing she is an asset to the library after working in a previous job at the New York Public Library. Her detractors call for a new face in the post.
The kerfuffle left the library in a lurch after two staffers quit, leaving the library without leadership or paid staff, the Manchester Journal first reported. 
Barnes’ role as director highlights the crucial role libraries play in helping define a community’s identity. In Pawlet, Barnes became a lightning rod for complaints that she shirked her duties and created barriers for homeschooling and other community groups to use the library. 
The Pawlet Public Library Board of Trustees Chair Cory Rail wrote in a statement that the board voted to rehire Barnes due to her qualifications and vision for library services and programs.
Unresolved lawsuit
Now, two months after receiving the job offer, Barnes has not signed a contract and resumed leadership of the library due to an unresolved lawsuit she has against the town and a former Board of Trustees chair.

The slew of charges in the suit include wrongful termination, breach of an implied employment contract, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
Barnes’ lawyer Richard Bowen said they are working with the town to come to an agreement over her claims before Barnes would sign a contract and return to work.
“I think that the library would benefit from getting Lyndsi back to work as soon as possible,” Bowen said in an October interview. “Libraries are important anchors in our community, and I think that that’s something that we want to be able to support and make sure that they survive through some difficult times that they’re facing.”
The town of Pawlet’s lawyer James Carroll denied a request for comment due to the pending litigation. 
Community response
This past summer, the community began rallying around the issue. Letters to the board poured in from volunteers and donors during the interview process and after Barnes was rehired, voicing concern that bringing back the former library director during an active lawsuit would sow more division. Community members told the board they would halt volunteering efforts and monetary support for the library if Barnes took the helm of the library. 
A local petition started by Arena Heidi, of nearby Danby, has called for the library board or Pawlet selectboard to reverse the decision to rehire Barnes, as “the vast majority of the library community simply wants to leave division and difficulties behind and move forward with someone new.” 
The petition garnered 91 signatures as of Monday, of which 38 Pawlet residents signed and 53 residents of neighboring towns signed. 
In a statement, Board Treasurer Lauren Herbert acknowledged two difficult years.“While outside voices are always welcome, decisions about our public services — especially those funded and used by local residents — should be guided by the people who live here,” Herbert wrote.
Staff resign
Nina Dubois, the community resource coordinator, resigned on Sept. 20, citing two years of community conflict and concern for the future of the library given the former director’s appointment. 
“There are two sides, both of which feel as though they have made the right decision. In this case, that means rehiring an old director or choosing not to participate in the future of the library,” Dubois wrote in an email to VTDigger. “It is my hope that all parties involved look at the role they played.” 
Adele Santwire, the former assistant librarian of 10 years, resigned two days later on Sept. 22. Santwire said that issues with Barnes’ leadership started a year into her term as director, when she took extensive paid-time off, opened the library late, closed it early and asked the library staff to cover her shifts often.
Kat Zemmel, a homeschooling parent and group coordinator, said Barnes’ imposed onerous rules and restrictions on local groups meeting, including proposed charges for the use of the library space during open hours.
On the other hand, Judy Lake of Pawlet said the former library director was “railroaded” by the Board of Trustees in 2023, and Lake said she will support the direction of the library under Barnes.
“I think it’s going to be great,” Lake said. “I think the donations will grow. I think they’ll have events that can fundraise, and it just takes time in these small towns.”
One of the dissenting board members, Joni Lee, said she voted against rehiring Barnes’ because she worried it would not help mend Pawlet’s “fractured community.” But, ultimately, her hope is that “the library can once again return to being the heart of the community and that in this next chapter, that everyone who comes in the door feels welcome,” Lee said.

Laura Kelly this holiday season is collaboration to resolve Kansas’ water issues, she said Tuesday at the annual Christmas tree donation at Cedar Crest.
“Recognizing that that is not a political win or loss for anybody, but absolutely essential for the future in this state,” Kelly said. 
In August Kelly elevated water to her highest priority. She’s concerned with creating a long-term sustainable strategy that recognizes the falling levels in the Ogallala Aquifer. 
And the Democrats? 
“I hadn’t really thought about what the Democrats themselves could give me,” Kelly said. “There’s probably not a lot in this upcoming session. What they could do is get some really good candidates for November 2026, break that supermajority so that regardless of who the next governor is there will be an absolute need to work together to get anything done.” 
Republicans currently have a supermajority in both the House and Senate, enough to override the governor’s vetoes.

Charlotte Cooper, granddaughter of Dave Bruton — the Kansas Forest Service liaison with the Kansas Christmas Tree Growers Association — isn’t entirely sure what she wants this holiday season either. Lucky for Cooper, Santa’s elves encouraged him to make business cards, so her mom can e-mail Santa with her list. She even got the chance to talk to Santa at Tuesday’s event. 
“This is a good group,” Santa said. “Santa always likes to reward the good people, and tell the others they have time —”
“Do you live in the North Pole?” Cooper interjected. 
“Most of the time. When I’m not living down here, checking up on children,” Santa said. 
Santa, Cooper and others rode in a replica of a Wells Fargo stagecoach up to the governor’s mansion to deliver the donated Christmas decorations.

Two six-year-old Percheron horses carried the stagecoach. They replaced Bess and Betty, who carried the stagecoach for years before. The ceremony was the horses’ first large crowd, and they acted “about what you would guess,” according to Robin Dunn of Dunn’s Landing farm near Wellsville. 
When asked if the new horses would be able to replace Bess and Betty, Dunn responded with a swift “no.” Then she paused. 
“Well, I don’t know,” Dunn said. “It’ll take about 15 years. In 15 years ask me that question again.”

On top of the stagecoach was an 8½-foot tall Scotch pine grown on the Strawberry Hill Christmas Tree Farm in Lawrence. Each year one farm from the Kansas Christmas Tree Association donates the tree.
According to Mark Walther, part of the family who runs Strawberry Hill, his late brother Mitch volunteered.
“Well, it’s kind of a sad story,” Walther said. “So Mitch stepped up and unfortunately passed away. So then it’s like, well, shoot, because he didn’t tell me which tree it was.” 
Mitch died unexpectedly in July. When the time came, the family went to the field and chose the tree with the nicest height and shape.

This is the third year that Chris Seets from Chris’s Tree Lodge in Abilene presented a wreath. 
“Hopefully, this is the first time I get to actually meet the governor. I’ve always handed it to lieutenant governors in the past,” Seets said shortly before the presentation. 
Perhaps Santa overheard her comment, because Seets was called up to present her wreath to Kelly in front of the mansion.
“I was just so excited. I think I spoke to her. I don’t know, I’m not sure,” Seets said after. 
After the carriage rolled in and Seets presented her wreath, the group entered the mansion to watch the tree be placed in a corner. Kelly adorned it with an ornament that recognized Charles Robinson, Kansas’ first governor. 
Kelly thanked the farmers, volunteers, and families who made the event happen. Cooper responded with a toothless grin. 
“When did you lose that?” Kelly asked.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said his recent trade mission to southeast Asian countries revealed “exciting market” opportunities for a variety of agricultural products. 
Naig, speaking to reporters after the governor’s turkey pardoning Tuesday, said Thanksgiving is a “unique time” for Iowans to think about “what it takes” for farmers to feed the nation. 
He said there’s a lot of risk and variability in the farm economy, especially as producers face high input costs and low market prices. Some of this might be alleviated by soybean purchases with China or a federal assistance package for farmers, which the Trump administration said might come in the next couple of weeks.
“I still think that there’s a need to help farmers bridge the gap into next year,” Naig said. “This is a time where they’re paying bills for next year’s crop, they’re looking at financing for next year, so it’s a critically important time to get some certainty around that.”

Ag industry leaders have also pushed for strengthened trade relationships in countries outside of China, which is historically the largest buyer of soybeans. Naig led a trade mission to Vietnam in 2024 and the nation issued several memorandums of understanding this fall to purchase more U.S. commodities like corn and soybeans. 
Naig said Vietnamese ethanol representatives also visited the state in October and the nation plans to ramp up to a 10% ethanol blending rate in the new year. 
Considering the already-established relationships with Vietnam, Naig said the recent trip there was about “going to the next level.” 
According to a news release about the trade mission, Vietnam purchased more than $4.5 billion of agricultural products from the U.S. in 2024. Iowa exported about $223.4 million in ag products to Vietnam in 2024. 
In 2024, Indonesia purchased $3.8 billion of agricultural goods from the U.S. and Iowa exported about $297.6 million to the country. 
The trade delegation, which returned home Sunday, was organized by the Iowa Economic Development Authority and included representatives from grain and protein groups in Iowa. 
Naig said the recent trip to Indonesia was “more of an exploratory” trip, considering Iowa delegates had not visited the country in “many, many years.” 
Naig said both nations are growing at “significant” rates and offer “exciting markets” for corn, soybean, ethanol, beef and pork. 
According to the news release from the economic development authority, the delegation visited the capital cities of both countries for trade policy discussions, market briefings and business development meetings.
“Good markets, but a lot more that could come from having free trade agreements with both countries,” Naig said.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Industrial Commission on Tuesday gave the state bank a green light to proceed with two loan programs aiming to provide relief to agricultural producers hit by a combination of tariffs, low commodity prices and high costs, as well as a series of summer storms. 
The state-owned Bank of North Dakota is setting aside $300 million for the 2026 Farm Financial Stability Loan Program, the larger of the two initiatives. Farmers and ranchers who experienced an operating shortfall in 2024 or 2025 will be eligible to apply for low-interest loans through their local banks and credit unions. 
“Ag is still the foundation of every single community in our entire economy in North Dakota,” said Gov. Kelly Armstrong, chair of the Industrial Commission, which oversees the Bank of North Dakota. “In these uncertain times, we need to help stabilize that foundation the best we can.”
Kaylen Hausauer, financial institutions market manager for the Bank of North Dakota, said the final interest rates available for the loans will likely be around 4.3% or 4.4%, below the bank’s current base rate of 7%. Up to 75% of the loan amount will be provided by the Bank of North Dakota, but ag producers will apply through their local lender. 
“This fits right in our mission,” said Don Morgan, CEO of the Bank of North Dakota. “It is a balanced help for our agricultural industry, and it is a time when the industry is extremely stressed.”
The loans will help agricultural producers restructure existing debts, convert recent operating losses into loans with extended repayment schedules and ensure they have money on hand going into the 2026 planting season. 
“We’re headed in the right direction, and I do believe that we as a state probably have the most to offer our farmers and ranchers by providing this type of backstop,” said Doug Goehring, agriculture commissioner and member of the Industrial Commission alongside Armstrong and Attorney General Drew Wrigley. 
Armstrong said there are farmers in the state who would be unable to continue farming next year because of their financial situation if this program were not implemented. 
Federal trade, health policies add to concerns for North Dakota farmers, state ag commissioner says

The Department of Agriculture’s mediation program is aware of a number of farmers who are having financial problems as a result of storm damage, market headwinds and other factors, Goehring said. 
“It’s all compounded,” Goehring said. 
The second program approved Tuesday, the 2026 Grain Inventory Loan Program, will help local farmers who are stuck with leftover inventories from the 2025 harvest. Farmers can apply for short-term financing of the leftover crop, allowing them to hold on to it until prices improve. 
“The short-term loans will benefit all producers, especially young and beginning farmers, who often lack the equity and working capital of older, more established producers,” Armstrong said.
The Bank of North Dakota has allocated $100 million for the program. The loan rates are slightly below market rate. 
“We don’t want to incentivize them to hold on to the grain longer than needed,” Hausauer said. “But it is a tool to use if needed.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
These programs are only possible because of North Dakota’s unique advantage of having a state-owned bank with the resources to provide relief to the agriculture industry in times of stress, the governor said. 
“We’re committed to deploying those tools as needed to provide a lifeline to the hard-working farmers and ranchers who grow the food we put on our tables at Thanksgiving and all year round,” Armstrong said.
Producers can begin applying for either program through their local bank or credit union beginning at noon Dec. 9. The application deadline will be June 30, 2026. 
“It might put our producers in a better position financially than other producers around the country,” Goehring said.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)A staunch opponent of Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ plan to build a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County will be on the ballot as an independent candidate for the Senate District 26 special election.
Secretary of State Cole Jester’s office confirmed Tuesday that Adam Watson of Branch submitted 250 signatures from registered District 26 voters in advance of the noon Wednesday deadline. Watson needed 75 signatures to qualify and began collecting them Nov. 16. He previously circulated a petition for a legislative hearing about the prison.
As an independent, Watson will forgo the Jan. 6 primary and automatically advance to the general election. He told the Advocate it was “definitely encouraging” that he gathered more than three times the minimum number of signatures in the district.
Arkansas legislators skeptical of prison site selection, frustrated over absence of Sanders staff

“I think there’s a lot more voter attention and [people] paying attention than there usually is in a regular cycle,” he said.
The District 26 seat became vacant when Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, died in September. His successor will serve the rest of his term until January 2029.
Sanders scheduled the primary for Jan. 6 and the general election for March 3 after the state Supreme Court denied her request to delay implementation of a lower court order. The new senator will take office in time for the legislative fiscal session in April when state lawmakers are likely to consider funding for the proposed prison.
Sanders initially scheduled the general election for November 2026 and moved it to June after public pushback. District 26 voter Colt Shelby’s lawsuit led a judge to rule that the election needed to be earlier in the year.
House District 70 voters in Pulaski County will see the same scheduled special election in light of North Little Rock GOP Rep. Carlton Wing’s resignation in September to become CEO of Arkansas PBS. Two Democrats and one Republican are running in District 70.
No Democrats are running for the open Senate seat. Five Republicans will face off in the primary, including former Rep. Mark Berry, R-Ozark.
Berry is the only candidate who has not publicly expressed opposition to the planned Franklin County prison. Wade Dunn, Stacie Smith, Ted Tritt and Brad Simon have all said publicly since beginning their campaigns that they do not want the prison to be built on the 815-acre site the state purchased in the county last year.
Arkansas’ 2026 election cycle will feature several rematches, returning candidates

Stubblefield was one of the most vocal opponents of the prison, and his family has endorsed Dunn to succeed him.
Regardless of who his Republican opponent is, Watson said he believes voters in District 26 have “an appetite for the kind of campaign” he is running. The district includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties.
“All of the work that I’ve been doing in the district before a political opportunity presented itself is ringing true with the voters, because they see somebody that is really just interested in doing what’s best for the district and not serving political parties,” Watson said.
Anyone seeking to run as an independent in the regular elections will be able to start collecting signatures from registered voters in January.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)The State Corporation Commission on Tuesday handed Dominion Energy two major approvals, after the board OK’d the controversial Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center as well as the utility’s new rates for customers and contract requirements for high load customers, including data centers.
 Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center (CERC) gets the green light

State regulators approved the CERC, a 944 megawatt gas peaker plant, which will be built on the site of the former coal fired plant at the Chesterfield Power Station near the Dutch Gap Conservation area south of Richmond. The SCC also gave approval to Dominion to add a CERC Rider to utility bills to recover the $1.47 billion it is anticipated to cost to build the project.
For months, community members and environmental advocates have railed against the proposed plant, citing environmental and health concerns for residents. With SCC approval, the construction, expected to start in 2026, is one step closer with the project slated for completion in 2029.
The most fervent opponents of the plant said that Tuesday’s final order was a blow that worsened, not alleviated, their concerns. Others said building a fossil fuel-reliant plant would counter the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which requires that gas power plants be retired by 2045, barring potential risks to reliability. 
“Under the Clean Economy Act there was a moratorium on new gas plants and Dominion was to phase out all existing gas and coal plants by 2045. In this first test of this law, the SCC has failed,” said Friends of Chesterfield board chair Glen Besa.
The surrounding community has been free of the former coal plant’s pollution since it was retired in 2023 after burning for 70 years. While the gas plant will pollute significantly less than the coal plant, neighbors with fresh memories of the old plant didn’t want the new one built in their community.
“To say we’re disappointed is an understatement,”  Chesterfield NAACP President Nicole Martin said. “Today’s decision puts Dominion’s profits over the health and wellbeing of those living in fenceline communities in Chesterfield and beyond.”
The SCC’s final order states that the decision is not about choosing the CERC over compliance with the VCEA.
“The evidence in this case clearly establishes that there is an imminent reliability threat for Dominion and its customers and that the CERC project addresses that threat in a manner that is in accordance with the public interest and the VCEA,” the order reads.
The plant is anticipated to only run 37% of the year to help meet demands during the hottest and coldest days. The regional transmission grid, PJM, has said that Virginia is the most energy constrained part of their region – in part due to the concentration of high load data centers in the commonwealth. Virginia also is one of the largest importers of energy in the country.
The final piece of the puzzle that Dominion needs to get shovels in the ground for the CERC project is approval of the air permit from the Department of Environmental Quality. A final hearing is scheduled in December before a final decision is made.
“This project will provide reliable power for hundreds of thousands of homes, businesses, schools and hospitals in Chesterfield and beyond. As part of our all of the above energy strategy, it will ensure our region has the reliable power we need to continue growing and thriving,” Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said.
 Dominion rate increase approved, new rate class created

Starting next year, utility bills will rise for Dominion Energy ratepayers, the SCC also determined Tuesday. In January 2026, the base rate will increase by $11.24 monthly for the average residential user, and in January 2027 an additional $2.36 would be added monthly. Those increases are at a lower rate than Dominion requested. 
The SCC allowed a return on equity to increase from 9.7% to 9.8%, which is lower than the 10.4% the utility requested.
“As the utility regulator, we are obligated by law to set a revenue requirement that affords the Company an opportunity to recover reasonable and prudent projected costs and earn a reasonable rate of return,” the SCC commissioners said in a statement after the order was announced. “ In this case, that has resulted in an increase in rates, but not to the extent requested by Dominion.”
Dominion initially requested a base rate increase of a total of $822 million in 2026 and $345 million for 2027. The SCC ultimately allowed a lower total amount of $565.7 million in 2026 and $209.9 million in 2027.
“We recognize the impact this will have on our customers. We are offering more energy-saving programs and assistance options than ever before. Every month, thousands of our customers benefit from programs that help lower their bills and get the support they need,” Slayton said. 
In December, Dominion plans to launch an online hub for all their programs that customers can use to try and save on their bills.
The newly-approved plan also creates a new rate class for high load customers that use over 25MW and a load factor of more than 75% monthly. That requirement captures most data centers, as well as industrial and commercial customers. These customers are also required to sign 14-year contracts that will ensure they will pay for their proposed energy costs, even if they use less or if the data centers aren’t built.
The minimum demand charges for these users would be 85% for transmission, 85% for distribution, and 60% for generation. They would be charged more if they exceed those minimums.
“Data centers and other large energy users create a special set of risks, and we are pleased to see the Commission engage with these emerging issues here. Residential customers should not be subsidizing these wealthy companies, and Virginians are relying on the Commission to address these fundamental questions of fairness.” said Peter Anderson, Director of State Energy Policy with Appalachian Voices, in a statement.
Dominion serves about 450 data centers in Virginia. A coalition of data center companies had proposed their own plan to the commission that was less stringent as the plan Dominion put forward, however the SCC did not accept it.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-25 22:20:00+00:00,CT Mirror,EPA moves to abandon rule that sets tough standards for deadly soot pollution,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/25/epa-soot-pollution-rollback-trump/,The action follows moves by the Trump administration last week to weaken federal rules protecting wetlands and streams and roll back protections for imperiled species.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is seeking to abandon a rule that sets tough standards for deadly soot pollution, arguing that the Biden administration did not have authority to set the tighter standard on pollution from tailpipes, smokestacks and other industrial sources.
The action follows moves by the administration last week to weaken federal rules protecting millions of acres of wetlands and streams and roll back protections for imperiled species and the places they live. In a separate action, the Interior Department proposed new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades, advancing a project that critics say could harm coastal communities and ecosystems.
The Environmental Protection Agency finalized a rule last year that imposed strict standards for soot pollution, saying that reducing fine particle matter from motor vehicles and industrial sources could prevent thousands of premature deaths a year.
Twenty-five Republican-led states and a host of business groups filed lawsuits seeking to block the rule in court. A suit led by attorneys general from Kentucky and West Virginia argued that the EPA rule would raise costs for manufacturers, utilities and families and could block new manufacturing plants.
In a court filing this week, the EPA essentially took the side of the challengers, saying the Biden-era rule was done “without the rigorous, stepwise process that Congress required” and was therefore unlawful.
“EPA now confesses error and urges this Court to vacate the Rule” before Feb. 7, the agency said in a brief filed with the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Vacating the Biden-era rule would revert the soot standard to a level established a dozen years ago under the Obama administration. The Trump EPA is set to propose its own rule early next year.
Environmental groups said the agency’s action — which follows a pledge by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to roll back the soot rule and dozens of other environmental regulations — threatens public health and undermines its obligations under the Clean Air Act.
“EPA’s motion is a blatant attempt to avoid legal requirements for a rollback, in this case for one of the most impactful actions the agency has taken in recent years to protect public health,” said Hayden Hashimoto, an attorney at the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force.
The 2024 rule set maximum levels of 9 micrograms of fine particle pollution per cubic meter of air, down from 12 micrograms established under former President Barack Obama. The rule sets an air quality level that states and counties must achieve in the coming years to reduce pollution from power plants, vehicles, industrial sites and wildfires.
“An abundance of scientific evidence shows that going back to the previous standard would fail to provide the level of protection for public health required under the Clean Air Act,” Hashimoto said.
EPA said in creating the rule that the new standard would avoid 800,000 cases of asthma symptoms, 2,000 hospital visits and 4,500 premature deaths, adding up to about $46 billion in health benefits in 2032. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the rule would especially benefit children, older adults and those with heart and lung conditions, as well as those living near highways, factories and power plants.
“Walking away from these clean-air standards doesn’t power anything but disease,” said Patrice Simms, vice president of healthy communities at Earthjustice, a nonprofit law firm that represents environmental groups in the legal case.
President Donald Trump “has made it clear that his agenda is all about saving corporations money,” Simms said, adding under Zeldin, the EPA “has nothing to do with protecting people’s health, saving lives or serving children, families or communities.”
Soot, made up of tiny toxic particles that lodge deep in the lungs, can result in severe health harms, including premature death, and comes from sources such as vehicle exhaust pipes, power plants, and factories.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25329704118782-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 17:57:22.535889

(Photo courtesy of Sen. John Hoeven's Office)The scenic loop drive at Theodore Roosevelt National Park’s South Unit reopened to the public on Tuesday amid North Dakota’s first major snow of the winter.
The scenic loop was under construction for more than two years. About $51 million in federal funding was dedicated to the project through the Restore Our Parks Act, which became part of the Great American Outdoors Act that was signed into law by President Donald Trump in August 2020.
In 2019, sections of a 4-mile stretch of the scenic loop slid down the steep embankment causing the road to close. Upon further inspection, an additional 2 miles of the scenic loop were also deemed unsafe and forced drivers to turn around on the loop, limiting the scenic viewing along the roadway.
Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., a co-sponsor of the Restore Our Parks Act, said the park sees about 700,000 people each year and people want to drive through it, not just for the beauty of the Badlands, but the wildlife.
“You got the prairie dog towns that come right up to the road and you see all those little guys popping their heads out, and of course, the kids go crazy for that,” Hoeven said in an interview Tuesday.

He said the completed scenic loop has improved and expanded places for people to stop their vehicles and get out to look around. The reconstruction also improved the drainage and grading along the roadway.
Hoeven called the project an accomplishment for modern engineering because of the difficult terrain in the park.
“It’s almost like building a bridge,” he said. “You see the cost at $51 million for 6 miles and you realize you are building this stuff on the side of a butte, very steep, and it’s on sandstone, so the structural engineering that went into this is pretty remarkable.”
Hoeven said he was pleased the loop was completed ahead of the opening of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library.
Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library launches virtual event series

A grand opening of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library is planned for July in Medora. 
“I think it’s just going to be great for our visitors to circle all the way through that park again,” said Matt Briney, chief communications and marketing officer for the presidential library.
Briney also praised Hoeven’s efforts to preserve the wild horse herds at Theodore Roosevelt National Park.
Proposals to remove the horses or reduce the herd have been controversial. 
Some of the 200 horses in the South Unit of the park have been fitted with GPS collars to better monitor the herd’s range and use of the park’s environment.
In April, Hoeven introduced Theodore Roosevelt National Park Wild Horses Protection Act that would mandate the park to keep at least 150 wild horses and require the National Park Service to craft a management plan for the herd. Hoeven said he was optimistic the bill will protect the herd for future generations.
“The park is just going to keep getting better and it’s going to keep drawing more,” he said.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)More than 200 online stores who do business using e-commerce platform Shopify illegally sold electronic cigarettes or other tobacco products, circumventing age and safety requirements, according to a letter sent by North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson and the attorneys general of 25 other states Monday.
“These web-sellers made e-cigarette sales in violation of nearly every applicable federal, state and local law regulating e-cigarettes, even after being repeatedly warned of their unlawful conduct,” the attorneys general wrote.
The attorneys general wrote that while Shopify has taken action against specific online vendors brought to their attention in previous letters, “the sheer scope of the conduct and the significant injury to public health accomplished through online e-cigarette sales necessitates a more comprehensive solution.”
At least 28 illegal e-cigarette online stores were hosted directly on Shopify’s platform, they alleged, while another 200 used the company’s services to illegally sell tobacco products.
Under federal law, only 39 FDA-approved e-cigarettes are legal to sell across state lines, and they can only be sold to customers aged 21 years or older. The age limit within North Carolina is 18.
In a press release, Jackson’s office noted that e-cigarette manufacturers are required to be certified by the state Department of Revenue to operate in North Carolina, and that state law mandates age verification for online retailers who sell them.
“If states and the federal government create laws to protect our residents, companies can’t sidestep those for their own profit,” Jackson said. “We have protections against selling e-cigarettes to children because we know how harmful it is for them, and we need Shopify to step up and keep those products off of its platforms.”
The North Carolina Child Fatality Task Force noted in its 2025 report that 37% of high schoolers in the state say they have vaped, including more than half of seniors. The task force urged the state to raise the minimum age for sale of tobacco products to 21 to align with federal law.
Jackson and the 25 other attorneys general are seeking a meeting with Shopify to ask the commerce giant to terminate service to all current and future sellers violating tobacco laws. They offered to “undertake some of the effort” needed to identify vendors who violate the law.
Shopify did not respond to a request for comment on the letter. Their legal page states that all retailers selling e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine products must “comply with the laws and regulations that apply to your business.”
North Carolina’s first legal bout with e-cigarette sales came under then-Attorney General Josh Stein, who in 2021 won the first settlement in the nation against e-cigarette manufacturer Juul.
Juul ultimately paid $47.8 million to North Carolina for marketing to underaged customers, and agreed to more stringent marketing requirements such as refraining from advertising on social media, not marketing to those under 21, and verifying the age of all customers.
“Vaping is dangerous to kids’ health, and we must continue to do everything in our power to keep them nicotine free,” Stein said after the approval of additional funds in 2023.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB124952-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-25 17:57:22.535889

(Photo by Amanda Watford/Stateline)Incarcerated people in New York state prisons face significant challenges in accessing healthy and affordable food, according to a new report from the Correctional Association of New York, or CANY, an independent oversight organization designated by state law.
This problem is not unique to New York: Researchers and advocacy groups have long documented that prison and jail meals nationwide are often insufficient in quantity, lacking in nutrients and of poor quality. Some correctional facilities also have outsourced their food operations to private companies.
The Correctional Association of New York found that meals served in prison mess halls across the state are often nutritionally imbalanced, with too few fruits, vegetables, proteins and whole grains, alongside high levels of refined grains and sodium. If consumed entirely, the meals provide too many calories for most incarcerated women and some men based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s guidelines, according to the report. 
US prison population rises for second straight year

During monitoring visits in 2023 and 2024, the correctional group interviewed more than 500 incarcerated people in general population housing units. About two-thirds of respondents said commissary shelves were inadequately stocked. 
At Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, prices for commissary items such as cereal and pasta rose an average of 45% between March 2020 and December 2024, while wages for incarcerated people declined when adjusted for inflation, according to the report.
Nearly half of those interviewed also reported delays in receiving packages containing food, with some items spoiling before reaching them.
The organization made several recommendations for the state’s Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, including increasing transparency around meal nutrition, moving to a single commissary vendor to stabilize supply and prices and standardizing package delivery processes, particularly for perishable items. 
It also recommended allowing incarcerated people to grow and consume fruits and vegetables by expanding horticulture programs and partnerships with Harvest Now, a group that works with state prisons to grow produce and donate it to local food kitchens and pantries.
Some states, including Maine and Missouri, have implemented programs that let incarcerated people cultivate gardens or small farms and incorporate the produce into their meals.

(Photo and seal courtesy of the Iowa Judicial Branch)  The Iowa Supreme Court has ruled that governmental bodies can conduct closed-session job interviews without first attempting to determine whether an applicant’s claim of potential reputational damage has any merit.
The ruling vacates an Iowa Court of Appeals decision that stated governmental bodies are obligated to investigate, and not take at face value, claims of possible reputational damage resulting from an open interview.
In 2021, former federal prosecutor Robert Teig sued the City of City Rapids over its refusal to disclose job applications filed by people seeking employment as city clerk and city attorney. As part of his case, Teig  argued the council had violated Iowa’s Open Meetings Law in April 2021 when it interviewed, behind closed doors, Alissa Van Sloten for a job as city clerk.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Van Sloten was then a longtime city employee who was serving as interim city clerk and had asked for a closed meeting on the grounds that closure was necessary to prevent “needless and irreparable injury” to her reputation.
After a two-day bench trial, the district court concluded that the mayor and council members had not violated the Iowa Open Meetings Law when they held a closed session to interview Van Sloten. The court noted that “the fighting issue amongst the parties is whether a closed session was ‘necessary to prevent needless and irreparable injury’ to Van Sloten’s reputation.”
In dismissing the case, the district court held that a governmental body need not be aware of “specific, negative information” before deciding to close an interview at the interviewee’s request.
The Iowa Court of Appeals subsequently reversed the district court’s decision and said council members had, in fact, violated the law. The appeals court said it was “troublesome” that when the council was faced with a request to close a public meeting due to a claim of potential reputational damage, the members made no further inquiries to determine whether a closed session was actually “necessary” to prevent such damage and simply approved the request.
That approach — which is the same approach used by many public bodies throughout the state — allows councils, commissions and boards to close more meetings than the law contemplates, the court said.
“An applicant would simply need to invoke the magic words, ‘fear of needless and irreparable injury’ and could then have the governmental body close the entire interview without further inquiry as to why,” the court stated.
In the Cedar Rapids case, the appeals court pointed out, “the council failed to ask any questions as to why Van Sloten’s request was necessary. Not one.”
The mayor and council appealed that ruling, sending the matter to the Iowa Supreme Court.
In their decision Tuesday, the justices held that job applicants and governmental bodies can’t be expected to know, in advance, whether an interview could wind up damaging the reputation of the applicant. It’s enough that a request for a closed session be made by the applicant, the court ruled.
“As the district court recognized,” the Supreme Court stated, “it’s simply unrealistic to know in advance what will come up in a job interview that might harm the interviewee’s reputation. Generally, the interviewee won’t know what questions are going to be asked, and the interviewers won’t know what answers will be given or what follow-up questions will be asked. It’s also difficult for the interviewing entity to appreciate what might be harmful to the interviewee’s reputation, especially in this day and age of proliferating social media.”
The justices also noted that under the Iowa Court of Appeals’ interpretation of the law, “the fact that the governmental body closed part of a job interview would amount to a finding that there was ‘specific, damaging information that would justify continuing the interview outside the public’s view.’ This in itself could harm the interviewee’s reputation.”
In its ruling, the court noted that under Iowa law, a closed-session job interview “requires the agreement of both the governmental body and the individual being evaluated. An individual who prefers to be interviewed in open session will always have that choice. Likewise, a governmental body that prefers public interviews of job candidates will always have that option.”

A reelection filing is routine for anyone else in the House, and a dozen incumbents already have done so. But for Ritter it reflects a conclusion that he retains support to continue as speaker, even as his decision frustrates the ambitions of others.
“I’ve had a lot of conversations with with members, and obviously, I’m running again based upon having the support to do so,” Ritter said. “I’m humbled by it, and, you know, I am mindful that this is a unique situation.”
His decision is not a surprise: In a Connecticut Mirror profile published a year ago, when Ritter was poised to become the first three-term speaker in two decades, he publicly broached the idea of a fourth term.
Connecticut only has had three speakers to hold the position for more than two terms. The first was his father, Thomas D. Ritter, followed by his immediate successor, Moira K. Lyons. The third is Matt Ritter.
Ritter’s decision means that the aspirations of House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, who is Ritter’s heir apparent, and the three women vying to succeed Rojas as majority leader will be pushed back two years.
“No question, there’s got to be frustration, because this does create a log jam,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. 
But Candelora, who has a constructive working relationship with the speaker, offered the same assessment as Democrats who were hoping to move up: Ritter has been an attentive leader of a diverse caucus, providing little fuel for a challenge.
“I think he’s broadly respected in the House chamber,” Candelora said. “Obviously, if he didn’t think he had the votes, he wouldn’t have filed.”
The speaker is elected by the full House, and the last speaker denied another term was defeated by the Republican minority voting as a bloc with a group of Democratic dissidents in January 1989.
Democrats currently hold a 100-49 advantage in the House, with two vacancies created by the resignation of one Democrat and death of another.
Rojas said he and Ritter will continue as a team.
“I’m filing and running again, and running for majority leader again with Matt as the speaker,” Rojas said. “As I told him, there’s something’s more important than political goals for myself — other personal relationships and the health of our caucus. Matt’s done a good job, as I said last year.”
All six top leadership posts in the General Assembly are held by men: Ritter, Rojas and Candelora in the House; and President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney of New Haven, Majority Leader Bob Duff of Norwalk and Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield in the Senate.
Democratic Reps. Maria Horn of Salisbury, Cristin McCarthy-Vahey of Fairfield and Kate Farrar of West Hartford praised Ritter’s leadership while affirming a belief that periodic change was healthy for the institution.
“I think it’s not surprising news to a lot of us, and I also think that we as an institution have to be really careful about what that means for us,” McCarthy Vahey said. “And I say all that with deep respect and appreciation for the speaker and the leadership that he has brought to the chamber.”
“Ritter has been a good speaker,” Horn said. “He has been a good consensus builder, a good sort of calming of the waters. He’s built good bipartisan relationships with the minority. Those are all positive things, and I support his leadership on that front.”
Horn said it is important for the House to find other ways to amplify a diversity of voices if the leadership will not be changing. She believes Ritter is open to those conversations.
Horn, as co-chair of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, is one of two women in the House overseeing the key money committees. Rep. Toni Walker, D-New Haven, is the other, as Appropriations co-chair.
She said both were consulted at length as the leadership drafted legislation in a recent special session that added $500 million to the state’s budget reserves.
“Ritter has provided really valuable leadership for our caucus, through COVID, through this Trump chaos,” Farrar said. “And I also think there’s great value in regenerative and new leadership.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0605_SR_SessionLastDay_433-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 17:57:22.535889

(Photo by HUD Office of Public Affairs)Nineteen attorneys general and two governors filed suit in Rhode Island on Tuesday to stop the Trump administration from shifting nearly $4 billion in housing grants they say could place as many as 170,000 formerly homeless people back out on the streets.
The group co-led by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha is accusing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development of violating “congressional intent” in its plan to dramatically reduce the amount of grant funds that can be spent on permanent housing, along with other conditions placed in its latest Notice of Funding Opportunity for Continuum of Care grants.
Enacted Nov. 13, HUD’s new policy instead shifts Continuum of Care funding toward transitional housing and other short-term interventions to the nation’s ongoing homelessness crisis. Only 30% of funds from the $3.9 billion grant program would be allowed to be used for permanent supportive housing — units that provide a subsidized, stable residence for formerly homeless people, often those who have experienced mental illness or spent years on the streets.  
HUD has previously directed approximately 90% of Continuum of Care funding to support permanent supportive units as part of its “Housing First” philosophy, according to the 55-page lawsuit.
“Addressing the crisis requires urgent action from our communities, institutions, and government,” the lawsuit states. “But instead of investing in programs that help people stay safe and housed, the Trump Administration has embraced policies that risk trapping people in poverty and punishing them for being poor.”
HUD’s latest Continuum of Care grants opportunity is open though Jan. 14, 2026. Grant awards are expected to be made May 1.
The new grant rules also eliminate funding for diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients and use of “harm reduction” strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely.
“Individually, these conditions are unlawful and harmful,” the 55-page lawsuit states. “Together, they are a virtual death blow to the CoC Program as it has operated for decades and will lead to predictably disastrous results.”
If the policy isn’t blocked, Neronha warned the cuts would “further exacerbate already dire conditions for homeless Rhode Islanders.” Indeed, Rhode Island’s homeless care providers project a little over 1,000 formerly unhoused people across the state could wind up back on the streets under HUD’s new funding focus.
R.I. housing leaders warn HUD policy change could increase homelessness across the state

“This administration continues to punch down by targeting the most vulnerable Americans, and unfortunately this most recent attack on homeless individuals is consistent with their modus operandi,” Neronha said in a statement. “The president and his administration don’t care about making life easier or better for Americans; they only care about political capitulation, consolidating power, and further enriching the wealthy.”
A HUD spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
In addition to Neronha, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown and New York Attorney General Letitia James are co-leading the lawsuit. 
Also joining the complaint are the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, Wisconsin, along with the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania.
The coalition is asking Judge Mary S. McElroy, who was appointed to the bench during Trump’s first term, to declare the new conditions unlawful and reinstate language from prior funding notices.
HUD framed its new funding policies as a way to promote “self-sufficiency among vulnerable Americans” and align with President Donald Trump’s July 24 Executive Order titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets.”
But the lawsuit filed Tuesday argues that Congress created the Continuum of Care program to ensure stability so providers can reliably serve people whose lives depend on it. The coalition says HUD’s changes are arbitrary and capricious because officials offered no explanation for abruptly reversing longstanding policies.
“HUD has failed to supply any rational explanation for these newly proposed conditions that are entirely unrelated to (and in some cases even inhibit) the statutory purpose of addressing homelessness,” the lawsuit states.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced changes to funding for what are called continuums of care, or the regional groups that organize to address homelessness. Those changes prioritize funding for programs that require people to meet pre-existing conditions such as sobriety, push people into stays at psychiatric facilities, ask about people’s immigration status before giving them services and only recognize two genders.
Continuums of care offer rental aid to nearly 6,000 households across the state. Many of those formerly homeless people are in permanent supportive housing, which means they have disabilities and get services at their homes.
Attorney General William Tong said the state signed on to the lawsuit to try to stop people from losing their homes under the new policy. The aid could end as soon as January for some households.
“They’re putting a bunch of nonsensical, ridiculous conditions on this funding,” Tong said during a Tuesday press conference. “They’re now saying that if you serve people who are transgender, and you acknowledge that they are not the gender of their birth, or if they won’t go into a program because they struggle with addiction, then they can’t be housed. They can’t have a roof over their heads.
“We are just trying to make sure that people are safe and that they don’t die out in the cold, and that’s why we’re suing.”
The lawsuit is the latest in a series of lawsuits Tong’s office has signed on to against the federal government since President Donald Trump came into office in January. It also comes as homelessness is rising in Connecticut and temperatures drop.
HUD formerly allowed service providers to put 90% of their federal funding through the continuums into these housing programs, and some people have been living in apartments with this aid for decades. Now, HUD has said only 30% of the money can go to these programs starting in 2026.
HUD did not respond to a request for comment by press time.
Sarah Fox, chief executive of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness, said the funding is critical and she is glad to see Tong step up.
“These are people who have been housed for years, and their housing is just as important as every one of ours,” Fox said. “We need to keep these people housed. We need to ensure that they remain housed, and we appreciate the state for stepping up.”
Service providers have asked Gov. Ned Lamont to put $70 million of the $500 million flexible fund the legislature approved earlier this month to address federal cuts toward the continuums of care. Lamont last week said he was in conversation with agencies and other officials about the best way to spend the money.
“Now there’s some threats in terms of housing cuts,” Lamont said last week. “We do have a $500 million reserve there to take care of the most vulnerable in need, to make sure that nobody is sitting outside, can’t get a place to stay in January if it’s due to the fact that the feds have cut back on things.”
The Connecticut Mirror requested comment from the governor’s office at 2:30 p.m., which referred the CT Mirror to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. The department had not responded as of 5 p.m.
Lawmakers on Tuesday said in a press release that they were concerned about the cuts. Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London, said that the state needs to “fight these cuts with urgency and be unapologetic.”
Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, said the action “undoes decades of important work and we cannot allow that to happen.”
Chair of the End Homelessness Caucus Rep. Kadeem Roberts, D-Norwalk, said the actions amounted to “unwarranted cruelty.”
“These changes by this federal administration and HUD to the Continuum of Care program are not only cruel, but will have real consequences for thousands of residents experiencing housing instability,” Roberts said. “This is particularly concerning to me as temperatures begin to drop, and housing becomes even more vital.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TONG-LAWSUIT-0716-7-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-25 16:57:38.910000

“I want to thank every person who supported this campaign,” Strnad said in a statement. “I ran to give working class families a voice and to deliver results for communities that have long been overlooked.”
Strnad launched his campaign for the Democratic nomination in August, acknowledging  he was polarizing and a longshot for the position. He told the Examiner at the start of his campaign that his mother thought he should “run for something smaller.”
He launched his campaign saying that he would seek to improve conditions for workers by repealing Act 10 and getting rid of “right to work” — the law that lets workers who are represented by unions decline to pay union dues without giving up their right to the union’s representation. He said he supported police and allowing access to abortion in Wisconsin. 
Strnad said he is endorsing Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley in the crowded race and encouraged his supporters to support him as well. He said Crowley “is the candidate who can hit the ground running, fight for families, and begin delivering those results for Wisconsin starting on day one.”
Other Democratic hopefuls include Lt. Gov. Sarah Rodriguez, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) and former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A federal judge in Denver on Tuesday found that federal immigration officers have “routinely” made warrantless arrests in Colorado in violation of federal statutes, ordering the Trump administration to halt the practice and take steps to prove that it’s complying with the law.
The partial injunction granted by Judge R. Brooke Jackson of the U.S. District Court of Colorado followed a lawsuit filed last month by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado on behalf of four plaintiffs who alleged they were subjected to unlawful immigration arrests. Federal law requires immigration officers making a warrantless arrest to show probable cause that the individual “is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained” for their arrest.
In a 66-page order, Jackson wrote that the plaintiffs had shown the defendants in the case — Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other top immigration officials — “likely have a policy, pattern, and/or practice of violating these sections by effecting warrantless arrests without individualized probable cause of flight risk.”

The four plaintiffs in the case are Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old Utah nursing student who spent 15 days in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora after a traffic stop in Mesa County; Refugio Ramirez Ovando, a 43-year-old man taken into custody in Grand Junction in an arrest that agents later admitted was a case of mistaken identity; and two other men identified only by their initials, J.S.T. and G.R.R.
Jackson’s injunction grants four of the six measures of relief sought by ACLU’s lawsuit, including the termination of ankle monitoring and other conditions of release for the plaintiffs. He ordered that officers making warrantless arrests must “consider the totality of the circumstances” when determining flight risk.
“Mere presence within the United States in violation of United States immigration law is not, by itself, sufficient to conclude that a person is likely to escape before a warrant for arrest can be obtained,” Jackson said.
The injunction further requires immigration officers to make extensive documentation for each warrantless arrest, including “the specific, particularized facts supporting the conclusion that the person was likely to escape before a warrant could be obtained,” and to make that documentation available for regular inspection by the plaintiffs and the court.
Jackson’s ruling also granted the plaintiffs’ request for provisional class-action status, extending protections to all individuals “who have been arrested or will be arrested” unlawfully in Colorado since Jan. 2o, 2025.
In his second term, President Donald Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.
Jackson declined to order two other measures sought by the ACLU, which would have required immigration enforcement agencies to conduct training on warrantless arrest procedures and regularly provide documentation that the training was taking place.
“However, should compliance with the Order prove elusive, plaintiffs may renew this request,” he wrote.

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered a pair of three-judge panels to hear arguments in two lawsuits challenging the state’s congressional maps. 
The challenges to the maps come as fights play out all over the country over the dividing lines of congressional districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections. After Texas legislators worked to draw Democratic seats out of existence at the behest of President Donald Trump and a number of other Republican-led states followed suit, California voters elected to temporarily undo their state’s independent redistricting commission and allow Democratic leaders to wipe out Republican-leaning seats. 
Similar efforts have followed to varying degrees of success in states including Arkansas, Indiana and Virginia. 
Wisconsin’s political maps have been at the center of its divided government for more than a decade, with the Supreme Court undoing the partisan gerrymander in the state Legislature two years ago. 
Since then, the focus has turned to Wisconsin’s congressional maps, where Republicans control six of the state’s eight districts. More than once, the Supreme Court has declined to hear cases that request the Court directly take up challenges to the congressional maps. 
A lobbying effort in the state is also ongoing to establish an independent, nonpartisan process for creating the state’s legislative and congressional maps. 
On Tuesday, the Court ruled that the challenges to the maps must follow a 2011 law, passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature and signed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker, which requires that challenges to the state’s congressional districts be heard by a panel of three circuit court judges. 
Republicans had argued that law shouldn’t apply in this case. In a 5-2 decision, in which the court’s four liberal justices were joined by conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn, the Court ruled the law applies and the panels should be created.
In the majority decision, the Court’s liberals also appointed the panels — of which all the members were appointed by Gov. Tony Evers or endorsed liberal Justice Susan Crawford in this spring’s election. 
Hagedorn dissented on the appointment of the panels, arguing the panel members should’ve been appointed randomly. 
“Given the nature of this case and the statute’s implicit call for geographic diversity and neutrality, a randomly-selected panel and venue would be a better way to fulfill the statutory mandate,” Hagedorn wrote. “To be clear, I am not suggesting the judicial panel will fail to do its job with integrity and impartiality. But this approach is an odd choice in the face of a statute so clearly designed to deter litigants from selecting their preferred venue and judge.” 
Justices Annette Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley dissented from the decision, arguing the majority chose the judges on the panel to further the goals of the Democratic party. 
In several previous lawsuits over political maps, Bradley and Ziegler have issued rulings that benefited the Republican party or further entrenched the partisan gerrymander that has allowed the Republican party to retain control of the Legislature for 15 years. 
“Hand picking circuit court judges to perform political maneuvering is unimaginable,” Ziegler wrote. “Yet, my colleagues persist and appear to do this, all in furtherance of delivering partisan, political advantage to the Democratic Party.” 
On Tuesday, Crawford and Justice Janet Protasiewicz also issued orders denying requests from Republican members of Congress and GOP voters that they recuse themselves from the redistricting cases. Since the two justices’ elections in recent years, the state’s Republicans have regularly accused the pair of making statements on the campaign trail that show pre-judgment of cases involving the state’s political maps. 
“The Congressmen’s recusal theories are overbroad, impracticable, and rife with unintended consequences,” Crawford wrote. “Individuals and organizations have the right to contribute to judicial campaigns and to express their beliefs about the effect judicial elections will have on issues of importance to them. Demanding that a justice recuse from a case because third parties who made campaign contributions have expressed their views on high-profile issues improperly implies that the judge had endorsed or adopted such views. This insinuation is inappropriate, particularly where the judge has expressly disclaimed such an endorsement, and undermines judicial impartiality. Further, it would chill protected speech and undermine this court’s central role of deciding cases of statewide importance.”

Credit: Related DigitalOne of the state’s largest energy companies is asking energy regulators to fast track approval of two contracts to provide power to a data center planned for construction in Saline Township, but environmental advocates and state officials have banded together to demand greater transparency into the details.
DTE Energy on Oct. 31 filed a request for ex parte approval seeking two contracts to supply 1.4 gigawatts of energy to a facility under development by ChatGPT creator Open AI, Oracle and Related Digital.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a request to intervene in the case, requesting the Michigan Public Service Commission. which oversees energy utilities in the state, view the matter as a contested case. That would allow different parties to intervene, request discovery and file testimony for the commission to review before making a decision on the contracts.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While DTE maintains that its contracts with the energy-intensive facility will not result in higher rates for its customers, Nessel said the plan lacks clarity on how consumers would be protected.
Though the commission has set a date for a virtual public hearing ahead of its next meeting, Nessel has argued that without a contested case declaration, the hearing amounts to “performative listening rather than thorough public scrutiny.”
“This is all highly unusual, to say the least,” Nessel said in a Zoom call on Tuesday. “DTE itself is anticipating it will spend half a billion dollars to service this new customer, making unverified promises nobody else will shoulder these costs, and urging the commission to fast track this application without any of the normally prescribed public scrutiny.”

While The Sierra Club, Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council and Citizens Utility Board of Michigan have also requested a contested case hearing, Nessel said that there is no indication the commission will hear their requests for intervention. That’s raised concerns over the commission facing political pressure to move forward on the deal without public input.
Matt Helms, a public information officer for the commission, declined to comment.
In an email to Michigan Advance, DTE’s Director of Corporate Communications Jill Wilmot, said the state’s regulatory process allows companies to file for an uncontested approval of contracts if there is no cost of service increase to customers.
“To that end, DTE Electric is following the defined process for filing this regulatory request,” Wilmot said.
Wilmot added that the data center is also footing the cost of a battery storage project to help meet energy demand at the facility.

Nessel noted that the public does not have the option to read over the full contract because there is no public version available, or at least without heavy redactions.
“My call here today is not that data centers don’t belong in Michigan, that they can’t be managed responsibly and regulated fairly. It’s actually quite the opposite of that; that we can regulate these entities responsibly, and therefore we have an obligation to do so,” Nessel said. “These special contracts will control how hundreds of millions of utility dollars are spent. I don’t think we’re being alarmist here by saying that deserves even just the most basic process and access the commission typically affords our offices.”
State Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor), who represents the area where the data center is being sited, said there are tremendous concerns within the community about the resource demands from the data center.
Some of those concerns include whether the facility will dry up wells or bring skyrocketing energy rates with it; and how the data centers coming into the state will impact the state’s goal of meeting a 100% clean energy standard by 2040.
Charlotte Jameson, the chief policy officer for the Michigan Environmental Council, said that in order to meet the state’s clean energy goals, it must rely heavily on renewable energy and battery storage. However, when significant new loads are added to the energy grid, utilities often rush to build natural gas plants, Jameson added. DTE has already discussed plans to replace its Monroe Coal Plant with a gas plant, alongside other gas plants under consideration.
Although natural gas plants are included in the law’s definition of clean energy systems, and the plants must utilize 90% effective carbon capture and storage technology, the Institute for Energy Economic and Financial Analysis has questioned the effectiveness of the technology, warning that it could increase carbon dioxide emissions.
Michigan regulators to host public hearing on DTE contracts for Saline Township data center

DTE has submitted testimony in the case detailing how the Saline Township project would impact their ability to remain within Michigan’s clean energy goals, but the company’s plan is sparse on details, Jameson said. The lack of transparency has raised additional questions on whether the company will need to pursue an extension to comply with the state’s clean energy requirements.
State Rep. Morgan Foreman (D-Pittsfield Township) said the deal has implications beyond Saline Township. 

“This is a precedent setting decision for the future of data centers and AI development in Michigan,” Foreman said. “If we allow one utility to bypass public engagement, we open the door for it to happen again and again and again and again.”
For residents concerned about the data center, Nessel advised them to direct their energy toward DTE, the public service commission, and their local lawmakers, with Irwin saying the Legislature needs to develop better rules to ensure Michigan’s waters and energy consumers are protected from these resource-intensive facilities.

Two domestic violence tools the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office unveiled three years ago provide the kind of information that could save the lives of victims and the officers who respond, law enforcement leaders say. 
But challenges remain. Adding an incident into the Mississippi Domestic Violence Registry is double the work: One report goes to  the law enforcement department and one goes to the system, said Luke Thompson, former chief of the Byram Police Department who trains officers about how to respond to domestic violence. 
Officers have used the system and the Mississippi Protective Order Registry, but the attorney general’s office is hoping for better participation. 
Thompson and Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen recognize how situations can turn deadly for victims and law enforcement during domestic violence calls. The Officer Down Memorial, a nonprofit that tracks line-of-duty deaths, found that in nearly every state since 1992, officers have died while responding to domestic violence calls. 
Just this year, Missisisppi officers have been killed during domestic violence calls. 
In February, Hinds County Deputy Sgt. Martin Shields Jr. was shot and killed by a man who had shot his own wife and another woman in Terry. The man later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. McComb Police Sgt. Jason Blake died in August while responding to an off-duty request where a man shot and injured a woman before fatally shooting Blake and himself.  
When they are training officers within their department or around the state, leaders like McCutchen and Thompson are able to share how every piece of information they add to the registries can help keep them, other law enforcement officers and the public safer. 
“The more data that you have at your disposal in real time, the better decision you can make and the better outcomes that can come,” said McCutchen, whose department has been using the incident registry since its launch. 
Access to information about prior incidents at the same address, by the same abuser and active protective orders could be used to help corroborate a victim’s story in live time, he said. 
It’s also a chance to build trust by showing victims that officers have prior information, that they can add the current incident to the system, and that if abuse happens again there or somewhere else, someone can look it up, McCutchen said.
Domestic violence prevention through intervention
Mississippi’s law enforcement departments and agencies often have separate systems specific to their local, county or state jurisdictions. Law enforcement can access and submit to federal systems such as the National Incident-Based Reporting System, but that system has limits and data collection only began in 2019. 
Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s office used the same electronic platform many officers were already using for motor vehicle crashes, believing that familiarity would lead to more input of information. Her office also has been training officers on how to use the systems. 
As of Jan. 1, officers have logged about 5,400 incidents into the system, according to the attorney general’s office. 
Officers are asked to fill in basics like location and a narrative, but they can also include additional details, including whether children were present at the time, whether the victim is pregnant and diagrams that show any injuries, according to a user guide for the Domestic Violence Registry. 
A way to help prevent domestic violence incidents from turning deadly is through intervention. 
Within the domestic violence registry, the attorney general’s office added a lethality assessment, which is a tool to help determine a person’s risk of being injured or killed by a partner. Officers ask a series of questions to learn about abusive behavior. From there, they connect victims with domestic violence services.

As chief, Thompson implemented domestic violence response training with domestic violence advocates and educators and used the lethality assessment. In 2018, the first full year of using the training and assessment, he said the department reduced the number of domestic response calls by over 30%. An additional 25% reduction happened the next year. 
The numbers made Thompson curious about what changed. What he found were fewer calls to the same addresses. He said that earlier intervention and referral of victims to service groups helped reduce calls in the future. 
To save additional time for officers, Thompson started an app that streamlines the lethality assessment and automates data sharing between law enforcement and their area domestic violence service provider. It’s currently used by several Mississippi law enforcement agencies, he said. 
Tracking protective orders
Another domestic violence-related system by the attorney general’s office is the Mississippi Protective Order Registry, which is among several statewide systems across the country. 
Through a federal system, the National Crime Information Center Protection Order File, law enforcement agencies and the military submit protection orders. 
Mississippi’s registry contains court-issued civil and criminal protective orders. These can be temporary or long-term orders a person  sought and a judge approved, or from a court-ordered protection in a criminal case. 
So far for this year, nearly 600 domestic abuse protection orders have been entered into the registry, according to the attorney general’s office. 
Clerks add full protective orders to the system. A number of players from the justice system, including judges, law enforcement and prosecutors, have access to the registry and can use it to tell if protective orders are being followed. 
Clerks fill in basic information such as conditions of the protective order and which judge approved it, according to a user guide for the order registry. Additionally, once law enforcement gives access, clerks can add updated bond conditions and case disposition information to incidents logged in the domestic violence registry. 
The domestic violence incident and protective order systems are not accessible to the public because they contain investigative law enforcement material and may involve an open investigation or ongoing litigation, according to the attorney general’s office.   
McCutchen, the Oxford chief, said the protective order registry is similarly helpful because it gives officers information. In some cases, that may be entire copies of protective orders detailing who is protected and the terms of the order to be followed. 
If someone is found to have violated the protection order – broken conditions of no abuse, no contact and distance from the protected person – police then could call the judge who issued the order, who may ask for the person to be brought to court. Violation of a protection order is a misdemeanor that can lead to up to six months in jail and/or a fine. 
A protective order database can be helpful in a community like Oxford, where people from Mississippi and other states attend school and visitors come for games and other events, McCutchen said. 
Thompson said if service providers or advocates know someone has a protective order, they can help the person make plans to stay safe. That could mean crafting an exit strategy, saving money for when they leave an abusive partner or getting a new cellphone. 
“How are we going to make this piece of paper effective for you?” he said about protective orders and assistance from a domestic violence organization. 
“You don’t just run,” Thompson said. “You have resources.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/18170127/MT-DomesticViolence-ProtectiveOrder-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2025-11-25 16:57:38.910000

Harold Pope Jr., left, and Rep. Matthew McQueen, right, asked state utility regulators for greater transparency regarding the proposed New Mexico Gas Company sale. (Photos: Danielle Prokop/Source NM and courtesy of Matthew McQueen) A pair of New Mexico lawmakers joined a small group of clean energy advocates and residents Tuesday morning in urging state utility regulators to demand greater transparency in the pending sale of New Mexico Gas Company.
The gas company in late 2024 filed an application to be sold to Bernhard Capital Partners, a New Orleans-based private equity firm, for nearly $1.3 billion. The companies initially had an early November deadline to finalize a sale agreement, but they recently agreed to extend that into early 2026.
A half-dozen people spoke Tuesday morning at a Public Regulation Commission meeting to urge greater transparency surrounding the deal. One, a Santa Fe psychologist named Patricia Brown, said she was alarmed to learn that Bernhard Capital’s founder previously ran a firm named the Shaw Group that FEMA awarded no-bid disaster response contracts 20 years ago in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. 
A 2008 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General determined that FEMA wasted millions of dollars by awarding the no-bid contracts to Shaw and others. A 2011 report commissioned by the state of Louisiana alleged that Shaw appeared to overbill the state by nearly $500,000 for constructing sand berms along the coastline to prevent oil from the BP oil spill from washing onto land.
Brown and others who spoke said it’s troubling that details like these, which the news media reported years ago, had not been introduced into the official record regarding New Mexico Gas Company’s proposed sale.
“We cannot protect the public interest without full transparency,” Sen. Harold Pope Jr. (D-Albuquerque), a 2026 candidate for lieutenant governor, told commissioners Tuesday morning. “That is impossible when critical information is hidden from view. Right now, central evidence about Bernhard Capital Partners’ regulatory compliance history including violations, fines, audits and settlements involving their affiliates and formerly owned companies has been withheld from the record. You can not reliably weigh benefits against risk when the most relevant facts are kept from the public.”
Similarly, state Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo), who chairs the House Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Committee and is running to be state land commissioner, told commissioners that they should implement a “robust discovery process” and a record that details all of the concerns surrounding companies related to Bernhard Capital.
New Mexico Gas Company referred comment to Bernhard Capital, which did not immediately respond.
Energy advocates have characterized Bernhard Capital’s response to the scrutiny as “a hand in the face.” 
New Energy Economy, a Santa Fe nonprofit that advocates for clean energy legislation, in a statement called Bernhard Capital’s track record cast doubt on whether it “can be trusted to provide reliable, safe and cost effective service.” Among other elements, the group noted that companies owned by the private equity firm have faced allegations of failing “to properly operate and maintain” a Louisiana water treatment facility where inspectors found bloodworms in sludge; mishandling hazardous waste such as asbestos; and failing to pay dozens of workers overtime wages.
“You want to come in and buy our essential utility service and we’re not allowed to know about your background?” Mariel Nanasi, New Energy Economy’s executive director, said in an interview Tuesday. “It’s like applying to be a school bus driver and the public school would say, ‘Let me see your accident history,’ and the bus driver says, ‘Oh, no, that’s irrelevant.’ What are you talking about?”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/popemcqueen-1024x683.png,,,2025-11-25 16:57:38.910000

President Donald Trump said in posts on Truth Social that their words were seditious and punishable by death. He also shared a post calling for them to be hanged.
Crow, an Aurora Democrat who is a former Army Ranger, has seen increased threats to his office since the video and Trump’s statements. Trump has continued to post about the video since his initial threats.

The Department of Defense announced Monday it’s investigating U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, for his participation in the video. Others in the video include U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, U.S. Rep. Chris DeLuzio of Pennsylvania, U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and U.S. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, all Democrats. 
“No amount of intimidation or harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our Constitution,” Crow, Deluzio, Goodlander and Houlahan said in a joint statement following the FBI’s request for interviews. “We swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. We will not be bullied. We will never give up the ship.”
U.S. Rep. Jeff Crank, a Colorado Springs Republican, said in a statement to Newsline that while the video Crow participated in is “shameful, inappropriate, and a threat to our national security,” he does not think his words warrant capital punishment. 
“Members of Congress should never be telling our troops to disobey orders from their commanding officers,” Crank said. “However, I do not believe that these actions are punishable by death.”
Crow and the others in the video specified that troops have the right to refuse illegal orders — not any order — under the U.S. Constitution and other legal provisions.

Jim Justice and his wife Cathy Justice immediately settled a new lawsuit seeking more than $5.1 million in unpaid federal income taxes spanning 15 years.
U.S. attorneys with the tax division of the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint Monday seeking to collect the unpaid liabilities dating back to 2009.
The filing in the district court for the Southern District of West Virginia said that both husband and wife had received notices about the unpaid amount, and, “Defendants James C. Justice, II, and Cathy L. Justice have neglected or refused to make full payment of those assessments to the United States.”
A short time after the federal filing, the Justices filed a motion Monday agreeing to pay the  $5,164,739.75 owed as of Aug. 4, 2025, along with the “other additions to tax accruing thereafter according to law until paid in full.” 
Justice’s Senate office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Justice, a Republican, was easily elected to the U.S. Senate last year while financial obligations mounted. In 2023, he faced a potential garnishment of his governor’s salary to pay back loans related to purchased coal equipment. 
Ahead of last year’s election, the state of West Virginia’s Tax Division placed a series of liens on The Greenbrier resort — which the Justice family operates — more than $4 million because of sales taxes that were collected but not remitted to the state, MetroNews reported. 
In October, Politico reported that the Internal Revenue Service had filed a notice of a federal tax lien against Justice and his wife for more than $8 million in unpaid assessments for tax years 2009, 2017 and 2022.
Justice brushed off the financial issues, saying it was “politically motivated” and that the IRS owed him money. He connected the lien to his family’s coal business ties, saying they were complicated and complex. 
Justice sold the family coal company, Bluestone Coal, to Russian-based Mechel in 2009 for about $436 million in cash and stock. Justice said his tax issues began in 2009 with audits by the IRS under the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama.
“The timetable is running out on the claim that they have, that back in 2009 I should have paid a few dollars more than what I paid,” Justice said Oct. 23 in response to a question from reporter Steven Allen Adams with Ogden Newspapers. “What they just did is they said we’ll go back to 2009 and we’re going to assess your interest and penalties on that all the way through and that’s how they come to the ($8 million).”
Cathy Justice serves on the state school board after being appointed by her husband in 2024.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita on Tuesday released the state’s new Consumer Data Protection Bill of Rights, saying the document is intended to help Hoosiers understand and exercise their rights under the Indiana Consumer Data Protection Act before it takes effect in January.
“Every click, every purchase, every search, every doctor visit, every dollar you spend, is tracked, packaged and sold, often without you even knowing,” Rokita said at a news conference in Indianapolis. “Your personal data is your personal property, and for years now, decades now, it’s been taken from you.”
Indiana’s General Assembly passed the privacy law unanimously in 2023. Rokita said it is “a huge first step, not a complete solution by any means,” but marks the first time Hoosiers will be able to force companies to show what data they hold, correct inaccuracies or “most importantly, delete the data.”
The new bill of rights outlines 15 protections for Indiana consumers, including rights to delete personal data held by companies; opt out of targeted advertising and data sales; and request a copy of their information in a portable format.
It also prohibits companies from discriminating against consumers who use those rights. 
Sensitive information — like health, biometric, immigration, religious, or precise location data, as well as all children’s data — also can’t be processed without explicit consent.
The Republican attorney general said companies must place a clearly marked privacy notice or data-rights link “in a prominent spot on their website,” and once a request is filed, the companies will have 45 days from the date of your request to comply.
Still, Rokita criticized exemptions in the law for nonprofits, utilities, banks and entities covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.
“Some have no sense whatsoever,” he said. “Some of our nonprofits are the biggest takers of our private, personal data … They’re exempted from this law. Why? Who knows.” 
Rokita said he expects to make recommendations to lawmakers during the upcoming 2026 session but will begin enforcing the statute as written, for now.
Consumer Protection Division Chief Scott Barnhart called the law “a good first step” that lets consumers “recapture some of their privacy” and gain “transparency into the system.” 
Doug Swetnam, data privacy and identity theft section chief, added that the law provides a long-sought remedy for inaccurate information, noting that, previously, “there was no means for a consumer to make sure the data was accurate or to ask companies to delete the data they’ve been accumulating.”
Swetnam said the office will enforce requirements for “simple-to-understand” privacy notices and will rely on consumer complaints as well as staff reviews of company practices. 
Rokita emphasized that violators could face injunctions and fines of $7,500 an incident.
“Where we had no power to control our property rights, our data right before as consumers,” Rokita said, “now we do.”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Everywhere, abundance.
That is the theme of the American Thanksgiving. Family and friends crowded around tables overflowing with food, thick moments of conversation, laughter, remembrance. It is a day meant to drip and swirl with excess. 
But regardless of its design, a holiday is just a point in time. There will be hunger on Thursday, as always, and the day grants no respite from the weight of absence, of hurt, of emptiness. Everybody knows Thanksgiving’s opposite, whether directly or obliquely. To be human, to live humanly, is to understand scarcity — if not of food than of friendship, of hope and connection. Only by category and degree are we separated in our understanding.
To know that is to grasp the roots of empathy. To abide there is the very practice of grace.
Still, even on a day set aside for gratitude, thanks applied more broadly does not come easily. The choices our world has made, continues to make, disqualify us as an advanced civilization, or even an aspiring one. A society consumed by the dream of sentient machines, as now, while sentient people go unfed, unsheltered, and untreated, all while the natural world suffers permanently under the weight of temporary industry, is a society that doesn’t understand the mission.
In that failure, we stand unsteadily at a crumbling edge.
There are few options in a position such as ours. Resignation is one, disengagement another. You can submit to fear, embrace the resulting cruelty. Or flail against the current of time, in the delusion that what has passed is preferable to progress.
Each is a variation of retreat. 
There is only one way forward at the edge, and that is forward. With eyes open and panning — unafraid and engaged. Aware not only of all that is broken but all that is worth preserving, worth celebrating, worth passing on even in its imperfection.  
To live fully is to understand that what we perceive as opposites are inextricably intertwined, and dependent. We know that the experience of joy requires the echo of sorrow, just as sorrow presupposes joy. And so it is with the waves of bounty and lack, degradation and ascent, acquisition and loss. Our greatest enemy, then, is despair — gratitude’s opposite — which negates the truth of experience, of existence. It deprives us of seeing what surrounds us, today and always.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The Trump administration wants access to state driver’s license data on millions of U.S. residents as it builds a powerful citizenship verification program amid its clampdown on voter fraud and illegal immigration.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security seeks access to an obscure computer network used by law enforcement agencies, according to a federal notice, potentially allowing officials to bypass negotiating with states for the records.
The information would then be plugged into a Homeland Security program known as SAVE that Trump officials have deployed to search for rare instances of alleged noncitizen voters and to verify citizenship. The plan comes as the Trump administration demands states share copies of their voter files that include sensitive personal data that also is being plugged into SAVE; it is suing some states that refuse.
Trump officials tout the SAVE program as a boost for election integrity. But critics of the program warn the federal government is constructing a massive, centralized information source on Americans. They fear President Donald Trump or a future president could use the tool to surveil residents or target political enemies.
Trump wants states to feed voter info into powerful citizenship data program

“What this SAVE database expansion will do is serve as a central pillar to build dossiers on all of us,” said Cody Venzke, a senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union.
At the same time, Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, conducted nearly 900,000 searches for state driver’s license and other motor vehicle data over the past year using the same data-sharing network that Homeland Security wants to link to SAVE, according to information provided to Congress. The network is called Nlets — formerly the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, now known as the International Justice and Public Safety Network.
Dozens of congressional Democrats in mid-November warned Democratic governors that Nlets makes driver’s license data available to ICE, including from states that restrict cooperation with the agency. While ICE, a Homeland Security agency, has long had access to Nlets, some Democrats are voicing renewed alarm amid Trump’s sweeping deportation campaign.
At least five states — Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington — have blocked Nlets’ ability to share their driver’s license records with ICE, according to the Nov. 12 letter from 40 Democratic lawmakers. Oregon also is taking steps to block access.
In Colorado, state Sen. Julie Gonzales said she is willing to advance bills to block the Nlets data sharing. Gonzales, a Democrat who chairs the Colorado Senate Judiciary Committee, has previously sponsored legislation to limit what personal information is shared with the federal government for immigration enforcement.
“It is like playing Whac-A-Mole, but the Constitution applies to ICE, too,” Gonzales said.
The recent developments underscore the ongoing struggle between Democratic states and the Trump administration over how much access Homeland Security should have to their residents’ personal data. For their part, some Republican state officials have voiced support for the administration’s moves and want to aid the search for noncitizen voters and individuals in the country illegally.
Data and privacy experts told Stateline the current moment could lead to more centralization of personal data by the federal government and an eroding expectation of privacy when it comes to driver’s license information. The federal government is for the first time essentially building a U.S. citizenship database, they said.
Some Republican states resist DOJ demand for private voter data

Homeland Security is proposing to take Nlets outside its intended use, said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
Nlets is a nonprofit organization that facilitates data sharing among law enforcement agencies across state lines. At a basic level, Nlets is the system that allows police officers to quickly look up the driver’s license information of out-of-state motorists they pull over.
States decide what information to make available through Nlets, and which agencies can access it. Each state has an Nlets member, typically that state’s highway patrol or equivalent agency. Several federal law enforcement agencies also are members.
“It appears that DHS is eyeing it for something quite different, for mass extraction of driver’s license information that would be far beyond the sort of targeted enforcement purposes of a system like Nlets,” Davisson said.
Driver data idea floated in May
Homeland Security’s SAVE program — Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements — was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But it can now scan state voter rolls for alleged noncitizen voters.
In the past, SAVE could search only one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing officials to potentially scan through information on millions of registered voters. Federal officials in May connected the program to Social Security data; linking driver’s license data through Nlets would provide an additional mountain of data on U.S. residents.
The League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that advocates for voting rights, filed a federal lawsuit in September against Homeland Security over the transformation of SAVE. In its complaint, the organization accused the department of ignoring federal law to create comprehensive databases of American citizens’ data.
U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan, a Biden appointee, last week declined to temporarily block SAVE’s overhaul while the lawsuit proceeds. But Sooknanan wrote in an opinion that based on the current record, “the Court is troubled by the recent changes to SAVE and doubts the lawfulness of the Government’s actions.”
Homeland Security publicly confirmed it wants to connect Nlets to SAVE in an Oct. 31 Federal Register notice. The notice said driver’s licenses are the most widely used form of identification, and by working with states and national agencies, including Nlets, “SAVE will use driver’s license and state identification card numbers to check and confirm identity information.”
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The agency also privately floated its interest in Nlets months earlier.
According to minutes of a May virtual meeting of the National Association of Secretaries of State Elections Committee, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) official Brian Broderick told the group that his agency — the Homeland Security agency that administers SAVE — was seeking “to avoid having to connect to 50 state databases” and wanted a “simpler solution,” such as Nlets.
The minutes were contained in records from the Texas Secretary of State’s Office obtained by American Oversight, a nonpartisan transparency group that frequently files records requests. Mother Jones magazine first reported on the records.
Nlets and the Texas Secretary of State’s Office didn’t respond to requests for comment.
On Friday, National Association of Secretaries of State spokesperson Brittany Hamilton wrote in an email to Stateline that at that time, “we have not received specific updates from USCIS on this aspect of driver’s license data potential usage.”
In a statement, USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser encouraged all federal, state and local agencies to use SAVE.
“USCIS remains dedicated to eliminating barriers to securing the nation’s electoral process. By allowing states to efficiently verify voter eligibility, we are reinforcing the principle that America’s elections are reserved exclusively for American citizens,” Tragesser wrote.
State restrictions flawed, lawmakers say
Some Democrats are separately pushing to limit ICE’s access to driver’s license data through Nlets. The Nov. 12 congressional letter warned that while some states have restrictions on data sharing with immigration authorities, the limits are often ineffective because of major flaws.
State limits sometimes apply only to state motor vehicle agencies, which don’t connect to Nlets — and often don’t apply to state police agencies that do connect, the letter said. And even though state restrictions target data-sharing for immigration enforcement, Nlets doesn’t indicate the purpose of a request.
“Because of the technical complexity of Nlets’ system, few state government officials understand how their state is sharing their residents’ data with federal and out-of-state agencies,” wrote U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, U.S. Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York and 38 other Democrats.
Homeland Security didn’t address Stateline’s questions about ICE’s access to state driver’s license data through Nlets.










I think that for many years, folks around the country that are concerned about privacy, that are concerned about immigrants, have been trying to sound the alarm about this issue.


– Matthew Lopas of the National Immigration Law Center


Advocates for immigrants have long raised concerns about ICE access to state driver’s license data through Nlets. Nineteen states allow residents to obtain driver’s licenses regardless of immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center, an immigrant advocacy group. Those driver’s license records represent a wealth of information on noncitizens.
While ICE can’t use Nlets to obtain records of all noncitizens issued licenses, the agency can use the search tool to obtain a variety of information on individuals, such as date of birth, sex, address and Social Security number, according to the law center. Sometimes a photo is also available — a particular concern for immigrants and their advocates amid reports that ICE has deployed facial recognition tools in the field.
“I think that for many years, folks around the country that are concerned about privacy, that are concerned about immigrants, have been trying to sound the alarm about this issue,” said Matthew Lopas, director of state advocacy and technical assistance at the National Immigration Law Center.
Stateline contacted all 50 state governors to ask about Nlets. Forty-one offices didn’t respond and most others provided high-level statements or referred questions to other agencies.
But Maryland indicated it was taking “proactive measures” to ensure that federal agencies’ access to its data through Nlets complies with state and federal law. A 2021 state law limits the sharing of driver’s license data with federal immigration authorities.
Maryland “is working with Nlets to ensure that Marylanders’ data is not misused for civil immigration enforcement absent a valid judicial warrant, and we intend to share more information on that effort as we are able,” Rhyan Lake, a spokesperson for Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore, said in a statement to Stateline.
The South Dakota Department of Public Safety, which is overseen by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, cautioned against limiting data-sharing among law enforcement. Records obtained through Nlets include data on wanted individuals and other information that can help identify potential threats to officers and agents, the department said in a statement provided by Director of Communications Brad Reiners.
“We reject the concerns outlined in the [Democratic lawmakers’] letter and remain deeply concerned about the potentially dangerous consequences of limiting access to this information,” the statement says.
In Oregon, state officials plan to cut off ICE’s Nlets access to its driver’s license data, but no date has been set, Oregon State Police Capt. Kyle Kennedy, an agency spokesperson, wrote in an email.
“We are working with other states to assist in considering a path forward,” Kennedy wrote.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Ten months of waiting for the prospective buyer of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital to close the deal is enough for Chief Judge Stacey Jernigan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas.
“It’s very upsetting, but eventually — I hate to say something so callous — but fish or cut bait,” Jernigan said during a hearing in Dallas federal bankruptcy court Tuesday morning. “We’re sort of in that position.”
Bankrupt hospital owner Prospect Medical Holdings thought it caught a solid buyer in The Centurion Foundation, an Atlanta nonprofit. The Rhode Island Office of Attorney General and the Department of Health conditionally approved the deal in June 2024. Then, Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January, but the sale was back on, with Jernigan’s permission, by February.
Tentative deal to keep Roger Williams and Fatima open through December in the works

“I didn’t think there was anything remaining required at that point,” Jernigan said. “We know that a sale of a health care business can take a very long time, but usually what I hear in this court is ‘we’re still waiting on regulatory approval.’ We entered this case with regulatory approval. That’s one reason I’m so frustrated.”
Yet Centurion remains unable to finance its purchase, blaming its difficulty securing investor-backed bonds on Prospect’s mismanagement and, more recently, the state’s courtship of an alternative buyer.
Prime Healthcare, which owns Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket among 50 other hospitals nationwide, has been considering a purchase for months at the behest of Gov. Dan McKee’s administration. 
There’s still no offer from Prime, though the California company was identified by name in court for the first time Tuesday. Attorneys used indirect references to Prime in previous hearings. 
Califano said he was “cautiously optimistic” that Prime would come through with something concrete by Dec. 5 — one week before the confirmation hearing on a bankruptcy restructuring agreement, and less than one month before hospital funding runs dry. 
Noel True, a Prime spokesperson, had no additional information to share Tuesday regarding the company’s interest in buying the hospitals.  
“We remain honored by the trust placed in the Prime Healthcare Foundation to explore how we may help ensure these essential hospitals continue serving their communities despite significant challenges that have developed over many years,” True said in an email.
‘These resolutions take time’
Verbal promises can no longer satisfy the 100,000-plus Prospect creditors waiting to cut the Rhode Island hospitals loose and move on. The bankruptcy estate is scheduled to present a formal restructuring plan at a Dec. 12 court hearing.
“The one issue that would prevent confirmation is a resolution for Rhode Island,” Thomas Califano, an attorney with Sidney Austin LLP representing Prospect, told Jernigan on Tuesday. “We need a line of sight to a resolution. Even though we have funding through December, these resolutions take time.”
In other words, sell now, or close the hospitals. 
Prospect laid its cards on the table in October, signaling intent to close the facilities by the end of the year. A short-term cost-sharing agreement with Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office offered a temporary lifeline.
Andrew Troop, a New York attorney representing Neronha’s office in bankruptcy court, assured Jernigan that state regulators were in talks with Prime, while also keeping open the conditional approval already granted to Centurion. 
Not welcome news to Centurion CEO Ben Mingle, who in a series of private emails earlier this month asked state regulators to cease negotiations with Prime. Mingle argued the state’s overtures to Prime undermined Centurion’s ability to close the sale, while simultaneously asking for more time and more flexibility on the deal. 
A spokesperson for Centurion did not immediately return requests for comment Tuesday.
David Wender, an attorney representing Centurion, did not address Mingle’s request in court Tuesday. Instead, Wender focused on the nonprofit’s continued commitment to reviving the two Rhode Island hospitals under its ownership.
“We are still here in pursuit,” Wender said. “We have pressed, and they’re still pressing.”
Wender concluded with an open-ended promise for an update, either through investor-backed bonds or, alternatively, a short-term bank loan that could let it close the deal by early or mid-December.
Troop maintained a neutral stance on the competing buyers on Tuesday.
“We are committed, as we’ve always been, to try and get this done,” Troop said. 
While he acknowledged that selling the hospitals does not put money back in Prospect creditors’ pockets, Troop pointed out that there are indirect benefits, such as releasing the bankruptcy estate from the administrative expenses and liabilities of running the health care facilities. 
For Rhode Island, the benefits are obvious: keeping critical emergency rooms, mental health care and specialty surgical treatments available for patients and jobs for 2,500 employees.
Closing the hospitals, with 500 beds between them and 50,000 emergency room visits in 2024, could send Rhode Island’s fragile health care system over the edge, advocates and state officials warn.
Jernigan empathized.
“I am still steaming over what happened in Pennsylvania,” she said, referring to the closure of two Prospect-owned hospitals in Delaware County earlier this year. 
Of the Rhode Island hospitals she said, “Is it worth it? Of course, for the community, it’s worth it. Of course, for the employees, it’s worth it. But, you know, we’ve run out of estate money. I have a duty, if you will, to make sure the pre-petitioned creditors aren’t worse off at the end of the day than they were before the bankruptcy was filed. At some point, I’ve got to stop that.”
Jernigan punctuated the brief conference with attorneys Tuesday with a warning.
“If we show up on Dec. 5 and there is any desire to go another day, or much longer, waiting for this to maybe play out, we’re going to need witnesses at that point to convince me that this is worth waiting it out a little longer,” she said. “I need reasonable assurances that this is going to happen, and it’s going to happen in December.”

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderA nearly decade-old tax credit program has directed hundreds of millions of dollars to struggling rural hospitals in Georgia over the years, helping to stabilize their finances.
But critics of the program, including those who advocate for full Medicaid expansion, say the program continues to fall short of giving Georgia’s hospitals the support they need to survive long term.
Georgia’s Rural Hospital Tax Credit program allows taxpayers to receive a 100% tax credit for donations made to eligible rural hospitals. A recently released state audit, conducted by the Fiscal Research Center at Georgia State University, found that the program was effective in supporting vulnerable hospitals, but it also found limitations regarding economic growth and its ability to increase the sources of new donations. 
While uptake of the tax credit lagged in the beginning, the report states that donations have nearly reached their statutory cap in recent years. Lawmakers capped the program at $100 million starting in 2025.
Jimmy Lewis, CEO of Hometown Health, which represents rural hospitals, said that the cost to the state is minimal compared to the economic benefit of supporting the state’s rural health care infrastructure.
“If we don’t provide vehicles like this to preserve economic development in rural Georgia, we’re going to accelerate to a third-world nation beyond anything we can imagine … we’ve got very problematic situations where we don’t have the money,” Lewis said. “Again, these hospitals were built in the mid-50s and haven’t been totally upgraded since then, and as a result, we’ve got a real infrastructure problem.”
Since its start in 2017, the program has generated more than $432 million in support for rural hospitals statewide, according to the audit.

The audit also noted a shift in the main source of donations, which previously came from individuals but has increasingly rolled in from businesses and corporations.
“This program was able to let millions of dollars flow directly to rural hospitals, and in return, they could serve the needs of their community the way they needed to, whether it was to buy more equipment, be able to pay doctors and nurses and technicians more, to be competitive,” former Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who sponsored the bill that created the program nearly a decade ago as a Republican state representative, said in an interview. Duncan is a 2026 candidate for governor who is now running for the Democratic ticket.
Despite the program’s cost, Duncan said it is essential and should be expanded. If elected governor, Duncan said he would support doubling the cap on the amount of state funding set aside for the program, raising it from $100 million to $200 million.
“Many of these huge contributions from companies are coming from the largest employer in that community or in that region,” Duncan said. “No business wants to ask hundreds of people to show up to work every day without a rural hospital being viable within a short ambulance ride if something unforeseen happens.”
Past critics of the program said that despite the program’s success as a lifeline for cash-strapped hospitals, it is not enough to address the lack of health care access, particularly in rural Georgia.
Leah Chan, director of health justice at Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said that while the tax credit helps, it “comes nowhere near to solving the scale of the problem.” She pointed to looming challenges posed by the new federal law known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which will reduce federal funding for health services over the next decade.
“I think what this audit shows is that it has generated more than $432 million in support for rural hospitals statewide,” Chan said. “So that is certainly a benefit. Again, no one solution is going to fix all our problems, and we need to access additional levers that allow us to draw down additional federal funds and to ensure we can cover more eligible Georgians.”
These federal cuts will “gut Georgia’s rural providers and communities,” said Natalie Crawford, the executive director of Georgia First and a former Republican commissioner in Habersham County. She said that with $626 million in federal financing cuts for rural hospitals and nearly 100,000 rural Georgians losing their insurance, referencing a recent study from Georgia Health Initiative, the state needs to consider more permanent solutions, such as full Medicaid expansion. Duncan, who was previously opposed to Medicaid expansion as a Republican, also pointed to the federal program as a potential solution.
“Band-Aids like this program aren’t going to save our rural health system from the coming pressures that, if not addressed, will generate a full-blown crisis for our state,” Crawford said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/hospital-sign.jpg,,,2025-11-25 15:59:55.869505

‘Funding did not follow the child’: State audit displays school choice woes

Little Wings of Prayer, a daycare and private school in Hernando County since 2018, is subject of an investigation opened in 2024 into a mass transfer of students (and their state-funded scholarships) from a separate school two hours away, according to administrative law Judge Robert Telfer III.
“It would be difficult for the undersigned to discern a more obvious and brazen fraudulent scheme than the one undertaken by [Little Wings of Prayer operator] Ms. [Crystal] Harris. This violation, in and of itself, is sufficient to revoke the eligibility of Little Wings to receive scholarship funds,” Telfer wrote in his recommendation to strip the school’s scholarship qualification. 
According to the decision, during the 2023-2024 school year, Little Wings submitted invoices to Step Up for Students, an organization administering state vouchers, for students previously enrolled at Touched by an Angel school, 130 miles away in Lake City.
The transfer of about 80 students raised a concern to Step Up, which tipped off investigators.
The Department of Education under then-Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. alleged fraud.
Harris told the judge that about 80 students previously enrolled at the Lake City school enrolled in her school because the Lake City school owner was in bankruptcy and her school was at risk of closing.
Harris testified that during the 2023-2024 school year, her school received state scholarship funds for students that did not physically attend the school and that she did not know it was illegal to do so. Additionally, Harris said she “never took the time out go down there and verify” the Lake City school was in operation.
According to court documents, Harris said she received about 30% of scholarship funds for the Lake City students. After sending those funds to Lake City, she in return received about $70,000 from the Lake City school “that should take care of the taxes for her money, and for audit and all those things.”
The state additionally suggested that Little Wings students were also enrolled in the Columbia County School District, but that evidence was redacted.
The recommendation from the judge leaves the decision about how to proceed up to the Department of Education.
Court documents do not specify the value of the scholarships in question.
The complaint filed by the department includes that Harris has previously pleaded no contest to child abuse charges. The state attempted to use that information to disqualify her from working at a private school. Ultimately, evidence on that front was deemed “inconclusive.”
The Department of Education alleged, too, that Little Wings did not maintain or submit fire safety and health inspections and failed to notify the state of a change in its physical location within 15 days after moving.

Lawmakers working on it
State legislators last week reviewed a state audit that found the school choice scholarship program in Florida exhibited “a myriad of accountability problems.”
The 22-page audit found that in 2024-2025, the Department of Education paid $655 million to middleman scholarship funding organizations, as statutes prescribe, before school started.
“Any improper payments, any ineligible amounts, you’re paying and chasing those amounts, because the dollar’s already gone out the door,” the auditor said.
Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Crestview, said that at any given moment the state does not know where 30,000 students are in terms of school categories — traditional public or voucher-supported private or home schools — together worth $270 million in education support.
Gaetz is sponsor of a lengthy bill that looks to address some of the accounting problems in the voucher program, which became universally accessible in 2023.
Gaetz’s bill would require the Department of Education to investigate written complaints from parents, students, and schools regarding school choice laws and investigate fradulent activity and overpayment, and refer them to the Department of Financial Services for potential criminal investigation.
Private schools that do not properly attest that a child attends could be investigated for fraud and would have to repay the money, according to the bill.
However, the House does not seem to be fully on board with the Senate proposal. The legislative session begins in January.

Due to revenue shortfalls, Idaho is already facing a projected state budget deficit of $58.3 million for the current fiscal year 2026 budget, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The projected state budget deficit could increase by more than 10 times that amount for the next budget year, fiscal year 2027 — depending on how state revenues come in and whether the Idaho Legislature chooses to conform with all of the tax changes from the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law this summer.
In an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun on Monday, Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff confirmed that Idaho may need to come up with somewhere in the range of $600 million to $1 billion for the fiscal year 2027 state budget.
“We try to keep $200 million on the bottom line when we budget, so you can quickly get to a billion dollars in terms of what we need to do to account for revenue projections coming in for FY 27,” Wolff said Monday.
 Challenges the Idaho state budget may face

That total includes a couple of assumptions and layers to get to the $600 million to $1 billion range. Here’s the breakdown Wolff provided using the latest state numbers and projections:

$555.2 million: the projected fiscal year 2027 budget deficit that the nonpartisan Legislative Services Office presented to the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee on Nov. 4. That projected deficit includes the 3% holdbacks Gov. Brad Little implemented this summer and then permanently extended. All state agencies, aside from the K-12 public school system, are subject to the holdbacks. 
$200 million to $284.4 million: the estimated cost of complying with all of the tax changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act championed by Trump. The Idaho Legislature still has to decide whether to comply with Trump’s tax changes, some of which include no tax on workers’ tips, no tax on workers’ overtime pay, no tax on borrower’s car loan interest and an expanded deduction for senior citizens. 
$200 million: the estimated goal state officials have to leave a positive cash balance, or budget cushion, on the bottom line at the end of the fiscal year 2027 budget to guard against additional budget uncertainty. 

State budget officials said they expect to release a new revenue projection when the 2026 legislative session begins in January. 
“We will get updated revenue projections right before we submit the governor’s budget, so that will be included in his State of the State address, and we’ll be publishing those in January,” Wolff said. “So we’ll have a little bit better idea of what we’re expecting, but we’re probably looking at anywhere between probably $600 million and $1 billion that we have to account for, and that’s going to include what’s been submitted in budgets, and that’s going to include revenue and revenue projections.”
For context, the total fiscal year 2026 general fund portion of the state budget passed by the Idaho Legislature during the 2025 legislative session was about $5.6 billion, according to the Sine Die report published by the Idaho Legislative Services Office. 
 Why is Idaho facing a projected budget deficit?

There are many factors and layers that affect systems as complicated as the state budget. 
In simple terms, Idaho is facing projected budget deficits because expenses are forecasted to exceed revenues. Revenue is the amount of money the state takes in. The largest sources of state revenues are taxes — specifically the individual income tax, the corporate income tax and the sales tax.
The projected budget deficits are occurring after the Idaho Legislature and Little have passed a series of income tax cuts over the past five years. The tax cuts reduce the amount of money Idahoans and Idaho businesses pay in taxes. But to pay for the tax cuts, the state has reduced its revenue. 
A new report released this month by the nonpartisan, nonprofit Boise-based Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy indicates that the Idaho Legislature has reduced state revenue by a total of $4 billion over the past five years, the Sun previously reported. The Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy reported that those income tax cuts have benefitted the wealthiest 1% of Idahoans making more than $738,300 annually the most and benefited the lowest-income families the least.
Wolff, the administrator for the Idaho Division of Financial Management, told the Sun on Monday her division’s calculations show the tax cuts accounted for about $900 million in revenue per year and about $3.2 billion cumulatively since 2019. 
During the 2025 legislative session alone, the Idaho Legislature reduced state revenue by more than $450 million to pay for this year’s tax cuts and a new refundable tax credit that reimburses Idaho families for education expenses including tuition at private, religious schools, the Sun previously reported. 
Lobbyist Patrick Sullivan told the Greater Boise Auditorium District’s board on Thursday several times that part of the problem is the revenue projections set by the Idaho Legislature were way too high. 
“The Legislature projected too much, too high,” Sullivan said. 
In an interview Monday, Wolff said Idaho’s economy remains healthy, the state is not in a recession and unemployment remains low. 
 Idaho Legislature’s top budget writer says there will be no budget deficit

Rep. Wendy Horman, the Idaho Falls Republican who co-chairs the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, emphasized that the budget deficit is only a projection at this point and the Idaho Legislature has options. 
In an interview Tuesday, Horman said the Idaho Legislature’s decision on whether and how to comply with the tax changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill is a huge variable in the overall budget picture.
“This year conformity could have a very high price tag,” Horman told the Sun on Tuesday. 
“Normally we just conform with the federal policies. This year will be different because of the Big Beautiful Bill — there is no tax on tips, there is no tax on overtime, but there are also substantial tax cuts for business. In my opinion, it makes no sense to set a revenue number (for the budget) until we know what the conformity policy is going to look like. As you know, JFAC does not set revenue policy – the tax committees set the policies that will determine the amount of eligible revenue to appropriate. So this is a unique year in that conformity could have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of dollars and there will be important policy decisions that need to be made outside of JFAC before we will really know how much revenue will be on the table for appropriation.”
Co-chairwoman Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, conducts the proceedings of the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee meeting on Jan. 7, 2025, at the State Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
Earlier this month Horman vowed that the Idaho Legislature will intervene, and Idaho’s state budget will not end in a deficit.
“We will set a balanced budget,” Horman told the Sun in an interview earlier this month. “The constitution requires it. I am personally committed to it. And I anticipate we will leave as large of a cash balance as we can to carry over into next year to guard against unforeseen circumstances.”
It is possible that state revenues could rebound and come in higher than expected before either the fiscal year 2026 or fiscal year 2027 end. 
Even if revenues do not rebound, the state has other options to avoid a budget shortfall. Because the Republican supermajority in the Idaho Legislature has been committed to cutting taxes, not increasing taxes, the most likely options to address the projected state budget shortfall include additional cuts to state programs and/or dipping into some of the $1.7 billion in state savings accounts and cash reserves Idaho has accumulated. 
JFAC is a powerful legislative committee that sets all of the state budgets for every state agency and department. 
During meetings earlier this month at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, Horman said JFAC is preparing to enter a new era of budgeting where the budget committee will focus less on approving spending requests and more on cutting budgets, the Sun previously reported. 
 Why does Idaho’s project budget deficit matter?

The budget situation is important for several reasons.

The state budget is how Idaho pays for all the programs and services the state provides — from paying for the statewide K-12 public school system, to providing public safety through Idaho State Police, addressing infrastructure needs like aging bridges and water supply issues, to fighting wildfires through the Idaho Department of Lands to funding Medicaid programs to providing pay and benefits for thousands of state employees. 
If there is less money available for the budget or additional budget cuts are needed, there will be less money for programs. 
House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, told the Idaho Capital Sun this month the budget situation keeps her up at night and she is bracing for “catastrophic” budget cuts, on top of the 3% holdbacks that she said are already having a negative impact on Idaho’s most financially vulnerable families, seniors and people facing serious medical conditions. 
Additionally, the Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced budget where expenses do not exceed revenues. 
Sullivan, a legislative lobbyist, told the Greater Boise Auditorium District’s board of directors on Thursday that Idaho could be facing a $1 billion budget deficit for fiscal year 2027. 
“They’re going to have to look really hard at fiscal (year) 2027, because the budget director told me this morning that she believes it’s going to be a billion dollar shortfall – a billion dollars in a $5.9 billion budget,” Sullivan said.
During the briefing, Sullivan told Greater Boise Auditorium District board members that the budget situation and the 2026 election (when all statewide elected officials and all 105 legislators are up for election) will be the dominant issues next year.  
“I guess to put it very concisely, it’s going to be all about the budget,” Sullivan added. “It’s going to be all about cuts, and at the end of the day, they’re going to reach into that rainy day fund and pull it out for this year. But as they start looking into next year, they’re going to have to make some really draconian cuts, I think, to be able to meet the constitutional mandate that they have.”
Sullivan said he is concerned about budget cuts because there are only four members out of 70 from the Idaho House of Representatives who were serving in the Idaho Legislature when the last major state budget cuts were approved in response to the 2008 Great Recession. 
“So we have a brand new Legislature that’s never cut (funding) and I don’t think they understand what that all means – I really don’t,” Sullivan said during Thursday’s meeting. “That’s going to be very difficult for them to kind of transform themselves into budget cutters.”
“Now there’ll be that hard-right group of the Legislature (that will) say, ‘Oh, fine, we cut it down to zero and go home,’” Sullivan continued. “But there’s still government services that need to be performed, and so there’s going to be that rift going on.”
Sullivan is the founder and owner partner of the Boise-based firm Sullivan & Reberger. Sullivan has amassed more than 35 years of experience providing strategic counseling to elected officials and businesses, according to the firm’s website. 
 Idaho’s recent financial history

A recent report from the Idaho Center For Fiscal Policy noted that it has been difficult for the state to bounce back from budget cuts approved in response to budget hardships. The report found that although funding has recovered from the 2008 recession, per-pupil K-12 public school spending levels have still not caught up with levels reached prior to the 2001 recession, once inflation is factored in.
New report shows 5 years of Idaho income tax cuts have reduced state revenue by $4 billion

Any projected budget deficit is a huge change for Idaho. A little over three years ago, Idaho ended fiscal year 2022 with a record budget surplus estimated at $2 billion. 
Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins July 1 and ends June 30. That means fiscal year 2027 does not end until June 30, 2027, and there is still time for revenues to rebound or the Idaho Legislature or Gov. Brad Little to take steps to avoid a budget deficit.
Although fiscal year 2027 does not begin until July 1, 2026, the Idaho Legislature will set the fiscal year 2027 budget during the upcoming 2026 legislative session, which begins Jan. 12 — in less than two months. 
It is also important to note that Idaho is not alone in facing state revenue shortfalls. The Colorado Legislature called a special legislative session in August to address a nearly $800 million hole in the state budget, Colorado Newsline reported.  
In a report published Monday, Pew Charitable Trusts reported the states of Arizona and New Mexico are projecting at least $100 million in general fund reductions across multiple fiscal years due to federal tax changes that reduce revenue for states.
In September, the Maryland Comptroller’s Office estimated the changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would reduce state revenues there by an $189.3 million between fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2027.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Capitol-240123r1-2250-med-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 15:59:55.869505

Jared Polis to promptly and publicly reject a request from President Donald Trump’s administration to transfer Tina Peters to federal custody.
Hayle Johnson, president of the Colorado County Clerks Association and a five-term Republican clerk and recorder in Jackson County, appeared to hold back tears as she described the oath that she and other clerks had taken to uphold the Constitution and state and federal laws, calling on Polis to ensure they “had not done so in vain.”
“If you transfer Tina Peters to federal custody, you are making a statement that elected officials are above the law,” Johnson said during an online press conference with other clerks from around the state. “This is a very dangerous precedent. I urge you, Gov. Polis — stand with Colorado county clerks. Stand with democracy.”

Amid mounting pressure from Trump and other far-right figures in the election conspiracy theory movement, the Federal Bureau of Prisons sent a letter to the Colorado Department of Corrections earlier this month, requesting that the state “initiate the transfer” of Peters, the former Republican Mesa County clerk who is serving a nine-year sentence in a state prison in Pueblo for her role in a breach of her office’s election systems during a 2021 software update. Trump called again for Peters’ release in a social media post Sunday, describing her actions as “attempting to expose voter fraud in the rigged 2020 presidential election.”
Claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent or compromised have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, the courts and Trump’s own campaign and administration officials.
Tuesday’s press conference followed a letter that the clerks association sent to Polis, a Democrat, last week, urging him to reject the BOP’s request and asking him to meet personally with county clerks, the local officials who oversee elections in the state’s 64 counties, before making any decision. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and and Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubinstein, who prosecuted the Peters case, sent a similar letter last week.
Clerks said they had not received a response from the governor to their letter or their request for a meeting. A brief statement from a Polis spokesperson on Friday said only that he and the Department of Corrections were “reviewing the letter” from the Trump administration.
Amid the governor’s silence on the issue, Democratic Boulder County Clerk and Recorder Molly Fitzpatrick told reporters there had been an “immediate uptick in concerns about safety” over the weekend. Weld County Clerk and Recorder Carly Koppes, a Republican, spoke about dealing with threats and harassment from election conspiracy theorists in the years since Peters was first charged, including her decision to hide her pregnancy because of “disgusting remarks” targeting her online.
“I’ve had to have multiple conversations since 2021 with my family, including this weekend, about credible threats. That conversation, Gov. Polis, never gets easier,” Koppes said. “Ms. Peters’ decisions, that she made all on her own, have had a massive impact on me and my fellow clerk and recorders, and the families that love and support us.”
‘Deafening’ silence
Trump does not have the power to pardon Peters, who was convicted on state charges. The Colorado DOC on Monday provided Newsline with a partially redacted copy of the one-page letter sent by the BOP on Nov. 12 to Moses “Andre” Stancil, the DOC’s executive director. The letter requests Peters’ transfer “for the purpose of serving a state-imposed sentence within a federal correctional institution.” The DOC has not responded to Newsline’s request for a written explanation of the redactions in the released record.
“Thank you for your attention and cooperation in this matter,” reads the letter, signed by BOP director William Marshall.
Peters has separately filed a petition for release in the form of a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, a case that has been pending since February. In a series of filings in that case following the BOP request, Peters’ attorneys have stated that she is in “declining health” and alleged that she had been placed in solitary confinement after objecting to a corrections officer’s treatment of her. A social media account that frequently posts updates about Peters’ case claimed on Sunday that she had been “moved out of solitary (confinement)” after an investigation.
Earlier this month, DOC spokesperson Alondra Gonzalez described transfers to federal custody as “typically reserved for complex cases involving significant, long-term safety and security needs.” In a brief statement Monday, Gonzalez reiterated that under the department’s regulations, such a move “is an action initiated by the Colorado Department of Corrections, not an outside entity.”
Fitzpatrick said Polis’ refusal, nearly two weeks after the state’s receipt of the Trump administration’s request, to clearly and publicly rule out such a move is “already causing harm to clerks across Colorado.”
“His silence is deafening, and it’s also offensive,” said Fitzpatrick. “It’s deeply offensive to county clerks, it’s deeply offensive to the Republicans and Democrats who serve as election judges and actually implement these elections, and it’s deeply offensive to voters.”

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-25 20:19:59+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Controversial curriculum swept up in literacy reform debate,Sam Drysdale | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/education/controversial-curriculum-swept-up-in-literacy-reform-debate/,"Science-of-reading advocates describe the activity as a ""back-door effort""","A HOUSE-APPROVED early literacy reform bill has intensified debate over whether some school districts and the creators of a controversial reading curriculum are seeking alternative routes to state approval.
Science-of-reading advocates describe the activity as a “back-door effort,” while supporters of the curriculum reject that and say the program is being scapegoated amid statewide declines in reading scores.
Rep. Ken Gordon, the House’s point person on education policy, said the curriculum would face an uphill battle under early literacy legislation passed unanimously in the House last month. The bill requires all districts to adopt state-approved, phonics-based materials.
At the center of the dispute is Lucy Calkins’s Units of Study, a workshop approach that encourages children to use context and sentence patterns to interpret unfamiliar words. Critics say these strategies conflict with decades of research supporting explicit, systematic phonics instruction — the foundation of the “science of reading” research base. Supporters of Calkins’s approach say it fosters student engagement, respects teacher expertise and has been wrongly blamed for falling scores.
Asked whether Units of Study could qualify as an approved curriculum under the House bill (H 4672), Gordon said the bill defines evidence-based reading as instruction supported by peer-reviewed research. Units of Study, he said, has not been submitted to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education for review, and its use of “three-cueing,” (an instruction method that includes teaching kids to guess unfamiliar words) would not meet the bill’s definition of evidence-based learning. Supporters dispute that the curriculum uses three-cueing.
The House approved the bill in late October and Senate President Karen Spilka has said the Senate expects to take up a literacy bill “in the near future.”  Formal Senate sessions are not scheduled to resume until January.
The statewide debate has been especially intense in Lexington, where parents for years have urged the district to abandon Units of Study, citing declining MCAS performance among vulnerable subgroups and increased reliance on private tutoring. Parents say district leaders have not acted with sufficient urgency. Jennifer Elverum, co-founder of Lex for Literacy, said she learned Lexington used Units of Study after listening to the “Sold a Story” podcast chronicling national criticism of its methods.
“You talk to parents and everybody has tutors. They’re paying a ton of money to make sure their kids can read and do math. It all just felt like something was wrong,” Elverum said. 
She later acknowledged, “We have very wealthy families… we have wealthy parents that step in and pay for tutors.” Still, she said, 73 percent of students are reading at grade level. 
When Lexington Superintendent Julie Hackett publicly opposed restrictive literacy legislation last session, arguing there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to literacy instruction, the parent group launched an opposition campaign. Parents later obtained roughly 60,000 pages of district emails and documents through a public-records request. 
In those exchanges, Hackett discussed a meeting with Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler and then-interim Commissioner Russell Johnston about broadening the state’s definitions of “high-quality instructional materials.”
A December 2024 letter to administration officials — signed by Hackett, Lesley University professor emerita Nancy Carlsson-Paige and others — questioned why DESE was adhering so closely to a narrow list of approved curricula and argued for widening the state’s definition of HQIMs.
“Massachusetts has a healthy independent streak that has served us well in the past, as well as a strong track record of doing things right when it comes to public education. Is there a reason that we can’t expand what we believe is a narrow definition of HWIM to be more inclusive?” the letter says.
Elverum also pointed to emails from 2022 that suggest districts had been “working with Lucy to create that waiver document,” modeled on a process used in Connecticut, if the state ultimately excluded the program from its approved list. 
Calkins’s team disputes the notion of a coordinated “workaround” strategy.
Amy Baker, vice president of operations at the Reading & Writing Project at Mossflower — the professional development organization associated with the curriculum —  said talk of a “back-door” strategy misrepresents educators’ opposition to state-mandated curriculum. 
“When there’s a push for something new, you have to demonize the old,” she said. “But there are educators in Massachusetts – and all over the world – who still use Units of Study because it works best for their students; there’s not a concerted, organized ‘backdoor’ effort like is being implied.”
DESE spokesperson Jackie Reis declined to comment on the meeting with district officials or whether the department would classify Units of Study as evidence-based under the proposed law.
“We don’t comment on bills that are still in progress,” she said.
Calkins herself framed the debate as an attack on educator judgment. 
“Local educators are in the best position to make informed, thoughtful decisions,” she said. 
She argued that on average, districts using Units of Study outperform the 3rd-grade averages on state tests and that many state-endorsed science-of-reading curricula lack strong peer-reviewed evidence, rely on scripted lessons or have been described as “culturally destructive” in recent research.
She also said many state-preferred programs limit student access to real books, instead having all students read the same passages and complete workbook-style questions, sometimes online. Lessons are “scripted down to the word,” she said, making it difficult for teachers to adjust instruction for students who are struggling or excelling.
“Educators, not legislators, should be making decisions about curriculum,” she said.
For many Lexington families, the debate is grounded in lived experience. 
Kyle York, whose daughter has dyslexia, described years of evaluations, denials and legal fees while trying to secure an Individualized Education Plan because his daughter was struggling to learn to read under Lexington’s Units of Study model. The family ultimately hired an advocate and then an attorney, spending more than $10,000 before receiving services.
York said Units of Study’s emphasis on recognizing whole words allowed his daughter to “cover up” her underlying difficulties. 
“[During] her dyslexia assessment… She could read the word ‘believe’ because it’s written all over classroom walls, she knew ‘imagine.’… She knew those words without ever actually understanding how to sound out the word,” he said.
Watching her struggle with reading homework was difficult, he added. “It breaks your heart.”
“I was so disgusted with how the school treated us,” York said. Administrators, he added, insisted “everything is fine, we’re using [Units of Study] and everything is great.” 
Education Reform Now President Mary Tamer, part of the MassReads coalition supporting the legislation, said efforts to broaden definitions or create alternative approval paths undercut the bill’s intent. 
“If this law is not implemented with fidelity, if educators are not willing to do right by children by getting on board and by following the science that goes back 50 years, we are doing an incredible disservice to children,” she said. With only four in ten Massachusetts students reading at grade level — and far fewer in high-poverty districts — she said district-by-district flexibility “is not working.”
Calkins’s team connected the News Service with Dr. Maurice Cunningham, a retired UMass political science professor who wrote “Dark Money and the Politics of School Privatization.” Cunningham said MassReads is a “coalition of billionaires masquerading as a grassroots effort,” citing funding ties from groups such as the Barr Foundation and Walton Family Foundation.
“Letting every district do what they choose is not working,” Tamer said. “This is not about adult preferences. This is about following the science.”
Hackett has defended Lexington’s reading program and argued against government interference. 
“Teachers, not politicians, should decide what works best for their students,” she told Lexington families in a Nov. 6 message about changes to the district’s K–5 literacy pilot. She said she and other educators had “written op-eds, met with legislators, spoken at events, and held meetings with the Commissioner, the Secretary of Education, the Governor, and others” to advocate for flexibility.
But with the House bill advancing and Senate action expected, Hackett said “despite our efforts” the district must “be realistic about what’s ahead.” 
Lexington had planned to pilot three programs this year, including a revised version of Units of Study. She said that portion of the pilot would end immediately because it “won’t appear on the state’s approved list.”
Hackett said Lexington’s educators have “seen results” over more than a decade using the curriculum and highlighted “bright spots,” including new decodable chapter books and a fifth-grade journalism unit that “turned classrooms into newsrooms.”
As the Senate prepares its own literacy bill, questions remain about how DESE will implement new requirements — and whether the department will revisit its definitions of high-quality instructional materials. While the legislation is unfinished, Gordon said its guardrails are clear: curricula must be supported by peer-reviewed evidence and cannot rely on guessing-based strategies.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/books-1204029_1920.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-25 15:59:55.869505

(Getty Images) The latest effort to legalize marijuana in Florida encountered a legal setback but those behind a new amendment insist they still can qualify for the 2026 ballot.
Florida election officials have told local election supervisors to toss out 200,000 petition signatures that they say are invalid. Smart & Safe Florida, the group pushing the initiative, and which has relied on millions from the state’s largest medical marijuana provider, Trulieve, challenged the decision in court. But in a ruling from the bench last week by Leon County Circuit Judge John Cooper sided with the state.
Smart & Safe announced Tuesday that it would not appeal Cooper’s ruling.
“We are confident in the ability to submit enough petitions to make ballot position so long as the state does its job in good faith to process the submitted petitions and accurately report the verification totals,” the organization said in a prepared statement.
To place an initiative on the ballot, the group must gather more than 880,000 signatures from Florida voters. Smart & Safe says it still has more than 1 million signatures even without the ones disqualified by the state.
The deadline to have the petition signatures validated is Feb. 1.
In its statement, the organization urged Secretary of State Cord Byrd to “timely process the petitions and update its reporting of the verified petitions as required by law. The public deserves to have their petitions counted.”

Those backing the legalization effort tried and failed to get a measure passed in the 2024 election. Gov. Ron DeSantis sharply criticized the amendment and his then chief-of-staff James Uthmeier (now Florida attorney general) led the political committee that urged voters to turn it down. The amendment fell short of the 60% threshold needed to pass.
In early 2025, Smart & Safe renewed its push and mailed a copy of a reworked initiative to millions of voters. But instead of providing a complete text of the amendment, it listed a website address on the back of the petition form that had been approved by state officials. That website address took voters to a page on Smart & Safe website that included the entire amendment.
Byrd, however, sent Smart & Safe a “cease and desist” letter in which he questioned the legality of the forms and said they had been altered without permission. State officials also demanded the organization hand over names and addresses of those who received the forms. In early October, the Division of Elections instructed supervisors to invalidate roughly 200,000 signed forms.
Smart & Safe challenged the state’s directive to local election supervisors but after a one-day hearing last week Cooper ruled with the state.
Republican Party of Florida chair Evan Power applauded Cooper’s ruling.
“Gov. DeSantis did the right thing by enforcing the law and protecting the integrity of our ballot,” Power said. “Floridians will not be misled. If you want to change our constitution, you follow the rules — period.”

Reynolds also spoke about the state’s request for a unified allocation of education funding and decision not to privatize health care for the Iowa Department of Corrections. 
Speaking to reporters outside of Terrace Hill in Des Moines following a ceremony pardoning Thanksgiving turkeys, Reynolds said she has heard from older Iowans across the state that are “having a hard time” making ends meet between ballooning property taxes and increases to health care premiums.

Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who is running for governor in 2026, have pitched the idea of a property tax freeze for seniors. 
Reynolds said this is one strategy she is considering. 
“We have to see what the numbers look like,” Reynolds said. “We can’t shift it to the state, that’s not property tax relief … it has to be sustainable. We have to think differently about how we’re delivering services to Iowans and there’s a lot of opportunity out there to do that.” 
Reynolds, approaching her final year as governor, has said reducing property taxes in the state is her focus for the 2026 legislative session. 
“I’ve done a lot of hard things, but there’s a reason that it’s last,” Reynolds said about her planned task. “There’s a reason that it hasn’t been done.” 
Unified allocation
Iowa was the first state in the nation to file a unified allocation plan, which the state said seeks to “align” federal education programs and resources with state and local priorities.
 Reynolds said the plan would help to “eliminate some of the bureaucracy” between federal resources and state education programming. 
The plan aligns with President Donald Trump’s and U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon’s plans to dismantle the federal education department and instead send funding to the states. 
Reynolds said Tuesday she is “really excited” about the unified allocation plan. She said it will help reduce some of the “manpower” required for programs at the state and local levels to apply for and receive federal funding. 
“We really have realigned and strengthened our accountability system, the assessment system, and so we are in a really good place to be one of the first states to be able to do this,” Reynolds said. 
Department of Corrections to continue its own health care system 
In July, the Iowa Department of Corrections issued a request for proposals to contract a private company for health care services at state prisons. The department announced in late November it was not planning to move forward with plans to privatize. 
Reynolds said Tuesday the exploration was part of a process to verify that the current system made the most sense financially. 
“We’re always looking at just making sure that we’re using taxpayer dollars wisely, and that we’re being the most effective and efficient at providing these services,” Reynolds said.
Reynolds said she feels “good” about the decision to stay with the DOC rather than privatize, because the state explored its options. 
“People shouldn’t think that just because we are looking that it means it’s going to stop, or we’re going to eliminate or we’re going to change course,” Reynolds said. “We should constantly be looking at how we can do things better, and never be afraid of being better at what we’re doing, because these are taxpayer dollars that we’re utilizing.”

Mark Kelly and Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin wrote the inquiry will not deter them from publicly stating their concerns about the Trump administration. “Last night, the FBI's Counterterrorism Division appeared to open an inquiry into me in response to a video President Trump did not like,” Slotkin wrote in a statement published on social media. “The President directing the FBI to target us is exactly why we made this video in the first place,” Slotkin added. “He believes in weaponizing the federal government against his perceived enemies and does not believe laws apply to him or his Cabinet. He uses legal harassment as an intimidation tactic to scare people out of speaking up.”  Kelly’s office said it had “received this inquiry via the Sergeant at Arms.”  The House members said the FBI has contacted the House Sergeant at Arms office requesting interviews.“Senator Kelly won’t be silenced by President Trump and Secretary Hegseth’s attempt to intimidate him and keep him from doing his job as a U.S. Senator,” the spokesperson said. Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire separately issued a joint statement alleging that “Trump is using the FBI as a tool to intimidate and harass Members of Congress.”“No amount of intimidation or harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our Constitution,” they wrote. “We swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. We will not be bullied. We will never give up the ship.”President Donald Trump after learning of the video posted on social media that he believed the statement from six Democratic lawmakers represented “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.”The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Illegal ordersThose six lawmakers posted a video on social media on Nov. 18 telling members of the military and intelligence community that they “can” and “must refuse illegal orders.”“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant,” they said. “But whether you’re serving in the CIA, in the Army, or Navy, or the Air Force, your vigilance is critical.”The Defense Department announced Monday that it was looking into “serious allegations of misconduct” against Kelly, a former Navy captain and NASA astronaut, for his participation in the video. The statement said defense officials may recall Kelly “to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.” Kelly wrote in a statement responding to the investigation that he had “given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.”“If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won’t work,” Kelly wrote.Members of Congress’ official actions are generally protected under the speech and debate clause of the Constitution. A report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service states the judiciary’s “immunity principle protects Members from ‘intimidation by the executive’ or a ‘hostile judiciary’ by prohibiting both the executive and judicial powers from being used to improperly influence or harass legislators.”",,,,2025-11-25 15:59:55.869505

(Michelle Liu/Verite) Louisiana lawmakers signed off last week on one-year extensions to the state’s six biggest government contracts, collectively worth more than $17 billion. The agreements are with the six health care companies that manage health insurance for Louisiana Medicaid recipients. 
“These are the largest contracts that the state of Louisiana has in history,” state health secretary Bruce Greenstein told Louisiana’s Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget Thursday. “They are [the largest] every year because they only go up.” 
The managed care organizations receiving the contracts are Aetna Better Health of Louisiana, AmeriHealth Caritas Louisiana, Healthy Blue, Humana Healthy Horizons in Louisiana, Louisiana Healthcare Connections and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. 
Medicaid provides government-backed health insurance for low-income residents, including children, and people who are disabled, blind and pregnant. Louisiana has a little over 1.5 million Medicaid enrollees, including 479,000 people insured through Medicaid expansion, according to health department projections from October. 
Overall, Louisiana’s Medicaid budget is approximately $22 billion in the current fiscal year, including$16.6 billion provided by the federal government. The rest of funding comes from a mixture of fees, dedicated taxes that medical providers pay and state tax revenue collected from other citizens and businesses. 
The new Medicaid contracts take effect in January and are worth approximately $2.2 billion more than the companies received last year.  The average amount the state pays the managed care organizations to insure Medicaid members will go up from $514 to $563 per patient per month. 
Much of that increase can be attributed to Louisiana’s decision to pay more money to hospitals, doctors, nurse practitioners and other health care providers who treat Medicaid patients, according to Greenstein and other members of his staff. 
Louisiana significantly boosted the amount of money Medicaid pays to hospitals and medical professionals in order to expand the network of providers who take Medicaid patients. Several doctors and hospitals were refusing to see people with Medicaid coverage because they considered Medicaid reimbursement rates too low to cover their costs.  
Even though payments to the Medicaid health care organizations are going up significantly, Greenstein said the growth in the Louisiana program’s spending per patient is lower than national health care inflation. 
Legislators expressed frustration last week that the six companies offering Medicaid plans have fallen short of adequate services in the past. For example, they hear complaints from constituents about the plans listing doctors and medical facilities as being available to Medicaid enrollees when they aren’t taking new Medicaid patients. 
There’s also an ongoing frustration with non-emergency medical transportation services, which help get Medicaid enrollees who can’t drive or take public transportation to and from their appointments. Legislators said constituents relying on this transportation, including those with disabilities, miss crucial treatments and doctors’ visits because their rides never pick them up. 

Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, questioned whether there were enough incentives to improve non-emergency medical transportation in the new Medicaid contracts. 
Greenstein responded that the health department was setting up a group to study the transportation issue, and that other states have similar challenges to the ones seen in Louisiana. 

“No one has a system that is superior to ours” when it comes to non-emergency medical transportation, Greenstein said. 
More generally, the state health secretary said Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration intends to raise standards for the private health insurance companies receiving the giant Medicaid contracts. They will no longer be rewarded with “participation trophies” for carrying out their services, Greenstein said. 
“This is a hard reset on our side,” he said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The state health department is withholding 3% of the money paid out on a per patient basis to the Medicaid contract holders until the end of the year when it can be determined whether they provided adequate services. Last year, the agency withheld less, only 2%, until a similar end-of-year review was conducted, according to a fact sheet the health department provided.  
The Landry administration initially showed interest in reducing the number of health insurance companies with Medicaid plans from the current six when the governor took office in 2024. Lawmakers in both parties have questioned whether the state is paying too much for overhead and administrative costs with so many companies involved. 
But Greenstein, a Landry appointee, didn’t seem enthusiastic when lawmakers asked about those efforts last week. The six companies meet different people’s health care needs, and very few Medicaid enrollees change their plan from year to year, he said, indicating they prefer to stay where they are.

Reducing the number of contracts could also prove difficult because of the political pressure that would ensue from national health care companies losing out on the business, although Greenstein didn’t mention that as a reason to avoid doing so. 

Still, a legislative resolution Senate President Pro Tempore Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, sponsored earlier this year requires the state health department to submit a report in January outlining the department’s plans for addressing oversight of Medicaid managed care organizations and how many companies currently have contracts. 
“It’s not a secret that I think we have too many,” Barrow said last weekSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Medicaid-navigators-1-1024x768.webp,,,2025-11-25 14:58:02.668201

Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake), at center in black shirt, helps volunteers fill boxes at the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina in Raleigh on Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2025. (Photo: Greg Childress/NC Newsline) As the holidays approach, food banks are feeling the effects of funding cuts, but striving to keep North Carolinians from going hungry.
The recent federal government shutdown, which lasted 43 days and became the longest shutdown in U.S. history, sent more people than usual to food banks. These included federal workers who weren’t getting paid and people who lost access to food assistance programs like SNAP.
But while food insecurity has become more evident in recent weeks, it isn’t new, according to Jason Kanawati Stephany, vice president of communications and public policy at the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina.
“Our communities were already facing the worst hunger crisis in a generation before the shutdown,” he said.
In March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture cancelled $1 billion in funding for two programs that allowed food banks and schools to buy food from local farms and ranchers.
Along with restricting purchasing power for those groups, the cuts also meant less income for local farmers. In turn, some of them turned to food pantries for help.
The budget cuts continued through the spring. In April, the federal government scaled back on The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), which works to stabilize the agricultural market by buying produce from farmers and distributing it to food banks.
That cut cost food banks in North Carolina over 80 truckloads of food, Kanawati Stephany said.
According to Kanawati Stephany, the combination of cuts meant less food and more need for assistance, even before the shutdown and loss of SNAP benefits drove demand even higher.
“It has really created a perfect storm in the worst possible way,” he said. “Hunger is a policy choice.”
Despite these setbacks, local communities have stepped up.
The Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina saw a record number of donated products in October. There are more than 700 local food assistance sites across the network, and Kanawati Stephany stressed that food is available to all who need it.
“We are depending on that community generosity more than ever because the federal support that we have long drawn on is just no longer there,” Kanawati Stephany said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSCN0397-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-25 14:58:02.668201

Molly Jenkins, R-Coyle, listens to a bill presentation during the House session on May 22, 2025. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A House lawmaker has formally requested that the Oklahoma Attorney General weigh in on the legality of a state board’s decision to meet behind closed doors to discuss legislative salaries and stipends. 
Rep. Molly Jenkins, R-Coyle, sent a letter to Attorney General Gentner Drummond Monday asking him to issue an opinion on whether the Board on Legislative Compensation was legally allowed to hold an executive session during its Nov. 18 meeting to discuss pay raises for elected officials she contends the board doesn’t employ. 
The seven voting members of the board conferred behind closed doors about setting new salaries and stipends for legislative leadership, but voted publicly to approve the changes. During two previous meetings this year the same conversations were held publicly. 
Just ahead of the Nov. 18 meeting, legislative leaders and the governor replaced four members of the board. 
Jenkins said the executive session doesn’t pass the “smell test” and if it was permitted through a “loophole” in state law, it needs to be corrected immediately. 
The board voted Nov. 18 to raise lawmaker salaries by $7,400, up to $54,900. In addition to the 15% raise, the panel doled out increased stipends for over a dozen leaders in the House and Senate. Combined, the increases, which are the first since 2019, total $1.3 million annually. 
The board’s actions rescinded previous votes to keep lawmaker pay stagnant while increasing stipends for some legislative leaders. 
The board chair, David “Chip” Carter, said after the meeting that the executive session allowed members to discuss salary changes more freely.
Shauna Peters, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office, said state law was followed. 
“State law plainly authorizes a public body to convene in executive session to discuss the salary of ‘any individual salaried public officer or employee.’ Further discussion and all votes occurred in open session, in full compliance with the Open Meeting Act,” she said in a statement. “Although some may disagree with the outcome or decision, the law was followed. If a lawmaker wishes to change the current law, or undo the votes of the two bodies, we trust that they will introduce a bill to do so.” 
The Attorney General’s Office was present at the Nov. 18 meeting and represents the compensation board. 
Jenkins said while state law allows executive sessions for boards to discuss salaries of their own employees, lawmakers are not the employees of the legislative compensation board. 
“I was heartbroken to hear that the Legislative Compensation Board entered an executive session, which I do not believe is authorized by Oklahoma law, before voting to award these massive raises,” she said in a statement. “This is not transparency, and this is not the Oklahoma way.”
Jenkins said she is considering options to amend state statute to prevent pay raises from happening in this manner again, including proposing an amendment to “abolish” the board and freeze salaries, pending voter approval for future increases. She said if the raises were legal, she plans to donate her salary increase to an organization in her district. 
She also said she plans to propose legislation to block pay raises for statewide elected officials and freeze their salaries. 
“Public service should never be about the money; it should be about sacrifice,” Jenkins said in a statement. “You can never pay a true public servant enough. But you can absolutely overpay a worthless politician.”
The agenda for the Nov. 18 meeting cited state statute and an attorney general opinion as justification for the executive session. 
The agenda cited a part of state statute that allows for executive sessions “discussing the employment, hiring, appointment, promotion, demotion, disciplining or resignation of any individual salaried public officer or employee.” The attorney general opinion cites similar language. 
The members of the legislative compensation board also make up the Statewide Official Compensation Commission. 
The Commission also met Nov. 18 and reversed course on previous salary decisions, but still raised the salaries of every Oklahoma statewide official between 18% to 40%.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)The Disability Rights Center-NH has launched an investigation into New Hampshire’s disability care system following a series of articles published by the Bulletin earlier this month, the agency said Monday.
The Bulletin’s reporting uncovered systemic abuse and neglect, sometimes fatal, within the state’s intellectual and developmental disability care system. From January 2023 through June 2025, there were 467 credible reports of abuse, neglect, and exploitation against people in this system investigated by the state, according to records obtained by the Bulletin. The records also show 119 people died in the system during this time period. As part of its investigation into the tragedies, the Bulletin spoke with lawyers, advocates, and family members of victims.
In New Hampshire, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are entitled to care that is funded and overseen by the state. The Department of Health and Human Services contracts with 10 private area agencies, each responsible for a region of the state, to coordinate the care. The agencies either provide that care themselves or subcontract with another vendor agency.
The Disability Rights Center-NH, or DRC, is a federally designated protection and advocacy agency. That means it has statutory legal authority to conduct investigations into suspected abuse and neglect against people with disabilities, access records that aren’t normally releasable under open records laws, and pursue litigation on behalf of people with disabilities. In order to launch an investigation into malpractice, the agency needs to establish “probable cause.” (Though the standard for probable cause is lower for an agency like theirs than it is for law enforcement.)
Francesca Broderick, the organization’s senior staff attorney and investigations coordinator, said the Bulletin’s series earlier this month gave the agency probable cause.
“Under federal statute, media reports are actually enumerated as a source that could form the basis of a probable cause finding,” Broderick said. “Media reports are obviously a way that a lot of things come to light.”
Broderick said the DRC is looking at the system broadly. She said her team is pulling documents the Bulletin made public — specifically the state’s mortality report — and using them as launching points for its investigation.
“Our goal for the investigation is to see if there are patterns,” she said. “To see if there’s anything that we can point to in terms of systems failing. Is there a lack of appropriate reporting? Is there lack of an information infrastructure to actually capture this data? Is there concern about who’s reviewing the data?”
Broderick said the center hopes to release a public report at the end of their investigation in early summer with specific recommendations for changes to strengthen the system.
Broderick said the DRC already had concerns about oversight, supervision, and training, but investigators want to learn more specifics. She said the agencies involved have so far been cooperating.
“The purpose isn’t to point the finger or to only assign blame,” she said. “We want it to be constructive, we want there to be the opportunity for changes, because that’s how we can ensure that people with disabilities are not going to face the same circumstances in this system and aren’t going to be subject to abuse or neglect or even death.”
She also said anyone who wants to share their experiences with the system should email mail@drcnh.org or call 603-228-0432.
Broderick said in the DRC’s discussions with lawmakers following the Bulletin’s reporting, there appears to be “an appetite to look at legislation in this area.”
“I’m hopeful that that does happen,” she said.
Lawmakers and officials react
After the Bulletin released its investigation earlier this month, Gov. Kelly Ayotte said she reached out to Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Weaver and Attorney General John Formella.
“These are very serious allegations,” Ayotte, a Republican, said. “They need to be examined, and we need to make sure that the system is serving the people that have disabilities in our communities, and also any of the contractors, the area agencies that contract with the state to serve people with disabilities, make sure that they are performing and that they are treating people well, so I take this very seriously.”
She promised to “continue to make sure that these are investigated, that we follow through with any changes that need to be made to the system.”
Republican state Senate President Sharon Carson and House Speaker Sherman Packard didn’t respond to the Bulletin’s requests for comment. However, their Democratic counterparts in the Legislature lambasted Republicans, who control both chambers and the governorship, for cuts to DHHS.
“The allegations revealed in this reporting are horrifying, and there is simply no justification for abuse or neglect by the State,” House Democratic Leader Alexis Simpson said in a statement. “Former Gov. (Chris) Sununu and Gov. Ayotte owe the public a clear explanation for how this was allowed to persist despite DHHS reportedly receiving hundreds of complaints.”
Simpson pointed to a $51 million budget cut to the DHHS Republicans instituted in this year’s budget, layoffs at that agency, and mostly stagnant Medicaid provider rates. “These decisions only further strain a clearly overburdened system,” she said.
 While she’s not aware of any legislation filed on this issue, Simpson said “it is difficult to imagine that reforms will not be necessary. Lawmakers may need to strengthen oversight of third-party vendors, tighten certification and licensing requirements, and expand auditing practices to ensure this kind of tragedy never happens again.”
State Sen. Cindy Rosenwald called the abuses and deaths “shameful and unacceptable” and said Democrats “fully intend on working to address this matter.”
“There needs to be enhanced oversight for these systems of care, so this never occurs again,” state Sen. Suzanne Prentiss added. “Gaps in mandatory reporting and prevention must be addressed.”
The two said in a statement that Senate Democrats “commit to working to reform and address the system of care provided to our fellow citizens so this may never happen again.” They specifically cited making in-person check-ins on constituents more frequent and improving communication and publicity.
U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, who has a son with cerebral palsy and has frequently cited disability rights as a top issue, said in a statement: “My heart goes out to the victims and families of those who suffered in these horrific instances of abuse and neglect, and I hope that justice is served. While this is primarily a state law enforcement and regulatory issue, I support investigations into such cases and attention being given to the systemic questions they raise about the quality of care for people with disabilities in New Hampshire.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/drcinvestigation-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-25 14:58:02.668201

Javokhir Rahimov-Akobirovich, a native of Uzbekistan who is seeking asylum in the United States, is suing Hardin County Jail Administrator Nick Whitmore and Hardin County Sheriff Dave McDaniel in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.
Also named as defendants are Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd Lyons, St. Paul ICE Field Office Director Peter Berg, and Acting Director for the Executive Office for Immigration Review Sirce Owen.

In his lawsuit, Rahimov-Akobirovich argues he has lived in the United States for the last five years and first came into contact with ICE when deportation proceedings were initiated in October 2020.
Court records indicate that in December 2020, Rahimov-Akobirovich was released from custody under a $5,000 bond that was approved by an immigration judge in San Diego, California. On Nov. 20, 2025, Rahimov-Akobirovich, who lives in Calexico, California, was traveling through Iowa when he was apprehended by ICE agents and placed in the Hardin County Jail.
The lawsuit alleges Rahimov-Akobirovich is the victim of the Trump administration’s new policy suggesting that every individual held for possible deportation is subject to mandatory detention regardless of how long they’ve lived in the United States.
“ICE and the DOJ have adopted this position even with the weight of almost every federal district court against them,” the lawsuit asserts, adding that without relief from U.S. District Court, Rahimov-Akobirovich faces “the prospect of months, or even years, in immigration custody, separated from his family and community.”
The lawsuit, which alleges due-process violations and unlawful denial of release on bond, seeks a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order preventing federal officials from moving Rahimov-Akobirovich out of Hardin County until a decision can be reached in the matter. It alleges ICE is “ignoring” the fact that Rahimov-Akobirovich was free on bond, as approved by an immigration judge, when agents had him jailed in Hardin County.
The Department of Justice and the other defendants in the case have yet to respond to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit is one of hundreds filed throughout the United States challenging the Trump administration’s new interpretation of longstanding immigration laws. Dozens of cases have been filed in Iowa, with many of them naming as defendants the counties in which DHS and ICE are holding people in jail.
For close to 30 years, the DOJ and the courts held that individuals who were living in the United States and were then subject to deportation proceedings were entitled to a hearing on whether they should be released on bond while their deportation case was pending.
In July of this year, the Trump administration, through DHS, ICE and the Department of Justice, announced new “guidance” regarding the detention of applicants for admission to the United States. The guidance, which has since been declared to be DOJ policy, states that all persons who have entered the United States without inspection are deemed subject to mandatory detention without the possibility of a bond hearing.
On Sept. 5, 2025, the Board of Immigration Appeals issued a decision consistent with the administration’s new policy, holding that immigration judges lack the authority to hear bond requests in such cases.
That shift in policy upends the longstanding interpretation of federal law that said individuals already living in the United States while seeking lawful admission — as opposed to individuals apprehended at the border — were entitled to due process and could argue for pretrial release on bond.
Lawyers for people rounded up and jailed under the administration’s new interpretation of the law argue the new policy was crafted in response to Congress’ appropriation of billions of dollars to expand the immigration system, which will soon enable ICE to double its capacity to jail individuals on any given day.
Since July, immigration judges around the nation have embraced the administration’s new interpretation of the law, stating they lack the jurisdiction to determine bond for any person who has entered the United States without inspection, even if that person has resided in the United States for decades.
That, in turn, has led to hundreds of detainees across the country suing DHS, ICE and their local jailers in U.S. District Court, which is entirely separate from Immigration Court. In the overwhelming majority of those cases, federal judges have ruled in favor of the detainees and said those individuals are entitled to bond hearings.
Despite those rulings, immigration judges continue to deny detainees’ requests for bond hearings, leading to additional lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)If you live in the Rio Grande Valley, you have probably heard heard the strange croaks of the sandhill crane or the honk of the Ross’s goose overhead when out for a walk along the river.
That’s because, in the fall and winter, tens of thousands of large migratory geese, cranes, and other water fowl nesting in Alaska, Canada, and the northern United States fly south to roost and forage for food.
“It just gets cold up there,” said Tucker Davidson, who primarily works with Audubon Southwest on expanding riparian restoration projects with the aim of improving water availability for birds. “They need soft soil that they can probe their bills into to find invertebrates that aren’t totally frozen over.”
Davidson said that migratory birds look for a combination of wetlands or flooded fields with nearby sources of food to tide them over until they ultimately head back north to nest in the spring.
As it happens, Albuquerque lies in the middle of one of the four major migratory bird corridors in the United States. Beginning in North Dakota, the so-called central flyway pushes birds from north to south – utilizing portions of the Rio Grande as a sky highway that naturally funnels birds down to New Mexico.

It’s pathways like these that are much more preferable than the seemingly indistinguishable prairies and grasslands in other parts of the country. By using the Rio Grande, birds can use unique visual clues like the mountains and the river’s winding ribbons as a guide. There are also other benefits that attract birds.
“Everything needs water on their way south,” Davidson said. “Some of these trips are really, really long. Especially for large migratory birds, they are cuing in on the wetlands along the river.”
Currently, New Mexico is experiencing its driest 20-year period in the last 1200 years, often referred to as a “megadrought” by scientists.
Drought has consequential effects that directly impact birds by causing bouts of dehydration or hypothermia, and reducing the availability of insects, vegetation, and fruits that birds rely on for nutrients.
And conditions for the future are not looking any better. Climate modeling estimates that New Mexico will have significantly less snowfall and, therefore, runoff to fill the Rio Grande – one of the main travel corridors for these birds.

Snowpack is a crucial piece of the climate puzzle for understanding how much water will be in the state’s rivers and streams. For example, models run by KUNM show a decline of 67% to 80% in the average amount of water in New Mexico’s January snowpack, depending on future emissions scenarios.
In addition, state of New Mexico reports estimate that flows into the Rio Grande above Elephant Butte Reservoir will decrease by up to 25% in the next 50 years as annual average temperatures increase from anywhere between 3 to 7 degrees. Other models estimate that the climate could warm even more.
While it is true that the state has made significant strides to reduce its water use since historic peaks in municipal/agricultural use in the 1980s and 90s, a disproportionate amount of the state’s water is used for agriculture.
A recent report estimates that New Mexico uses an eye-popping 80% of its fresh water for agricultural uses – including for dairies, alfalfa, pecans, and chile farming. Within those irrigated acres, most are irrigated with sprinkler systems or flooding.
The widespread technique of flooding fields for crops is a big reason why birds continue to visit New Mexico, even during times of extreme drought.
“Attracting the cranes and geese really is a manufactured thing at this point,” Davidson said. “We have to flood up fields, and if we don’t provide corn or supplemental food, then they would probably start to find other places to overwinter.”
But in an increasingly arid Southwest, water policy experts are wary of using scarce water resources to flood fields in the face of a drier future.

(File/Getty Images)Resources are available for anyone in crisis or concerned about someone else: Call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.
Few South Carolinians may know the name of Dr. Nolan Williams, who died last month, but to many people suffering with depression, Williams was something of a miracle worker.
Williams, born and educated in South Carolina, died from the devastating illness he had helped alleviate in perhaps hundreds of others.
Only 43 years old, Williams took his own life at his northern California home Oct. 8.
Those close to him said he had long struggled with depression.
Two of his former professors and colleagues at the Medical University of South Carolina called Williams “bold and visionary,” a “brilliant neuropsychiatrist” whose groundbreaking experiments “impacted multiple fields.”
The neuropsychiatrist “changed the landscape of mental health treatment” by developing a noninvasive brain-stimulation technique for people with treatment-resistant depression, friend Thomas Reiner wrote in a fundraising page he created for the family.
Williams’ story began modestly in the small town of Bamberg (population about 2,900 today) on June 25, 1982.
His father, a baseball fan, named him Nolan Ryan Williams after Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan.
Williams’ father was a fisherman and carpenter; his mother ran a day care and later worked as a caterer.
His family later moved to Charleston, where Williams grew up.
His passion for excellence emerged early: Williams attained a black belt in Taekwondo at 18, becoming a world-class champion in high school. He also developed a lifelong love of kitesurfing.
“He kitesurfed all over the globe and never missed a chance to spend a day kiting before or after scientific meetings,” said Dr. Mark S. George and Dr. Harold A. Sackeim in a recent tribute to Williams, detailing his important research accomplishments.
Williams earned his bachelor’s degree in molecular biology from the College of Charleston in 2003. It was later while earning his medical degree at the Medical University of South Carolina that Williams became fascinated with the practice of stimulating the brain to relieve severe depression that is resistant to therapy and drugs.
Hired in 2014 by the Stanford University School of Medicine, Williams founded the school’s Brain Stimulation Lab, focusing on treating psychiatric illnesses such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
It was there that Williams developed a fast-acting high-tech therapy called SAINT (Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy) that targets the area of the brain where depression originates.
In a clinical study of SAINT, 80% of patients suffering from depression experienced remission. Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2022, SAINT is now being used in several clinics across the country.
Kyle Williams wrote that his brother “Nolan was far more than a brilliant doctor — he was a loving husband, devoted father, cherished son, and the pillar of our family. His bond with his mother, Ann, was unbreakable, and his kindness, laughter, and heart touched everyone he met.”
A light in darkness
Williams also led studies of veterans in special operations forces struggling with PTSD and traumatic brain injury, with symptoms including anger, depression, anxiety and insomnia. He collaborated with a nonprofit organization, Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions (VETS), to investigate the effectiveness of the drug ibogaine, which some veterans had used in Mexico because it’s not legal in the U.S.
VETS honored Williams in a statement: “His research demonstrated what these veterans courageously believed: That healing was possible, that their suffering mattered, and that science could meet them in their darkest hour.”
In addition to his brother and mother, Williams is survived by his wife, Dr. Kristin Raj, and their two children, Autumn and Hendrix.
He leaves behind a legacy of caring for some of society’s most vulnerable citizens.
Reiner, the family friend, said Williams “had a deep compassion for patients” and “gave everything he had to help others heal.”
The loss of a brilliant native son of South Carolina is especially poignant at a time when suicide is on the rise in our state. The suicide rate in South Carolina, higher than the national average, increased by 44% over the past 20 years.
That hits close to home.
My own community of Anderson County in 2025 is experiencing the highest number of suicide deaths in its recorded history.
Suicide prevention and other mental health concerns should be top state priorities.
South Carolina’s gubernatorial candidates, already fiercely campaigning for next year’s election, have had little or nothing to say about suicide prevention and mental health as they clamor for slashing taxes while ignoring vulnerable South Carolinians who’ll be impacted by federal cuts to Medicaid, mental health and addiction treatment.
And yet there’s always hope.
Here in Anderson County, for instance, some public-spirited residents recently announced a campaign to establish the AOP (Anderson, Oconee, and Pickens) Clubhouse, offering comprehensive help for people living with mental illness.
There’s always a light shining in darkness, thanks to supportive communities and the legacy of brilliant doctors like Nolan Williams.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mental-health.jpg,,,2025-11-25 14:58:02.668201

Murphy grants clemency to 55, promises more before term ends",Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/briefs/governor-murphy-pardons/,The governor has reduced sentences or wipe records clean for 283 New Jerseyans under a program he launched last summer.,"Gov. Phil Murphy has reduced sentences or wipe records clean for 283 New Jerseyans under a program he launched last summer. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy issued 55 pardons and commutations Tuesday in his latest round of post-conviction relief and said more would come before he leaves office in January.
Most of the clemencies granted Monday went to people with non-violent drug convictions. The charges others faced varied widely and included 13 serving sentences for murder.
“Each one of them has owned up to their actions. They have made amends, and they are ready to reenter society and start giving back to the great Garden State,” Murphy said during a ceremony at the Santa Isabel Lutheran Church in Elizabeth. “To all of the families who will soon be reunited as a result of these commutations, let me say: Your days of separation and longing are finally coming to an end.”
Attorney asks court to weigh wrongful conviction claim in Newark slaying

The latest pardons and commutations, made in line with recommendations from an advisory board convened in June 2024, bring total clemencies under Murphy to 283. That’s more than double the 105 clemencies issued total by every governor since Christine Todd Whitman took office in 1994.
The advisory board recommends clemency for certain classes of offenders, chiefly those convicted of non-violent crimes who have remained offense-free for at least a decade, though those serving excessive sentences or who were victims of domestic abuse, sexual violence, or sex trafficking are also eligible.
The governor’s actions Tuesday included 36 pardons, which are granted to individuals who have completed their sentences, and 19 commutations, which reduce sentences for those who are currently incarcerated or on parole.
The clemencies would help reunite families ahead of Thanksgiving, Murphy said, though it’s not clear whether the 17 imprisoned people granted commutations Tuesday will be released by Thursday.
“For families with loved ones living behind bars, the holiday season can be painful. It’s a time of the year that puts an even brighter spotlight on that empty seat at the dinner table and the heartbreak of distance and lost time can weigh heavily on the heart,” Murphy said. “Let me say unequivocally that also goes for the families of victims.
The governor said the commutations would reunite families “in the coming weeks.”
Murphy’s grants of clemency to individuals convicted of serious violent crimes — including murder, robbery, and arson — have incensed some Republican lawmakers. State Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris), the Senate’s minority leader, called the wave of clemencies Murphy issued earlier this month an insult to law-abiding New Jerseyans.
“These aren’t petty offenses. These are the worst of the worst, and now, thanks to Governor Murphy, these people will be walking free under the false banner of ‘reform,’” Bucco said in early November.

(Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — Saying the issue is now moot, Oklahoma’s highest court dismissed a lawsuit challenging a requirement that public schools keep Bibles in classrooms and teach from them.
In a 6-2 decision, the Oklahoma Supreme Court wrote Monday that newly appointed state Superintendent Lindel Fields and the six new members of the Oklahoma State Board of Education said they planned to nullify a 2024 mandate requiring Bible usage in schools. The new education leaders also told the justices that they were not pursuing other mandates issued by former state Superintendent Ryan Walters that would use taxpayer money to purchase classroom Bibles or “biblically-based character education materials.”
Over 30 Oklahomans of various faiths or no religious affiliation had sued State Department of Education leaders in October 2024, arguing that the Bible mandates issued by Walters in June and July 2024 violated the state Constitution’s prohibition on state-established religion. They asked the court to block the use of taxpayer dollars to purchase Bibles and declare the overall mandate unenforceable.
They argued the Education Department did not follow state requirements when implementing the Bible teaching requirements, and that state academic standards hadn’t been changed to justify Walters’ order. Many of those plaintiffs had children in public schools and said required school-based biblical instruction could interfere with their ability to teach their own religious or moral beliefs at home.
Walters resigned in September to become CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance. Gov. Kevin Stitt tapped Fields in October to finish the remaining 15 months of Walters’ term. He will lead the state agency and State Board of Education until January 2027. Oklahomans will elect the next state superintendent during statewide general elections in November 2026.
Attorneys with American Civil Liberties Union, the Oklahoma Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, the Freedom from Religion Foundation and Americans United for Separation of Church and State represented the Oklahoma residents.
In a joint statement, the attorneys said they were pleased that Fields had “abandoned former Superintendent Walters’ attempts to incorporate the Bible into the public-school curriculum and classrooms, and to buy Bibles and biblical-instructional materials with state tax dollars.
They also said in a statement that they were pleased that Fields had rescinded and nullified Walters’ biblical policies.
“Fields’ actions and the Supreme Court’s order mean that Oklahoma families and students – not politicians – will get to decide if, when and how to engage with the Bible,” the attorneys said.
The State Department of Education didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

(Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator via SouthWings)A refinery near Gramercy faces new allegations from state regulators after water samples taken from the facility’s Mississippi River outfall proved deadly to aquatic animals during a routine lab test.  
On Oct. 24, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality issued a new “Notice of Potential Penalty” compliance order to the Atlantic Alumina Co. facility that refines bauxite mineral into a feedstock chemical used to make aluminum. The facility is the only one of its kind in the United States. 
The notice serves to warn the company of potential penalties for alleged violations state inspectors documented during a recent file review and field visits conducted Aug. 8 and Oct. 17 following a citizen’s complaint. The document, which the Department of Environmental Quality published earlier this month, notes the Atalco refinery failed an effluent toxicity test of the discharges sampled from its Mississippi River drainage outlet. Performed every three months as a matter of routine, the toxicity test involves exposing minnows and crustaceans to various concentrations of the sampled effluent over a 48-hour period. 
According to the test conducted Sept. 4, Atalco’s sampled discharges were significantly more toxic than what the state allows in the Mississippi River. Even at the lowest concentration tested, the sampled effluent began killing significant numbers of crustaceans. When tested at the 1.5% standard concentration at which the animals should still be able to survive, the effluent killed 64% of the Daphnia pulex crustaceans, better known as water fleas.
Atalco did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

Ahmed Harhara is a chemical engineer who runs a neighborhood-level environmental data website in the Houston area and is familiar with the toxicity tests used in refinery operations. He reviewed the Atalco lab results and said they are a strong signal of a serious problem at the facility. 
“These tests are basically an early warning system,” Harhara said. “If fish or small aquatic animals don’t survive in the sample water, it means the effluent is too toxic — even after it’s been treated — and could harm life in nearby streams if released.” 
Harhara pointed out that the method for toxicity testing is tailored to the specific water stream  receiving the discharges. The test conducted for Atalco uses a dilution or concentration factor that takes into account the Mississippi River’s current and massive volume of water, meaning it would take high levels of toxicity to fail the test.
Nicholas Fisher, an environmental scientist who studies aquatic pollution at Stony Brook University and also reviewed the lab results, said effluent toxicity tests often understate the danger of the pollution.
“I would say they’re overlooking a lot of the toxicity,” Fisher said. “The stuff that’s in the effluent is probably far more toxic than they realize.”
LDEQ puts Atalco refinery on notice for ‘red mud’ leaks. Fines to be determined.

When tested on minnows, the sampled effluent had no significant effect, but both Harhara and Fisher said that’s not surprising as the crustaceans are generally far more sensitive to many industrial contaminants. Also, fish are more mobile than small crustaceans and can swim away from areas of poor water quality, Harhara said. 
It’s unclear how often facilities such as Atalco fail effluent toxicity tests. LDEQ spokeswoman Meagan Molter said only it happens occasionally, but had no relevant data available. The agency doesn’t track the test results in a global way, she added. 
Harhara said toxicity test failures are infrequent at facilities with properly working treatment systems. 
“In my view, it is newsworthy precisely because these failures are rare and measurable. They show where the treatment system may have slipped, even briefly,” he said. “It’s the kind of data point regulators and the public should pay attention to.”
On Oct. 21, just days before the Department of Environmental Quality issued the notice of potential penalty, aerial photos of the Atalco site showed plumes of discoloration in the river coming from the facility’s drainage pipe. 
Aside from the toxicity test results, LDEQ’s notice cited large volumes of discharges with high pH levels that Atalco drained into the river at over 20 times the rate allowed under its permit. 
When state inspectors visited the area on Aug. 8 and Oct. 17, they discovered public stormwater ditches and waterways filled with reddish-orange water. This included the Hope Canal, which flows to the Maurepas Swamp, according to the notice.  
An Atalco representative told the inspectors the facility’s runoff containment system failed after it was inundated with sediment, and the runoff became contaminated with Atalco’s “red mud” waste, the notice states. 
“The inspection revealed that the Respondent failed to maintain waters of the state in an aesthetically attractive condition and meet the generally accepted aesthetic qualifications,” the LDEQ notice said.
Atalco received a similar notice from the Department of Environmental Quality in August for separate violations stemming from erosion channels in the giant levees of Atalco’s red mud waste lakes. The fissures allowed waste slurry to escape from the facility and contaminate state waters. 
Records the Illuminator reviewed indicate the facility’s waste byproduct contains toxic heavy metals and other hazardous chemicals. 
The latest infractions continue a pattern spanning more than a year during which the company has struggled to contain toxic releases from its facility despite heightened public scrutiny over previous violations of environmental laws and workplace safety regulations.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy is now considering who may fill two legislative seats vacated by state senators seeking higher office.
Sen. Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, resigned Nov. 3 to run for lieutenant governor, and Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, resigned Nov. 14 to run for governor. 
On Sunday, Republicans in Hughes’ district proposed three local residents to fill her seat: Rep. Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, Matanuska-Susitna school board member Tom Bergey, and Gerrie Deal of Palmer.
Under state law, Dunleavy does not have to pick any of the three, but Republican Party rules state that local party officials will propose nominees to the governor in the event of a vacancy.
Dunleavy has until Dec. 14 — 30 days after Hughes’ resignation — to fill the seat.
The deadline to fill Shower’s vacant seat is coming up sooner: Republicans in his district have nominated Reps. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, and George Rauscher, R-Sutton, for the vacancy, as well as Ryan Sheldon, a former aide to Rep. Julie Coulombe, R-Anchorage.
Any person picked for the Senate must be confirmed with a majority vote by the Senate’s Republican members, which includes four remaining members of the all-Republican Senate minority as well as the five Republicans who are in the Senate’s majority caucus. 
If Dunleavy picks a current member of the state House for either seat, he will create a vacancy that he must fill within 30 days. 
That person — or those people — will almost certainly join the House’s 19-person all-Republican minority caucus, whose leadership is in flux.
On Saturday, House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, said she would resign immediately as minority leader.
The resignation came after two members of the minority met with her and said there were enough votes to remove her as leader. That meeting was first described by Jeff Landfield of the Alaska Landmine. 
Her resignation, which had not been requested, leaves the minority’s position uncertain ahead of the legislative session. The minority leader is traditionally in charge of opposition messaging and is the main negotiator between the House majority and minority caucuses.
This past year, members of the House minority repeatedly diverged on key topics, including a vote on whether or not to override Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s education funding vetoes.

The private university, located in Indianola, announced in a news release Tuesday its board of trustees unanimously selected Stuebner to officially take on the role after the completion of a performance review by higher education search firm Academic Search.
Stuebner joined Simpson as its interim president in late July after the death of president Jay Byers in April. When she was first introduced to campus, college board Chair Terry Handley said Stuebner and the board would decide together if she wanted to stay, in consultation with the Simpson community and subject to a review of her work during the fall semester.

He said in the release it was an “easy” decision to make in the end, looking at her past successes as a university president and hearing positive things about her from community members.
“Faculty, staff and student leaders were enthusiastic in their praise for President Stuebner and the many leadership strengths she brings to Simpson College,” Handley said in the release. “Sue’s authenticity and transparency in engaging with the campus community have already gone a long way in building early trust and confidence. The board is eager to partner with her in designing and realizing a promising future for Simpson.”
Before coming to Simpson, Stuebner served as president of Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire for eight years, spending her last year before coming to Simpson as an adviser for the institution’s interim president.
In her first speech to the Simpson College community, Stuebner said Colby-Sawyer and Simpson were facing similar challenges, and she planned to bring the same model to Indianola of finding new revenue streams and building partnerships from popular programs.
Stuebner said in the release she is both “honored and humbled” by the board’s decision to keep her leading Simpson.
“From the moment I arrived on campus, I have resonated with the values and approach of this incredible learning community. Seeing our exceptional faculty and staff in action as they create a transformational educational experience for our students is truly inspiring,” Stuebner said in the release. “Simpson students and alumni exhibit so much passion about their time on campus and are making a difference in their professions and communities.
“I look forward to partnering with the Simpson community in pursuing new avenues of innovative excellence to further distinguish Simpson as a national leader in liberal arts education.”

She’s one of two congressional representatives in the state vying for statewide office: John James, who represents Michigan’s 10th District, is leaving the lower chamber to run for governor. James’ decision to leave his seat behind has been controversial, as some thought it could lead to a Democrat flip, but Stevens’ seat is considered a solid Democratic stronghold, meaning the primary will be a key race to watch in 2026.
The other, the 13th District, still has its incumbent in the race, but he does face a unique challenge in his district. U.S. Rep.

His main primary competitor, State Rep. Donavan McKinney, has been endorsed by the more progressive wing of Michigan’s Democratic Party, including neighboring U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib. McKinney has also criticized Thanedar, a multi-millionaire business owner, for being out of touch with his constituents in one of the lowest-income districts nationwide.

The turkeys, both toms this year, came from the farm of Josh and Kelli Berg, first-generation farmers near Early who raise close to a million turkeys each year. 
Josh Berg is also president of the Iowa Turkey Federation, which Reynolds highlighted in her proclamation pardoning the turkeys. 
“In Iowa, we’re proud to be one of the nation’s top turkey-producing states,” Reynolds said.

She noted the state has over 130 turkey farms in the state. According to the federation, Iowa raises about 12 million turkeys annually. 
“These are mostly family farms continuing multigenerational operations, hard-working farm families who care deeply about animal health, quality of the product, and really, most importantly, keeping this proud tradition strong and rural Iowa vibrant,” Reynolds said speaking over the gobbles of the roaming turkeys.

According to the federation, the turkey industry in Iowa supports 38,000 jobs in Iowa annually and is responsible for $10.64 billion in total economic activity. 
Turkey pardoning began in the late 1940s with President Harry Truman and has continued in Iowa since the 1970s. Last year, Reynolds pardoned turkeys “Caitlin” and “Clark,” presumably named after Iowa’s famed basketball player.
President Donald Trump pardoned turkeys “Waddle” and “Gobble” Tuesday morning in front of the White House.
Reynolds said the Thanksgiving holiday is a “great time to pause and to thank our farmers for the impact that they have” in the state and beyond. 
Reynolds said she plans to host her extensive family for Thanksgiving at Terrace Hill this year and expects a crowd of about 25 people. 
“It’s about bringing family together, and it’s about just spending time together and creating memories,” Reynolds said.  “We have some incredible memories that we’ve created here at Terrace Hill.” 
This is the second to last Thanksgiving the governor will spend at Terrace Hill, as she does not plan to run for reelection.

(Photo by Marco Lozzi for Utah News Dispatch)Calling Utah’s new court-ordered congressional map that creates a Democratic-leaning district the “most gerrymandered map in the history of the state of Utah,” Utah’s Republican legislators are digging in their fight against the judge’s ruling. 
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, and Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, held a news conference at the Utah Capitol on Tuesday — with dozens of GOP legislators from both the House and Senate at their backs — to announce they plan to appeal 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s decision to the Utah Supreme Court. 
Additionally, the legislative leaders announced they are gearing up for a special session expected to be held Dec. 9 to consider their legislative options to ensure the state’s election system has “clarity” ahead of the 2026 election. 
The agenda for that special session is still being decided, legislative leaders said. But lawmakers may consider putting a constitutional amendment on the 2026 ballot to ask voters whether to “clarify” when lawmakers can make changes to laws enacted by ballot initiatives. 
Lawmakers may also weigh delaying candidate filing deadlines in order to allow more time for a different congressional map to be enacted for the 2026 election — but the special session’s agenda hasn’t yet been finalized, according to Gov. Spencer Cox, who will be issuing the call. 
“It’s deeply concerning that an unelected judge overrode the Utah Constitution … and silenced Utahns by imposing a map without public input,” Adams said, arguing that the map she picked, drawn by the plaintiffs in a redistricting lawsuit against the state, didn’t follow a public process. 
Democrats in the Utah House and Senate issued a joint statement after Tuesday’s press conference condemning the call for a special session next month, saying “we continue to believe that Judge Gibson’s ruling should be respected.”
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

“The Legislature’s map failed to comply with Proposition 4, and the court selected the map that did meet the law’s requirements,” House and Senate Democrats said. “It is fiscally irresponsible to use tax payer dollars to fight this legal battle, which undermines the will of Utah voters. Utahns deserve to know their voices matter and their representatives do not choose their voters.” 
Utah’s Republican lawmakers continue to argue that Gibson violated the Utah Constitution when she picked a map that wasn’t adopted by the Utah Legislature, which GOP lawmakers continue to argue — despite multiple court rulings against them in the state’s yearslong redistricting court battle — has the sole authority to redistrict. 
Plaintiffs in the state’s redistricting lawsuit have pointed to court proceedings in other states and  argued the courts have a duty to intervene and select “remedial” maps when they determine lawmakers have failed to follow the law. But Republican lawmakers contend the judge should have gone another route, like asking the Legislature to vote on an alternative, rather than picking a map and sidelining the Legislature. 
Now, Adams and Schultz said county clerks and candidates are facing “chaos” and confusion over the new map’s boundaries. 
“Utahns deserve a process that’s stable, transparent and accountable. One in which decisions are made with respect to the constitutional roles of each branch of government,” Adams said. “Unfortunately, the courts have created confusion for our communities, candidates and for Utahns across the state.”

The lawsuit’s plaintiffs and Utah Democrats have celebrated the map selected by Gibson as one that most closely follows Proposition 4’s neutral map-drawing criteria and reflects Utah’s “political geography” with a district that best represents Utah’s urban core in Salt Lake County. But the map’s critics argue it created four uncompetitive districts that lead to skewed partisan results in a state that’s dominated by a statewide majority of Republican voters.
“By design or by default, Judge Gibson has authorized the most partisan and thus the most gerrymandered map in the history of the state,” Adams said. “I assume she didn’t intend or set out to gerrymander herself. But anyone who looks at the donut hole map sees very clearly it’s gerrymandered. Yes, Judge Gibson gave us a gerrymandered map.” 
“That’s why,” Adams continued, “we’re appealing to the Utah Supreme Court and preparing the appeal right now.” 
As of Tuesday morning, Gibson hadn’t yet issued her final legal analysis and ruling on a request from the Legislature’s attorneys to push pause on the map she selected earlier this month. Adams said attorneys are waiting for that final ruling to be issued before submitting their appeal to the Utah Supreme Court. 
Judge orders tweak to clean up Utah’s congressional map while lawmakers argue for stay

“We urge the district court to issue its final ruling quickly so we can use all the options and tools available to us as we appeal that decision to the Supreme Court,” Adams said. 
Thursday’s press conference was the latest show of force from Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature as conservative lawmakers continue to protest the court-ordered redistricting process meant to “remedy” the state’s 2021 congressional map, which Gibson in an August ruling determined was the result of an unconstitutional process.
That year, the Utah Legislature adopted a map with four safe Republican congressional districts after it undid a 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative known as Proposition 4, which was meant to implement an independent redistricting process. That prompted pro-democracy groups including the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government to sue, alleging the map was a “blatant gerrymander” and that lawmakers violated Utahns’ right to alter and reform their form of government through a ballot initiative. 
Gibson initially dismissed that lawsuit, but in a ruling last summer, the Utah Supreme Court sent the case back to her courtroom, determining in a unanimous opinion that she “erred.” That opinion made clear that the Utah Legislature’s power to change “government reform” ballot initiatives has limits.

Researchers first discovered the bones in September 2024 while searching for crocodile fossils in Bowman County, according to State Paleontologist Clint Boyd. Tuesday was the first time the find was publicly announced.
Since work at the site was about to close for the year, they couldn’t start excavating it until this year. 
They’ve since unearthed nine or 10 bones, Boyd said, including vertebrae, part of the tail, a tooth and an ankle. Boyd said to his knowledge this is the third partial T. rex skeleton found in North Dakota.

“Any T. rex specimen that you find that’s got more than five or six bones is a significant discovery because the animal’s so rare,” Boyd said Tuesday morning at a North Dakota Industrial Commission meeting.
The agency on Tuesday also shared updates about two mammoths it’s excavating: one underneath a residential garage in northwest North Dakota and another discovered at a coal mine near Beulah.
Boyd said the specimen under the garage has deep grooves in its vertebrae — an indicator of severe malnutrition or bone disease.
“It was probably very sick toward the end of its life,” he said.

According to Boyd, those deformities are not common in mammoth fossils. To date, researchers have only documented it in mammoths found in Asia and Europe, he said. 
“So it’s going to be not just a nice, beautiful specimen eventually coming into the state fossil collection, but actually a significant specimen that’s going to teach us more about these animals,” he said.
Boyd said the agency has also found the bones of small mammals there.
“We may end up getting a whole ecology story out of this one site,” he said.
The other mammoth fossil was discovered Memorial Day weekend of 2023 when coal miners unearthed a 7-foot tusk.
The tusk just finished a nearly yearlong cleaning and preservation process, Boyd said.
In addition to the tusk, the agency has identified other bones including a hip, one shoulder blade and some ribs.
Based on the tusk’s shape, the animal is likely a Columbian mammoth, not a woolly mammoth, he said.
Boyd indicated the fossils will eventually be on display for the public.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Fairfax County Public Schools is one of just three districts nationwide facing a federal investigation by the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce, which alleges Jewish students are being harassed and subjected to open antisemitism.
The scrutiny follows the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people and resulted in more than 250 hostages, and Israel’s subsequent war campaign in Gaza that has left over 60,000 Palestinians dead. Tensions over the conflict have spilled into U.S. schools.
Republican U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, who chairs the committee, wrote a letter to the school district saying the panel  is “deeply concerned that FCPS is failing to uphold its obligations under Title VI.”
Youngkin signs executive order to combat antisemitism in Va. schools

Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, school districts that receive federal funds must maintain a safe learning environment and promptly address discrimination, including harassment that creates a hostile environment.
Fairfax County Public Schools said it received a letter from the committee chair requesting information on potential antisemitic incidents since 2022 and intends to cooperate. Separate letters also went to Berkeley Unified School District in California and the School District of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. 
“FCPS intends to fully cooperate with Congressman Walberg’s inquiry,” the district said in a statement. “FCPS continues to partner with all families to provide a safe, supportive, and inclusive school environment for all students and staff members.”
According to the committee’s letter, investigators claim they have evidence of a hostile environment both before and after the Gaza war began on Oct. 7, 2023, alleging that Jewish students were bullied by peers making the “Heil Hitler” salute and throwing coins at them.
The committee also says  an unnamed school refused to remove a hallway display featuring swastikas and Nazi flags. A school board member is accused of repeatedly posting antisemitic messages online, including statements such as “Israel doesn’t exist.” 
In another instance, the Muslim Students Association chapter at an unidentified high school allegedly hosted a speaker who made “grotesque antisemitic statements,” including, “I have never met a Jew who didn’t have a huge nose.”
As evidence that incidents are worsening, the committee claims one high school approved an anti-Israel walkout, and an MSA chapter reenacted the Oct. 7 kidnappings in a promotional video.
In May, Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order directing Virginia leaders to develop tools to track incidents of antisemitism and anti-religious bigotry at schools. Surveys conducted by the Combat Antisemitism Movement, a commission established by the governor in 2022, recently identified 554 incidents in Virginia — most occurring in K-12 schools.
The committee has asked FCPS to respond by Dec. 8 with specific documents to assess the district’s compliance with Title VI and to determine whether new legislation addressing anti-semitic discrimination is needed.
Requested records include an anonymized chart of antisemitism complaints since Oct. 7, 2023, and corresponding FCPS actions; all FCPS communications since Oct. 7 related to Jews, Judaism, Israel, Palestine or Zionism; and all contracts or agreements since Jan. 1, 2022 that reference those subjects.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-25 18:26:43+00:00,CT Mirror,"Kinneytown Dam, a major impediment to fish, could soon be removed",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/25/kinneytown-dam-ct/,"The sale to Connecticut Brownfield Land Bank is the latest progress in the removal, which officials say would provide 'significant' benefits.","For well over a century, fish making spawning runs up the Naugatuck River have had their journey cut short just 16 miles inland at the Kinneytown Dam in Ansonia.
Above the dam, the river flows relatively unencumbered from Thomaston 30 miles to the north, where it draws from dozens of tributaries that serve as vital habitats for spawning shad, lampreys, eels and Atlantic salmon.
Efforts to ease their path from Long Island Sound — including the installation of a fish ladder alongside the dam in the 1990s — have largely failed, officials say, and Kinneytown Dam remains a major migratory roadblock on the Naugatuck’s watershed.
“Without the removal of this dam, it can never be a river,” said Kevin Zak, a local advocate who has led efforts for years to restore the Naugatuck River, which he says behaves more like a “landlocked lake.” 
“It looks like a river, and you would think that it acts like a river, but it doesn’t,” Zak  said. “You can’t put a price tag on a free-flowing river, the economic and quality of life benefits are just astounding. You don’t have to build it, it’s already there.” 
Earlier this month, the Connecticut Brownfield Land Bank announced that it had closed a deal to purchase the dam and surrounding property from a private company in Washington state for $1, a critical step forward in what officials expect will be a $60 million effort to remove the dam and restore the river to its natural course.
The project is the largest active dam removal effort currently underway in Connecticut, which has one of the largest concentrations of dams in the United States.
Many of the dams being removed date back to Connecticut’s industrial past, when rivers powered mills across the state.
“We have more than 4,000 dams in the state, and they’re being removed on a regular basis because they’re no longer functional,” said Alicea Charamut, executive director of the Rivers Alliance of Connecticut. “They’re deteriorating, and it’s important that they are removed before they cause too much damage.”
James Fowler, a spokesman for the state’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said that removing the Kinneytown Dam will “provide significant ecological, recreational, and community benefits, including for nearby environmental justice communities.” The agency has contributed $1.6 million toward the removal effort.
The dam, which was built in 1840s, continued to operate as a hydroelectric facility until 2020 when its generators were turned off by its former owners, Enel North America.
Enel sold the dam later that year to a firm called HydroLand Inc., which stated its intent to repair and modernize the dam in order to continue producing electricity. But that plan never came to fruition, leaving the dam to languish while local officials began exploring ways to purchase the dam to tear it down. (In the meantime, Hydroland transferred ownership of the dam to a related entity based out of Washington state, Trimaran Energy.)
“That went from a long period of time of these guys still trying to squeeze some dollars out of us in this acquisition to acquiring it for dollar,” said Rick Dunne, the president of the Connecticut Brownfield Land Bank. 
Timothy Carlsen, who is listed in official documents as a point-of-contact for both HydroLand and Trimaran, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
The Connecticut Brownfield Land Bank is based in Waterbury and has worked on over a dozen environmental assessment and remediation projects throughout the state. Dunne, its leader, is also executive director of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments.
Concerns with the dam aren’t limited to the obstruction of migratory fish. Advocates and local officials have also worried that the dam’s deteriorating condition could result in a failure that would send millions of gallons of water rushing downstream.
When the region was hit with devastating floods in 2023, the torrent of water flowing over the dam washed away much of an earthen berm carrying Metro-North’s Waterbury branch line, resulting in millions of dollars of damage. 
The berm also separates the river from a canal that flows into an artificial pond containing contaminated sediments leftover from the days when Ansonia was a center of brass manufacturing. Flooding could spread that contamination.
“It was only a matter of a few more inches of rain, or another hour or two of heavy rain, it could have completely breached,” Dunne said. “So we’re really worried about catastrophic release at this point because we found out things about the integrity of this dam since we’ve been in there that are really scary.”
Zak, the advocate who now serves as president of Naugatuck River Revival, said the dam has also suffered from a series of longstanding flaws related to the design of the fish ladder that was built in 1999 at the behest of the the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in order to allow the dam to continue operating as a hydroelectric facility.
Videos filmed by Zak and posted online show fish struggling to make their way up river past the dam, while whole sections of the ladder are filled with debris.
“It was a terrible design,” Zak said. “Fish ladders, if they’re short and straight, are moderately okay. This is neither. This is extremely long… and it has a zigzag entrance, so the fish have to find it and navigate to it. Then they have to go up, down, back. It’s stupid.”
A 2010 fire in one of the dam’s two generation units caused further damage to the passageway, according to a complaint submitted to FERC in 2021 by the NVCOG and Naugatuck River Revival. By 2020, a report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that the numbers of some fish species using the ladder — including alewife, shad and brown trout — had fallen by over 90%.
Enel North America, the company that owned the dam at the time the fish ladder was installed, did not respond to a request for comment last week.

Dunne said that more than $50 million has already been committed to the project from state and federal sources. More than half of that, $25 million, is state bonding approved by lawmakers earlier this year that’s awaiting final approval from the State Bond Commission.
The project has also been awarded a $15 million grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association as well as $4 million in federal Clean Water Act funding. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is also spending $1.5 million to test the sediment behind the dam for contaminants.
As part of the effort to remove the dam, Dunne said the land bank also plans to ask officials in Ansonia and Seymour to waive any taxes that went unpaid by the dam’s previous owners.
So far, Dunne said none of the money for the dam removal has been affeccted by President Donald Trump’s budget cutbacks. (Earlier this year, NVCOG had a $5.7 million federal grant to complete portions of the Naugatuck River Greenway Trail rescinded by the Trump administration.)
The land bank must also receive formal approval from FERC, which regulates hydroelectric projects, to remove the dam. A spokesperson for the federal agency said Monday that it has yet to receive a removal application related to the Kinneytown Dam.
Absent any delays in the delivery of federal funding or regulatory approvals, Dunne said he expects crews to begin work next year on relocating a series of sewer mains that will be affected by the project.
From there, Dunne said removal of the dam structure could take place as soon as 2027, with final work on the project wrapping up the following year.
“Demolishing the dam is a relatively simple, straightforward and short process,” Dunne said. “It’s dealing with the sediments, dealing with the flows and dealing with the reconstruction, the rehabilitation and restoration of all the river features… that’s where the work is.”
If successful, the demolition of the Kinneytown Dam would follow similar dam removal projects along Connecticut’s Scantic and Farmington Rivers, as well as a string of other projects along the Naugatuck River.
A decade ago, DEEP completed work on a $6.3 million fish bypass on the Tingue Dam less than 2 miles upstream from Kinneytown.
The bypass, which is surrounded by a park, is wider than a traditional fish ladder and features a more gradual incline to mimic the natural flow of the river. But despite praise for its design, advocates like Zak say it is of little use to fish if they never make it past Kinneytown.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1121_SR_KinneytownDam_017-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 13:58:33.737463

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle) Minutes after the Indiana House confirmed it will return to the Statehouse next week to redistrict, Senate Republicans reversed course and will show up Dec. 8 to “make a final decision on any redistricting proposal sent from the House.”
House Speaker Todd Huston said in a statement released Tuesday that “House Republicans will gavel in on Monday, Dec. 1, reconvening the 2026 regular session. All legislative business will be considered beginning next week, including redrawing the state’s congressional map.
No proposed maps have been released as of midday Tuesday by legislative leaders showing how the General Assembly might accede to Trump’s wish for Republican-led states to draw more GOP-friendly U.S. House districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
The move presents an intra-Republican Party challenge to the state Senate, where Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray has declared too few senators are in support for redistricting to pass.
But Bray confirmed Tuesday, the chamber will convene: “The issue of redrawing Indiana’s congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state. To resolve this issue, the Senate intends to reconvene.”
Trump and Gov. Mike Braun have made political threats against recalcitrant Republican senators — and a House vote in favor of new Indiana maps could ratchet up the pressure on those senators.
Last week, the House and Senate both set Jan. 5 as the date lawmakers would start the new legislative session — not on Dec. 1, as previously planned, to take up the redistricting debate.
But Huston instructed House members to remain prepared for a possible return to the Statehouse during the first two weeks of December. He told reporters the House had enough support to pass redistricting and that it was “prepared” to act.
Redistricting supporters want Indiana lawmakers to craft a map with all nine of the state’s congressional districts favoring Republicans. Those would be based on 2020 census data, like the current maps.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)A University of Kentucky law professor is challenging a widespread but controversial definition of antisemitism as he seeks reinstatement to his UK teaching duties in a lawsuit that could reach beyond Kentucky.
Ramsi Woodcock was promoted to assistant professor in June, but then removed the next month from teaching and banned from the law school’s building as UK opened an investigation into allegations of antisemitism against him.
Woodcock sued the university in federal court earlier this month seeking to be returned to his duties as a full-time tenured professor.
His suit also seeks to block UK from using the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism in disciplinary proceedings.
Harvard University adopted the definition earlier this year as part of a settlement with the Trump administration, which uses it to enforce anti-discrimination laws.

Kentucky’s public universities and colleges must employ the IHRA definition by January in policies “to combat antisemitism” under a resolution enacted by the legislature and signed by Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year.
But critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union, say the definition conflates antisemitism with criticism of Israel, leading to unconstitutional violations of free speech rights. The definition’s author has said it should not be used to “sacrifice free speech.”
Woodcock is asking a federal court in Kentucky’s Eastern District to block UK’s use of the definition in disciplinary proceedings and to declare the state’s mandated use of the definition in university policies a violation of the First Amendment. He’s also asking the court to order U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon “to refrain from requiring or using the IHRA definition of antisemitism in enforcing Title VI.” Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin as a condition of receiving federal funding. 
Lexington attorney Joe Childers is representing Woodcock whose case is supported by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression’s (FIRE) Faculty Legal Defense Fund. Also representing Woodcock are the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and Chicago-based law firm Kapitan Gomaa Law.
UK administrators said they reassigned Woodcock from his teaching duties over the summer after learning of an online petition Woodcock circulated that called for military action against Israel.
In a statement to the Lantern, Woodcock said, “Israel is a colonization project that practices apartheid and is currently committing genocide. The normal response of the international community to colonization, repeated more than 80 times in the 20th century, is to bring the colony to an end. It’s a scandal that the university has been willing to torch our nation’s Constitution to punish me for pointing out that inconvenient fact. Every American scholar has a First Amendment right to oppose Israel. I look forward to continuing to exercise that right and to holding the university to account for violating it.”
Investigation begins
UK President Eli Capilouto in July shared a public message to campus regarding the decision to reassign Woodcock. Capilouto wrote the petition “can be interpreted as antisemitic in accordance with state and federal guidance,” and linked to a definition that cited the IHRA working definition.
UK President Eli Capilouto
Woodcock received notice in a July 22 letter that said the university opened the investigation because of the online petition and after being told he spoke about genocide in Gaza at an academic conference and during another university’s panel discussion. The letter also alleges Woodcock “spammed and are spamming listserves (sic) … with your personal viewpoints concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” The letter says four professors who said they heard him speak at academic conferences or were on the Listservs reported the statements. 
An amended letter sent in September said four students “some of whom are Jewish” also notified UK that Woodcock in his official capacity was calling “for violence against Israel, the genocide of Israeli people who are predominantly Jewish, and the ultimate destruction of Israel.” One report alleged Woodcock made “anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli remarks during an optional lecture,” while another said he shouted “Free Palestine” while in a car with UK law students. 
Woodcock’s complaint says he does not talk about his conclusions regarding Palestine and Israel “in his classes because he did not want to cause students to face persecution for speaking about Palestine.” The complaint did say that Woodcock began sharing his views in early 2024 “in all of the ways in which a scholar would be expected to share research conclusions about how to stop a genocide,” such as presenting conclusions during a faculty research seminar, sending emails to the faculty Listserv and speaking at conferences. 
UK records requested by the Lantern also show that several of Woodcock’s colleagues within the College of Law, including former acting Dean Paul Salamanca, recommended him for tenure as an assistant professor and wrote letters on his behalf in early 2025. The UK Board of Trustees approved Woodcock for promotion in June. 
Woodcock was hired by UK in 2018. His academic research focuses on law and economics from a wealth-distributive perspective, including how it relates to antitrust law. In addition to his professorship in the law college, he has a secondary appointment to UK’s Gatton College of Business and Economics. 
UK hired an outside attorney to lead the investigation in Woodcock’s conduct. Farnaz Farkish Thompson, a partner of McGuire Woods based in Richmond, Virginia, is listed as a contributor to Project 2025, which was created as a guiding document for the Trump administration leading up to the 2024 presidential election. Among its goals for the U.S. presidency, the document calls for supporting Israel. 
In an August 22 letter to Thompson, one of Woodcock’s attorneys questioned whether she can “be an unbiased neutral’ in conducting the investigation, citing her political partisanship and a profile of her by the Christian Broadcasting Network in which she talks about her decision to go to Regent University Law School, founded by the late evangelist Pat Robertson, who taught that Christians have a divine responsibility to support Israel.
The Trump administration has taken a hard line on alleged antisemitism on college campuses, investigating and penalizing numerous universities, including for incidents stemming from pro-Palestinian protests as Israel, with U.S. support, waged war on Gaza to eradicate Hamas after its deadly surprise attack on Israeli civilians on Oct. 7, 2023.
University response
UK spokesman Jay Blanton said in a statement to the Lantern that Woodcock had been reassigned duties pending an ongoing investigation. 
“First, people in this country have the right to express themselves. That is not in question,” Blanton said. “But the university has the right to express itself as well. We have. What was expressed is repugnant and President Capilouto, on behalf of UK, said so.” 
Blanton then added that, under federal law, “if someone’s views as stated threaten the safety and well-being of the university’s students and staff, we are obligated to act to protect our community and our people.” The ongoing investigation is “entirely appropriate and consistent with institutional norms and past practices.” 
UK’s view of academic freedom “is that our faculty have a right to speak about their research and scholarship within their area of expertise,” Blanton said. 
“That right, however, doesn’t extend to creating a hostile environment for people,” he continued. “That is the question that has been raised. And that is what an investigation, from an expert, outside counsel, will help the university determine.”

(Getty Images)A day after Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said that his office is investigating allegations that the Campbell’s Soup Co. uses bioengineered meat in their soups, the company is strongly denying that claim.
Uthmeier weighed in Monday following the release of comments made in a secret audio recording of a vice president of the company criticizing Campbell’s “bioengineered meat” and “chicken from a 3-D printer.”
“We have s*** for f***** poor people,” part of the recording said, as reported by WDIV Local 4 in Detroit. “Who buys our s***? I don’t buy Campbell’s products barely anymore. It’s not healthy now that I know what the f*******‘s in it. Bioengineered meat — I don’t wanna eat a piece of chicken that came from a 3-D printer.” (Elisions by Florida Phoenix)
Uthmeier seized on the media report.
“Florida bans lab-grown meat,” the attorney general posted on X Monday. “Our Consumer Protection division is launching an investigation and will demand answers from Campbell’s.”
When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Campbell’s directed the Phoenix to a newly created page on the company’s website that says: “The chicken meat used in Campbell’s soups come from long-trusted, USDA approved U.S. suppliers and meets our high-quality standards. Campbell’s does not use 3D-printed chicken, lab-grown chicken, or any form of artificial or bioengineered meat in our soups.”
Florida banned lab-grown meat in 2024
Florida became the first state in the country to ban the selling, manufacturing, or distribution of lab-grown or “cultivated meat” in 2024. Since then, six states have followed suit, according to the National Agricultural Law Center. The bill was sponsored by now-Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins in conjunction with the Florida Department of Agriculture.
“There are many concerns right here and, until we have those studies and there’s proof positive that this process is going to work, we want to ban this in the state of Florida because it’s just not there quite yet,” Collins told a Senate committee about the legislation.
The label on Campbell’s soups says that the company uses “bioengineered food ingredients,” but the company says that “[b]ioengineered food ingredients refers to genetically modified crops — canola, corn, soybean, sugar beets, etc. that are grown by the vast majority of American farmers. This language on our labels refers to ingredients derived from those crops, not chicken.”
Cultivated meat is animal meat (including seafood and organ meats) produced by growing animal cells directly. According to the Good Food Institute, cultivated meat is made of the same cell types that can be arranged in the same or similar structure as animal tissues, thus replicating the sensory and nutritional profiles of conventional meat.
While it’s been hailed by its supporters as better for the environment, a 2023 report from the University of California at Davis found that lab-grown or “cultivated” meat’s environmental impact is likely to be “orders of magnitude” higher than retail beef based on existing and near-term production methods.
Lawsuit
Upside Foods, one of two companies in the country authorized to sell cultivated meat, filed a lawsuit against the state after it banned its product, raising claims under the Commerce Clause and the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution.
In April of this year, Federal Judge Mark Walker threw out four parts of that lawsuit, but did not dismiss the suit outright, according to the Associated Press. Upside Foods argued the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit earlier this month.
WDIV-TV in Detroit was the first station to report about the audio recording, which surfaced in a story about a former employee at Campbell’s, Robert Garza, who filed a lawsuit in Michigan. Garza claims he was fired after he complained about Campbell’s VP for Information Technology Martin Bally, who can be heard in a video released by the TV station blasting the quality of Campbell’s Soup and the people who buy it.


Regarding the audio recording, Campbell’s said this in a statement:


“We are proud of the food we make, the people who make it and the high-quality ingredients we use to provide consumers with good food at a good value. We know that millions of people use Campbell’s products, and we’re honored by the trust they put in us. The comments heard on the recording about our food are not only inaccurate — they are patently absurd.”
Campbell’s added that “the alleged comments heard on the audio were made by a person in IT who has nothing to do with how we make our food.”

(Photo courtesy of Jared Golden for Congress)U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is asking for heating assistance that was delayed during the government shutdown to be released as soon as Sunday. 
Golden, a Democrat who represents Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, is among dozens of bipartisan lawmakers asking Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to distribute funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, also known as LIHEAP, now that the government has reopened and temperatures are dropping. 
“Given that the heating season has already started in many parts of the country, we agree that there is no time to waste,” the lawmakers wrote.
The letter was sent to Kennedy on Monday, asking him to disperse the funds by Nov. 30.
States usually receive LIHEAP allocations in early November to help roughly 6 million Americans, including 45,000 Mainers, heat their homes, but this year’s money was delayed because of the government shutdown that proved to be the longest in history. 
In early November, when it was clear states would not receive LIHEAP funding on the usual timeline, the Maine State Housing Authority came up with a temporary solution to use leftover funds from two other programs to avoid heating emergencies. However, they knew it wouldn’t be a long-term fix. 
Golden has pushed back on Kennedy’s management of LIHEAP multiple times this year, particularly taking issue with the secretary’s decision to fire the program’s entire staff this past spring. In response to that decision, Golden helped lead another letter signed by more than 80 colleagues calling for LIHEAP to be protected and its staff to be rehired.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_1615-scaled-e1730834031719-1024x737.jpeg,,,2025-11-25 13:58:33.737463

Jeff Hurd, then a candidate in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, speaks to the audience at a Republican event at the Grizzly Rose in Denver in 2024. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd introduced a bipartisan bill that would extend for two years enhanced premium tax credits for people who buy health insurance on the individual market. 
The Bipartisan Healthcare Optimization, Protection, and Extension Act, or the HOPE Act, also adds an income cap for the tax credits, so enrollees who make less than $200,000 a year for a family of four would be eligible for the credits. The credits would be phased out for families of four that make between $200,000 and $300,000.
The enhanced premium tax credits implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were initially set to expire in 2022, but Congress extended and expanded them with the Inflation Reduction Act. In the absence of those enhanced federal subsidies, the average cost to purchase health insurance through Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s individual marketplace, will more than double next year.
Extending the credits was a key point of contention between Democrats, who argued for an extension, and Republicans in Congress while they tried to pass a funding bill to reopen the federal government during the recent shutdown.

“I joined this bipartisan effort because doing nothing would leave too many families in rural communities facing unaffordable increases that they cannot absorb,” Hurd, a Republican, said in a statement. “The HOPE Act provides a temporary, responsible extension of the current premium tax credits so families do not see sudden cost spikes through no fault of their own.”
Hurd, of Grand Junction, represents Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, which encompasses Colorado’s Western Slope and the southwest corner of the state, sweeping east to include Pueblo, Otero and Las Animas counties. 
Hurd sponsored the HOPE Act alongside U.S. Reps. Tom Suozzi, a New York Democrat, Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, and Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat. The bill was introduced Friday.
The measure also intends to add guardrails against fraud, including penalties for agents and brokers who provide false information and a requirement for individual marketplaces to confirm enrollee eligibility with the Social Security Administration death records.
“The HOPE Act is a practical, bipartisan solution that maintains affordability, enhances transparency, and improves accountability while Congress works toward long-term reforms that will make our health-care system more stable and more affordable,” Hurd said. 
Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised Democrats that a floor vote on an extension of the tax credits will occur in December, part of a deal struck with seven Democrats and one independent to advance a spending bill to reopen the federal government, despite it not including an extension of enhanced premium tax credits.

(Photos by Anna Kaminski and Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A pair of state senators from Johnson County competing for the Kansas Democratic Party’s nomination for governor are eager to demonstrate political connections to Republican and independent voters who have a dominant presence in rural Kansas.
Sens. Ethan Corson and Cindy Holscher were asked Monday night during an online forum whether they can draw enough support from voters outside the Democratic Party to be competitive in a statewide race for governor. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly won back-to-back elections, sweeping urban counties and outperforming her predecessors in rural areas of Kansas.
Both of the 2026 Democratic candidates for governor highlighted their ability to influence policy in the Kansas Legislature despite two-thirds Republican majorities in the House and Senate.
Corson, who broke campaign donation records by raising $625,000 since announcing in July, is prone to talking about his time playing collegiate baseball in western Kansas. He says he’s running because he believes it is important to have a governor who will ensure the next generation of Kansans stays in Kansas.
He is promising a campaign different than any other run by a Democrat because of “a deep moral obligation to do right by western Kansas.”
“I think one of the big mistakes our party has made is that we wait until three weeks before the election, and then we go out to western Kansas and ask people for their votes,” Corson said. “I think it’s wrong and it’s disrespectful.”
Holscher is committing to a grassroots campaign that is “with and for the people.” She speaks frequently about her rural upbringing and her family’s work ethic.
Holscher said she is running for governor because “Kansans deserve a better deal and a lower cost of living.” She promises to be “a fighter” who stands up to President Donald Trump and extremism.
“The question isn’t whether the Democratic candidates share values. We do,” Holscher said. “The question is, who has the proven ability to deliver results and win tough races?”
 
Shared values, different approaches
Corson, of Fairway, earned current Gov. Laura Kelly’s endorsement. She called him a “true middle-of-the-road” politician. He said he was born and raised in Kansas, attending public schools up until his graduation from Garden City Community College. He later became an attorney, worked in Washington, D.C. and returned to Kansas, where he served as director of the state party and was elected to the Kansas Senate in 2020.
Holscher, of Overland Park, has spent the past 26 years in Kansas, and she has been involved in politics for nearly a decade, beginning during the administration of GOP Gov. Sam Brownback. She has served two terms each in the House and Senate. She was born in Missouri and said she grew up on a farm and she is a first-generation college graduate.
Democrat Marty Tuley of Lawrence also declared his candidacy for governor, but he was not a participant in the forum with Corson and Holscher. The state party’s chairwoman said 500 people registered for the virtual event.
In 2026, the campaign for Kansas governor includes a dense field of Republican candidates, including former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Senate President Ty Masterson, Secretary of State Scott Schwab, Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt, former Johnson County Commissioner Charlotte O’Hara and former Wichita school board member Joy Eakins.
Johnson County, the Kansas City suburb where Corson and Holscher both reside, is the wealthiest county in Kansas and among the richest counties in the country, according to Census data.
The forum for Democratic candidates explored a range of political issues, including rising consumer prices, public education and legislative efficacy.
Holscher said Kansans “can’t afford an extremist” as the next governor. She called out Masterson multiple times for failing to pass property tax relief during his time as Senate president and for his conservative politics.
“I’m not like Ty Masterson. I’m a workhorse and I get things done,” Holscher said. She also referred to Masterson as “Brownback on steroids.”
Masterson’s campaign could not immediately be reached Tuesday for comment.
Corson criticized Kansas Republicans for passing laws they know will solicit lawsuits. He also said, if governor, he would veto Republicans’ costly special-interest earmark projects.
He said housing is a major barrier to job growth in Kansas. Businesses want to expand, and others want to move to Kansas but don’t because they often think workers won’t be able to find housing, Corson said.
He proposed expanding the state’s property tax freeze for seniors to encompass a wider range of people and strengthening renter protections. He also vowed to sign into law, if elected, a child care tax credit.
Corson advocated for full funding of special education and renewing or strengthening the state’s K-12 public school finance formula. The process to rework the formula, which has been the subject of past lawsuits, is currently underway.
Holscher said she opposes school voucher efforts that benefit private schools and vowed, if elected, to implement a statewide plan to improve teacher retention.
She underscored issues Kansas’ next governor must address, including groundwater scarcity for ranchers, rural hospitals at risk of closure, infrastructure and economic development needs, such as broadband access and stronger public schools.
She also expressed support for legalizing medicinal marijuana and investing in labor apprenticeship programs across the state.
Both Corson and Holscher said they would pledge their full support to whoever wins the Democratic primary.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CorsonHolscher-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-25 12:57:36.707204

Free.,"Trump shedding support among Latino voters, survey finds",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-shedding-support-among-latino-voters-survey-finds,,"WASHINGTON — A majority of U.S. Latinos have grown pessimistic since the 2024 presidential election and increasingly disapprove of the immigration and economic policies of the second Trump administration, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center.About 70% of Latinos in the U.S. disapprove of President Donald Trump’s record, with 65% disapproving of his handling on immigration and 61% say his policies have worsened the economy, according to the report.The report found Latinos’ views are still divided by how they voted in the last presidential election, though even Trump voters’ opinion of the president have also declined.“Those who voted for Trump express strong support for the president and his policies, while those who voted for Kamala Harris hold deeply negative views,” according to the report. Latinos were among the groups with the largest shifts toward Trump. In his first campaign in 2016, 28% backed him. In 2020, about 36% of Latinos voted for Trump and that support again grew in 2024, when nearly 48% supported him. Latinos are among the fastest growing demographic groups in the U.S., and are the second largest racial group in the country. The Nov. 24 Pew Research Center report analyzed survey responses from more than 5,500 Hispanic adults conducted from Sept. 22-28 and Oct. 6-16. The study used the terms Latino and Hispanic people interchangeably.Disapproval on immigration

The study found deep disapproval of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, amid aggressive immigration enforcement operations in areas with large Latino immigrant populations.More than half of Latino adults reported that they worry that they, a family member or a close friend could be deported. Almost 59% of Latinos said they have seen or heard of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids or arrests in their community in the past six months. “About seven-in-ten (71%) say (the Trump administration) is doing too much when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, up from 56% in March,” according to the study.In his 2024 campaign, Trump promised to conduct mass deportations and end temporary legal statues given to newly arrived migrants under the Biden administration.Economic outlook worryingTwo-thirds of Latinos said their overall situation has worsened since last year.“This is the first time that most Hispanics say their situation has worsened in nearly two decades of Pew Research Center Hispanic surveys,” according to the report. Inflation and the economy were major policy concerns for Latinos, like most voters, in the 2024 presidential election.The Pew Research Center study found that in the last year, one-in-three Latinos struggled to pay for groceries, medical care and rent or a mortgage.“Many Latinos also have a negative outlook on the economy’s future,” according to the study. “About half (49%) say the nation’s economy will worsen over the next year, up substantially from 2024. Another 23% say economic conditions will be about the same as now.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-11-25 12:57:36.707204

This story was originally reported by Sara Luterman of The 19th.  Meet Sara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
As The 19th makes plans for 2026, we want to hear from you. Complete our annual survey to let us know your thoughts.
Three years after the release of the first comprehensive roadmap to address difficulties faced by family caregivers of older adults and people with disabilities, the Trump administration has quietly erased transgender caregivers and caregivers of color from a list of underserved or hard-to-reach populations, The 19th has exclusively learned. 
Dozens of changes were quietly made this year to the National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers, which was first released in 2022 after years of work by government officials and community stakeholders. An objective to “prioritize efforts to advance equity for unserved and underserved populations of caregivers” was removed entirely, as was a section noting that the challenges of family caregiving are not equally distributed.
These changes distort reality, according to Jason Resendez, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Family Caregiving. The alliance represents the interests of family caregivers, or about 59 million Americans. A recent report from the alliance and the AARP showed that not all family caregivers face the same amount or intensity of challenge. 
“[Our research] shows that family caregivers span the full spectrum… Yet people of color, women and LGBTQ Americans experience greater negative impacts from caregiving, from financial hardships to worse health outcomes,” Resendez told The 19th in a statement. He also condemned the changes to the report. “Weakening the equity provisions in the National Strategy to Support Family Caregiving ignores this stark reality,” he said. 
The changes were made “earlier this year,” according to the Department of Health and Human Services, which did not answer questions about the specific timing of the changes, who made them or why they were made.
But the why is clear: On President Donald Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order stating that the government recognizes only two sexes, male and female. That order signaled his administration’s opposition to gender diversity and tasked federal agencies with excluding transgender people from laws that protect against sex discrimination. The order also equates being transgender to an ideology, or belief system, instead of an identity that is protected by state and federal law. That executive order is cited on the first page of the edited version of the report, along with a reference to a second executive order against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. 
The Recognize, Assist, Include, Support and Engage Family Caregivers Act, or RAISE Family Caregivers Act, was first signed into law by President Trump in 2018. In 2022, the initial report was delivered to Congress. The report consisted of “over 300 specific commitments from federal agencies about what they could do within their existing authorities and programs to better support family caregivers. It also included recommendations for Congress about key legislation that would make a difference for family caregivers,” said Alison Barkoff, the former head of the Administration for Community Living. 
The recommendations were developed by the advisory councils created by the law and extensive input from the public, including family caregivers and the people they support. 
“One thing that was really important to us was that all caregivers be able to see themselves in the report,” Barkoff said. “By taking out caregivers from certain communities, from taking out the acknowledgement of the unique barriers that people face in different communities face — I think it’s going to create challenges in really meaningfully engaging some types of caregivers that actually face the most barriers and are maybe the least likely to see themselves as caregivers and to seek support.”
This is far from the first time that a federal agency has removed trans people from government-funded health research or a government website. This year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deleted terms like “transgender” and “pregnant person” from agency websites, and the State Department purged references to queer and transgender people from its online resource for LGBTQ+ travelers. The Social Security Administration scrubbed all mentions of trans and intersex people from its resource page about Social Security benefits for LGBTQ+ people. Some webpages were quickly restored, following public outcry and a federal judge’s order. 
Early this year, employees at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were warned to reject grants that mention “women,” “trans” or “diversity.” Another federal judge intervened, ordering the agency that oversees public health research to restore grants that had been cut based on references to gender or racial diversity. However, the Supreme Court ultimately allowed the agency to terminate over $780 million in grants linked to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. 
Making changes to a report delivered to Congress three years ago is still fairly unusual, however, and no one who The 19th spoke with could recall a similar situation in recent history. 
Jace Flatt, an associate professor of health and behavioral sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, was among many researchers whose grants were cancelled earlier this year. Their research focuses on the needs of LGBTQ older adults and LGBTQ caregivers. They were not surprised by the changes. 
“Taking people out doesn’t take away the need,” they told The 19th, adding: “It doesn’t just make this disappear that there are unique concerns and needs for groups of caregivers.” 
Flatt said they are concerned about how erasing certain populations and the idea of inequality from government documents and research will impact policy and funding. 
“If a certain group isn’t listed as a priority, they don’t just go away,” Flatt said. “It just means we will not have data or information on them, which will create knowledge gaps and limit how we move forward and provide care to all caregivers.”

As part of the Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, Arkansas has been allocated $1.024 billion in funding to deliver broadband access to more than 79,000 homes and businesses across the state, according to the release. The Arkansas State Broadband Office (ARConnect) is responsible for administering the BEAD program and funding process at the state level.
“Arkansas is proud to continue serving as one of the states leading this program nationally and be in the first wave of approvals for provisional grant selections,” State Broadband Director Glen Howie said. “This approval gets us one step closer to putting shovels in the ground to connect Arkansans who remain unconnected.”
Arkansas officials outline next steps in federal broadband grant program

Eighteen states and U.S. territories received approval this week for their final proposals, which are expected to save taxpayers approximately $6 billion, according to the release. 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will now review Arkansas’ BEAD program budget. Pending NIST review and subsequent appropriation approval by the Arkansas General Assembly, ARConnect anticipates construction on these projects to begin during the second quarter of 2026, according to the release. 
“After stripping away burdensome rules and regulations and wasteful requirements, taxpayers will save billions in unnecessary costs while connecting those in need to high-speed broadband through the full spectrum of broadband technologies,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said.
The BEAD program, a $42.45 billion initiative created under the Biden administration’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, aims to close the digital divide by expanding broadband access, particularly in rural communities. 
However, the Trump administration made changes to the program that disqualified hundreds of thousands of locations from receiving internet access, according to Stateline. The program’s new technology-neutral approach will also shift a large portion of the funding toward satellite internet companies, which cost less to build, but have more uneven service than underground fiber optic cable. 
Participation in the BEAD program is one of the latest efforts to expand broadband access in Arkansas, especially in rural areas. In 2019, former Gov. Asa Hutchinson created the state’s broadband office, which is “tasked with eliminating the digital divide within the state by 2028,” according to its website. 


Let us know what you think...


 

Although millions of dollars have been poured into the goal, some lawmakers like Rep. Frances Cavenaugh, R-Walnut Ridge, are not pleased with the results. During the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Review subcommittee meeting last Tuesday, Cavenaugh, the committee’s co-chair, questioned a request to amend an existing contract with the Boston Consulting Group to execute the BEAD Program and support ARConnect. Extending the contract term from 2026 to 2029 would add $29.7 million to the contract, which would be completely covered by federal funds, according to documents provided to the committee.
Cavenaugh expressed frustration that she has repeatedly asked, but not received a straight answer about how much of Arkansas is covered by broadband because the state has “been throwing money at this now forever.” The Northeast Arkansas Republican said parts of her district are still not covered by broadband.
To date, the state has spent more than $500 million on broadband, not counting the BEAD program, Howie said. More than 79,000 locations are expected to be covered under the BEAD program. The question of how much of the state is covered by broadband is nuanced, Howie said, because more than 200,000 locations have been awarded a grant that’s not administered by his team and therefore they don’t have insight into the exact progress of those projects. 
Additionally, Cavenaugh said she’s heard reports of issues with providers that have led to broadband projects stalling. She asked Howie for more clarity about how the state is dealing with providers who aren’t fulfilling their contracts and what it will cost to fix this problem. 
“There’s a lot of issues going on in the broadband, and we’re not getting the full picture of what’s happening with that,” Cavenaugh said. “So I guess I’m asking for transparency because there is none, and we’re spending $30 million with someone to help us with that. It’s mindboggling.”
The subcommittee approved Cavenaugh’s motion to hold the broadband contract so she could receive additional information about her questions. Her co-chair, Corning Republican Sen. Blake Johnson, announced the hold was released during Friday’s Arkansas Legislative Council meeting, and lawmakers approved the contract.

It became the island’s greatest national symbol on August 6,1962, when Jamaicans at home and abroad celebrated independence from Great Britain. 
Being one of the few flags in the world that does not have red, white or blue in it, the flag of Jamaica always stands tall as it tells the story of the Jamaican people – my people.
Jamaica has been through many adversities in the past, whether it be socially, economically, politically or any other sector that affects societal affairs.

In recent weeks, our country has been through Hurricane Melissa. This was a category five hurricane that devastated much of our island especially in western parishes. Many schools, churches, businesses and homes were affected or destroyed, yet the Jamaican spirit remains strong as our people seek to rebuild again with hope. 
All over the world, people have been chipping in as well to help with Jamaica’s rebuilding process,  The non-profit organization that I’m a part of here in Connecticut, BlessBackJamdown Missions, Inc, and various churches and other social clubs have all banded together to assist with the recovery and rebuilding efforts of our nation. 
It serves as a reminder that Jamaica, my homeland, is well loved. As we have poured out our talents and gifts to the world over the years, we are certainly feeling and seeing the love reciprocated. The unity we see in the world in response to Jamaica’s need for help at this time, serves as a reminder of what our national flag symbolizes.  
The color black in our flag symbolizes the strength and creativity of our people, green represents the hope that the Jamaican people have as well as the  rich agricultural resources of our land. Gold — gold represents the natural beauty of the Caribbean sun and the wealth of our nation. In my eyes, the colors of our flag do not only carry deep symbolic meaning to Jamaican nationals, but it is certainly an inspiration to anyone who strives to become all that God created them to be, even if everything may not be perfect in their lives. They can overcome whatever the challenge is if they only put their minds to it with God’s help. 
Our Jamaican flag will always be a source of hope as it serves as a reminder that we can bounce back and rebuild even amid the destruction caused by Hurricane Melissa. Together,  we’ll build back stronger. Out of many, we are one!

(Getty Images) While Michigan lawmakers were able to avert a government shutdown and eventually reach a state budget agreement in October, the final agreement left out critical early childhood funding that has upended a nearly two-decade-long commitment to supporting Great Start Collaboratives and Family Coalitions (GSC/FCs) across the state.
The unexpected elimination of their funding has thrown the 54 collaboratives and family coalitions in Michigan into limbo. Many have already abruptly ended and others are relying on organizational and philanthropic support to remain temporarily operational. Only a few will be able to continue in a scaled-back capacity through the end of the school year in June.
Since the early 2000s, the collaboratives and family coalitions have connected families with vital early childhood and family supports, convened partners to improve outcomes and reduce duplication, and implemented programming that supports healthy development for our youngest children. While each collaborative and family coalition operates slightly differently depending on community needs, they all work toward ensuring that all children are born healthy, thriving, and developmentally on track from birth to third grade, are developmentally ready for school entry, and are prepared to succeed in fourth grade and beyond by being proficient readers by the end of third grade.

Using these outcomes as their guideposts, the collaboratives and family coalitions bring together parents and professionals to address these issues however they manifest in their communities. In this model, parents also have a voice in shaping the programs and services that help them give their children a great start. Parent leaders help with strategic planning, program implementation and serve as hosts for Parent Cafe support groups. They also serve as trusted messengers for school enrollment and early childhood initiatives such as Talking is Teaching and Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library.
Many of Michigan’s collaboratives and family coalitions also offer home visiting programs, free parent and child kindergarten readiness programs, playgroups, parent education and support groups, community-based events and outreach, support for child care providers, professional development for service providers and educators, connections to other early childhood resources, help for at-risk moms and pregnant teens, advocacy, and much more. The collaboratives and family coalitions are a lifeline to getting help and give parents and caregivers in Michigan a voice.
A parent who participated in the collaboratives serving Clare and Gladwin counties gets to the heart of why they are essential for communities: “The Great Start Collaborative doesn’t just offer programs; it nurtures dreams, bridges gaps and holds our community together. Losing this support would dim the light in our children’s eyes and silence the laughter that echoes through our parks and homes. Their work is the heartbeat of our early childhood system — irreplaceable, essential and a call to action for decision-makers to preserve this vital legacy.”
Nearly 700 other providers and parents have expressed similar sentiments about the importance of the collaboratives and family coalitions in a statewide survey that was sent out following the news that funding had been eliminated.
In addition to the devastating blow to families across Michigan who have relied on the collaboratives and family coalitions to ensure their children are thriving no matter what barriers they face, the elimination of their funding has also meant that many full-time and part-time Great Start workers in our state have either already lost their jobs or are facing uncertainty about whether their job will exist in the months ahead. 
Many have already moved on to new jobs, leaving behind a void that will not easily be filled, given that these are talented early childhood development professionals with a wealth of experience in the work that they do and years, if not decades, of connections and relationships built in the communities in which they have served.
In response to this setback to early childhood coordination, advocates are actively seeking a new way to frame the work of the collaboratives and family coalitions and restore funding for their critical systems work and programming. 
Financial support for early childhood services has the greatest return on investment in terms of educational and health outcomes for kids. The elimination of this funding is not only disheartening for families now, but it will come with long-term costs for Michigan. Michigan children, families and the staff members who have dedicated years of their lives to these organizations deserve better.

The mother was just arriving to pick up her girls at their elementary school in Chicago when someone with a bullhorn at the nearby shopping center let everyone know: ICE is here.
The white van screeched to a halt right next to where she was parked, and three Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents piled out. They said something in English that she couldn’t decipher, then arrested her on the spot. Her family later said they never asked about her documentation.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

She was only able to get one phone call out before she was taken away.
“The girls,” was all she said to her sister. Her daughters, a third grader and a fourth grader, were still waiting for her inside the school.
Luckily, the girls’ child care provider had prepared for this very moment.
Sandra had been taking care of the girls since they were babies, and now watched them after school. She’d been encouraging the family to get American passports for the kids and signed documents detailing their wishes should the mother be detained.
When Sandra got the call that day in September, she headed straight to the school to pick up the girls.
Since President Donald Trump won a second term, Sandra has been prepping the 10 families at her home-based day care, including some who lack permanent legal status, for the possibility that they may be detained. (The 19th is only using Sandra’s first name and not naming the mother to protect their identities.)
She’s worked with families to get temporary guardianship papers sorted and put a plan in place in case they were detained and their kids were left behind. She even had a psychologist come and speak to the families about the events that had been unfolding across the country to help the children understand that there are certain situations their parents can’t control, and give them the opportunity to talk through their fears that, one day, mamá and papá might not be there to pick them up.
And for two elementary school kids, that day did come. Sandra met them outside the school.
“When they saw me, they knew something wasn’t right,” Sandra said in Spanish. “Are we never going to see our mom again?” they asked.

For all her planning, she was speechless.
“One prepares for these things, but still doesn’t have the words on what to say,” Sandra said.
After that day, Sandra worked with the mother’s sister to get the girls situated to fly to Texas, where their mother, who had full custody of them, was being detained, and then eventually to Mexico. She hasn’t heard from them in over a month. The girls were born in the United States and know nothing of Mexico.
“I think about them in a strange country,” Sandra said. “‘Who is going to care for them like I do?’ Now with this situation I get sad because I think they are the ones who are going to suffer.”
In this year of immigration raids, child care providers have stepped up to keep families unified amid incredible uncertainty. Some are agreeing to be temporary guardians for kids should something happen to their parents. The workers themselves are also under threat — 1 in 5 child care workers are immigrant women, most of them Latinas, who are also having to prepare in case they are detained, particularly while children are in their care. Already, child care workers across the country have been detained and deported.
“The immigration and the child care movements, they are one in the same now,” said Anali Alegria, the director of federal advocacy and media relations at the Child Care for Every Family Network, a national child care advocacy group. “Child care is not just something that keeps the economy going, while it does. It’s also really integral to people’s community and family lives. And so when you’re destabilizing it, you’re also destabilizing something much more fundamental and very tender to that child and that family’s life.”
A loose network of resistance has emerged, with detailed protection plans, ICE lookout patrols, and Signal or Whatsapp chats. Home-based providers like Sandra have been especially involved in that effort because their work often means their lives are even more intertwined with the families they care for.
“All the families we have in our program, I consider them family. We arrive in this country and we don’t have family, and when we get support, advice or the simple act of caring for kids, as child care providers we are essential in many of these families — even more in these times,” said Sandra, who has been caring for children in the United States for 25 years. All the families she cares for are Latinx, 70 percent without permanent legal status.

According to advocacy groups, child care providers are increasingly being asked to look after kids in case they are detained, typically because they are the only trusted person the family knows with U.S. citizenship or legal permanent residence. Parents are asking child care workers to be emergency contacts, short-term guardians and, in some cases, even long-term guardians.
“We heard this under the first Trump administration, and we’re hearing it much more now. It’s not so much a matter of if, but when, right now, and it used to be the other way around,” said Wendy Cervantes, the director of immigration and immigrant families at the Center for Law and Social Policy, an anti-poverty nonprofit. “It adds just additional stress and trauma because they deeply care about these kids. Many of them have kids of their own and obviously have modest incomes, so as much as they want to say, ‘yes’, they can’t in some cases.”
The question was posed to Claudia Pellecer a couple weeks ago. A home-based child care provider in Chicago for 17 years, Pellecer cares for numerous Latinx families, at least one of whom doesn’t have permanent legal status.
In October, one of those moms was due to appear before ICE for a regular check-in as part of her ongoing asylum case. But she knew that many have been detained at those appointments this year.
The mother asked Pellecer to be her 1-year-old son’s legal guardian should she be taken away.
“I couldn’t say no because I am human, I am a mother,” Pellecer said.
They got to work getting the baby a passport and filling out the necessary guardianship paperwork. Pellecer kept the originals and copies. The mother closed her bank account, cleaned out her apartment and prepped two bags, one for her and one for the baby. If the mother was deported, Pellecer would fly with him to meet her in Ecuador, they agreed.
The day of the appointment, she dropped the baby off with Pellecer and set the final plan. Her appointment was at 1 p.m. “If at 6 p.m. you haven’t heard from me, that means I was detained,” she told Pellecer, who cried and wished her luck.
At the appointment, the judge asked her three sets of questions:
“Why are you here?”
“Are you working? Do you have a family?”
“Do you have proof of what happened to you in your country?”
The judge agreed to let her stay and told her to continue working. The mother won’t have a court date again until 2027.
“We learned our lesson,” Pellecer said. “We had to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.”
But their relief was short-lived. Recent events in Chicago have sent child care workers and families into panic, as the people who have tried to keep families together are now being targeted.

Resistance networks have sprung up rapidly in Chicago in recent weeks after a child care worker was followed to Spanish immersion day care Rayito de Sol on the city’s North Side and arrested in front of children and other teachers. The arrest was caught on camera and has sparked demonstrations across the city.
Erin Horetski, whose son, Harrison, was cared for by the worker who was arrested at Rayito de Sol in early November, said parents there had been worried ICE might one day target them because the center specifically hired Spanish-speaking staff.
The morning of the arrest, parents were texting each other once they heard ICE was in the shopping center where the day care is located.
Her husband was just arriving to drop off their boys as ICE was leaving. The first thing out of his mouth when he called her: “They took Miss Diana.”
Agents entered the school without a warrant to arrest infant class teacher Diana Patricia Santillana Galeano, an immigrant from Colombia. DHS said part of the reason for her arrest was because she helped bring her two teenage children across the southern U.S. border this year. “Facilitating human smuggling is a crime,” DHS said. Santillana Galeano fled Colombia fearing for her safety in 2023, filed for asylum and was given a work permit through November 2029, according to court documents. She has no known criminal record. After her arrest, a federal judge ruled that her detention without access to a bond hearing was illegal and she was released November 12.
Horetski said the incident, the first known ICE arrest inside a day care, has spurred the community to action. A GoFundMe account set up by Horetski to support Santillana Galeano, has raised more than $150,000.
Horetski said what’s been lost in the story of what happened at Rayito is the humanity of the person at the center of it, someone she said was “like a second mother” to her son.
“At the end of the day, she was a person and a friend and a mother and provider to our kids — I think we need to remember that,” Horetski said.
Now, the parents are the ones coming together to put in place a safety plan for the teachers, most of whom have continued to come to the school and care for their children.
They are working on establishing a safe passage patrol, setting up parents with whistles at the front of the school to stand guard during arrival and dismissal time to ensure teachers can come and go to their cars or to public transit safely. Parents are also establishing escorts for teachers who may need a ride to work or someone to accompany them on the bus or the train. A meal train set up by the parents is helping to send food to the teachers through Thanksgiving, and two local restaurants have pitched in with discounts. Some of the parents are also lawyers who are considering setting up a legal clinic to ensure workers know their rights, Horetski said.

Figuring out how to come together to support teachers and the children who now have questions about safety is something that “continues to circle in all of our minds and brains,” Horeski said. “It’s hard to not have the answers or know how to best move forward. We’re in such uncharted territory that you’re like, ‘Where do you go from here?’ So we’re kind of paving that because this is the first time that something like this has happened.”
Prep is top of mind now for organizers including at the Service Employees International Union, where Sandra and Pellecer are members, who are convening emergency child care worker trainings to set up procedures, such as posted signs that say ICE cannot enter without a warrant, showing them what the warrants must include to be binding, helping them set a designated person to speak to ICE should they enter and talking to their families to offer support.
Cervantes has been doing this work since Trump’s first term, when it was clear immigration was going to be a key focus for the president. This year has been different, though. Child care centers were previously protected under a “sensitive locations” directive that advised ICE to not conduct enforcement in places like schools and day cares. But Trump removed that protection on his first day in office this year, signaling a more aggressive approach to ICE enforcement was coming.
Cervantes and her team are currently in the midst of a research project about child care workers across the country, conversations that are also illuminating for them just how dire the situation has become for providers.
“We are asking providers to make protocols for what is basically a man-made disaster,” she said. “They shouldn’t have to worry about protecting children and staff from the government.”

State rolls out multi-step handgun permit process as Sportsmen’s leader Jeff Hague questions costs, agency power, and how the rules were implemented
WILMINGTON, Del. — Delaware handgun buyers now must clear a new, multi-step state process before they can purchase a firearm, under a permit-to-purchase law that took effect Nov. 16.
The law, passed by the General Assembly in 2023, requires most residents to obtain a state-issued permit before buying a handgun. During a recent “A Better Discussion” webcast, longtime Delaware regulator and Second Amendment advocate Jeff Hague walked viewers through how the system is designed to work and what applicants should expect.
Hague is president of the Delaware State Sportsmen’s Association and previously served 18 years as the state’s first Registrar of Regulations.
Step 1: Mandatory handgun training
Under the law, most first-time handgun buyers must complete an approved safety and proficiency course before they can apply for a permit.
Hague told viewers the classes are typically one to two days long and are offered by private instructors who must be certified by the state.
“You have to have a class, a training class that can take up to two days,” he said, noting that course fees he has seen generally range from about $150 to $300, depending on the instructor and location.
State police have issued written guidance for instructors on how to qualify to teach permit-eligible courses and what topics must be covered. Those guidelines spell out the steps instructors must take to be listed as certified and to have their classes accepted for permit purposes.
Step 2: Fingerprinting and background checks
After completing the required training, applicants must be fingerprinted and undergo a background check conducted by the State Bureau of Identification (SBI), part of the Delaware State Police.
“Fingerprinting is $85,” Hague said on the webcast.
The fingerprints are used to run state and federal criminal history checks. Hague emphasized that while the law does not impose a fee for the application itself, the training and fingerprinting costs together represent the primary out-of-pocket expense for would-be handgun buyers.
Step 3: Applying for the permit
Once training and fingerprinting are complete, applicants may submit a permit application through SBI. That application and the background information are then forwarded to the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security for review.
Hague said the law gives the Secretary of Homeland Security authority to deny a permit if there is probable cause that an applicant poses a danger to themselves or others. The statute also contains certain exemptions, he noted, such as for some current and former law enforcement officers and other limited categories, though most civilian buyers must follow the full process.
The permit, once issued, is then presented to a federally licensed firearms dealer as part of the purchase, in addition to the standard federal background check form already required under federal law.
“You still have to go through the standard background check with the dealer,” Hague said. “This is an additional state step on the front end before you can even get to that point.”
Delaware Attorney General praises the law as “Common Sense Measure,” claiming the State is ready.
Since Nov. 16, AG Kathy Jennings has publicly defended the handgun permit law, stressing its enforceability, its role in promoting safe gun ownership, and its evidence-based effectiveness in reducing gun violence.  On November 17, 2025, Jennings told Delaware Public Media that she looks forward to seeing the law’s effects statewide. She emphasized that the law is a “common sense measure” requiring buyers to know how to use, store, and understand the laws around handguns before purchase. Jennings noted that permits have already been successfully issued since the law took effect, showing that the system is enforceable and functional.
The System is still evolving, and the State may not be ready!
Because the law’s effective date was set for mid-November, Hague said much of the infrastructure has been built quickly in recent weeks.
“Our sources tell us that the state didn’t do a thing until about five weeks, six weeks before implementation, when they figured out that, ‘uh-oh, we gotta do something,’” he said.
He told viewers the process, forms and online information have been updated repeatedly since the November launch as state agencies refine procedures and adjust instructor and applicant guidance.
Guidelines and regulations
A key piece of Hague’s explanation focused on the difference between informal guidance and formal regulations.
Before the law took effect, the Delaware State Police published detailed guidelines for instructors who want to teach qualifying permit classes. Those guidelines describe application procedures, record-keeping expectations and course content standards instructors must meet to be approved.
Drawing on his 18 years overseeing the Administrative Procedures Act, Hague said that when state rules impose mandatory requirements and consequences, they typically must go through the formal regulatory process: public notice, publication in the Register of Regulations and a public comment period.
“Anything regulatory has got to go through the Administrative Procedures Act,” he said.
He said the question of whether some of the instructor “guidelines” should instead have been adopted as formal regulations was one of the issues raised in court as the law approached its launch date.
Legal challenge continues
Hague also updated viewers on the ongoing court case challenging the law.
He said the Delaware State Sportsmen’s Association and other plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in federal court within hours of Gov. John Carney signing the bill last year. Earlier this month, a federal judge denied their request for an emergency injunction that would have temporarily blocked the law before the Nov. 16 start date.
“We immediately appealed by midnight to the Third Circuit,” Hague said.
According to Hague, the plaintiffs have filed an initial brief, the state has filed its response, and the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has requested additional written arguments on specific issues. A three-judge panel will decide how to handle the emergency appeal while the broader constitutional challenge to the law continues.
“We’re still challenging the constitutionality on the federal level and the state level,” he said. “That case will continue, even if the statute stays in effect.”
Hague questions burden and legality
While much of Hague’s presentation focused on explaining the new process, he also made clear he believes the system is overly burdensome and on shaky legal ground.
He noted that between training fees and fingerprinting costs, “you’re talking hundreds of dollars” before a law-abiding citizen can attempt to buy a handgun, and said the law effectively gives an appointed official broad power over a constitutional right.
“An unelected bureaucrat appointed by the governor makes the final determination as to whether or not you get to exercise your right to keep and bear arms,” Hague said, referring to the Secretary of Homeland Security’s role.
Hague argued that key elements of how the law is being implemented — including fast-changing instructions and the use of instructor guidelines he views as de facto regulations — should have been fully spelled out and vetted before the statute took effect.
“It should be transparent — the processes you have to go through to get the permit,” he said. “There’s regulations all through this that needed to be done prior to the implementation of this statute, and they just… they never did it.”
In his view, the dispute over the permit-to-purchase law is as much about regulatory power as it is about firearms policy.
“This is an example of an agency playing games with regulations,” Hague said. “They’ve been changing the requirements daily since the 16th,” even as the law remains in force while the courts decide its fate.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/545b5e72-0779-40c0-bf5e-c5bc79da71ab-1.png,,,2025-11-25 11:58:01.223546

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse on Tuesday admonished the former leader of a Kansas foster care charity for dragging his feet on plans to enter a guilty plea.
Crouse ordered Robert Smith to stand trial for bilking millions of dollars from Saint Francis Ministries, which Smith led from 2014 to 2020.
Smith, who faces federal charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud, and one count of money laundering, told the court in May that he planned to enter a guilty plea. Smith subsequently asked the court three times to delay his change of plea hearing.
Crouse rejected the most recent request for a delay and ordered Smith to travel from his home in Tennessee to attend Tuesday’s hearing in person.
But when Smith showed up at the federal courthouse in Topeka, his attorney, Sarah Hess, told the court he still wasn’t ready to change his plea. Hess and the prosecutor have yet to settle on a proposed plea deal that could include dropping some charges.
“I’ve given you all the time I’m going to give you,” Crouse said. “So if you’re not ready to enter a plea, I’m going to set it for trial.”
Hess told the judge, “We do intend to plead guilty,” possibly as early as January. Crouse responded by scheduling a 10-day trial for May 5.
“Is there anything else the government can do for you today?” Crouse asked.
“No, your honor,” Hess replied.
Smith, an Episcopal priest, was known to friends and colleagues as Father Bobby. As president and CEO of Saint Francis Ministries, he allegedly used the company credit card to live a lavish lifestyle. He and his co-defendant, former Saint Francis IT director William Whymark, also schemed to steal at least $4.7 million from the organization, according to court documents.
Whymark, who was indicted on 14 crimes, pleaded guilty on Nov. 18 to two charges of wire fraud totaling more than $2 million. As part of the agreement, he admitted to submitting fraudulent invoices for inflated costs of IT services, and that Smith knowingly approved the inflated invoices.
Whymark also told the court he has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. He faces up to 10 years in federal prison for each of the two charges.
Smith asked the court last week to delay his hearing by 45 days, and noted that it would be inconvenient for him to make the road trip two days before Thanksgiving.
“Mr. Smith has zero savings,” his attorney wrote in a court filing. “He is not able to afford airfare, and the costs of last-minute gas, tolls, food, and uncertain lodging for the required road trip would completely deplete his available funds.”
Crouse told Smith, “The delays must end,” and ordered him to appear in court.
“The hardships, if any, are the product of Mr. Smith’s choices, as the November hearing has been set for nearly two months,” Crouse wrote in a Friday response. “And any alleged complications seem to be capable of resolution, as his co-defendant has already entered his plea and is awaiting sentencing. The Speedy Trial Act certainly protects an accused’s right to proceed expeditiously, but it also provides the public with an expectation that matters will not languish because an accused seeks to delay justice.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Topeka-federal-court-house-4--1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-25 11:58:01.223546

(File photo by Spenser Heaps/ Utah News Dispatch)South Carolina farmers impacted by Hurricane Helene, as well as tornados, floods and droughts that hit the state in the last two years, can apply for a second round of federal aid.
The application period opened Monday for 2023 and 2024 natural disaster-related crop losses for which farmers did not have crop insurance.
The aid can also help insured farmers recuperate any minor losses that were not enough to trigger an insurance payout, as well as damage to crops that reduced the sale value of those crops.
The U.S. Farm Service Agency has a total of $16 billion it can award nationwide for what’s known as the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program.
From the first funding round, about 2,120 South Carolina farmers received a total of $42.6 million in aid, mostly for losses to corn, peaches, soybean and cotton crops.
About $10.3 billion still remains available in the national program, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Farmers have through April 30, 2026, to apply for these dollars.
When it comes to drought relief, eligible counties in 2023 include Anderson, Cherokee, Chester, Fairfield, Greenville, Laurens, Newberry, Oconee, Pickens, Spartanburg, Union and York. In 2024, those counties are Clarendon, Darlington, Dillon, Florence, Horry, Lee, Marion, Sumter and Williamsburg.
Applications also opened Monday for dairy farmers who had milk spoil or farmers whose crops were ruined while stored in grain bins on the farm.
The Milk Loss Program provides up to $1.65 million in payments to eligible dairies. The on-farm stored crop program provides for up to $5 million.
Farmers have until Jan. 23, 2026, to apply for these two disaster programs.
All of this aid applies nationwide and is separate from a South Carolina-specific grant, which the federal agriculture agency awarded to the state in September.
That $38 million grant applied to farmers and timber companies across 33 of South Carolina’s 46 counties.
That grant covers damage to trees and crops that can take multiple years to mature, such as pecan trees. It also covered farm buildings, irrigation equipment, on-farm roads and fish hatchery equipment, as well as losses for farmers who couldn’t get their crops to market because of storm damage, according to the state Department of Agriculture.

Ron DeSantis with Ohio state Rep. Heidi Workman. (Photo by Nick Evans/Ohio Capital Journal)Gov. Ron DeSantis proposed new penalties against certain dog breeders and animal abusers on Tuesday, hoping to pass more anti-animal cruelty legislation before his term is through.
He spoke at Big Dog Ranch Rescue in Loxahatchee early Tuesday, the same site where he signed two other anti-animal cruelty measures into law earlier this year. For the 2026 session, DeSantis wants the Legislature to impose a statewide dog breeder license, target unethical dog breeding, and tighten penalties for Floridians who abuse animals in front of children.
According to its website, Big Dog Ranch Rescue is the largest cage-free, no-kill animal rescue organization in the nation.
“There are some bad actors who keep these animals in inhumane conditions and we want to put an end to that type of practice in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said, joined by Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and a host of Republican lawmakers eager to sponsor the proposed legislation.
“It’s been a long-time coming,” he added.
According to the governor, the measure would require the Department of Business and Professional Regulation to issue statewide dog breeder licenses to better “hold them accountable” for abusive conditions. This could include overbreeding female dogs, overcrowding breeding areas, a lack of veterinary care, or exposure to harsh environments.
The proposal asks pet stores to offer local shelters spaces to put dogs up for adoption before the space is used to sell dogs from “puppy mills,” which are large, for-profit centers designed for quick breeding under poor conditions. In 2023, the Humane Society of the U.S. ranked Miami-Dade County as the highest area in the country for pet stores peddling puppy-mill dogs.
Other suggestions include establishing a hotline to crack down on unethical breeding practices, ensuring veterinarians give consumers accurate information about dogs, and increased penalties for those who abuse animals in front of a minor.
Not the first animal legislation…
Republican Rep. Meg Weinberger, a leading animal-rights activist representing Palm Beach, sponsored similar legislation in the 2025 session. Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin filed the companion bill in the Senate. Their bills required breeders to register with the state, undergo inspections, and be listed in a public database.
Violators would face hefty fines. However, neither bill was ever voted in either a House nor a Senate committee.
This isn’t DeSantis’ first venture to Big Dog Ranch Rescue. At the end of the 2025 legislative session, he signed “Trooper’s Law” and “Dexter’s Law” at the South Florida venue. On Tuesday, he vowed to do so with his new proposals if the Legislature agrees.
“The mission is, you legislators, churn this out and then we’ll set a date to come back here and … then we’ll do an even bigger celebration,” he said.
Trooper’s Law, named after a Bull Terrier nicknamed “Trooper” by Florida Highway Patrol, makes it a third-degree felony to restrain and abandon a dog outside during a natural disaster. Trooper was found tied to a Tampa fence ahead of Hurricane Milton as floods rushed in. Animal cruelty charges were dropped against his former owner for lack of evidence of intent.
Dexter’s Law lengthens prison sentences for Floridians who torture, mutilate, or kill pets. This came after Dexter, a bulldog mix, was found decapitated and dumped in St. Petersburg.
The 2026 legislative session begins Jan. 13.

The surrounding land was scorched by a wildfire in December 2021 (Allison Kite/Missouri Independent).In the first 10 months of 2025, almost 110,000 acres across Missouri were burned by more than 2,700 wildfires.
More than 9,300 of those acres were burned by wildfires caused by power lines.
In May 2025, the Missouri Public Service Commission — which regulates the state’s utility companies — asked utilities to detail their wildfire mitigation plans.
The commission hopes to develop best practices for utilities to reduce the risk of wildfires and protect the communities they serve.

The request reflects Missouri’s changing environment, with drought and other factors driving an increase in wildfire risk statewide. Utilities’ responses highlight a patchwork approach, with some providers well into implementing plans and others still drafting them.
 No stranger to fire

In the United States, wildfire is often considered a mostly western phenomenon. But Missouri is no stranger to fire — historically, nearly all of the state burned on a regular basis, according to LandFire, a federal fire management data program.
Before Europeans arrived, some parts of the state burned as often as every two years, and almost all parts of the state burned at least every 20 years, according to federal data.
That means the plants and animals in Missouri’s ecosystems evolved around wildfire, with some becoming dependent on it for renewal and survival, according to Andrew Dressel, vice president of energy practice at Charles River Associates, a consulting firm that works with utilities on risk mitigation.
Today, wildfires primarily burn in the state’s southern forests, while its northern grasslands burn far less than they did historically.
Firefighting and suppression have kept much of Missouri from burning as often as it once did. The FEMA National Risk Index characterizes most of Missouri as being at “relatively low” or “very low” risk of wildfire, a point that Ameren and Evergy — the state’s largest utilities — noted in their responses to the Public Service Commission.

Wildfire Risk

But Missouri State Climatologist Zach Leasor said changing climate conditions are providing more fuel for fire.
“All of the trends we’re seeing with drought point to an increased wildfire risk here in Missouri,” Leasor said. “We might not see longer droughts … but we’re going to see short, intense droughts that are then punctuated by these extreme precipitation events.”
Leasor said these conditions exacerbate fire risk because they dry out new growth, creating more fuel.
“Usually, what we see as the best mix for a fire year would be healthy vegetation early so you build up a lot of biological mass, and then it dries down, and now you’ve got all these fuels here,” Leasor said. “That’s the worst-case scenario when you think about fire risk, especially in a state like Missouri.”
Other climate conditions, like temperature, can also play a role, he said, because warmer overnight lows have extended the growing season, pushing back winter conditions that suppress fires. That is particularly problematic because fall is Missouri’s peak fire season, when lower humidity and higher winds increase fire risk.
While Missouri hasn’t yet seen the massive blazes affecting nearby states, the potential is there, according to Michael Stambaugh, a professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia and the chair of the Oak Woodlands & Forests Fire Consortium.
“There have been half-a-million-acre fires recently in Kansas and Oklahoma. … We haven’t seen the big fires yet, but I think it’s just a matter of time,” Stambaugh said.
“The conditions are more or less the same (in Missouri) as you see in Kansas and Oklahoma,” he added. “We have the same fuels, we have the same kinds of landscapes, more or less very similar weather patterns. A lot of those ignitions are accidental, so I think it’s just a matter of time.”
Stambaugh said there is precedent for these kinds of fires in Missouri, with fires several hundred years ago burning up to 1 million acres.
“Even though we’re not seeing a significant increase in the number of fires and area burned, it doesn’t mean the potential hasn’t changed, or isn’t there, for large events to happen,” he said, adding that even if conditions make fire risk worse, the scope of that risk can be hard to fully understand until fires actually start.
The fact that Missouri hasn’t yet seen a significant increase in wildfires makes the PSC’s inquiry all the more “proactive,” according to Andrew Dressel, a consultant who works with utilities on risk mitigation.
“Missouri is not immune from wildfire risk, so it’s good to be out ahead of this,” he said, adding that states across the country have seen an increase in the risk of wildfires, including utility-related fires.
 A national challenge

“This became a big issue really in the 2010s, when it stopped being a southern California problem — then it was all of California. There were a number of fires … culminating in the 2018 Camp fire,” Dressel said. “That fire started from a transmission line … that broke in a remote section of northeastern California and, hours later, burned down much of the town of Paradise and subsequently led to the bankruptcy of PG&E.”
Similar disasters followed, including Oregon’s Labor Day fires in 2020, the 2021-2022 Marshall fire in Colorado and the Lahaina fire in Maui in 2023.
Dressel said the Marshall and Lahaina fires catalyzed conversations about the role of utilities in preventing wildfires, as “that’s when people really started focusing in on why the power was even still on in those situations.”
The 2018 Camp fire and others have shown the potential for utility-related wildfires to destroy entire towns and claim lives. They’ve also demonstrated that when utility infrastructure causes or exacerbates a wildfire, the cost can be high enough to destabilize — if not bankrupt — a company, Dressel said.
That means higher costs for customers, but also higher costs for the insurance companies that work with utilities. The increase in utility-related wildfires has “skyrocketed” insurance costs for utility companies, Dressel said, which puts pressure on companies to develop wildfire mitigation plans.
 Utilities’ plans

In its response to the commission, Ameren said it has wildfire liability insurance. While a wildfire mitigation plan was not required to access coverage, it said “it is helpful in securing coverage and explaining to underwriters what mitigations are being taken.”
Evergy also reported that its excess liability policy — which includes wildfire coverage — did not require it to have a plan in place.
The Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives, which represents co-op utilities across the state, told the commission that “a well-structured plan helps reduce liability exposure” but did not elaborate further.
Wildfire mitigation plans outline strategies for reducing the risk of wildfire. They include plans for preventing equipment from starting fires and plans for protecting customers and equipment if a wildfire is already burning through an area, Dressel said.
Most electric utilities told the commission they “have some semblance of a plan,” but a few had no plan, Dressel said, adding that he had not reviewed any utilities’ full plans, only their responses to the PSC.
Ameren told the commission it had a plan in place but later described it as being “in its early development stage.” Evergy is developing its wildfire mitigation plans, but told the commission it expects to have a draft complete by the end of 2025.
Meanwhile, electric cooperatives across the state are in different stages of developing and implementing their plans, according to the cooperative association’s responses.
In addition to asking whether utilities had plans in place, the commission requested information about aspects of those plans, including infrastructure maintenance, risk assessment, forecasting and emergency communication.
Ameren, Evergy and the cooperatives all reported regularly inspecting and managing equipment and nearby vegetation. Asked about efforts to upgrade infrastructure, Ameren and Evergy told the commission they were working on replacing old conductors and installing new, more fire-resistant poles.
Dressel said “system hardening” — upgrades to infrastructure to improve resilience — is often considered after other mitigation strategies “because you want to see what you can do at a lower cost first.”
Other, cheaper approaches could be prioritized, like changing how the grid itself responds to potential problems. But Dressel said that section “was a little light on a lot of the responses.”
Power lines have sensors that detect when a tree branch has fallen on a line, prompting the system to shut off power to that line temporarily. Evergy spokesperson Courtney Lewis told The Beacon in an email that Evergy makes those sensors more sensitive during Red Flag Warning days “so the grid is faster to react to potential problems.”
But Dressel said that approach has its limitations if the power starts flowing again moments later. If there’s a branch sitting on the line when that happens, “then you have a fire,” Dressel said.
To prevent this, during high fire conditions, utilities could disable the technology that automatically reopens the line. But that further impacts reliability, as power would be shut off until a crew could come in person to turn it back on, Dressel said.
In its request, the commission also asked utilities about their ability to model different weather scenarios to help with planning and disaster preparedness.
Ameren told the commission it relies on the National Weather Service’s fire risk alerts but doesn’t model weather conditions. Evergy reported it currently “accesses state resources for this type of work.” Both said they are reviewing available products.
While utilities’ answers covered much of what would be needed for effective mitigation plans, Dressel said “there were several that don’t have great elements regarding coordination with public safety agencies and other utilities. They don’t necessarily have a plan to reach out to other critical infrastructure operators.”
Ameren told the commission it has not integrated its mitigation plan into state or local emergency plans, but it has instructed employees to call 911 in the event of a wildfire. Evergy, meanwhile, reported that although the focus hasn’t been on wildfires, it has built “strong working relationships” with state and local officials and first responders regarding emergency planning and communications.
Both Ameren and Evergy told the commission they participate in mutual assistance plans and work with other utilities to share best practices and provide support in the event of an emergency. However, Ameren added that it does not have “a specific procedure for information sharing” beyond planned work outage notifications.
The commission also asked utilities about their plans for public safety power shutoffs, or PSPS, which involves preemptively cutting off power during an emergency to prevent energized power lines from exacerbating a fire.
Neither Evergy nor Ameren currently has a PSPS policy in place, but both told the commission they are exploring developing one. In its report, Ameren described such a policy as a “mitigation measure of last resort.”
“Most seem to not want to do this. That’s common,” Dressel said. “But our view is that everyone should have PSPS in their plan somewhere. When conditions devolve to some really raging windstorm in very dry conditions, no one wants to shut the power off — because the primary objective of power companies is to deliver power — but sometimes, it’s the best decision you can make.”
Having a PSPS plan in place is necessary to ensure that, in the event of an emergency, utilities understand how cutting power will impact the community, he said.
“Is there critical infrastructure on that line? Is it going to affect your ability to pump water? Are you going to cut off the emergency response dispatch center? Are there medical needs customers there? Have you communicated with them?” Dressel said. “There has to be a really detailed communication strategy that involves all the stakeholders.”
Asked whether there were constraints on its ability to develop and implement mitigation plans, Evergy said it is considering potential constraints, including “stakeholder recognition of this as a risk.”
Asked by The Beacon what stakeholder feedback has looked like thus far, Lewis wrote in an email: “We have found broad support among policymakers in Missouri and Kansas for assessing wildfire risk and creating a mitigation plan through a collaborative effort.”
 What’s next?

With regulators in Missouri and across the country taking notice of growing wildfire risk, regulations could very well be coming, Dressel said.
Missouri “had done some homework before asking about wildfire mitigation plans,” he said. “It looks like they did look at what other states are doing that have dealt with this more. … It seems like they weren’t just doing this on a whim.”
“With what we’ve seen elsewhere, I would not be surprised if they move forward with a requirement that Missouri utilities have a wildfire mitigation plan,” he added. “Because most of (the utilities) have something in flight, it shouldn’t be a major lift.”
Dressel said the PSC’s detailed request — covering aspects of wildfire mitigation and preparedness — could suggest that, beyond requiring a mitigation plan, the commission could require utilities to have plans for individual pieces, such as emergency communications or PSPS.
Even if the commission opts to recommend best practices rather than require them, progress has been made, Dressel said.
“Whether the PSC moves forward or not, I think just asking these questions has probably spurred most of the utilities to action,” he said.

Despite the cranes and construction fencing, airport leaders say Wilmington is well-positioned for one of its busiest holiday periods yet!
WILMINGTON, Del. — Wilmington Airport is promising a “hometown, hassle-free” experience for Thanksgiving travelers this week even as a multi-million-dollar terminal expansion and curbside changes reshape Delaware’s only commercial airport.
Airport officials say ILG remains fully open and staffed for the holiday rush, with Avelo Airlines operating nonstop flights to 14 destinations and a growing share of Delaware Valley passengers choosing the smaller airport over crowded big-city hubs.
$9.8 million expansion nearing completion
The Delaware River and Bay Authority, which operates the airport, is in the final stages of a $9.8 million terminal expansion funded in part by a $5.6 million federal infrastructure grant.
The project adds roughly 6,000 square feet to the gate area, making room for an additional boarding gate, a larger passenger holding room and space for more concessions. It also allows for another security lane, including ILG’s first dedicated TSA PreCheck line, and upgrades terminal utilities.
As of now, the renovated restrooms — including the airport’s first-ever family restroom — and a new baggage claim carousel are completed.
The expansion is designed to help Wilmington handle record passenger levels — more than 155,000 travelers in the first half of 2025 alone — and to attract a third Avelo aircraft to the airport in the coming year.
“We’re investing now to give customers a better experience and lay the groundwork for additional service,”  Jennifer Oberle-Howard, Deptuy Director of Communications for the DBRA.
New and future routes for Delaware flyers
Avelo, which opened a base at Wilmington in 2023, now flies from ILG to popular sun destinations including Orlando, Tampa, Fort Myers, Fort Lauderdale, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, among others.
Looking ahead, Avelo has announced new nonstop service from Wilmington to Atlanta beginning in February 2026, with service to Chicago starting March 12, 2026. Other major cities may also be announced later that year. Those routes will not be in operation this Thanksgiving, but airport leaders say they show ILG’s growing role in the region’s air service.
Construction impacts: curbside and parking tweaks
Holiday travelers will see signs of construction but should find all core services available. The terminal, gates and security checkpoints are operating, and most expansion work is happening behind construction walls.
To handle heavier holiday traffic and ongoing growth, the airport has expanded its cell phone waiting spaces, located directly adjacent to the terminal to make it easier for drivers picking up holiday visitors.
Parking has been expanded in recent years, with ILG now offering more than 1,320 spaces across lots A, B and C, plus an overflow Lot D that opens as needed. For added convenience, real-time parking space counts are available on the airport’s website.
The airport increased its daily parking rate to $11.50 on Nov. 1 but says prices remain below many larger regional airports and help fund ongoing terminal improvements and the gate expansion scheduled to open later this year.
Extra accommodations for Delaware travelers
In addition to Avelo’s flights, Wilmington continues to offer an option for travelers headed beyond ILG’s nonstop map through a partnership with the Landline motorcoach service and American Airlines. Passengers can check in, clear security and check bags at ILG, then board a coach directly to Philadelphia International Airport to connect with American flights and earn frequent-flier miles.
Inside the terminal, recent projects have already delivered renovated restrooms, a new baggage carousel and added parking capacity. The expansion will ultimately bring more food and beverage choices, including a grab-and-go concept with seating, and additional customer amenities as new concession space comes online.
What travelers should do this week
For Thanksgiving week, airport officials and travel experts are urging Delaware flyers to:


Arrive early. Even though ILG is smaller than major hubs, passengers are advised to arrive at least 90 minutes before departure to allow time for check-in, security and any construction-related detours.


Build in time for parking and curbside changes. Families should plan for a short walk from parking or the temporary curbside area and look for updated signage directing them to the correct entrance.


Check flight status before leaving home. With peak demand and potential weather issues, ILG recommends monitoring airline apps or the airport website for any schedule changes.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from the Democratic Party's livestream)TOPEKA — Democratic U.S. Senate candidates Christy Davis, Sandy Spidel Neumann and Anne Parelkar blamed Kansas GOP incumbent Roger Marshall for cost-of-living increases and promoted demands for affordable health care, better treatment of farmers, quality schools and a higher minimum wage.
The trio indicated during an online forum Monday night hosted by the Kansas Democratic Party the centerpiece of their 2026 campaigns would place responsibility for the country’s economic woes on Republicans, including Marshall. The Republican senator said he would seek reelection next year.
The Democratic candidates argued President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” supported by Marshall, exacerbated kitchen-table worries across the red state of Kansas that elected Marshall by 11.5 percentage points in 2020. Democrats said voters shouldn’t forget Trump signed the legislation in July with Marshall standing directly behind the president.
Parelkar, Spidel Neumann and Davis — Senate candidates Michael Soetaert and Chase LaPorte didn’t take part — reminded the audience Marshall walked out of an Oakley town hall in March rather than listen to criticism. Town-hall attendees were boisterously complaining about federal job cuts, especially those tied to veterans’ programs, that were part of Trump’s DOGE initiative with billionaire Elon Musk.
“I’m here to be everything Roger Marshall isn’t,” said Davis, a Cottonwood Falls resident and former rural development director at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. “Kansans deserve a senator who will honor the Constitution, hold the executive branch to account and use the power of the purse to help everyday Kansans.”
 
‘Time we stand up’
Parelkar, an Overland Park immigration attorney, picked up the anti-Marshall thread: “He hides, he avoids and he performs on TV for ‘Daddy’ Trump’s approval. That’s not leadership. It’s fear of having to explain what he’s actually done to working families and the people who trusted him.”
She said Kansans scraping by day after day were frustrated with escalating costs, loss of health care and corporate consolidation of agriculture.
“It’s time we stand up and say, ‘We’re mad as hell, and we’re not going to take it anymore,'” Parelkar said.
Spidel Neumann, a former financial services executive who grew up in Overland Park, said she would represent all Kansans in the U.S. Senate. She asserted Marshall was “dodging constituents,” and that she wouldn’t be that kind of politician.
“I will go to every county, every city, talk to Kansans, find out what’s concerning them and work across the aisle to deliver,” she said. “From what I’ve seen, Marshall just parrots (Trump) administration talking points. He shows up on occasion for a photo op in Kansas, and then he touts policies, like the Big Beautiful Bill, that really harmed Kansans, be it seniors, children, veterans, farmers. I mean, who takes food from kids to give billionaires a tax break?”
Spidel Neumann said a person didn’t need her degree in economics to grasp the “chaos created by Marshall and the Republican-controlled government is hurting everyone.”
The Democratic candidates said they would consider an adjustment to the federal minimum wage, which has stood at $7.25 per hour since 2009.
“We’re losing workers to other states,” Spidel Neumann said. “From an economic perspective, it needs to go up. It needs to go up to a living wage, up to $15.”
Davis said it was unrealistic to expect a person to live off minimum wage because it amounted to $15,000 in annual salary. Housing costs in Kansas were too high and parents were struggling to afford child care, she said. It didn’t make sense for Trump, Marshall and other Republicans to work toward elimination of the U.S. Department of Education, she said.
“Right now the top 1% has more wealth than the entire middle class combined,” Parelkar said. “A full-time job no longer guarantees a middle-class lifestyle. The next generation has little, if any, hope of owning a home.”
 
Marshall’s agenda
A spokesperson for Marshall didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about remarks of the Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate.
Last week, Marshall reintroduced a bill to expand a federal tax credit intended to help people with statistically higher barriers to employment. The credit would be extended to 2030 and could be relied on by employers to invest in training, wages and benefits for military spouses, veterans and recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or Supplemental Security Income benefits.
“For hardworking Americans who’ve faced real obstacles entering the workforce and pursuing their American dream, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit has long been a vital lifeline,” Marshall said. “We’re giving more people a fair chance at meaningful work and the independence that comes with it.”
Marshall said the bill reflected his commitment to the U.S. working class. His advocacy for them included a measure providing tax relief on overtime wages, which was incorporated into the One Big Beautiful Bill.
Another piece of that bill set aside $50 billion to support rural hospitals nationwide, Marshall said.
He’s been a critic of the Affordable Care Act and of proposals by Democrats to extend tax credits relied on to hold down the cost of ACA premiums. The ACA tax credit expires at the end of the year, but Republican lawmakers in Washington plan to outline a health care bill in December, Marshall said.
“For 15 years, Obamacare has been the law of the land. This is an opportunity for Republicans to fix it and jump to solutions,” Marshall said.
He said the GOP bill should redirect to consumers about $150 billion the federal government was “giving insurance companies” under the ACA. He said legislation requiring hospitals and surgery centers to share with patients in advance the cost of procedures would help curtail expenditures.
“We think those two things alone will drive down the cost of premiums and the true cost of health care,” Marshall said.
 
Kansas’ health
During the forum, Parelkar alleged Marshall, who is a physician, was “violating his Hippocratic oath” as a doctor by endorsing federal policies that placed Kansas hospitals at greater threat of closure. She said about 30 hospitals in Kansas were at “imminent risk” of being shut down.
“Moms already can’t get maternity care out there and people are having to be helicoptered to urban centers for heart attacks,” she said. “If you survive that, well, how are you ever going to pay for that? Nursing homes are going to close and we’re going to see people end up on the streets.”
Parelkar recommended granting federal health coverage to all U.S. children from birth through age 18. She proposed the cost of the initiative could be covered by a repeal of tax breaks earmarked for wealthy people.
Spidel Neumann, the former business executive, said the government should extend tax credits linked to ACA premiums. If not, she said, families would certainly choose to go without health care. In addition, she said, the federal government should place caps on prescription drug prices.
Davis, the former USDA official in Kansas, said her sister, who was a physician, died while advocating for better health care access for patients. Meanwhile, Davis said, provisions of the ACA saved her own life.
“No one knows better than me that we’re in a crisis and we need to address health care. People can’t afford premiums and deductibles. We are short on health care providers, especially in rural Kansas,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Senate-democratic-candidates-1024x585.png,,,2025-11-25 10:57:33.664154

Downtown Christmas pop-up becomes a natural stop after the Wilmington Jaycees parade
WILMINGTON — In downtown Wilmington, many people know the holidays have officially arrived when Blitzen opens its doors on West 9th Street.
The Christmas-themed pop-up bar, styled as “The Den,” returns for the 2025 season on Thursday, Nov. 20, opening at 4 p.m. at 220 W. 9th St. The immersive bar is decked out in lights, trees and reindeer-inspired décor, and will operate Wednesday through Saturday with evening hours that make it a natural follow-up stop after the Wilmington Jaycees Christmas Parade.
This year’s parade steps off at 11 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 29, running along Market Street from Second to 11th streets in the heart of downtown. City officials and parade organizers have framed the 61st annual event as both a family tradition and a way to support nearby small businesses on Small Business Saturday.
With Blitzen just a short walk from the parade route, organizers and downtown boosters are encouraging families and visitors to make a full day of it — parade in the morning, shopping and dining in the afternoon, and a festive stop at Blitzen in the evening.
From fast build to holiday fixture
Blitzen first opened in November 2019, transforming the former Pochi restaurant space on 9th Street into what its creator, Delaware-based fashion illustrator and creative director Dallas Shaw, described as a whimsical reindeer’s den. The pop-up was designed and decorated in just a few weeks, with an early menu crafted in partnership with Stitch House Brewery.
Shaw’s concept quickly stood out from a typical holiday bar. Local coverage at the time highlighted Blitzen’s wall-to-wall décor, custom artwork and storytelling touches that gave guests the sense they had stepped directly into a reindeer’s off-season lair.
Since that first season, Blitzen has returned each year with refreshed décor, new cocktail lists and an expanding following. It is now regularly included on regional lists of must-visit holiday pop-ups and is considered one of downtown Wilmington’s signature seasonal attractions.
A cozy “den” after the bands pass by
Inside, Blitzen offers an intimate, photo-ready setting, with holiday lighting, themed vignettes, and a cocktail-forward menu served in the evenings. Guests can expect inventive seasonal drinks, sparkling wines, and winter-style beers, alongside a small selection of bar snacks during early evening hours. The experience is designed more as a festive lounge than a full-service restaurant, catering to groups of friends, coworkers, and parade-goers looking to keep the holiday momentum going.
On parade day, once the last marching band and float clear 11th and Market, families and adults can head a few blocks west toward 9th Street, where Blitzen’s evening hours give downtown visitors a place to warm up, take photos and continue celebrating under twinkling lights.
Boost for downtown holidays
City leaders have pointed to events like the Jaycees parade and seasonal pop-ups such as Blitzen as key pieces of Wilmington’s holiday economy, drawing visitors into the urban core to shop, dine and explore. The parade is timed to coincide with Small Business Saturday, and nearby restaurants, bars and retailers often report some of their busiest foot traffic of the year.
For many Wilmington residents, that combination — a morning on Market Street, an afternoon of shopping and an evening at Blitzen — has become its own tradition.
Blitzen is scheduled to operate through the holiday season with limited days and evening hours, and past years have seen lines form on peak weekends. Visitors are encouraged to check the bar’s website and social media for updated hours, special events and private-party availability before it “dashes away” again until next year.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-25-101954.jpg,,,2025-11-25 10:57:33.664154

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Thom Adamson had been through uncertainty in his job before, including government shutdowns. But earlier this year, it felt different.
Adamson worked as a science communicator at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Earth Resources Observation and Science Center for 18 years before walking away in July. 
He was responsible for translating scientific research and accomplishments for the EROS website, producing and leading a podcast showcasing EROS work, and leading several tours a week through the facility.


From insiders to ousted
This is the second of four stories about federal government employees or contractors in South Dakota affected by the Trump administration’s reduction of the federal workforce.
Read the series >


EROS, located northeast of Sioux Falls, archives satellite images to monitor land use and changes — including helping with emergency disaster responses, such as wildfires, or analyzing the impact of drought, disease and flooding across the world. 
Amid widespread federal workforce and spending reductions by the Trump administration, Adamson and his team of a dozen people were instructed that they’d be laid off in July. But their funding was restored a week or so before the date arrived.
By the time Adamson’s job was no longer in jeopardy, the 55-year-old was convinced it was time for a change. It felt too fragile to trust.
“Even without being political, just being objective about it, the uncertainty feels different now,” Adamson said. “It’s a lot more extreme.”
About 154,000 federal employees took buyouts — officially known as deferred resignations — offered by the Trump administration earlier this year as a way to reduce the size of the federal government. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor said recently that he expects the total decrease in the federal workforce to reach more than 300,000 eventually.
Adamson is not included in that number, because he was a contracted employee. He joined EROS when he and his wife moved to Sioux Falls in 2007. He enjoyed scientific writing, found it rewarding to work with scientists and was fascinated by the work accomplished at the site.
Now, Adamson teaches English in the Sioux Falls School District. He was an educator before joining EROS.
During the recent federal government shutdown, he vacillated between empathy for his former coworkers — recalling the stress thrust upon him in prior shutdowns and leading up to potential shutdowns — and relief at not enduring shutdowns anymore.
Adamson is worried that the Trump administration’s propensity to cut government spending could jeopardize the EROS mission.
“If they don’t understand the value of the work at EROS, they might see it as a great place to cut costs,” Adamson said. “There’s a lot of cost to cutting science, and there’s a lot of science going on at EROS.”

(Getty Images)A third unvaccinated infant in Kentucky has died of pertussis as public health officials urge Kentuckians to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease also known as whooping cough.
Kentucky’s three infant deaths from whooping cough over the past 12 months are the state’s first reported since 2018. None of the infants or their mothers had been vaccinated against the respiratory disease, the Kentucky Department of Public Health confirmed.
Kentucky is in the midst of its largest pertussis spike since 2012, says a Monday state news release that says the disease has increased nationwide as vaccination rates decline.
As of Nov. 19, there have been 566 cases of whooping cough identified in Kentucky, with health officials anticipating more cases as the year ends. Babies younger than 1 year old are at the greatest risk for whooping cough. 
The best way to prevent whooping cough is by receiving the Tdap or DTaP vaccine, which protects against three bacterial infections — diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, say public health experts, says the release. 
Infants can receive the DTaP vaccine beginning at 2 months. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for women during pregnancy to help provide early protection for the baby.  
“We are deeply saddened to learn of another infant death in Kentucky due to pertussis and are concerned by the volume of cases we are seeing throughout the commonwealth,” said Dr. Steven Stack, secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. “We continue to urge Kentuckians to get their whooping cough vaccine and to make sure they are up to date on all other recommended immunizations. Many illnesses can be prevented through vaccination, which helps protect not only the individual but also those around them.”  
The cabinet’s news release says:
Whooping cough vaccination is required for Kentucky school children. Data from the 2024-2025 Kentucky school immunization survey indicate, however, that only 86% of kindergarteners and 85% of seventh-graders are up to date on their required whooping cough vaccines. Health officials encourage everyone to remain up to date with pertussis immunizations. This means: 

All pregnant women should be immunized with each pregnancy to protect their babies. 


Infants should be immunized when they are 2 months, 4 months, 6 months and 12-to-15 months old. 


Children should be immunized before starting kindergarten. 


Pre-teens should be immunized between the ages of 11 and 12 years old. 


Teens and adults should be immunized at least every 10 years, or sooner if an injury occurs or to protect a newborn. 

Other ways to prevent the spread of whooping cough and other infectious illnesses include washing hands often, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when sick. 
Symptoms of whooping cough can vary based on age and vaccination status but typically begin with a runny or congested nose and mild coughing. After one to two weeks, the cough can progress to rapid, violent coughing fits that may cause the characteristic “whooping” sound, vomiting or labored breathing.

The nonpartisan committee announced the updated projections for the state’s general fund after meeting on Monday and credited the forecast to expected increases in sales and income tax revenue, as well as additional capital gains due to the stock market’s strong performance since the last revenue forecast in May.
“With these projected revenues, the State of Maine continues to remain on solid fiscal footing,” said Gov. Janet Mills in a statement. After the Maine Legislature reconvenes in January, the governor will work with lawmakers to craft a supplemental budget that takes into account these changes.
However, even with these adjustments, the Mills administration cautioned that year over year growth “is forecasted to remain relatively slow,” just under 1% for the 2026 fiscal year and 1.4% for 2027. 
Last legislative session, lawmakers faced a projected $450 million deficit, as well as an immediate funding gap to cover the cost of MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, when they crafted the two-year budget.
“The Mills Administration has anticipated revenues to stabilize and has budgeted accordingly to maintain key obligations to the people of Maine,” said Elaine Clark, acting commissioner of the Department of Administrative and Financial Services. “We will continue to prioritize prudent fiscal decisions that serve Maine people.”",,,,2025-11-25 10:57:33.664154

WILMINGTON, Del. — Nemours Children’s Hospital, Delaware, is inviting the community to help brighten the season for young patients through its second annual Holiday Joy Drive, adding a $20,000 matching gift challenge to boost support for hospitalized children and their families.
The 2025 Holiday Joy Drive will be held from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 6, at Nemours Children’s Hospital, Delaware. Community members can drop off new toys and monetary donations to support children spending the holidays in the hospital.
Visitors that day will also find plenty of festive activities on site, including a hot chocolate station, cookie decorating, live holiday music and photos with Santa Claus.
An anonymous donor has pledged to match every dollar given during the event, up to $20,000, effectively doubling the impact of each contribution.

“The Holiday Joy Drive is a cornerstone of our efforts to bring smiles and comfort to our patients and families, especially during the holidays,” said Hilary Bruno, director of Child Life at Nemours Children’s Hospital, Delaware. “With our $20,000 matching gift challenge this year, the community has a chance to amplify their generosity and make an even greater difference in the lives of these children.”

Money raised through the drive will benefit the hospital’s Child Life programs, which provide therapeutic play, educational activities and emotional support to help children cope with illness, treatment and hospital stays.

The closure, which UMass Memorial attributed to workforce shortages and declining births, has since left maternity patients farther from a labor and delivery unit – resulting in a number of ambulance and emergency room births – and has strained the region’s emergency medical services, CommonWealth Beacon reported in September.  
The state auditor’s office reviewed UMass Memorial’s activities between July 1, 2020, and June 30, 2023, and found that the private, nonprofit health care network in Central Massachusetts could not provide evidence of how it spent $6.2 million in COVID-related grants it received from the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) during the investigation period.  
The hospital system says the money was used on bonuses for frontline health care workers.  
The issue appears to be a spat about accounting records, but it highlights the struggles health providers had during the height of the first COVID waves, when frontline medical personnel were stretched thin, and how the business of health care has made it increasingly difficult to deliver services like maternity care across the state. 
UMass Memorial has pushed back on the audit’s findings, arguing that DiZoglio’s office overstepped by attempting to dictate how the hospital network should manage its funds. 
Despite UMass Memorial’s claims that the funding was used for bonus payments authorized under the grant agreement, the auditor has maintained that the health care system did not provide accounting records as evidence of those expenditures.  
Although UMass Memorial likely will not face consequences, the audit makes several recommendations and encourages the hospital to adopt procedural changes and reassess maternity care in the region.  
“By not investing this money in its maternity center workforce, [UMass Memorial] has created a health disparity for its patients, of whom 20 percent are MassHealth members, because of a lack of access to maternity care in the Central Massachusetts region,” the auditor’s report said. 
After the investigation concluded, lawyers for UMass Memorial told DiZoglio’s office the funds were used to reimburse itself for employee appreciation bonuses it allocated to thousands of front-line workers during the height of the pandemic, when hospitals around the country struggled to retain medical staff. UMass Memorial added that the bonuses fell under the “increased cost of workforce” category of allowable uses of COVID funds. 
“While reimbursement for bonuses may be permitted, the general public, whose tax dollars were spent, would likely have been better served had this money been used to ensure community access to critical healthcare services, such as maternity care,” the auditor’s report noted.

UMass Memorial provided the auditors with a spreadsheet detailing $10.6 million in bonuses, but DiZoglio’s office said that didn’t constitute proof of payments made to the employees, nor was it proof the bonuses were funded by the $6.2 million grant. Payroll records would have been an acceptable form of documentation. The report also pointed out that the spreadsheet was created on December 3, 2024, well after both the date the information was requested and the audit period.  
UMass Memorial countered in its formal response that the auditor “never submitted requests to UMMH for such ‘accounting records’ and it is unclear what those would be other than the previously provided materials.”  
Steve Lisuaskas, the deputy auditor under DiZoglio, said in an interview that a spreadsheet generated after-the-fact and provided by UMass Memorial’s lawyers was insufficient evidence.  
“I am highly confident that … UMass Memorial knew exactly what we were looking for, and chose not to provide, or more worryingly, never had payroll records they are required to keep for their grants,” he said. “Providing an Excel spreadsheet, which you and I could develop on our own, and purporting it to be a payroll record is not how audits work.”  
In response to the auditor, UMass Memorial said it had not prepared any documents related to the use of the funds initially because the Executive Office of Health and Human Services never provided specific guidance on how to keep track of the expenditures.  
The hospital system also argued in its formal response that the closure of the maternity ward at UMass Memorial HealthAlliance-Clinton Hospital in Leominster was not due to COVID, and directing pandemic relief funds to keep it open would not have been permissible under the grant agreement.  
But EOHHS clarified, in response to the audit, that supporting maternity care “would likely have been a permissible use of the funds,” and said maintaining accounting records was a requirement of the grant agreement.  
The auditor’s office added that the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, which funded the state grant in question, authorized “premium pay” and “grants to employers with essential workers,” which could have applied to maternity care workers UMass Memorial struggled to recruit before the closure.  
Regional leaders like Fitchburg mayor Sam Squailia took to social media to share the audit and lament the maternity unit closure.  
“The closure of UMass Leominster’s maternity unit was a terrible hit to Fitchburg families and families across North Central Massachusetts,” Squailia wrote on Facebook. “When public money is involved, communities deserve a clear paper trail and a plan that protects access first. Families should not be driving farther to deliver a baby.” 
UMass Memorial argued that there was a public benefit to the bonuses, which rewarded and retained more than 13,000 frontline workers – including nurses – during the pandemic. 
The auditor’s office said it does not question the validity of the bonus payments, but rather “how UMMH chose to reimburse itself for them rather than preserving services for the public.” 
The audit states that the maternity unit closure was “just one example of a loss of a service that may have been prevented if grant funds were used in a different way.” In its response to the audit, UMass Memorial wrote that the auditor “provides absolutely no basis for this vague assertion.” 
In addition to the 2023 maternity unit closure, UMass Memorial shuttered its pediatric unit at the Leominster campus in 2018. Community Healthlink, an affiliate of UMass Memorial, shut down a program in October that provided mental health services for adults in Fitchburg. Additionally, UMass recently closed two primary care programs – one in Leominster in September 2024 and another in Worcester in March, citing financial strains. 
UMass Memorial’s response to the auditor stated that it was “inappropriate and an abuse of [the auditor’s] authority to attempt to dictate how a private entity should manage its funds and operations.” In response, DiZoglio’s office emphasized that UMass Memorial’s use of state funding is subject to audit. 
DiZoglio’s office made multiple recommendations for UMass Memorial, including maintaining detailed accounting records and audit trails when state or federal funding is received, using those types of grants to invest in the operations of essential services, and reassessing the need for maternity care in the region.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/leominster-hospital-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-25 09:57:46.317282

The review is likely to sow confusion and fear among the nearly 200,000 refugees who came to the United States during that period. It is likely to face legal challenges from advocates, some of whom said the move was part of the administration’s “cold-hearted treatment” of people trying to build new lives in the U.S.
The memo, signed by the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, and dated Friday, said that during the Biden years “expediency” and “quantity” were prioritized over “detailed screening and vetting.” The memo said that warranted a comprehensive review and “re-interview of all refugees admitted from January 20, 2021, to February 20, 2025.”
The memo indicated that there will be a list of people to re-interview within three months.
Advocates of the refugee program say that refugees are generally some of the most vetted of all people coming to the United States and that they often wait years to be able to come.
The memo also immediately suspended green card approvals for refugees who came to the U.S. during the stated time period.
If the agency determines that a person shouldn’t have qualified for entry as a refugee, the person “has no right to appeal,” according to the memo, although if they are put in removal proceedings and sent to immigration court, they can then plead their case there. The memo also stated that even those who have already received their green card would be reviewed.
“USCIS is ready to uphold the law and ensure the refugee program is not abused,” Edlow wrote.
People admitted to the U.S. as refugees are required to apply for a green card one year after they arrive in the country and usually five years after that can apply for citizenship.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The moves described in the memo are the latest to take aim at the refugee program, which the administration suspended earlier this year and later set a limit for entries to 7,500 mostly white South Africans — a historic low of refugees to be admitted to the U.S. since the program’s inception in 1980. The Trump administration more broadly has ramped up immigration enforcement as part of its promise to increase deportations of illegal immigrants.
The Biden administration admitted 185,640 refugees from October 2021 through September 2024. Refugee admissions topped 100,000 last year, with the largest numbers coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela and Syria.
Refugee advocates slammed news of the review, saying that it will traumatize people who have already gone through extensive vetting to make it to the U.S. in the first place.
“This plan is shockingly ill-conceived,” said Naomi Steinberg, vice president of U.S. policy and advocacy at HIAS, a refugee resettlement agency. “This is a new low in the administration’s consistently cold-hearted treatment of people who are already building new lives and enriching the communities where they have made their homes.”
USCIS expects to have a priority list for re-interviews within 90 days, Edlow wrote. His language points to a rigorous revisiting of why refugee status was granted in the first place.
“Testimony will include, but is not limited to, the circumstances establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear for principal refugees, the persecutor bar, and any other potential inadmissibilities,” he wrote.
Sharif Aly, President of the International Refugee Assistance Project, an advocacy group, criticized the administration’s actions in a statement late Monday, saying that refugees are “already the most highly vetted immigrants in the United States.”
“Besides the enormous cruelty of this undertaking, it would also be a tremendous waste of government resources to review and re-interview 200,000 people who have been living peacefully in our communities for years,” Aly said.

Supreme Court eases 24-hour notice rule for local officials, angering transparency advocates","Tom Riese, WESA",,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/pa-supreme-court-eases-24-hour-notice-rule-for-local-officials-angering-transparency-advocates/,"The decision angered supporters of government transparency who argue that it weakens the state’s Sunshine Act, which sets requirements for conducting official business in public view.","The Pennsylvania Supreme Court July, 2024 (Jen Barker Worley/ Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts)In a 4-3 decision, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled Monday that local agencies do not need to give 24-hour notice when making changes to public meeting agendas — as long as a majority of the body votes to do so.
The decision angered supporters of government transparency who argue that it weakens the state’s Sunshine Act, which sets requirements for conducting official business in public view.
Under the ruling, said Melissa Melewsky, in-house counsel for the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association,  “[Local agencies] can add anything they want as long as they vote to add something to the agenda, and then post it the day after the meeting. “How does the public ascertain what will be discussed and acted upon with any kind of certainty when an agency can add virtually anything at the last minute?”
Under amendments signed in 2021 by Gov. Tom Wolf, the Sunshine Act generally requires officials to post meeting agendas at least 24 hours in advance. The agenda is usually required to identify any votes officials plan to take.
But in her majority opinion, Justice Christine Donohue, noted that the law also lists some exemptions to that requirement. They include votes on emergency business where there is a “clear and present danger” to the community, or situations involving late-developing matters that involve either trifling decisions or cases in which the agency takes administrative action short of a policy discussion or vote.
But as written, Donohue wrote, the law also identifies an additional exception: “An agency may add a matter of agency business to the agenda” if a majority of voting members approve doing so.
That last category of exemption arose in the case before the court, which involved an October 2021 vote by a Lehigh Valley school board to approve a teachers’ union contract. Earlier that day, the union agreed to a contact that included a 3% pay raise for nearly 700 teachers: While there was no mention of the contract on the agenda for the meeting, a board majority voted to add it during the meeting, and then voted to approve the contract.
The board argued the agreement with the union was reached within the same day, so the body didn’t have time to notify the public of the change. But a state Senator representing the area, Republican Jarett Coleman, took the board to court.
Coleman argued that all four of the exceptions in the law must be in play to allow a last-minute agenda change, and the state Commonwealth Court ruled in his favor. Advocacy groups from across the ideological spectrum — including the ACLU of Pennsylvania, the conservative Commonwealth Foundation, and the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association — urged the Supreme Court justices to uphold that ruling.
But Monday’s ruling turned on a single word: “or.”
Donohue noted that when the Sunshine Act identified four categories of exception to the 24-hour rule, it separated them with the word “or.” That, she wrote, was “unambiguous and creates four freestanding exceptions,” with any one of them sufficient to waive the notification requirement.
Donohue acknowledged that the majority-vote exception was “the broadest exception” of the four, since it didn’t require that matters be of either minor or life-and-death importance. But she said requiring officials to put themselves on record by voting to add an agenda item provided accountability.
”If the [legislature] intended something different from hat is expressed in that plain text, it is free [to] amend the statute,” she added.






Not everyone agreed, and the ruling provided an unusual ideological split. Donohue’s opinion was joined by Justice Kevin Dougherty, who like her was elected as a Democrat, but it also by Sallie Updyke Mundy and Kevin Brobson, who were both elected as Republicans.
Chief Justice Debra Todd and justices Daniel McCaffery and David Wecht — all elected as Democrats — dissented. Todd argued that allowing a majority of officials to circumvent the 24-hour notice at will would “effectively over[ride] narrow exceptions to the agenda requirement.”
“While I agree with the majority that the plain and common meaning of the term ‘or’ should be taken at face value … the application of that plain meaning would lead to an interpretation of the Sunshine Law that is inconsistent with the manifest intent of the General Assembly,” Todd wrote.
Coleman agreed. In a statement, his office said the court majority “has opened Pandora’s Box. Although a split decision, today is a dark day for transparency in Pennsylvania. This ruling negates the need for governments to publish accurate agendas twenty-four hours before public meetings and essentially allows them to operate with no public notice.”
Melewsky predicted that lawmakers will react by amending the Sunshine Act again.
“If there’s a decision that cries out for legislative change, this is one of them,” she said. “The General Assembly made clear what they intended to do in 2021 when they passed this agenda requirement, and this decision really renders that meaningless.”

(U.S. Air National Guard photo by Tech. Sgt. Daniel Robles)Officials with the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management announced a reduction of some state emergency response operations on Friday, and a transition from a response to a recovery phase following the Western Alaska storms as winter sets in. 
Emergency personnel with the Alaska Organized Militia, the Alaska Division of Forestry and Fire Prevention and veteran-led volunteer organization Team Rubicon are ending their missions and departing the region this week. Their work for the season should be complete by Nov. 26, according to a division update. 
“Some aspects of the recovery operation might look different, but the support for impacted individuals and communities will continue,” said Bryan Fisher, director of the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management in a prepared statement.

He thanked the disaster crews for their service. “The work to get emergency repair personnel, supplies, and equipment to communities and repair homes has been nothing short of amazing,” he said. 
The reduction in personnel was expected as winter weather and freezing temperatures set in, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesperson for the State Emergency Operations Center, which is coordinating state, federal, tribal and local partners in the storm disaster response effort.
“We knew when this disaster happened, back on October 8, that we didn’t have a lot of time before winter was going to set in,” Zidek said on Monday. “Here in Alaska, we have two seasons: we have winter and we have construction season. And the ability to work during the winter in these far flung areas that are experiencing below freezing temperatures is very challenging.” 
“So we knew this time would come where we would have to kind of cease some of this emergency response work,” he added. “And really focus on supporting the people that couldn’t return home, and making a plan, longer term, to make repairs when conditions are more favorable.”
The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities will continue to work on critical infrastructure projects, Zidek said, as well as coordinate with local residents in impacted communities and regional partners like the Association of Village Council Presidents, the tribal coalition leading storm response efforts on the west coast, to continue work in villages as weather allows. 
“A lot of work is still going to continue, particularly on infrastructure,” he said. “And there are going to be local crews that can take better advantage of weather windows, both within communities and out of Bethel. But for the most part, we’re going to focus on repairing critical infrastructure and providing services to people that have been displaced.”
The devastating October storms in Western Alaska prompted the largest emergency disaster response in state history. The remnants of Typhoon Halong killed one person, impacted more than 50 communities, destroyed over 200 homes, damaged thousands of structures, and displaced an estimated 1,600 residents across the state, according to local reporting from KYUK. 
Zidek emphasized that communities were impacted at different degrees, and the coordinated response from a wide variety of federal, state, tribal and community organization partners will continue to support communities as needed.
Since the Trump administration approved a federal disaster declaration on Oct 22, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has distributed $17.9 million in assistance, under its individual and household assistance programs, as of Sunday, an agency spokesperson, Alberto Pilot said by email on Monday. 
Pilot said the federal agency has dispersed over $172,000 in housing assistance funds and $17.7 million in “other needs” assistance, which can include disaster unemployment assistance, legal services and crisis counseling. FEMA has also dispersed over $1 million to the state for “expedited public assistance,” he said. 
The Dunleavy administration has requested a 100 percent cost share covered by FEMA for the storm disaster, but that request is “currently under review,” a FEMA spokesperson confirmed on Monday. 
Zidek noted that the state has paused its distribution of disaster assistance to allow FEMA disaster funds to be dispersed first. He said while the programs provide different kinds of support — for example, the state will cover funding repairs to subsistence fishing camps — the relief funding cannot be duplicated on the same projects, like for home repair work. If that occurs, the state will seek repayment from residents or disqualify them from future benefits, according to a division update.
Storm survivors are still encouraged to apply for state disaster assistance and FEMA disaster assistance to cover different costs as the recovery effort continues. Additional assistance is offered by the American Red Cross.  
There are currently 600 storm evacuees staying in non-congregate shelters, like hotels, and the process of transitioning to longer term housing is ongoing, Zidek said. 
“Our goal is to get as many people as possible into some type of temporary housing by Christmas,” he said. “It’s kind of a lofty goal. We might not be able to get everyone in there, but we want to move a large number of people in non-congregate shelters to something that will be more longer term and more comfortable.”

The Alaska National Guard will largely depart the region and return home by Tuesday, a spokesperson said, except for one UH-60L Black Hawk helicopter air crew stationed in Bethel, which will remain ready to respond at the request of state emergency officials.
As of Monday, the Alaska National Guard reported its service members have assisted 18 communities in the storm disaster relief effort in what officials say is the largest off-the-road-system mobilization in Alaska history. 
National Guard service members evacuated 1,160 residents from the region and assisted with resupply efforts, delivering 350,000 pounds of cargo and supplies to coastal villages and logging 364 flight hours. They transported emergency personnel throughout the region, and service members also cleared miles of boardwalks, removed tons of debris, assessed almost 500 homes and secured or moved 94 caskets displaced by the storm.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-25 14:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"US Education Dept plan to reduce student loan access angers nurses, health care groups",Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/25/trump-professional-programs-student-loans/,Students pursuing graduate degrees in nursing and other fields would face tighter loan limits because Trump administration doesn't consider them professional programs.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A coalition of nursing and other health care organizations are angry over a Trump administration plan that could limit access to student loans in some cases.
Students pursuing graduate degrees in nursing, physical therapy, public health and some other fields would face tighter federal student loan limits under the plan because it doesn’t consider them professional programs.
The revamp is part of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress.
While graduate students could previously borrow loans up to the cost of their degree, the new rules would set caps depending on whether the degree is considered a graduate or professional program.
The Education Department is defining the following fields as professional programs: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry and theology.
Left out are nursing, physical therapy, dental hygiene, occupational therapy and social work as well as fields outside of health care such as architecture, education, and accounting.
While the plan is still being finalized, the new student loan caps would take effect next July.
Why this is happening now
The Trump administration says limits on graduate loans are needed to reduce tuition costs. It believes that capping student loans will push universities charging higher-than-average tuition to look at lowering rates.
To define what counts as a professional program, the Education Department is turning to a 1965 law governing student financial aid. The law includes several examples of professional degrees but says it isn’t an exhaustive list. The Trump administration’s proposal, by contrast, says only the degrees spelled out in the new regulation can count as professional programs.
One in 6 of the nation’s registered nurses held a master’s degree as of 2022, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.
The details of the plan were recently hashed out in a federal rulemaking process.
What this means for students
Some future students could find it more costly or difficult to pursue a specialized degree. Under the new plan, students in professional programs would be able to borrow $50,000 a year and up to $200,000 in total.
Other graduate students, such as those pursuing nursing and physical therapy, would be limited to $20,500 a year and up to $100,000 total.
Trump administration says impact will be minimal
The Education Department says its data show 95% of nursing students, for example, are in graduate programs that won’t be affected by the new caps. The department says the vast majority of students are in programs that cost less than the $100,000 cap being proposed for federal student loans.
Students already enrolled in graduate programs would be grandfathered into current lending limits.
Health groups say change will worsen nursing shortage
A coalition of health care organizations has urged the Education Department to change course, arguing that post-bachelor’s health care degrees that are needed for licensure or certification should be considered a professional degree.
They also say that fields being excluded are largely filled by women and in high-demand. According to a U.S. Census Bureau report in 2019, women made up about three-fourths of the full-time, year-round health care workers in the U.S. and accounted for a much higher share in jobs such as dental and medical assistants.
The organizations contend that capping federal student loans will make the ongoing nursing shortage even worse, force students to seek more expensive private loans and threaten patient care.
The American Association of Colleges of Nursing says if the proposal is finalized, “the impact on our already-challenged nursing workforce would be devastating.”
Giving nurses a chance to further their education and advance their careers has attracted young people to the profession, said Susan Pratt, a nurse who is also president of a union representing nurses in Toledo, Ohio.
But making that harder could push away future nurses, she said.
“It’s just a smack in the face,” Pratt said. “When we were during the pandemic, the nurses showed up, and this is the thanks we get.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25328684315940-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 10:57:33.664154

This year California lawmakers passed a handful of measures regulating artificial intelligence. But President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are reigniting efforts to block states from regulating the technology — potentially upending these recent laws and prompting outcry from California officials. 
The Trump administration last week floated a draft of an executive order calling for a task force “whose sole responsibility” is to challenge state AI laws. Citing recent legislation passed by California and Colorado, the proposed order says the current regulatory framework allows “the most restrictive states to dictate national AI policy.” States found in violation of the order would have their federal funding withheld. 
The draft circulated as Trump took to social media to slam state AI “overregulation” and advocate for “one federal standard.”
Meanwhile, Republican members of Congress are considering a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual legislation to fund the military, that would preempt state authority to regulate AI. The proposal prompted more than 200 state legislators, including six Democrats from California, to fire off a letter Monday opposing the idea.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta also urged congressional leaders to reject the proposed language, arguing that preemption would undermine states’ abilities to respond “swiftly and effectively to emerging technologies” and allow AI companies to “evade commonsense state law protections.” Thirty-two of the world’s top 50 AI companies reside in California, according to Bonta’s office.

The letter: “Any federal AI law should serve as a floor, not a ceiling, preserving flexibility for states to go further where necessary to protect their residents.”

The proposed executive order and bill language are the latest in a series of federal actions to prohibit states from regulating AI, following a failed effort earlier this year. In May Republicans from the U.S. House of Representatives advanced legislation that would have enacted a 10-year ban for states to enforce their AI laws, putting 20 state laws California passed in 2024 at risk. The U.S. Senate ultimately rejected that measure in July, after Democrats and a handful of Republicans arguing for state rights denounced the bill.

California utility regulators next month will vote on a proposal to lower the payout shareholders can receive from three major power companies — a potential decision that critics say won’t do enough to lower utility bills for millions of Californians, writes CalMatters’ Malena Carollo.
Known as a “return on equity,” this baked-in cost in utility bills goes toward shareholders for the risk of investing in utility companies. The California Public Utilities Commission is responsible for determining the state’s rates of return, and is proposing to drop this rate by 0.35% each for Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric.
If approved, the profit margins for all three companies would lower and shareholders would see a potential return next year of just under 10%. But critics also say that while the change can save millions of dollars for ratepayers across the state, it would make little difference for individuals.

A new law will end the practice.","Guest Commentary written by

Jon England
Jon England is the education policy analyst at Libertas Institute, a Utah-based free-market think tank.


Gov. Gavin Newsom and I don’t have much in common politically. He’s the Democratic governor of California; I work for a think tank in Utah that supports limited government. Newsom opposes school choice and issued a moratorium on some new charter schools in California. I’m a former public school principal who has become a school choice advocate, and I support alternatives like charter schools.
On one thing, Newsom and I agree — criminalizing chronically absent students and their families is a bad idea. 
The attendance crisis in schools is real. Nearly one in four students nationwide is chronically absent. Absences put pressure on students, who fall behind, and on teachers, who are left to fill the gaps. 
Some lawmakers believe that solving chronic absenteeism, also known as truancy, can be achieved through courtrooms and criminal codes. They say that if parents are threatened with fines or jail, students will start showing up. 
It sounds harsh. It’s also wrong. Punitive truancy laws don’t address the real reasons kids miss school. Instead, these laws turn frustration with a complex problem into a blunt legal hammer.
As a public school principal, I was always concerned about chronic absenteeism. I spent many hours with parents and students trying to understand why school wasn’t working for them. 
Some teachers wanted me to turn to the courts. But legal action never fixed the problem. It was simply a way to hand off a problem schools didn’t feel equipped to solve. The sentiment was understandable. The solution was not.
Truancy isn’t a politically partisan issue. Timmy Truett, a Republican representative in Kentucky, and Kamala Harris, the former Democratic vice president, senator and attorney general from California, both pushed for stricter truancy penalties.
In Kentucky, a 2024 law requiring court referrals for truant students led to a surge of families pulling their children out of public schools to homeschool, rather than face legal consequences.

And in California, Harris’ policy of arresting and charging parents with misdemeanors produced equally troubling results. One California mother was arrested after her daughter, who has sickle-cell anemia, missed school due to hospitalizations.
Harris, while running for president, said she regrets criminalizing truancy in California. And Newsom in early October signed a bill ending California’s policy of punishing parents with a fine or a year in jail for their children’s chronic truancy. 
Truancy laws all share a fatal flaw: they ignore why students are absent in the first place.
Health struggles, bullying, economic hardship, and weak school connections are often the real barriers. Threatening parents does nothing to resolve them. It only deepens the divide between families and schools.
Beneath the statistics lives an uncomfortable truth that few want to say aloud: Public schools do not work well for every student. 
Some face unsafe or hostile environments. Others encounter ideological conflicts or simply feel lost in the system. Families often disengage because their schools aren’t meeting their needs.
There is a better solution. Schools must shift from punishment to prevention. Over the past 15 years, many states have made tremendous strides towards this goal. 
Iowa built a data system to catch absentee patterns early. Georgia required attendance teams and school climate committees. These efforts share one trait — they treat absenteeism as a problem to solve with families, not a crime to prosecute against them.
Schools that intervene early see results by building trust and addressing practical obstacles, such as transportation, bullying, health and engagement issues. These strategies rarely make headlines, but they work. 
Lawmakers should follow these examples. Address safety and climate concerns directly. Help schools build stronger relationships with families. And expand educational options for those who are not thriving in traditional settings.
Attendance improves when families trust their schools, not when they fear them.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/102924_BILINGUAL-RECOVERY_LV_CM_22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-25 08:59:40.667564

It’s the lowest profit margin in 20 years for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but will be hard to notice in your payments.","In summary
California utilities regulators are bringing down “return on equity” payments to power company shareholders. It’s the lowest profit margin in 20 years for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but will be hard to notice in your payments.




With California electric rates stuck at nearly the highest in the nation, the state’s utility regulator is poised to lower the payout shareholders can receive from California’s three large investor-owned power companies. 
In a proposed decision, the California Public Utilities Commission recommended dropping the “return on equity” by 0.35% each for Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. If approved, shareholders of all three companies would see a potential return next year of just under 10%. Such returns for PG&E and Edison haven’t dipped below double digits in at least 20 years.
Utilities said the decline would affect their ability to bring in needed investment for their work. Critics of the decision said that the decline is too small to meaningfully impact ratepayers’ bills, even if it’s a step in the right direction. 
“California and other [public utility commissions] authorize rates of return that are far in excess of the statutory requirement,” said Mark Ellis, former chief economist at Sempra, which owns San Diego Gas & Electric. 
The California Public Utility Commission is expected to vote on the decision in December.
Californians pay the second-highest electric rates in the U.S. after Hawaii, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A number of factors go into those rates, including wildfire mitigation costs. PG&E in particular has attracted the ire of California customers for its frequent rate hikes within the last year.   
Baked into those bills is the return on equity, money meant to compensate shareholders for the risk of doing business. These shareholder return rates are set by each state’s utility regulators and hover nationally around 10%. If approved, PG&E’s rate would be 9.93% (down from 10.28%), Edison would be 9.98% (down from 10.33%), and San Diego Gas & Electric would be 9.88% (down from 10.23%). These rates are not automatically guaranteed – utilities can fall short of this return if they don’t keep down costs, such as project overruns or unexpected lawsuit fees. 
A small change in this rate can be a difference of millions of dollars for ratepayers. The return is a percentage of the rate base, the total value of a utility’s assets it can earn a return on; this includes projects such as building a new power plant, for example. The rate bases for California’s three large investor-owned utilities have steadily grown each year as they add new customers and projects, increasing the amount that shareholders can receive. 
PG&E, for example, had a 10% shareholder return in 2023, a possible return of about $125 million. Had it been 1% lower, the potential return would have been $12.5 million less.
“The proposed cost of capital decision needs refinement to better reflect California’s unique risks and market realities,” said Edison spokesperson Jeff Monford. “Making those refinements in the final decision will enhance SCE’s ability to finance essential infrastructure projects for a more reliable, resilient and ready electric grid.”
PG&E spokesperson Jennifer Robison echoed this sentiment, saying the decision “fails to acknowledge current elevated risks to help attract the needed investment for California’s energy systems.”
Anthony Wagner, spokesperson at San Diego Gas & Electric, said, “A decision that accurately reflects these realities is essential to enabling investments that reduce wildfire risk, strengthen reliability, replace aging infrastructure and advance California’s clean energy transition for the benefit of the communities we serve.” 
Utilities routinely request these rates be pushed higher because they are a key part of what goes into utilities’ credit rating, affecting the interest they pay on loans for infrastructure investments. But in recent years, experts and consumer advocates point to a mismatch – the utility industry is typically considered low-risk, but critics say the shareholder return rates don’t reflect that. Rates for U.S. 10-year treasury bonds, which are considered the benchmark for a risk-free investment, are about half of the national average for approved utility shareholder return rates. And it’s costing utility ratepayers across the country as much as $7 billion annually, according to academics.
Ellis, the former Sempra economist, said there is a way to lower shareholder returns while keeping customer bills in check and maintaining credit ratings that the commission has not yet explored – changing the balance of debt and equity each utility has. 
“You really need to understand credit,” he said. “This is where they’re going to get you.”
The commission is allowed to set the debt-equity balance when it determines shareholder returns, but it left this unchanged for all three utilities in its proposed decision for 2026. Keeping shareholder return rates high as the main means for keeping credit ratings up, Ellis said, unnecessarily burdens ratepayers.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111023_Angelica-Vasquez_MO_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-25 08:59:40.667564

Newsom vetoed bills on virtual power plants, which deliver energy to the grid from such home devices as smart thermostats, solar panels, electric vehicle batteries and heat pumps.","Guest Commentary written by

Ellie Cohen
Ellie Cohen is CEO of The Climate Center, a California-based climate and energy policy nonprofit.


Governor Gavin Newsom stood before global leaders in Brazil recently at COP30, the annual United Nations climate conference, and introduced himself to the world as the new face of U.S. climate ambition. 
The scene raised a question back home in California: Why did Newsom recently veto climate solutions that would have made electricity cleaner and more affordable for Californians?
For decades, California has shown the world that states and regions can drive climate and economic progress, even when national governments lag. 
Now the world’s fourth-largest economy, our state has paired consistent cuts in emissions with sustained economic growth and set a standard for clean car rules that is copied worldwide. It also built the nation’s first economy-wide “Cap and Invest” program, the cap-and-trade energy credit program recently reformed and extended under Newsom’s watch.
Yet as the climate crisis escalates, even that legacy faces scrutiny. While Newsom was preparing for COP30, his administration was delaying or diluting key domestic reforms and quietly expanding in-state oil and gas drilling.In Brazil, Newsom urged fellow Democrats to start framing climate as an affordability issue — of course, it is. This rhetoric earned him praise abroad. 
But Newsom has balked at several recent opportunities to address climate and cost-of-living challenges together. 
Just weeks ago, the governor vetoed three bipartisan bills that would have advanced virtual power plants, which are systems that deliver clean power back to the electrical grid during peak hours by aggregating power from devices many of us already have in our homes — such as smart thermostats, rooftop solar panels, home and electric vehicle batteries and electric heat pumps. 
Managing strain on the grid with virtual power plants helps avoid blackouts, reduces reliance on gas powered plants and saves electricity customers money on their utility bills, including those not participating in a virtual power plant program. 
One recent study predicted virtual power plants could save Californians up to $13.7 billion on electricity over the next five years. That is the kind of climate-forward and affordability-focused policy that California voters and global climate champions want. 
But all three bills were doomed because investor-owned utilities like PG&E continue to work against local-scale electricity solutions like virtual power plants, and they know they can count on Newsom as an ally.
It’s time for Newsom to start treating climate like a winning issue here in California — not just on the international stage in the lead-up to the 2028 presidential race. Investing in solutions like virtual power plants creates jobs, lowers electricity bills and builds resilience to wildfires and floods. 
Californians pay twice the national average for electricity and yet still endure frequent planned blackouts. We want solutions that work, protect our families and save money, and we want our governor to champion them.
Newsom is right to emphasize affordability as a pillar of climate progress, creating further contrast between himself and President Donald Trump. That’s good politics and good policy — but it’s also puzzling when his administration vetoes the most cost-effective clean energy solutions available today.
After his time in Brazil, Newsom needs more than rhetoric to cement his legacy as a true climate champion. In his final months as governor, he should advance policies that combat the climate crisis and economic relief to hardworking Californians. Here are two ways he can show the world how to tackle climate change while lowering the cost of living.
First, knock down state barriers to local, clean, affordable energy. Newsom must stop deferring to corporate utilities like PG&E and mobilize the state to support rooftop solar, virtual power plants and other clean, decentralized electricity solutions. 
Second, eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and make corporate polluters pay for climate disasters. California hands billions to the oil and gas industry while communities bear the costs of extreme weather and fossil fuel pollution. Making polluters pay their fair share would help finance the transition to a cleaner economy, improve public health and take the burden off taxpayers. 
These solutions can be replicated around the world. And, thanks to Newsom’s strong showing in Brazil, the world will be watching.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/021820_Solar-Panels_AW_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-25 08:59:40.667564

In New Mexico, Mexican gray wolves are required to stay within a  designated area, the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area. (Robin Silver/Center for Biological Diversity)The wandering male Mexican gray wolf “Taylor” was spotted west of Albuquerque this week, the third time this particular wolf has traveled outside of the protected zone and north of Interstate 40 since July.
According to the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit conservation organization, Taylor was living on Mount Taylor in the Cibola National Forest before the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish found and relocated him to a protected zone in the Gila National Forest in May. He returned north in mid-July, then was spotted again on Nov. 7 and Nov. 22. The department relocated him to the protected zone after each of his previous trips north of Interstate 40.
Darren Vaughan, spokesperson for the Department of Game and Fish, told Source New Mexico in a written statement that the department “will continue to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding [Taylor’s] movements.” It is unclear at this time whether Taylor will be relocated to the Gila National Forest once again.
New Mexico wolf relocation prompts outcry from advocates

 
Due to federal endangered species regulations, Mexican gray wolves are required to stay within the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, which in New Mexico, encompasses most of the state below I-40.
“Wolves like Taylor can’t read maps, even those with lines drawn by politicians,” Michael Robinson, senior conservation advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “Government officials disregarded science when they drew this arbitrary boundary. Wildlife agencies need to let Taylor roam free. I’ll be celebrating if he finds a female northern wolf to raise pups with who will boost the genetic diversity of Mexican wolves.”
Wildlife advocates have previously criticized the state wildlife department for removing Mexican gray wolves like Taylor from areas they are naturally drawn to. According to a joint news release from conservation and wildlife organizations, Taylor is likely searching for a mate. If he were to reproduce with a northern gray wolf from the southern Colorado area, it would help the species’ genetic diversity, advocates state.
The joint release also notes that scientists have suggested that allowing Mexican wolves to expand into northern New Mexico, southern Colorado and the Grand Canyon region would assist in the recovery of the endangered species.
“Instead of spending the time and money to relocate this amazing lobo again, wildlife officials should take a step back and let him roam — maybe learn from where he wanders,” Chris Smith, wildlife program director for WildEarth Guardians, said in a statement. “Mexican wolves belong in the northern part of our state. Biologists and the wolves themselves seem to agree on that.”

An Indiana judge last week dismissed a lawsuit filed by Elephants R Us, the company seeking to build the quarry, which alleged that local opposition to the quarry amounted to interference and cost the firm money. (Southern Environmental Law Center)An Indiana judge last week threw out a lawsuit filed by an Indiana company against Limestone County residents that alleged their attempts to stop quarry construction in Belle Mina amounted to interference.
Hamilton County Superior Court Judge Michael A. Casati said that Elephants R Us, listed as an Indiana LLC but with a location in Huntsville, could not pursue its lawsuit in Hamilton County, Indiana because the issues surrounding the quarry are all in Alabama.
“Now our clients can breathe a sigh of relief and go back to focusing on the case at hand, which is a nuisance case against the quarry,” said Sarah Stokes, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, representing the defendants, in an interview on Friday.
A message seeking comment was left with attorneys representing Elephants R Us on Monday.
Belle Mina residents have filed a separate lawsuit in Limestone County Circuit Court, alleging explosives used to get limestone from the quarry create noise and dust. It also cites noise from trucks and the equipment that grind the minerals for 11 hours per day, five days a week.
According to the lawsuit filed by the residents, the company plans to harvest 400 tons of limestone from the site, roughly one million tons of sediment each year, for the next 30 years.
Elephants R Us sought $1.6 million from two churches, a farm and pastor, alleging they had interfered with the company’s attempts to secure for the quarry from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
The company said in the lawsuit it applied for the permit in June 2023, but that the agency did not issue a permit granting permission for the quarry until November 2024. It alleged the delay was due to“various published media reports and court actions taken by the defendants,” including social media postings that the company claimed “spread false information” about the project.
“The purpose of the Defendants’ court actions and public comments disseminated through social media through the country against issuance of Stoned’s mining permit were an attempt to intentionally interfere with the Lease and prevent mining on the Leased Premises and thereby harmed an Indiana company,” the lawsuit said.
The company alleged the delays cost the company money.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Nevada lawmakers concluded a week-long special session that saw the demise of a Democratic-sponsored plan to publicly subsidize the film industry and passage of Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s crime bill, but with a Democratic amendment designed to rein in Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
But underlying those and other issues that comprised the session was frustration, anger, and confusion caused by a legislative process where lawmakers and rules sometimes seemed to alternate between capricious and optional.
Rank-and-file lawmakers, lobbyists, and issue advocates repeatedly criticized the chaotic nature of the special session that at times shelved transparency in a swirl of abbreviated timelines, stifled public input, and fewer opportunities for deliberation or review of legislation.
And all for what several legislators characterized as bills that did not warrant a special session.
Assemblymember Jill Dickman (R-Sparks) summed up that sentiment during a hearing when she explained lawmakers were speeding through the film industry subsidy bill during a special session “not because it’s urgent, but because someone wants it rushed.”
Michele Rindels, the president of Nevada Open Government Coalition and co-editor of the Nevada Independent, said the sheer volume of different topics and bills covered during the special session was unusual compared to previous special sessions which were more limited in scope.
“We were surprised by the length of the agenda. There were about 20 different items they were considering and several surprise additional items came on after the fact,” Rindels said. “This had multiple committees going on at the same time, which just makes it hard for anyone to follow, unless you have a large team.”
Transparency shortage
The Nevada Legislature is exempt from open meeting laws, making transparency issues common, but that can be exacerbated during special sessions.
Everyday Nevadans were also cut out of the process when Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas) made the decision not to permit telephonic testimony for Assembly hearings. Two of the most contentious bills during the special session, the film subsidy and crime bills, were both Assembly bills, meaning they were heard in that chamber first. Both bills attracted hours of public comment when they were first introduced during the regular session.
During a committee hearing, Assemblymember Tracy Brown-May (D-Las Vegas) explained the decision was made due to a staffing shortage in the Assembly. It was a major departure from public comment processes established over the last several sessions, a deviation which advocates argued harshly excluded the public’s access and inclusion as lawmakers considered large, and in the case of the film bill, extremely costly policy issues.
The Nevada Assembly Democratic Caucus did not respond to emailed questions about why telephonic testimony was not permitted in Assembly hearings.
Other lawmakers, like Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch (D-Reno), said they weren’t convinced the decision to limit telephonic testimony was due to a staffing shortage. The state Senate, which shares a lot of the same staff as the Assembly, did allow testimony over the phone despite working with similar limitations.
“The fact that the Senate was able to have phones shows that we had that ability. This was a deliberate decision by leadership on the Assembly side to not allow phone testimony,” La Rue Hatch said.
“It was a way to silence some of the dissent that would be coming from the public, and I think there was an attempt to try to slide things through quickly during a special session when people weren’t paying attention,” she said.
Advocates and lawmakers also criticized the lack of accommodation and transparency for Spanish speakers, who were not provided translation services as they typically are during a regular session.
After voting against the crime bill, Assemblymember Cinthia Zermeño Moore (D-Las Vegas) said “directly impacted community members were not able to speak in opposition of this bill because they didn’t have any translation provided to them.” Moore, who sat on the Assembly Committee on Public Safety and Security where the bill was first heard, said she was also frustrated by the time limit for  public testimony.
Advocates echoed those concerns. John Piro, representing Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice, told lawmakers during a hearing on the crime bill that “last session we had hours of opposition, and cutting the phones off has now cut off hours of opposition for this bill.”
“Don’t let the limited amount of working class people that could make it here today be an example of everybody else that opposes this bill,” he continued. 
Situational rules
Disagreements over how the special session was handled by Assembly leadership also extended to the manner and content of legislation leadership decided to introduce. Yeager and Assembly Majority Leader Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) introduced a resolution calling for a study of immigration enforcement operations in the state without consulting the Latino Legislative Caucus, which blasted it as a bill “that’s gonna do nothing.”
Details for nearly all the bills being considered during the special session weren’t available until the day before the session, when Lombardo released his official proclamation, which he announced less than 24 hours before lawmakers were scheduled to convene.
Lack of transparency intensified as the session progressed. In the final days of hearings, committees rarely notified the public of planned action on significant legislation. Instead, agendas were filled with references to “Possible committee Bill Hearings” and “Possible committee Bill introductions.”
“We didn’t see any of the bills before we got to session, which meant as soon as they got introduced, that’s the first time we saw them, and then we would be given an hour or two notice at most that a bill was coming up for a hearing,” La Rue Hatch said.
In the final hours of the special session, Democrats introduced a resolution to enshrine universal mail-in ballots in the Nevada State Constitution.
Also on the final day, a bipartisan supermajority of state lawmakers petitioned to add their own topic to an ongoing special session: a bill that would limit cash-rich corporate investors from bulk buying housing. 
Conflicts between rank-and-file Assembly lawmakers and leadership heightened when Yeager allowed Assemblymembers. Brian Hibbetts (R-Las Vegas) and Heidi Kasama (R-Las Vegas) to vote remotely on the  contentious film subsidy bill. The two Republican lawmakers’ votes were critical to the Assembly’s narrow passage of the bill, 22-20.
The chamber’s procedural rules permit remote voting under “exceptional circumstances.” 
On the Assembly floor, Selena Torres-Fossett (D-Las Vegas) questioned whether Hibbetts and Kasama “preparing for vacation” was truly an exceptional circumstance.
Torres-Fossett and others attempted to override Yeager’s decision but failed on a 19- 21 vote. 
La Rue Hatch, who voted to appeal Yeager’s decision, called it hypocritical.
“The fact that we are allowing lawmakers to participate remotely, but not allowing the ordinary public is an unacceptable double standard. You are either letting everybody call in or you’re letting nobody call in, but the fact that we are going to bend the rules when it is convenient for a vote is not appropriate,” she said.
“I think those allowances were made because the speaker wanted the film bill to pass, and he was willing to break the rules of the Assembly to make it happen,” she continued.
‘No sit down conversations’
Several attorneys in Nevada also raised concerns about ramming complex legislation, like the crime bill, through during a shortened special session.
Paloma Guerrero, Deputy Public Defender at Clark County Public Defender’s Office, said they had major concerns about language surrounding social media in the crime bill, but weren’t able to work with the governor’s office on an amendment that addressed their concerns.
“They said that there was an amendment coming. We didn’t see the language until it was presented to the committee. So there’s just been no sit down conversations, which is how any sort of big change in law should be done,” Paloma said. “There was just none of that with the governor’s office bills.”
Tim Robb, the governor’s homeland security adviser, said during an Assembly hearing that “with the timeframes we were working under” during the special session Lombardo’s team was not able to “get this language in front of them through approval processes we have on our end.”
Paloma suggested the legislative failure to consult public defenders analysis of the social media amendment to the bill probably rendered that portion of the legislation vulnerable to a legal challenge.
“The language ended up being worse than what we had first issues with, with the like, the first version of it,” Paloma said. “They just want to push the language through without any sort of input. And that’s just not how the legislative process should work.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC08028-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 07:56:39.564245

The settlement, which must be reviewed by a court, would require RealPage to “cease having its software use competitors’ nonpublic, competitively sensitive information to determine rental prices,” among other mandates.
Abigail Slater, head of the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, cast the agreement as a win for competition and for renters. But RealPage downplayed the settlement’s impact on its business model, saying the deal’s terms “bless the legality of RealPage’s prior and planned product changes”—alluding to the company’s voluntary decision last year to let its customers remove nonpublic data when using the software to calculate recommended rents.
The company emphasized that the settlement does not include any financial penalties or admissions of guilt.
“What a total farce,” Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel for the American Economic Liberties Project, said in response to the DOJ announcement. “This sham settlement violates the first thing we tell every lawmaker: Fixing prices based on public data sets is still price fixing!”
“This is lipstick on a pig and terrible for renters,” Hepner added.
The Justice Department initially sued RealPage last year under the Biden administration, accusing the company of running an “unlawful scheme to decrease competition among landlords in apartment pricing and to monopolize the market for commercial revenue management software that landlords use to price apartments.”
“RealPage contracts with competing landlords who agree to share with RealPage nonpublic, competitively sensitive information about their apartment rental rates and other lease terms to train and run RealPage’s algorithmic pricing software,” the Biden DOJ said. “This software then generates recommendations, including on apartment rental pricing and other terms, for participating landlords based on their and their rivals’ competitively sensitive information.”
The DOJ complaint used RealPage’s own words against it, citing the company’s description of its products as “driving every possible opportunity to increase price.”
NV’s RealPage case may signal step toward reining in private equity rental practices, watchdog says

A White House report released late last year estimated that the kind of algorithmic pricing that RealPage enables cost renters across the US a total of nearly $4 billion in 2023 alone. The report characterized that estimate as conservative.
Basel Musharbash, managing attorney at Antimonopoly Counsel, warned following Monday’s settlement announcement that “far from stopping illegal practices, it gives a green light to algorithmic price-fixing across the economy.”
The states that joined the DOJ lawsuit were not listed on the settlement. (Nevada reached its own settlement with RealPage in September.)
Last week, California, North Carolina, and other states announced a separate settlement with the apartment management giant Greystar, one of the companies that used RealPage software to set rents.
Under the state deal, Greystar agreed to pay $7 million in penalties and stop using RealPage’s software or similar products for pricing.
“Whether it’s through smoke-filled backroom deals or through an algorithm on your computer screen, colluding to drive up prices is illegal,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta. “Families across the country are staring down an affordability crisis. Companies that intentionally fuel this unaffordability by raising prices to line their own pockets can be sure I will use the full force of my office to hold them accountable.”

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale: Vermont’s return to office order hurts working families.","This commentary is by Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast, the Vermont Senate majority leader.


As a mom of a two-and-a-half-year-old and a one-year-old, I’ve learned the universe laughs at your best-laid plans.
When I was pregnant with my first child, Mira, my due date coincided with the last day of session. I imagined triumphantly passing a child care bill on that final day and then being rushed to the hospital.
Instead, my water broke seven weeks early. I spent a month in the hospital, voting remotely and helping pass major housing and labor bills between contractions and rounds of medication.

No one questioned my commitment to Vermont then. And yet now, as state employees prepare to comply with the governor’s return to office order for Dec. 1, caregivers like me — and the many parents and workers who keep Vermont running — are being treated as though flexibility and commitment can’t coexist.
The order was announced weeks ago, but its true impact is only now coming into focus. At the same time that federal cuts and uncertainty are rippling through state budgets and programs, the governor is adding another layer of chaos to the lives of public servants. Families who depend on those workers — to process benefits, issue permits, and answer calls — will feel it first.
This is no small shift. Dec.1 falls squarely between Thanksgiving and Christmas, one of the hardest times of year to find child care or rearrange family schedules. Workers are being told to drive back to leased office spaces the state has not budgeted or prepared for, even as they juggle school closures and rising costs.
The Wall Street Journal recently reported that women’s turnover rates are three times higher than men’s following return-to-office mandates. The gender pay gap, which had finally begun to narrow, is widening again as mothers are pushed to the margins.
Meanwhile, a New York Times podcast (later retitled) actually asked, “Are women ruining the workplace?” It’s a revealing question in this moment of backlash — a time when women’s gains at the ballot box and in the workforce are being met with old, tired attempts to set us back.
This isn’t just a national trend. Here in Vermont, I’ve heard Republican male colleagues joke that “if women weren’t allowed to work, we wouldn’t have a child care problem.” That kind of thinking — casual, nostalgic and wrong — is exactly what this order echoes. It imagines a workplace frozen in time, where workers’ value is measured by their presence, not their performance, and women’s labor is invalidated.
Meanwhile, Vermont’s government is struggling to meet its basic obligations. The Tax Department routinely has no one available to answer calls on Wednesdays because of staffing gaps.
Developers complain it can take months to get a permit turned around from the Agency of Natural Resources, sometimes because one overworked staffer is on vacation. Agencies can’t fill vacancies fast enough to process benefits, issue licenses, or review applications.
How does forcing more commutes and rigid office schedules solve that? Why not focus instead on pay, retention and modern management practices that actually attract talent?
During the pandemic, we proved that a flexible, digital government could serve people more efficiently. To reverse course now — just to prove a political point — is wasteful and self-defeating.
In the Legislature, we see the dedication of state employees firsthand. Our own staff — policy analysts, attorneys, committee assistants — work year-round to keep government running while we float in and out of the Statehouse with the seasons. They show up early, stay late, and adapt around our unpredictable schedules, just as other state employees do for Vermonters in every corner of the state.
To treat them as expendable now, or to frame flexibility as a luxury rather than a proven management tool, is short-sighted and cruel. It sends a message that loyalty and performance don’t matter — only control does.
This would be a bad idea in the best of times. But in this moment — with Washington in disarray, federal funds in limbo and families already bracing for economic uncertainty — it is indefensible. The people of Vermont need their government focused on stability, service and common sense.
I urge the governor to pause the return to office order and give state employees the breathing room they deserve. There is nothing to gain from forcing an arbitrary December 1 deadline that will only deepen vacancies, disrupt services and demoralize workers.
Vermont’s state workforce has been there for us through crisis after crisis — through floods, fires and pandemics. They showed up when it mattered most, often from their kitchen tables and home offices, balancing family life and public duty. We should meet their loyalty with trust, not suspicion.
It may feel like we’re far from the chaos in Washington or the cruelty of national politics, but make no mistake: the backlash against working women and families has reached us, too. Cruelty doesn’t always shout. Sometimes it hides behind the language of “equity,” the timing of the holidays and the assumption that we’ll quietly manage.
Vermont’s strength has always been compassion and common sense. The governor still has time to show both — by pressing pause.

A small group of Alabama clergy gathered to protest, calling on Tuberville and Britt to restore security of SNAP benefits. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)A small group of Alabama clergy gathered in front of the federal courthouse in Montgomery Monday to protest the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and to call on Alabama U.S. Sens. Katie Britt and Tommy Tuberville to restore funding cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. Over 1 million Alabamians were enrolled in Medicaid in 2022, mostly children, the elderly and those with disabilities. 
The protest, part of Repairers of the Breach “Moral Mondays” movement, was organized by clergy and pastors from across the South, and led by Rev. Carolyn Foster of Greater Birmingham Ministries. Foster said the group has tried to schedule meetings with Tuberville and Britt for weeks to discuss policy and to pray with the senators.
“Policy violence is a political decision, a legislative neglect when you vote to hurt your own people,” Foster said.

Messages seeking comment from Britt and Tuberville’s Montgomery and D.C. offices were left Monday afternoon. The Alabama Department of Human Resources says approximately 726,000 Alabamians receive SNAP, which provides funds for low-income households to purchase food. 
The group held a similar protest in September ahead of the federal government shutdown, which lasted 43 days. Pamela Payne-Foster, another organizer and preventative care physician in western Alabama, said that even though the shutdown is over, the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) benefits are still at risk.
“We know that the government is back in session, but the SNAP benefits are still at risk for our people in our state and are taking food out of the mouths of hungry people,” Payne-Foster said. “It’s a shame.”
 The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that 137,000 Alabamians will lose SNAP benefits due to the work requirements added by OBBBA. It requires able-bodied adults without dependents to work 80 hours per month to qualify for food assistance. 
Foster said that, like many churches, Greater Birmingham Ministries has a food assistance program. But, she said, it’s not enough. Michelle Hodges, direct services coordinator at the ministry, said it had to turn away about 70 people at the Oct. 28 distribution, before SNAP benefits were suspended earlier this month.

Ryan Thorpe and Christopher Rufo’s article asserts that al-Shabaab, a terrorist organization based in Somalia, is being funded through the remittances sent by Somali Minnesotans who have defrauded taxpayer-funded programs.
I say this as an American of Somali ancestry who has investigated fraudsters and as someone who has written about it for the Reformer: I can’t prove a negative, but the story, especially in all its sensationalism, appears to be little more than an effort by the right-wing propaganda machine to whip up hatred against Somali Americans. 
Over the past three years, federal prosecutors in Minnesota have charged 78 people in what they have called the largest pandemic relief fraud in the country. The overwhelming majority of the defendants involved in this fraud — named after a nonprofit at the center of the scandal, Feeding Our Future — are from the Somali community but are American citizens. 
Federal prosecutors have seized just a fraction of the money stolen — more than $50 million so far — because fraudsters spent their proceeds on lavish purchases, including real estate abroad. But not in Somalia. 
If federal prosecutors had any inkling that the ill-gotten gains were going to a terrorist organization, don’t you think they’d have brought charges? The U.S. Attorney in Minnesota is no stranger to charging Somalis for ties to al-Shabaab and ISIS. Why on earth would they hold off in this instance?
Those of us who have actually followed the Minnesota fraud cases closely know that time and time again, prosecutors have stated the fraudsters were motivated by greed, not ideology.
That’s why the money that’s gone overseas went to Kenya, which is not surprising to me as someone who has investigated Medicaid fraud cases for the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office. 
Fraudsters invest their proceeds in Kenya because it is profitable and isn’t easy for the U.S. government to retrieve. Kenya, which has a significant Somali population, has a stable and functioning government unlike neighboring Somalia. 
Thorpe and Rufo cite retired Seattle Police Detective Glenn Kerns, who ominously states that Somalis were “routing significant amounts of cash on commercial flights” to Somalia. 
Thorpe and Rufo cite two anonymous sources to imply that the money collected by hawala networks is being sent to al-Shabaab in Somalia. After the story was published, Rufo took to X to write, “Somalis in Minneapolis are stealing billions from Americans taxpayers, loading bags of cash onto commercial flights, and funding terrorism back in Mogadishu.”
These statements are meant to alarm, but the actual situation is that Somalia does not have a formal banking system, and Somalis rely upon hawala networks — a kind of informal banking system developed after the civil war broke out in the 90s — to send money back home. Which they are legally allowed to do: The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control states that individuals “can send remittances to Somalia, as long as the transactions do not involve parties listed on the OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List.” 
The hawala couriers are by law required to report the money they are carrying and its destination. 
Al-Shabaab is a sanctioned entity by the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. In March 2024, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 16 entities and individuals that were known to launder money for al-Shabaab, which was just the latest round of sanctions imposed by the U.S., EU and UN. 
In short: Gathering large amounts of cash and delivering it to al-Shabaab would require avoiding the feds at several steps. 
Al-Shabaab, which formed two decades ago, has myriad ways of generating revenue inside Somalia, and it’s true they are known to tax businesses — including hawala businesses — in the rural areas under their control, but the impression given by both the article and Rufo’s social media posts are a gross distortion. 
Somalis in Minnesota number approximately 87,000, which is a fraction of the millions of Somalis who live in the diaspora, many of whom send money back home. The remittances we send keeps afloat the local economy and is a lifeline to millions in Somalia. 
If you lived in Minnesota in 2018, all this may sound familiar. That’s because a similar claim was made about millions of dollars in cash flying out of MSP to Somalia. That claim, which was reported by Fox9, implied that child care fraud was funding Al-Shabaab. (Bizarrely, Rufo and Thorpe claim “Our investigation reveals, for the first time, that some of this money has been directed to an even more troubling destination: the al-Qaida-linked Islamic terror group Al-Shabaab” even though they cite the same retired Seattle police detective as the Fox9 story from seven years ago.)  
The Office of Legislative Auditor conducted an assessment in 2018 and submitted a report stating:“Despite the serious nature of the allegations, neither (former state Department of Human Services employee Scott) Stillman nor Fox9 presented specific evidence to substantiate the allegation.” 
Again, federal prosecutors never charged anyone with terrorism financing. 
Unfortunately, that reporting by Fox9 in 2018 gave fraudsters cover — it allowed for the dismissal of allegations of fraud as just bad faith, racism and Islamophobia. Feckless Democratic-Farmer-Labor politicians were given license to ignore warnings about fraud in public programs, and the rest is history. 
Rufo’s actual intentions became all too clear hours after the piece ran, when he unleashed a torrent of anti-Somali posts on X, while pleading for the attention of President Donald Trump.
Rufo took to X to write, “Somalis are stealing billions of dollars from American taxpayers and sending cash to terrorists back home. It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to revoke Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for all Somali nationals in the United States. It’s time for them to go home.”
The Somali-Al-Shabaab piece made its way through the right-wing propaganda machine, amplified by Benny Johnson and Matt Walsh. Somali-Americans were described as undesirables, who are a drain on society. 

“Minnesota nice” works within a homogenous, high-trust society. It’s doesn’t work when you import an entire population of Somali welfare pirates.

Hours later, Trump announced he was ending Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota, citing “fraudulent money laundering activity.”

To be clear: The Temporary Protected Status affects about 700 people nationwide. The defendants in Feeding Our Future and Medicaid fraud are nearly all American citizens.

Kennedy Jr. has intensified his attacks on aluminum vaccine components used in many shots to boost the body’s immune response.
Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before seeking public office, claims that aluminum adjuvants are neurotoxic and tied to autism, asthma, autoimmune disease, and food allergies.
But science and medicine advances a different view. Strong recommendations that parents introduce peanut-containing foods to infants early, for instance, have led to a drop in the incidence rate of peanut allergies.
Since taking office, Kennedy has ordered reviews of vaccine ingredients, citing aluminum as a top concern. A discussion of “adjuvants and contaminants” is on the vaccine advisory panel’s draft agenda.
A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage that for years has assured the public vaccines do not cause autism was updated Nov. 19 with new language stating that studies have not definitively ruled out a link between vaccines and autism.
He has also targeted scientists who have published studies showing aluminum adjuvants are safe. In August, Kennedy denounced a large Danish study finding no link between aluminum in vaccines and childhood disease, calling it a “deceitful propaganda stunt” and demanding its retraction. The Annals of Internal Medicine rejected the claim and refused to retract the study.
And, regarding the upcoming advisory panel meeting, HHS spokesperson Emily HIlliard said ACIP “is independently reviewing the full body of evidence on adjuvants and other vaccine components to ensure the highest safety standards.”
The stakes are high because Kennedy’s push to cast doubt on aluminum isn’t just about the ingredient itself. It’s part of a broader strategy to foster uncertainty about vaccine safety and lay the groundwork to challenge the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which drug manufacturers say is essential to ensure a stable market for shots.
But researchers across infectious diseases, immunology, pediatrics, and epidemiology say the data is clear: Aluminum adjuvants are safe.
“Aluminum is the third most common element on the Earth’s surface,” said Paul Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “So we’re all exposed to aluminum all the time. The water that we drink has aluminum in it. The food that we eat has aluminum in it.”
Vaccines add only a tiny amount of aluminum to the body — a combined total of about 8 milligrams — after the schedule of childhood vaccines is complete. Offit said that over the first 18 years of life, people naturally take in about 400 milligrams of aluminum from everyday sources.
“I don’t know why there is so much concern,” said Rajesh Gupta, a former FDA vaccine scientist. “Aluminum gets distributed in the body everywhere. It is ultimately excreted by the kidneys in the urine. So, it is not that aluminum stays in the body.”
How they work
The aluminum in vaccines isn’t foil or metal. It’s a compound of aluminum salts, such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, that help the vaccine work better.
It’s a bit like zinc in cold tablets: Patients don’t swallow chunks of metal, instead ingesting a zinc salt that dissolves safely in the body.
In vaccines, these aluminum salts give the immune system an extra nudge so it learns to recognize the target germ more effectively.
When injected, the vaccine stays near the injection site and causes mild, short-lived inflammation that summons immune cells. Those cells pick up the vaccine antigen, a harmless piece of a virus or bacterium, and carry it to nearby lymph nodes. There, the adjuvants show it around like a wanted poster so the body can identify and destroy the germ quickly.
Harm HogenEsch, a professor of immunopathology at the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine, said that aluminum adjuvants work only when they’re injected in the same spot as the vaccine ingredient they’re meant to boost, to help nearby immune cells learn to recognize the germ. If the two shots are given in different places, he said, “you don’t see that effect.”
In response to Kennedy’s claims, scientists say that anything that acts as an adjuvant can, in principle, also boost an allergic response. But that doesn’t mean aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines are turning children into food-allergic time bombs. Antigens in vaccines such as the hepatitis B surface antigen or HPV proteins are not allergens, and no food proteins are put into vaccines.
Animal experiments
Animal studies form the basis of Kennedy’s claim that aluminum adjuvants in vaccines can create allergies. In these experiments, scientists deliberately sensitize rats or mice by injecting them with a food protein mixed with aluminum. The aluminum strengthens the immune response, but it does not cause an allergy by itself.
“That’s the basis for a lot of the experimental mouse models, where you inject a food allergen with an aluminum adjuvant to sensitize the mice,” HogenEsch said. “I’m not aware of any food antigen being included in vaccines, and so I don’t really see a way by which this could happen.”
Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine, went further, noting that there is no plausible route for vaccines to create a peanut allergy out of thin air. “Someone would have had to mix peanut proteins in with the actual vaccine prior to injection.”
Stefan H. E. Kaufmann, director emeritus at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, said results from mice often don’t match what happens in people, because “mice are much easier to push into allergic reactions than humans.” In other words, what looks dramatic in a rodent study doesn’t automatically apply to human immune systems.
And in this case, it’s “important to distinguish between how aluminum behaves in lab animals versus people,” Kaufmann said.
Human studies
Beyond animal models and theoretical scenarios, scientists have looked hard for signals of harm in large human datasets.
In 2023, a study by the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration coordinated by the CDC, reported a slight increase in asthma among children with higher aluminum exposure before age 2, but the association disappeared in further analyses.
“That paper was roundly criticized,” Offit said. “When they controlled for breastfeeding, the association between asthma and receipt of aluminum-adjuvant-containing vaccines disappeared.”
“It should have never been published,” he said.
Kathy Edwards, professor emerita of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University, said that false signals are common when large databases are mined for dozens of outcomes.
“When you look at a hundred different things, just by the law of percentages, some of those may look like there is a signal,” she said. “The whole RFK Jr. assessment is really prone to cherry-picking,” she said, adding that “there does need to be some kind of basic understanding of statistics for people to interpret this.”
Soon after the 2023 U.S. findings drew attention, scientists at the CDC contacted Anders Hviid, head of epidemiology research at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark, to see whether his team could replicate the work.
“It makes perfect sense to try to replicate findings of any kind in different data sources,” Hviid said.
Hviid’s nationwide Danish study followed 1.2 million children over two decades, using linked national health registries that record every vaccination and diagnosis.
“Our health care system is quite egalitarian. It’s free, and there’s universal access. And everyone is in these nationwide registers,” he said. Their findings: no increased risk of these conditions associated with increasing amounts of aluminum received through the vaccines.
Rare bumps
Doctors have documented one genuine reaction to aluminum adjuvants: itchy nodules at the injection site, called “pruritic granulomas.” These small bumps are so rare that most allergists and pediatricians will never see a single case.
This reaction “doesn’t lead to something bad, and it really isn’t associated with anything other than that local irritation,” Edwards said.
Researchers believe these bumps represent a localized immune response — meaning only in the area of the injection, not a body-wide allergy — that is very different from the kind of immediate allergic reaction people treat with antihistamines. These include the reactions driven by food or beestings, when histamine, the body’s own alarm signal, floods the system within minutes and causes hives, swelling, or breathing trouble. Kedl said that distinction often gets lost in public debate.
Eliminating aluminum adjuvants
For many experts, the real issue is not just whether aluminum is safe but what happens to the entire vaccine program if aluminum adjuvants are stripped out. For many modern vaccines that rely on a single purified protein — such as those for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, hepatitis B, and HPV — adjuvants are crucial.
Edwards said that simply swapping in a different adjuvant isn’t realistic.
“They’re kind of all built on one another,” she said. Once a vaccine has been proved to work and become the standard of care, new or updated versions are generally no longer tested against a placebo in people who should be getting that vaccine. Instead, they’re tested against the existing product, which means each approval rests on the one before it.
Core childhood vaccines would probably have to be reformulated, and large clinical trials would have to be repeated to prove the new products are safe and effective. Meanwhile, production gaps and shortages would have to be managed, potentially for years, while manufacturers and regulators start over — all while diseases such as whooping cough, hepatitis B, and HPV-related cancers gain more room to spread.
“The aluminum adjuvants have sort of hit the sweet spot in terms of being effective at inducing a robust antibody response that is protective for those vaccines in which they’re being used and being very safe,” HogenEsch said. “It would be quite frankly foolish to try to eliminate them.”
A century of safe use
The DTaP, hepatitis B, and HPV vaccines all contain aluminum adjuvants and have been in use for nearly a century. Large-scale studies show no link between aluminum and systemic allergic disease.
“We have had aluminum adjuvants in vaccines for decades,” Edwards said. “I have grandchildren. My grandchildren have received all of their vaccines. And I do not worry about the safety of them.”
If aluminum is falsely cast as the villain and vaccine uptake falls, experts warn, the consequences will not be theoretical: more measles in schools, more meningitis in college dorms, and more young adults dying of cancers that HPV shots could have prevented.
In their view, the real danger isn’t the trace amounts of a metal that children already encounter every day. It’s rolling back the protection aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines have provided for generations.
That’s the trade-off Offit hopes parents will see. “A choice not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice,” he said. “It’s just a choice to take a different risk.”

It’s just all the oxygen being sucked out of the Capitol by next year’s legislative bugaboo: school choice, or private school vouchers, or “education freedom,” depending on your worldview.
A pattern has firmed up nicely with Mississippi’s Legislature under the current Republican House and Senate leadership. And so far, this pattern has tended to gum up the works and kill off many initiatives at the Capitol. This year, it resulted in the Legislature accidentally passing a flawed, sea-change tax cut bill and ending its regular session without being able to pass a state budget.
The pattern:
House Speaker Jason White and his closest adherents, months out from the coming year’s legislative session, announce their main priorities and get to work with hearings and forums, to set the market when lawmakers gavel in in January. 
And these House priorities always include at least one doozy: Medicaid expansion White’s first year, then eliminating the income tax, and now, school choice. 
Meanwhile Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and his Senate leaders react to the House’s pre-session maneuvering with something along the lines of, “Um … yeah. We’ll take a look at all that. We’re not so sure we want to do that … but, we’ll see, maybe.”
Per the new pattern, Hosemann, usually well after White has announced the House priorities and with much less actual groundwork or public-facing hearings and such, comes out with something of a Senate priorities list.
And as the session nears, White and Hosemann don’t just appear like they’re from different political parties, but from different planes of existence.
Hosemann said he wants to focus on student absenteeism, raising teacher pay and the lack of affordable housing for first-time homebuyers (even though it’s unclear what the state, or state taxpayers, can do about that).
White said he wants an omnibus education reform package to reshape the state’s K-12 education system, with school-choice initiatives to allow public money to be spent on private schooling at the front and center of any plan.
Pender
White, by his own account, said he’s continuing to push “bold and uncomfortable” initiatives.
So far over the last few years, Hosemann has appeared to be the one most uncomfortable with White’s bold initiatives. 
And whatever the opposite of bold is, that’s how the Hosemann Senate priorities and out-of-session strat-e-gery come across. They’ve mostly been playing defense, parrying the House’s thrusts. They’ve been so busy being against what the House comes up with, they’ve had trouble figuring out stuff they’re for.
One longtime senator recently asked jokingly whether White could go ahead and provide the major themes he plans for the next few sessions so they could start fighting early.
The school-choice debate promises to overshadow the entire coming legislative session or, as mentioned above, sap all the oxygen from other issues – health care, infrastructure, you name it. During the 2025 session, the House-Senate standoff over income tax elimination killed much other legislation, including the state budget.
Is school choice the most pressing, clear-and-present issue facing Mississippi? That’s a fair question, but under the new legislative paradigm, it doesn’t matter. It’s the one about to get all the focus.
And it will likely suck up the most oxygen at the Capitol in 2026.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06061413/3X0A2107-copy-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-25 07:56:39.564245

July 18, 2021 | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan AdvanceIn the wake of the 2025 election, where Democrats swept seats from gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, to state legislature special elections in Mississippi, leaders on both sides of the aisle are vying for control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2026. 
For Democrats, two seats in Michigan — the 7th District and the 10th District — could mark chances for big pickups in Michigan. Meanwhile, for Republicans, the 8th District, though it has stayed with the Democrats since 2018, would be the most likely seat for them to flip. 
The midterm elections are expected to be, in many ways, a referendum on President Donald Trump — some saw the 2025 results as a sweeping show of disapproval, and current polling from Reuters shows the same, with his approval rating sitting at 38 percent.

Michigan’s 7th Congressional District is expected to be one of the more competitive House races in 2026 — the seat has flipped in the last two elections, and is seen by many on both sides of the aisle as a key seat to hold for a majority in the House. 
While 2026 will not be a presidential election, the fact of Trump’s influence in this race will be felt.
Meanwhile in the 10th Congressional District, John James’ decision to run for governor and leave his seat open — a decision that was criticized by some in his party, as it leaves a potentially flippable seat without a Republican incumbent. 
He’s the second Michigan representative to leave his House seat for statewide office — Haley Stevens, who represents the 11th District, is leaving to run for Senate. But her seat is expected to be safe for the Democrats, paving the way for a competitive Democratic primary race.
Without James, that would be a major red flag to Republicans about their popularity in the state.

A 64-year-old man in the Buchanan County jail has been waiting […],"In September, an average of 487 Missourians were waiting for a bed in a psychiatric hospital run by the department. The waitlist had grown by a third since September 2024 and almost 88% since September 2023 (Darrin Klimek/Getty Images).A 34-year-old man has been waiting 472 days in the Greene County jail for services and treatment from Missouri’s mental health department that could enable him to stand trial.
A 31-year-old man in the Jackson County jail has been waiting 445 days for treatment.
A 64-year-old man in the Buchanan County jail has been waiting 304 days.
None of these men have been convicted of the crime that landed them behind bars. They’ve been ordered to receive treatment by a court and instead  have languished in jail, part of a backlog of almost 500 people awaiting help from the Missouri Department of Mental Health, according to a federal class action lawsuit filed Monday.
The lawsuit, brought by the MacArthur Justice Center, ArchCity Defenders and the ACLU of Missouri, alleges the department has illegally denied timely evaluations and services to Missourians with mental health and cognitive disabilities who stand accused of crimes.
These individuals were arrested, deemed unable to stand trial and ordered into services designed to allow them to move their cases forward — a process called competency restoration.
“[The department] is knowingly derelict in its duty to these hundreds of Missourians, all of whom suffer while abandoned in county jails, some decompensating beyond restoration,” the lawsuit says.
When a court orders the department to evaluate a defendant, Missouri law requires the department to do so within 60 days. But Missourians “routinely” wait six months or longer to be evaluated, the lawsuit says.
Once the department has ruled someone incompetent to stand trial, Missouri law requires the department to take custody of the individual to receive restoration services in a “reasonable” time. But people who have been assessed to be incompetent spend an average of 14 months in jail before receiving treatment, according to the department.
The department on Monday declined a request from The Independent to comment. In previous statements, a spokeswoman for the department maintained that people on the waitlist are receiving help.
“All individuals on the waitlist receive services providing they are willing to participate,” said Debra Walker, spokesperson for the department, in an October email. 
Missouri’s Department of Mental Health building in Jefferson City (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The department has rolled out initiatives in recent months to help people move toward competency when there are no available beds in state psychiatric hospitals, including jail-based competency programs authorized by a 2023 state law. Since launching last year, 12 people have achieved competency after completing one of four pilot programs in St. Louis city and county, along with Jackson and Clay counties. More than 50 people have participated in these programs.
But the lawsuit argued jail-based services are a “non-solution,” indicating that services focus on coaching detainees “in hope that they will memorize the ‘correct’ answers” to the competency exam.
Amy Malinowski, an attorney from the MacArthur Center representing the plaintiffs, said jail-based treatment is a “contradiction in terms, because jails are not therapeutic environments.”
The lawsuit described a man in the St. Louis County jail who was arrested in May after wandering naked around a St. Louis airport terminal and knocking off a law enforcement officer’s eyeglasses. He lost access to his caseworker, treatment plan and medications when he was detained, the lawsuit states, and “he is not aware of where he is or why he is there.” He is waiting for an evaluation by the department.
People on the competency waitlist are typically housed in isolation. One plaintiff, who has been awaiting services in the St. Louis city jail for 252 days, is locked down in his cell between 23 and 24 hours a day, according to the lawsuit. He had not been allowed a single phone call during the nearly two years of his incarceration. 
“I think [the department] itself will acknowledge that being in a loud, noisy jail by yourself most of the time, for 23 hours a day, without access to medication, without access to a support system, is literally the worst thing you could do,” said Maureen Hanlon, an attorney from ArchCity Defenders who is also representing the plaintiffs.
The 2023 law also permitted outpatient treatment for individuals who could safely be released on bond. 
But the lawsuit describes that option as “grossly underutilized,” saying that only two people had been ordered into community-based restoration as of January.
The department has two small forensic mobile teams of clinicians who provide medication and case management to people on the waitlist, in-person or via telehealth.
The lawsuit quoted a jail operator who described these mobile teams as “a joke.” 
The department has long acknowledged the growing waitlist.
Dr. Jeanette Simmons, deputy director of the department, told The Independent in October that with a static number of state hospital beds and increasing numbers of competency evaluation requests from courts, the increasing backlog isn’t surprising.
“Our numbers have increased,” Simmons said. “We predicted that they would increase.”
In May, Valerie Huhn, the director of the department, warned the Missouri House Health and Mental Health Committee that the state could face litigation due to its competency waitlist.
Malinowski said the attorneys for the plaintiffs plan to call in experts, including former mental health directors from other states, to help forge a path forward.

(Getty Images)New Jersey legislators on Monday took another step toward legalizing psilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound found in some mushrooms that supporters consider a breakthrough therapy bound to transform mental health treatment.
The Assembly health committee’s Democratic majority advanced a bill that would provide therapeutic access to psilocybin for adults over 21, despite some committee members questioning whether state action is needed because the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve the use of synthetic psilocybin late next year.
The committee heard about an hour of testimony in Trenton from the bill’s supporters, who urged legislators to reject psilocybin’s reputation as a recreational drug and consider its promise in treating chronic psychiatric disorders more effectively than existing therapies.
“This bill really is a no-brainer. You should pass it,” said Neal Usatin of New Jersey for Fungi and Plant Medicine. “The clinical evidence in FDA trials is clear that psilocybin is not only safe and non-habit-forming, it treats depression, anxiety, OCD, addiction, and a number of other mental health indications more effectively than current therapies.”
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the drugs now commonly used to treat many mental health disorders, “aren’t doing enough,” said Jesse MacLachlan of Reason for Hope, a national suicide-prevention nonprofit that supports expanding access to psychedelic-assisted therapies.
“We see that in the form of a veteran suicide crisis, where 22 to 40 veterans are lost to either suicide or substance-related deaths every single day,” MacLachlan said. “And that drives our determination to make a change.”
He called psilocybin “the next great breakthrough in psychiatry.”
Stacy and Jeffrey Swanson, a married couple who both served in the military, testified on behalf of Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions. Stacy Swanson told lawmakers that psilocybin healed her husband’s mental health struggles after years of unsuccessful traditional remedies.
“His treatment was not recreational, and it was not a shortcut. It involved medical screening, preparation, supervision, integration before and afterward. Integration is what allowed him to process what he had carried for years. It reached the roots of trauma in a way that traditional treatment could not,” she said.
Since his treatment, the difference “has been steady and real,” she added.
“He sleeps. Our children feel safe. There is no alcohol numbing the pain. Our home is calm instead of reactive. He shows up in a way our family can feel and not just see. The man next to me is the same man I married, but without the constant internal battle,” she said.
The testimony proved persuasive to most of the panel, including Assemblywoman Melinda Kane (D-Camden), whose son Jeremy was a Marine killed in Afghanistan in 2010. She voted for the bill.
“I know that the loss my family has suffered is terrible,” Kane said. “I also know that there are more losses in our country to suicide than there are to combat deaths.”
Others, though, questioned why they should bother passing a bill, given that a drug manufacturer seeking FDA approval of its synthetic psilocybin is now in its third round of trials and anticipates approval in late 2026 or early 2027.
Assemblywoman Nancy Munoz (R-Middlesex) is a nurse and the Assembly’s minority budget officer. She pointed to $6 million in state funding the bill would allocate to carry out its provisions and abstained from the vote over her concerns for a “budget that is really tough.” The record-high $58.8 billion budget lawmakers approved in June included some deep and controversial cuts.
Assemblyman John Azzariti Jr. (R-Bergen), a physician anesthesiologist, also abstained, saying he preferred to wait until the FDA acts.
“If you’re making claims, you should have to prove those claims, those medical claims,” Azzariti said. “We should hold psychedelic medicines, psychedelic drugs, to the same standards as other medicines.”
The bill now goes to the Assembly’s appropriations committee for consideration. It has already passed two Senate committees and awaits a vote before both full chambers. Lawmakers have less than two months to act, with the current two-year legislative session set to end in January.

The Missouri National Education Association is challenging the state’s $50 million appropriation to MOScholars, a program overseen by the State Treasurer’s Office that provides scholarships for largely private and parochial schools. The teacher’s union is seeking to bar the treasurer from using any more of the appropriation, of which $38 million has already been spent.
“Defendants ask this court to close one eye, ignore portions of the MOScholar Act and the Missouri Constitution,” Loretta Haggard, the teacher’s union’s attorney, wrote in her pretrial brief. “And render a ruling promoting a policy that they seem to like — public dollars for private school vouchers.”
But the state says the use of state funds doesn’t harm MNEA or its members.
“This is a case about a lawful appropriation that helps millions of Missouri families secure a valuable education for their child,” Assistant Attorney General Peter Donahue told the judge Monday. “It harms no one.”
Donahue asked Cole County Circuit Court Judge Brian Stumpe to dismiss the case at the start of his arguments, citing a lack of standing and a mischaracterization of the MOScholars law.
“(The law) allows for the program to be funded by tax credit donations,” Donahue said. “It does not in any way restrict the funding to tax credits alone.”
The motion was denied. 
Parents intervene in Missouri voucher lawsuit with help from Herzog Foundation leader

Haggard called the law that created MOScholars a “tax-credit statute” — one revolving around tax-deductible donations and devoid of any mention of direct state appropriations.
“The MOScholars act does not ever mention the appropriation of general revenue,” she said. “There is no ambiguity in the MOScholars Act.”
The change from a program solely funded through tax-deductible donations to one that also pulls general revenue has altered its framework, Haggard argued. The treasurer’s office had to create a new dashboard online for parents to see the status of scholarships funded through general revenue, and a new process of invoicing started in August.
The process is not in state law or in the existing agreements with EAOs, she said. The change is “not written anywhere” apart from an emergency rule the state treasurer filed in July.
The rule adds a provision stating the “treasurer shall provide the certified (educational assistance organizations) the anticipated budget authority for the program year.”
Previously, the organizations reported their anticipated donations to the treasurer. But now, with the bulk of the funding coming from state appropriations, the number of scholarships leans on the will of lawmakers instead of organizations’ fundraising.
Haggard also points to the usage of the Missouri Empowerment Scholarship Accounts Fund, which is described in state law as “for marketing and administrative expenses or the costs incurred in administering the scholarship program, whichever is less.” The treasurer’s fund descriptions on the state website also bear this definition.
That fund now is the vehicle to receive general revenue and then distribute it to schools.
“The MOScholars statute creates no authority for the state to transfer general revenue into the (Missouri Empowerment Scholarship Accounts) Fund for scholarships,” Haggard said.
Donahue argued Monday that the statute lacks clear restrictions on general revenue being used for the program. And where there is ambiguity, case precedent presumes that a law is constitutional, he said.
“All they can point to is silence, simply statutory silence,” Donahue said. “It says nowhere that general revenue cannot be added to the structures of tax credits.”
 Donahue also pointed to another part of the law that specifies “monies in the fund shall be used solely by the state treasurer for the purposes of (this section).”
“(The law) says the fund is for the purpose of the MOScholars program,” Donahue said. “The purpose of the Missouri scholars program is to issue scholarships. Full stop.”
Before Stumpe can consider whether state law authorizes MOScholars to use general revenue, he first must determine whether MNEA and its plaintiffs have standing to challenge the appropriation.
MNEA says it has standing as an association, citing members’ opposition to public funding for private and religious schools. Haggard offered excerpts from the association’s 2025 representative assembly resolution as evidence, which Donahue objected to.
Although the state admitted to the document as true and accurate in pretrial filings, Donahue said it was irrelevant.
Haggard said the exhibit was intended to show that “members care about the issues in this lawsuit.”
“I would hate to get to the end of this case and not have shown that the trial is of interest to MNEA’s members,” she said.
Stumpe denied the exhibit. He is considering whether MNEA President Rebeka McIntosh, who is a plaintiff, can be presented as a witness.
McIntosh and MNEA Regional Director Kimberly Duvall also claim individual and taxpayer standing. The impact on taxpayers should be “assumed,” Haggard said, pointing to case precedent.
“All of the discussion of standing is a red herring,” she said.
Donahue said there was “no evidence of any concrete injury.”
“They lack any kind of standing, whether it be individual, associational or taxpayer standing,” he said.
MNEA concluded its arguments Monday. The case is scheduled to conclude Tuesday.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112425_stumpe1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-25 06:56:16.076590

(Photo by Douglas Sacha/Getty Images)Cigarette consumption in Indiana dropped 40% during the first three months of a long-sought tax increase, according to the Indiana Department of Health. Enrollment in the agency’s smoking cessation program jumped almost 40% over that time.
“[Cigarette] use impacts, really, every aspect of health,” said Miranda Spitznagle, director of IDOH’s Division of Tobacco Prevention and Cessation. But it’s a risk factor that is “fully preventable.”
Using taxes to raise the price of tobacco helps current users quit and may dissuade others from starting, Spitznagle said.
“It’s a huge policy factor for public health,” she added.
Senate, House reach final budget compromise

State legislators stuck a $2-per-pack hike into the two-year budget, House Enrolled Act 1001. They also proportionally increased taxes on electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products.
Spitznagle said that across-the-board approach prevents users from switching products instead of quitting or pulling back.
“This year, Indiana lawmakers stood up to Big Tobacco” by boosting the taxes, said Allie Kast Gregg, government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network.
But public health wasn’t the only motivation.
The Indiana Senate resisted for years, but in the wake of a dismal budget forecast, agreed to include the hikes in the budget’s final draft.
The boost to a nearly $3-a-pack tax on cigarettes went into effect July 1 is already paying off.
Indiana has collected $188 million in cigarette taxes from July through October, according to the State Budget Agency’s latest monthly revenue report. That’s almost three times the $68 million earned over that time period last year.


IDOH used the first three months of data — July, September and October — to calculate a 40% drop in consumption.
Meanwhile, Hoosiers are flocking to the state’s cessation help program, Quit Now Indiana.
“The month of July specifically, we doubled our enrollments,” Spitznagle said, compared to that month last year.
Participation was up 38% over those first three months.
Quit Now Indiana is up to eight times more effective than solo efforts, Spitznagle noted. Going it alone has a single-digit success rate, while the state program has a 32% quit rate.

“What Quit Now Indiana offers is multiple touch points with a trained quit coach who knows how to talk through and make a quit plan … that understands nicotine addiction,” she said.
The program can also provide two weeks of nicotine patches or gum and helps enrollees see if their employers or health plans can offer further medical support.
The American Cancer Society also runs an email-based Empowered to Quit program.
Nearly 15% of adults in Indiana smoke, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from 2023.
Thousands of Hoosier deaths annually are attributable to smoking. An oft-cited CDC estimate from 2014 places the death toll at 11,000 a year.
Spitznagle said that for every one death, however, 30 people live with chronic health conditions linked to their smoking.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Some of Oklahoma’s largest police departments will change their protocols for responding to incidents on interstates amid a push by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol to try to force them to assume more responsibilities. 
Of the departments contacted by Oklahoma Voice, Oklahoma City, Edmond and Norman said their protocols will not change, meaning the Oklahoma Highway Patrol will need to respond to incidents along interstates in their jurisdiction. 
Only the Tulsa and Moore police departments said they have made changes to how they patrol interstates within their jurisdiction. 
A Tulsa police spokesperson said officers will respond to and investigate reports of non-injury collisions, crime, disabled vehicles, road debris and drunken drivers on the 42 miles of interstate in their jurisdiction. 
“If officers arrive and it is an injury collision, they will render aid until Troopers from the Oklahoma Highway Patrol arrive,” said a spokesperson for the Tulsa Police Department in a statement. “We will respond to everything but fatality collisions, injury collisions, and collisions involving large (commercial motor vehicles).”
Moore Police Chief Todd Gibson said in a statement that officers have “proactively” been assisting Highway Patrol with motor vehicle accidents and traffic response with a “comprehensive plan” along the 5.5 miles of Interstate 35 that cuts through city limits.
This plan includes deploying Moore police when the Highway Patrol’s estimated arrival time exceeds 15 minutes, conducting ongoing training focused on highway safety for officers and continuing to provide fire and medical response to accidents, according to a statement.
Oklahoma City Police will render medical aid and handle motorist assists and DUIs if an officer comes across those incidents on the interstates, but will refer all crashes to the Highway Patrol which does not differ from current protocol. Over 100 miles of interstates cross through the city limits. 
Del City and Midwest City police did not respond to a request for comment by deadline.
In July, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol announced plans to move its resources out of the state’s urban areas by Nov. 1 and shift responsibility for the interstates and highways within those jurisdictions to local law enforcement. The agency said it would refocus those on areas with the “greatest need” outside of Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Edmond, Moore, Norman, Midwest City and Del City. The agency said it would prioritize areas covered by smaller law enforcement footprints. 
The plan drew immediate pushback from leaders within those urban areas, and Attorney General Gentner Drummond later found the plan to be illegal. Drummond said the Highway Patrol cannot make “the arbitrary decision to foist its responsibility” onto the municipal and county law enforcement in certain counties, and that state law vests it with the primary authority to patrol interstates.
Over 1.4 million people, or over a third of the state’s population, reside in those seven cities, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Public Safety Commissioner Tim Tipton said the plan was never to “abandon” the metros, but to stretch the Highway Patrol’s coverage in the state. 
He said the Highway Patrol has asked the metros to assist with calls within city limits and has had “great support.” 
“It’s important that we have troopers out 24/7 on the interstate system, hopefully to deter bad driving, speed, dangerous driving behavior, and to be able to respond, especially in those areas where there’s no other law enforcement anywhere around,” he said. “Both here in the Oklahoma City metro area and in the Tulsa metro area, we’ve got great partnerships with those local (police departments) that when they’re available, they help us with those more minor collisions, and they’ve been doing that.”
He said sharing the responsibility for responding to calls on the interstates allows his agency to “stretch” their coverage.

Alex Dallman speaks at a press conference in June  that was livestreamed by WisconsinEye. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)WisconsinEye — the independent, nonprofit service that provides coverage of Wisconsin state government similar to C-Span — is set to halt its coverage on Dec. 15 without sufficient funding and is turning to lawmakers as well as donors for help.
The service’s coverage includes livestreams of committee hearings, floor sessions and press conferences. It also has an extensive video archive of more than 30,000 hours of state government proceedings, candidate interviews and other programming. 
“We operate on a shoestring budget, but we exceed our contractual agreement with the Legislature,” WisconsinEye President Jon Henkes said, noting that they are required to cover all floor sessions as well as a certain percentage of committee hearings. “For 18 years, we have far exceeded those expectations and requirements, so we’re doing a remarkable job.”
All of that could stop — live coverage eliminated and the video archive at risk of going offline — if the organization doesn’t raise $887,000, enough to cover its 2026 annual budget, it warns in a popup message on its website. In a November press release, the organization warned of this possibility.
“It’s clear to us that the current funding model is not working. We can continue to knock on doors. We continue to connect with potential donors,” Henkes said. “The fact is by the end of December, we will run out of money — and that is the reason why we sounded the alarm a week ago — if we cannot bridge this gap in the short term.”
Since starting in 2007, WisconsinEye has operated independently with the majority of its funding coming from charitable, nonprofit donations. Henkes said that the organization, similar to other nonprofits, has faced a tough fundraising environment since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
He said there has been “a very palpable donor skittishness” due to economic uncertainty and an increase in competitiveness as nonprofits that were more dormant during the pandemic have reemerged.
“We’re such a small nonprofit, relatively young in the world of philanthropy, we’re never first in line. We’re lucky to be third in line at times,” Henkes said.
“We are not grounded and deeply rooted in a local community meeting basic human needs,” he continued. “We’re not feeding the homeless, we’re not providing shelter, we’re not disaster relief… then we’re also faced with a recent trend, which is record-breaking political fundraising, so donors who are interested in the inputs and outcomes of government are more inclined to give to candidates, campaigns and causes, but yet they put WisconsinEye into that same general bucket of politics, and we’ve got to fight our way through that fog, because that’s not us. We don’t advocate. We’re the neutral ground.”
Henkes said WisconsinEye is continuing to make inquiries and raising $250,000 could get the organization through the first quarter of 2026.
As first reported by WisPolitics, the organization is also looking to the Legislature for assistance. 
The state has provided grant funding on a few occasions, including during the pandemic. In the 2025-27 state budget, Wisconsin lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers extended WisconsinEye’s opportunity to access $10 million in state funds to build a permanent endowment fund until June 2026. 
The state had initially set aside the money in the previous budget, which required WisconsinEye to raise the entire $10 million in order to get the state-funded match. The organization wasn’t able to access the state’s portion because it didn’t meet the full amount.
In the new budget, the organization is able to collect the state portion on a dollar-by-dollar basis that matches WisconsinEye’s own fundraising.
Currently, $250,000 is available with no match requirement. That will cover expenses through Dec. 15.
The organization can receive the other $9.75 million if it raises an equal amount from private sources. Henkes said that those match dollars would not help with current operating costs, however.
“We could raise a half million dollars and the state would match that, but those dollars, by law, then would have to go into an endowment account — could not be spent for operating current budget needs, and could only be used as the income off of that investment is generated,” Henkes said. “Really, in a sense, we are competing against ourselves.” 
However, even still, Henkes says the organization has made “well qualified, well cultivated” donation requests totaling more than $9 million. None of those requests have led to donations.
“We’re trying to raise money for the operating budget. At the same time, we’ve got this wonderful opportunity to raise $10 million to create a $20 million endowment, which would solve the funding need once and for all,” Henkes said. “The priority right now is meeting month-to-month obligations and keeping the lights on, and not losing staff and having to rebuild if we do lose staff, so the pressure is on us right now.”
The organization is turning to Wisconsin lawmakers for some help with addressing its funding gaps by eliminating the match requirement or finding a way to release some of the state funding to support its operating budget.
In a letter to lawmakers, WisconsinEye identified three alternative routes they could take:

Provide annual funding of $1 million dollars per year to fund and maintain WisconsinEye’s live and produced content; 
Provide $1 million per year for each of the next three years, carrying WisconsinEye through the 2027-28 budget cycle; 
 Provide $1 million for 2026 and have the next Legislature consider the 2027-28 WisconsinEye Budget Request. 

Under the third option, the 2027-28 session would not be broadcast until funds are appropriated.
Henkes said he and the rest of WisconsinEye’s management are hopeful that lawmakers will be open to helping. He said there are many champions and supporters of WisconsinEye in the Legislature, including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester), Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg), Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton). He also noted that bipartisan effort led lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers during the budget process to extend the availability of the $10 million. 
“This is not like we’re asking for new money. This money has already been earmarked for WisconsinEye. We’re simply asking for release of those funds, or part of those funds, in a way different from the endowment,” Henkes said. “The best case scenario would be if the Legislature would release a minimum of one year, so $1 million, essentially to carry us forward, and we can focus 100% over the next several months through June, to really hammer down and see if we can’t raise some endowment dollars. We think that’s a very viable option, and we’re hopeful.” 
Henkes said WisconsinEye provides accountability for the state government — providing a view of how decisions are made that affect every citizen and community. He said that is the message the fundraising team is taking to potential donors. 
“There’s this current cry out there right now — and a legitimate cry — to save our democracy, and that is a painting that is being colored by different voices,” Henkes said. “Some of those voices are saying we need election integrity. Those who are eligible to vote should have every opportunity, and we need to guard against those who don’t. We need to guard against gerrymandered legislative districts. We need to tone down the partisan rhetoric and all this negative campaign stuff.” 
WisconsinEye is able to meet those demands, he argued. 
“At the heart of all that is WisconsinEye and providing transparency and access to what really happens,” Henkes said. “What we are is a network where truth takes its rightful place. If you really want to know what happened, without partisan spin, without sensational headlines, then you come to WisconsinEye.”

Idahoans United for Women and Families announced last week that the group has collected more than 50,000 signatures so far — out of the nearly 71,000 signatures needed.
The ballot initiative, a power outlined in Idaho’s constitution, allows voters to propose their own policies that carry the power of law — if approved by a majority vote. 
The group hopes to qualify the initiative, which would end Idaho’s near-total abortion ban and add protections for reproductive rights, for the November 2026 election. 
“Crossing the 50,000 signature threshold is both a celebration and a clear signal that Idahoans want their voices heard,” Idahoans United for Women and Families’ Executive Director Melanie Folwell said in a statement. “Every signature is a reminder that these decisions belong with patients and their doctors, not with politicians.”
On Saturday, the group plans to host its largest signature gathering effort with events at dozens of small businesses across Idaho.

Through operation targeting undocumented truck drivers and local arrests, sheriff estimates 70 people in Laramie County have been placed into ICE custody since October. 
The post Laramie County sheriff’s deputies making more immigration arrests around Wyoming’s largest city appeared first on WyoFile .","Since announcing two months ago that he and 25 of his deputies would participate in federal immigration enforcement, Laramie County Sheriff Brian Kozak has led a crackdown on undocumented people in and around Wyoming’s largest city.
Kozak announced in October that a significant portion of his roughly 170 commissioned officers had received federal training under a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement program that enlists local law enforcement in the search for people illegally in the country. 
This week, through a well-publicized operation targeting undocumented truckers, and through comments he made to WyoFile, Kozak revealed the arrest of as many as 70 undocumented immigrants in his county within the last two months.
On Friday, Kozak announced that alongside agents from ICE and the Wyoming Highway Patrol, which is also contracting with the federal immigration agency, he and his deputies had helped arrest 40 undocumented truck drivers over a three-day sweep last week.
Then on Monday, Kozak told WyoFile those arrests came in addition to around 30 people who, since Oct. 1, have been pulled over by his deputies, found to be undocumented and handed over to ICE.
It’s a notable number of people picked up for deportation out of one Wyoming county — though the truck drivers were not living locally — and likely marks the most concentrated immigration enforcement operations in the state during President Donald Trump’s second administration.
The enforcement is making Laramie County, Wyoming and the country safer, Kozak has maintained. “Most definitely their focus is people who are a danger to the community,” he said of ICE officials. 
But it’s unclear how many of the people detained in Laramie County are the type of hardened criminals both Kozak and Trump administration officials say they’re prioritizing for deportation.
“We were sold that with this doubling down on immigration enforcement they’d be trying to get the worst of the worst off the street,” Janna Farley, a spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union of Wyoming, told WyoFile on Monday. So far, she said, it seemed the sheriff’s department and its enforcement partners were casting a much wider net in a county that’s home to Wyoming’s most populous city.

In a press release touting the trucking enforcement operation, Kozak referred to the 40 drivers arrested as “criminal aliens.” In a video posted to his department’s Facebook account, the sheriff said those drivers were now awaiting deportation. In immigration court proceedings, however, detainees have a range of legal reasons for which they may seek asylum in the country. Kozak also noted that two of the drivers arrested had accumulated serious criminal convictions unrelated to their immigration status, including larceny and aggravated assault. 
In a Monday interview, he added a third person to that list of people with criminal convictions, and said every person detained during the immigration was pulled over on suspicion of one crime or another. 
“We were pulling over for obvious violations,” the sheriff said Monday. He cited broken or missing safety lights and speeding, as well as violations that made trucks less safe on the roadways. There were 45 brake violations found, 16 issues with commercial drivers licenses and 10 violations of English language proficiency rules that the Trump administration has ordered stricter enforcement of, according to a statement issued Monday by the Wyoming Highway Patrol. 
National immigration arrest numbers, including the numbers for Wyoming and Colorado through this past summer, show that the majority of people detained by ICE do not have criminal convictions. 
Though the exact number of stops conducted by the different agencies was hard to pin down because some reporting may have overlapped, Kozak estimated officers conducted more than 190 traffic stops over the three-day operation. Based on that number, the percentage of drivers ICE agents determined to be undocumented was relatively high, Kozak noted, as was the overall number of violations.  
“I was completely surprised by the number of unlicensed, undocumented drivers and unsafe trucks,” he said. “We have a big problem in our country.”

The proportion of violators may have been buoyed by the operation’s focus which, according to Kozak, was on trucks that were traveling roads that commercial drivers would use to avoid the heavily-enforced Interstate 80 corridor.
Wyoming Highway Patrol officials touted the operation slightly differently in its statement, which was headlined: “Three Day Multi-Agency Operation Leads To Multiple Arrests, Commercial Carrier Safety Violations.” WHP officials indicated in the statement that inspections made by their officers had led to 12 immigration arrests.
Kozak’s Facebook video, on the other hand, headlined that Operation Safe Haul “targeted undocumented truck drivers,” resulting in “40 ICE deportations.” Detractors, like Farley with the ACLU, say that’s in keeping with what they describe as mixed messaging throughout Kozak’s enhanced cooperation with ICE. 
In October, when Kozak announced his enrollment in what is commonly referred to as a 287(g) agreement with ICE (named after the federal statute allowing for the arrangement), the sheriff said that “Wyoming does not want to be a sanctuary state for those that ignore our laws.” 
In joining the federal government’s crackdown, and doing so with an unprecedented number of deputized officers for a Wyoming law enforcement agency, Kozak aligned his department with state politicians who have called for increased immigration enforcement by local officers traditionally entrusted to enforce state, rather than federal, law. But at the same time, he emphasized in the 287(g) announcement that his deputies “will not proactively engage in immigration enforcement.” 
He pledged not to engage in racial profiling or overzealous immigration enforcement. 
“We affirmed our pledge to obey and enforce the United States Constitution which prohibits any type of profiling or discrimination based upon race, language, ethnicity or perceived immigration status,” Kozak said during the October announcement.
Kozak also highlighted that he was likely the first commanding officer of a local law enforcement agency to complete the ICE training himself. 
Kozak has been no stranger to the spotlight since first being elected sheriff in 2022, with his department purchasing a Denver billboard in 2024 to suggest Colorado law enforcement would be better off working in more conservative Wyoming. Earlier this year, he hung a flashing “vacancy” sign, in the manner of a roadside motel, above his jailhouse door, an effort, he said at the time, to tout that his jail has plenty of space for alleged lawbreakers, including federal detainees. 
On Monday, Kozak told WyoFile he’s holding to the promises he made when starting the 287(g) program. “We have never gone to someone’s house or place of employment,” seeking someone because of their immigration status, he said. The vast majority of the 30 people he estimated his deputies detained on behalf of ICE were first contacted during a traffic stop on suspicion of a crime, he said.
But those crimes can vary in severity, Kozak noted. His agency is asking for local prosecutors to file criminal charges against someone detained with a felony that implies a public safety threat, like a DUI, he said. But other people are being stopped on suspicion of a traffic violation, like speeding, and they’re being handed over to ICE for deportation proceedings once their immigration status comes into question. 
“We don’t want our local court holding them up,” by adjudicating a Wyoming misdemeanor charge, Kozak said. “We will not charge the local crime and (instead) book them into the immigration process.”
To immigration and civil liberty advocates, Kozak is describing the type of enforcement that has long driven allegations that the 287(g) program invites racial profiling into communities. 
“It really is what we’ve been talking about and what people within the community are afraid of,” Farley said. “We don’t know why someone was being targeted for a traffic violation, and hopefully it wasn’t racially motivated — as in someone seeing a brown person and then ‘oh, it just so happens you see their brake light was out.’” 
In response to questions about the possibility that critics would perceive racial profiling during Operation Safe Haul, Kozak noted that a number of truck drivers cited for safety violations were citizens or otherwise legally in the country. “We stopped any violation and we enforced all laws,” he said.

After years of federal efforts to revive nuclear power, old mines are stirring again in Wyoming, Texas and Arizona, while new ones line up for permitting expedited by a Trump executive order.

BAIROIL—The remote dirt road through dusty fields of sagebrush that John Cash drove along in June seemed to pass little of economic value. But his car was, in fact, rattling towards the top-producing uranium mine in Wyoming. 
In 2022, the Lost Creek Mine became the first of several such sites across the West to restart operations as the U.S. scrambles to reestablish a domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel. 
Cash, the CEO of UR Energy, which operates the Lost Creek Mine, believes more mines will come online in the years ahead.
“This [area] is loaded with uranium,” he said amid the vast, arid expanse of Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin. “I promise you right now, if I drilled a hole right here, we would hit uranium.”

Newly revived mines are also humming in Texas and Arizona, their owners hopeful that a boom in demand lies ahead. Ten uranium mines operate in the country today, up from three in 2021, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Company announcements and public records show dozens of others on standby for reopening or queued up for permitting in Colorado, Utah and New Mexico, with at least four currently fast-tracked for approval under recent executive orders. 
“We’re right at the edge of a good little uranium mining boom,” said Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association. “We’ve been off the playing field for decades on some of this stuff.”
For more than a generation, many of these sites sat dormant, stifled by a cheaper imported supply and modest demand from a stagnant nuclear power sector. However, uranium markets have recently reawakened: Spot prices doubled between 2022 and 2024, driven by global supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tension and lofty expectations for a renaissance of American atomic power. 
Lately, a buzzing landscape of nuclear startups has stirred excitement with announcements of ambitious plans for advanced reactors to power artificial intelligence and other heavy industries across the country. But almost all of these companies are waiting for the U.S. to rebuild a nuclear fuel supply chain before they can even power up their prototype units. 
“Expectations for uranium demand have been growing,” said William Freebairn, an associate editorial director at S&P Global Commodity Insights. “But this kind of demand is slow to show up.”
Investor appetite for uranium started to increase around 2022, he said, “as climate concerns became more prominent.” Uranium is processed and enriched into nuclear fuel that provides abundant energy without carbon emissions, although it poses other significant health and safety risks. 
Presidential administrations since Barack Obama’s have pushed to increase domestic production of uranium fuel to supply the national nuclear sector, but that goal remains years away. President Donald Trump issued a flurry of executive orders this year to streamline permitting, expedite environmental reviews and impose tariffs on imports that compete with American products. 
Despite the recent activity, the U.S. still has a long way to go before it could even come close to meeting its nuclear needs with uranium from domestic mines, Freebairn said. 

Unlike pit mines, which scrape away acres of earth, most modern uranium extraction projects drill hundreds of wells, inject them with solvents and suck up the mineral slurry they create. This method has a much lighter impact on the surface but can contaminate or deplete freshwater aquifers if improperly managed. 
In Wyoming, several hundred wells churn out a modest 28,000 pounds of uranium oxide per month at the Lost Creek mine. The mine is licensed to produce more than 1.2 million pounds of uranium oxide concentrate annually, according to UR Energy, but uranium miners are still waiting for the development of a domestic nuclear supply chain before ramping up production.
Supply chain bottleneck 
For now, American uranium production remains a dribble. Despite recent steep increases, total output in 2024 was less than 2% of the country’s peak production in 1981. The U.S. lacks the infrastructure to transform uranium oxide concentrate, known in the industry as “yellowcake,” into the uranium hexafluoride gas used for enrichment. About 99% of the feedstock consumed by U.S. power plants is imported, and much of that uranium is enriched in Russia, despite the prohibition on importing Russian uranium that then-President Joe Biden signed in May 2024. The ban doesn’t fully go into effect until 2028.
“Uranium mining, uranium processing and uranium enrichment have all largely been offshored because they could do it cheaper,” said Rusty Towell, director of the Nuclear Energy Experimental Testing Laboratory at Abilene Christian University. “That whole supply chain was weakened.”
After uranium is extracted from the formation, it goes through a series of binding and refining processes before it is turned into yellowcake. (Jake Bolster/Inside Climate News)
In the U.S., just one commercial plant converts uranium into the gaseous form required for enrichment and only one commercial plant enriches that gas into nuclear fuel at the scale required to fuel power plants. No facility can produce significant volumes of the higher-grade fuel used by new reactor designs — High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium, or HALEU. That also comes primarily from Russia, though the Department of Energy has posted billions in grant funding for private-sector enrichment projects in the U.S. 
“The U.S. [government] is moving very fast on this,” said James Walker, CEO of a startup called Nano Nuclear Energy and a former nuclear engineer at the U.K. Ministry of Defense. “Now the pressure is on everybody to ramp up as fast as they can.”
A whole cluster of advanced nuclear startups like Nano eagerly awaits the availability of American HALEU to begin testing their reactors, and they’ll purchase the new enrichment facilities’ product as soon as it becomes available, Walker said. 

However, even a booming domestic market for nuclear fuel doesn’t guarantee that American uranium miners will supply the needed raw material. New enrichment projects could continue to import uranium mined overseas — but government policies are making that harder, including with the Biden administration’s ban on imports of Russian uranium.
“We are making investments to build out a secure nuclear fuel supply chain here in the United States,” the announcement of that ban stated.
This year, Trump imposed tariffs on imports from 70 countries, including the top uranium producers: Kazakhstan, Canada and Namibia. 
“As long as we’re keeping that foreign uranium from coming in, then I think there is hope for domestic production,” said Brent Elliott, a geologist with the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas. But if “we can get it cheaper somewhere else, then that will more likely be the case.”
A flurry of new mines
In Wyoming, home to the nation’s richest known uranium deposits, three other companies have recently joined UR Energy in ramping up operations. To the south, in far western Colorado, Canadian firm Anfield Energy announced plans in August to begin exploratory drilling at an abandoned, 2000-acre uranium pit mine.

In Utah, Anfield’s Velvet-Wood project received an expedited environmental review that lasted just two weeks due to a March executive order from the White House. 
“This approval marks a turning point,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a press release at the time. “By streamlining the review process for critical mineral projects like Velvet-Wood, we’re reducing dependence on foreign adversaries.”
The reviews of several mines in western New Mexico were also fast-tracked and are expected to conclude in late 2027. They include the Crownpoint-Church Rock and La Jara Mesa projects by Australian miner Laramide Resources, as well as Energy Fuels’ Roca Honda project in the Cibola National Forest. 
On federal lands, where many of the reopened mines are located, digs for minerals are still governed by the Mining Act of 1872. Originally passed to draw settlers to the West, it declares all mineral deposits “free and open to exploration and purchase.” The law has enabled some mines to open in areas that are culturally important to tribes, critical habitat for vulnerable species or revered for recreational and scenic values, often over local opposition.
Some of the fast-tracked New Mexico mines border the lands of the Acoma and Laguna pueblos. In the nearby Navajo Nation, the new activity has sparked concern. 
The Navajo Nation “continues to be affected — not only from abandoned uranium mines and mill sites — but also from other contaminants,” said Perry Charley, chair of the Diné Uranium Remediation Advisory Commission, at a public meeting in August in Shiprock, New Mexico.
From 1944 to 1986, mining activities left more than 500 abandoned mines and an enormous amount of uranium waste in various regions of Navajo land.

Numerous peer-reviewed studies of the Navajo Nation have shown widespread groundwater contamination by uranium, as well as other elements released by the mining process, including arsenic, vanadium, manganese and lithium.
“Though uranium mining ceased on the Navajo Nation in 1986, the contamination left from these operations still represents a significant danger,” said a study from 2019. 
Recent studies have linked proximity to abandoned uranium mines with increased risks of autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases on the Navajo Nation. Uranium concentrations in urine samples of Navajo women are almost three times higher than the national median and are associated with significantly increased risks of preterm births, according to studies in 2020 and 2023. 
Navajo people’s cancer diagnosis rate is 6.3 times higher for gallbladder cancer, 3.2 times higher for stomach cancer, 1.9 times higher for kidney cancer and 1.8 times higher for liver cancer than white populations in New Mexico and Arizona, according to a 2023 report from the Navajo Epidemiology Center.
On the eastern edge of Navajo land, at the Church Rock site, a dam failure in 1979 released 94 million gallons of waste fluids into the Rio Puerco, the largest radioactive material spill in U.S. history. Church Rock is among the sites currently undergoing expedited environmental review to resume production.
“These communities are still trying to clean up from the last time this happened,” said Amber Reimondo, the energy director at the Grand Canyon Trust, a nonprofit advocating for protection of the Grand Canyon and Colorado Plateau. “For years, tribes have been reassured that the problems of the past are just that — problems of the past — and that now we have environmental laws that are supposedly protecting them.”
At the Navajo reservation’s western edge, uranium production began last year at the Pinyon Plain Mine, nestled among pinyon pine trees in the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni National Monument, less than 20 miles from the Grand Canyon’s south rim in Arizona.

The mine operator, Energy Fuels, began trucking its uranium product through Navajo territory in July 2024, but was forced to stop after the tribal government issued an order banning unauthorized transport of radioactive material. 
“Anyone bringing those substances onto the Nation should undertake that activity with respect and sensitivity to the psychological impact to our people, as well as the trauma of uranium development that our community continues to live with every day,” former Navajo Nation Attorney General Ethel Branch said in a statement at the time. 
Later, the tribal government and Energy Fuels negotiated an agreement to resume transport of uranium from the Pinyon Plain Mine across the Navajo lands. 
“Energy Fuels is pursuing an aggressive plan to quickly increase short-term U.S. uranium supply,” company CEO Mark Chalmers said in a press release this year announcing record production at Pinyon Plain. 
Energy Fuels did not respond to requests for comment. The company has a long list of mines it’s working to bring back online across Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, according to public announcements. 
Groundwater concerns
Permitted in 1986, the 14-acre Pinyon Plain Mine sat dormant for decades, like hundreds of other sites in the country, waiting for uranium prices to rebound. When they did, the U.S. Forest Service cleared it to begin operations for the first time last year, although it last cleared federal environmental review almost 40 years ago. The decision prompted protests from local tribes, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs and Attorney General Kris Mayes.
“We must protect the water supplies,” Mayes said in an August 2024 statement calling for reevaluation of the mine. “The risks are too great to ignore.”
The site contains a single mine shaft extending 1,470 feet down to the uranium deposits, and the company removed millions of gallons of groundwater to access the ore. The mine and others like it pose threats to the region’s network of interconnected aquifers that stretches across the Grand Canyon region, according to research published last year by Karl Karlstrom and Laura Crossey, Emeritus professors of earth science at the University of New Mexico. 
“Energy Fuels doesn’t know how much their mining is contaminating the deep aquifer, and USGS doesn’t know, and we don’t know,” Karlstrom said. “Caution is needed.”

In an interview, both researchers said the Pinyon Plain mining plan assumes that two underlying formations holding water, the upper Coconino aquifer and the lower Redwall-Mauv aquifer, aren’t connected. But ample regional science shows that’s not true, they said; water moves between them. 
The Redwall-Mauv aquifer feeds springs across the region, some of which provide drinking water for the Havasupai Tribe. 
“Current well data are insufficient to rule out a connection between the two aquifers,” wrote the Environmental Protection Agency in a review of the mine following Karlstrom and Crossey’s study. But the agency noted that USGS data from the mine’s well sites show elevated levels of uranium and arsenic contamination, and that it is unclear how or if it will spread.
“The potential for groundwater contamination resulting from operations at the Pinyon Plain Mine site cannot be assessed fully without additional investigations,” the EPA review concluded.
The uranium mining revival has churned up similar concerns in the savannah of South Texas. Encore Energy, based in the Gulf Coast city of Corpus Christi, started production at its Rosita site in November 2023 and its Alta Mesa site in June 2024. In August, it acquired 5,900 more acres adjacent to Alta Mesa, where it plans to begin drilling in October. Another Corpus Christi-based company, Uranium Energy Corp., expects to start mining at its South Texas sites in early 2026. 
One rural groundwater conservation district is fighting the renewal of an old, unused mining permit UEC holds for a site in Goliad County. 
“We are extremely concerned that UEC’s uranium mining activities will lead to groundwater contamination,” said a request for a hearing on the mine permits filed by the district with Texas’ environmental regulator late last year. 
Faultlines and abandoned oil wells connect the mining area to freshwater aquifers, the district claims. Some 30 households, a church and about 400 cattle drink from wells in the area surrounding the mine. Groundwater levels there dropped 15 feet between 2000 and 2022, the district said. 
The Goliad site will use about 130 million gallons per year, according to Art Dohmann, vice president of the Goliad County Groundwater Conservation District. But mining is exempt from groundwater permitting requirements under Texas law, he said. 
“This may cause more wells in the area to go dry,” the district wrote in comments to the state. 
In August, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality voted unanimously to grant the district’s request for a hearing on the permit. UEC did not respond to requests for comment. 
Separate state permits authorize UEC to inject up to 105 million gallons of mining wastewater underground for disposal every year at its Goliad site. UEC has four other projects under development in South Texas. 
The company, which calls itself “America’s largest and fastest growing supplier of uranium,” also owns sites in New Mexico and Wyoming, where its Christensen Ranch mine began production last summer and its Sweetwater Uranium Complex was selected in August for the fast-tracked approval authorized by President Trump’s executive order.

UEC calls Sweetwater “the largest uranium complex in the U.S.” It encompasses 20,000 acres of exploration and mining rights in Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin, and sits only a few miles from UR Energy’s Lost Creek Mine, where Cash, UR Energy’s CEO, was surveying his company’s project.Before UEC can even develop the site, the expedited review is expected to take 18 months, according to a federal permitting tracker.
Drilling uranium 
On a hot morning in June, three men and a 25-foot-tall winch pulled piping from the ground at the Lost Creek mine in Wyoming. They had just completed a new uranium well.
Cash, a trim man with brown hair lightly graying on the sides, inspected a slab of wood containing samples of wet earth taken every five feet down the well. A chunk he scooped up was a deep green, indicating it probably contained uranium.
“For a geologist, it’s like reading a book,” said Cash, who has a master’s degree in geology and geophysics from Missouri University of Science and Technology.
Lost Creek extracts uranium using in-situ recovery — ISR mining — a process pioneered in Wyoming in the 1960s. Over the eons, water carried uranium off the granite mountains surrounding the Great Divide Basin, burying it in the sandstone. Water is now used to draw it back out. The company drills wells patterned like the five sides of dice and then injects a leachate — water, oxygen, CO2 and occasionally soda ash at UR-Energy’s project, according to Cash — into the exterior four shafts. When that stew is pumped back to the surface through the center pipe, it’s full of uranium. 
Wells’ surface impacts bother Cash, he said, looking out over the site. “I wish we could do this with less disturbance.”
But if this were an open-pit mine, a crater would displace the vegetation on the surface and “this would all be gone in perpetuity,” he added. Instead, the company will replant native sagebrush and grasses, Cash said.

Hundreds of wells surrounded the site’s processing facility — a concrete and steel warehouse where employees wearing radiation-monitoring badges oversee chemical processes that turn uranium-filled slurry into yellowcake, the base ingredient of nuclear fuel.
Water that isn’t reused, about 21,600 gallons a day, according to Cash, is treated and disposed of underground.
Lost Creek has detected groundwater contaminated by what the company injects — moving “where it shouldn’t move” — four or five times since 2013, Cash said. If left alone, it could spread to freshwater sources. This is “exceedingly rare,” and each time it has happened, UR Energy has successfully prevented an escape, he said.
Employee and environmental safety are among Cash’s top concerns, but he feels U.S. nuclear regulations often hamper innovation and curb profit margins. He chaffed at the fact that UR Energy was required to install and maintain a full-blown weather station at Lost Creek, and wondered why his company had to take groundwater that was already undrinkable and make it slightly cleaner, but still unpotable, before disposal.
“We need to be protective,” he said. “But we don’t need to be hyper-protective.” 
Cash left Lost Creek for another UR Energy project, which would revive the Shirley Basin mine some 80 miles east at the foot of the Laramie Range. On his way that June day, he passed another potential mine, the Lost Soldier project, a claim he isn’t sure the company will ever develop. 
“There’s a lot more work we need to do,” Cash said.

Ron Richard was a Wyoming author and actor who lived more than eight years after a lung transplant, recalls columnist Kerry Drake.
The post Thanksgiving memories of a talented and funny friend appeared first on WyoFile .","Friends are the folks in our lives who lift our spirits and help keep us sane. And Thanksgiving is one of the best times to be with them.

Opinion

I’ve always looked forward to the holiday because, on most occasions for the past two decades, my wife Corryne and I spent it in the company of Ron Richard and Pat Greiner of Casper, who hosted dinner for several of their friends. They “adopted” us even though we were very close in age.
This year’s dinner will be different, because it’s the first time Ron won’t be there. We all felt lucky to have him for another eight years after he received a lung transplant, but his new lung started to fail and he died on June 5.
I’m sure we’ll make many toasts to Ron, a truly gifted and gentle soul, and share some memories. These are mine, paired with some favorite moments Pat told me about in a recent conversation.
I’ll always remember Ron as an entertainer. We first met the couple at Stage III, Casper’s community theater, where they were always the highlights of any show they were in. Corryne and I felt grateful to be in several casts with them, because they were so funny, talented and dedicated to their craft.


Pat and Ron were friends for 20 years before the relationship turned romantic. Pat recalls it happened when they were rehearsing for “The Owl and the Pussycat.” They kissed so long in one scene that their director literally had to break it up.
“He said, ‘Uh, that’s probably long [pause] — that’s long enough!” Pat recalled, laughing.
Pat said the acting bug bit Ron when he was taking photos at a Casper College theater rehearsal, and was fascinated watching the director coach an actor through a scene who wasn’t getting it. “He thought, ‘I understand that, I could do that,’” Pat said. “He didn’t spend a lot of time doing small roles. Once he jumped in, he was good from the start.”
In 2006, Stage III performed “The Laramie Project,” the story of how the university town coped after the 1998 murder of student Matthew Shepard, who was gay. His death helped galvanize the movement for LGBTQ+ equal rights, and the play has been performed worldwide.
Matthew Shepard had appeared in Stage III plays, and I know that made playing his father, Dennis Shepard, an emotional time for Ron. I didn’t know the young man, but I covered his story and had a small role in the play where I relived a scene reporting about his funeral.
There is a powerful moment in the play where Dennis Shepard addresses one of the killers and tells him about his son. Those of us backstage could look through peepholes, and during all eight shows, my eyes were riveted on Ron. I couldn’t get through the scene without crying. I think it was because I couldn’t cry in court when that speech was made, but watching Ron was a cathartic moment for me. And he was brilliant in the role.
Ron spent his career with Casper’s traffic department, where he was a supervisor until he decided he didn’t like writing evaluations of his friends, so he stepped down to take a different role.
He told Pat after his retirement that he was going to write a fantasy novel. Since he had the story already worked out, he started immediately. After he wrote “Group Six and the River: Of Water and Brimstone,” two more books continued the tale. Ron was nearing the conclusion of the fourth book when he died, but left notes for his wife to finish it.
“I’m glad he did, because he wrapped up the whole series since he knew he couldn’t do any more,” Pat said. “The ending is always the hardest part to come up with.”
Ron had a remarkably clever and wicked sense of humor, which is a great combination. “Like Shakespeare, my writing contains occasional scenes of gory violence, but in a fun, light-hearted kind of way,” Ron wrote in his author’s bio.
Here’s a sample from his first book:
“Tresado plodded down the filthy alley, wondering if the pouring rain would lessen or add to its filthiness. His question was soon answered as the delicately blended mixture of soil, grease, urine, and fish scales that was the road beneath his Eryndi feet embraced the rain water like a long-lost family member. The happy reunion produced a substance as slippery as owl poop on a brass sword pommel.”

Ron and Pat shared reading duties on Audible, which, like the book format, is available on Amazon. Pat had a long career working at KTWO Radio, where she honed her skills, and both of their voices are superb. As much as I like the printed word, it’s my favorite way to enjoy Ron’s work.
Ron and Pat were fans of “Star Trek,” and an entire room in their house is filled with memorabilia, much of it from “Star Trek” conventions they enjoyed.
“On the day of my surgery, they were waiting for the transport guy, the one who pushes the wheelchairs,” Ron told us. “There was a delay and the nurse said, ‘I don’t know what happened to the transporter.’”
Naturally, he quipped, “Get Scotty to fix it.”
Ron was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in 2015 and had a lung transplant at the University of Colorado a year later. He had some infections that caused a few hospital stays, but he remained active until the past year, when he could no longer do some of his favorite things, including making detailed models of various ships and planes. 
We didn’t get to enjoy Pat and Ron’s Thanksgiving feast last year because I suffered a heart attack the day before. Corryne and I drove to Casper a few weeks later and brought one of his favorite meals — bought at a fast-food place, because we burn everything — but it made us long for this year’s celebration. But Ron, who was on oxygen since before the transplant, labored mightily to breathe.
We last saw him over Zoom a short time before his death, when he could no longer have in-person visits due to his deteriorating condition. He was in great spirits and told many funny stories, but near the end, he was so tired he fell asleep.
Pat cooked the turkey every year, and it was always at least 20 pounds and delicious. Ron’s specialty was the gravy.
“It wasn’t just the great food that made Thanksgiving so special; it was being with our friends,” Corryne said. “Ron was always so positive and upbeat, even with all he had to go through.”
Corryne bonded with Ron in her first play over their mutual love of “Mystery Science Theater 3000.” Watching episodes was often an after-dinner treat, along with pumpkin pie.
I’m looking forward to dining again with friends. I’ll always have fond memories of Ron, not just on Thanksgiving. Before we moved to Cheyenne five years ago, Ron built me bookshelves as a going-away present because I admired his so much.
Whenever I go into my office, I remember my friend. I’m looking at his gift right now. Since he left us, it brings a tear to my eye, but a smile always follows.

I have never met anybody who works there. I haven’t donated. I do, however, drive through this scenic prairie landscape on my way to Fort Peck Reservoir. I also get American Prairie’s newsletter and always read news stories about the organization, which gives me enough information to believe American Prairie doesn’t deserve all this political pushback. Instead of buying into this constant criticism, Montanans should be thrilled with everything the organization is doing.
In the latest salvo, Gov. Greg Gianforte and all four members of Montana’s congressional delegation penned a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum asking him to deny previously granted grazing rights to federal land leases acquired by American Prairie and claiming granting these grazing rights “threatens the economic viability of our most important industry.” 
Really? 
In their next breath, these five men would claim private property rights are sacred, and they would never try to keep any private landowner from exercising his/her property rights. Yet, they have no problem denying American Prairie’s legally acquired property rights. The state has also been setting on American Prairie’s approval to graze state lands, which has forced the organization to sue state government. 
American Prairie owns about 600,000 acres of deeded and leased prairie in north central Montana. Most, if not all, of this land was previously closed to public access. Now, it’s open to public hunting, camping and other recreational uses, and it’s free! Where are the hunters in this debate? In a time when lack of public access seriously threatens the sport of hunting, they should be publicly worshiping American Prairie. 
The main reason naysayers have this irrational fear is American Prairie’s plan to restore free-roaming bison herds. Currently, the organization runs about 900 certified brucellosis-free bison on only 46,000 acres. It manages cattle grazing on much of the rest of its holdings, raising 7,000 cattle in partnership with local ranchers. Again, hunters benefit. The organization allows hunters to annually harvest a small number of bison.
Keep in mind, incidentally, that many ranchers raise bison in Montana. Also, several tribes manage free-roaming bison herds on their land. But you don’t see Governor Gianforte or Attorney General Austin Knudsen or any of our senators and representatives bashing these private land owners. Also keep in mind, that American Prairie doesn’t force anybody to sell their land. It pays good money to willing sellers only, no different than any other buyer.
The truth is American Prairie has been an economic boom to an economically depressed section of Montana, providing good-paying jobs and bringing in tourists who otherwise would never come to north central Montana to spend their money at local businesses. Every year, more people flock to north central Montana to experience a rare and unspoiled prairie environment. American Prairie also remodeled a building in downtown Lewistown into a wonderful visitor center. Since American Prairie opened its doors, population has increased and unemployment has decreased in this economically depressed area. 
Clearly, no rancher or business has gone bankrupt because of American Prairie, and many have benefited from the organization’s efforts. And this economic bonanza will only continue to grow as the organization grows.
Nonetheless, a few local ranchers just can’t get over the fact that American Prairie exists, even though the organization doesn’t affect them in any negative way. They put up “Don’t Buffalo Me” and “Save the Cowboy” signs at strategic intersections on the network of unpaved roadways in the area, next to the “Roads Impassable When Wet” signs. Again, really? I’m absolutely positive American Prairie has nothing against cowboys, if we have any left. If we do, they’re probably chasing cows on ATVs.
This senseless paranoia reminds me of the early 1900s when business groups in northwestern Montana opposed the creation of Glacier National Park. A few decades, later, the park became the economic driver of the entire region and photos of the park’s scenery adorned most business websites and brochures.
So, let’s lose the hysteria and welcome American Prairie to our state because now, Montana has something special that no other state has. Decades from now, we will look back and realize the current madness was utterly ridiculous.

(Photos by John Partipilo)With one week until the Dec. 2 special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, the money is pouring in, signaling both parties think the race is competitive. 
Former Tennessee General Services Commission Matt Van Epps, a Republican, was slightly favored by most political rating organizations to defeat state Rep. Aftyn Behn, a Democrat, in the special election to replace retired former U.S. Rep. Mark Green. The district was redrawn in 2022 to include parts of Nashville, Clarksville, and a swath of rural and suburban Tennessee counties with strong GOP leanings. Green won the district in 2022 and 2024 by nearly identical 20-percentage point margins. 
But as President Donald Trump’s approval rating has steadily dropped over the last few months because of the government shutdown, his handling of SNAP benefits and the impacts of tariffs on farmers and consumers, the Democratic Party has sensed an opportunity. 
Political action committees, PACs, tied to Democratic donors have spent almost $1.8 million in the race to help Behn, and Republican-tied PACs have spent $2.3 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings as of Nov. 24. The latest spending in the general election comes after nearly $3 million was mostly to help ensure a Van Epps victory. 
Of the $4.1 million spent so far, more than two-thirds has been spent on negative advertising about Behn and Van Epps. 
For Democrats, the vast majority of their PAC money has been spent by two groups: HMP and Your Community PAC.
The largest individual donors to HMP this year are Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, whose family owns the Hyatt hotel chain, and Reed Hastings, the founder of Netflix. The HMP PAC also received a significant contribution from the House Majority Forward, a campaign arm of U.S. House Democratic leadership. 
Your Community PAC’s money doesn’t link back to an individual donor but to a group called North Fund, whose donors are untraceable. The North Fund, as of 2024, was run by a Washington, D.C. consultant named Jim Gerstein, who has served as a pollster and independent expenditure campaign organizer in support of several Democratic Party candidates. 
For Republicans, MAGA Inc. has spent nearly $1.2 million in the race, with Club for Growth and  Conservatives for American Excellence spending a combined $1 million. 
MAGA Inc. is Trump’s primary PAC, whose largest individual donors this year are Jeff Yass, a billionaire investor who most notably owns a significant stake in Chinese social video company TikTok, and Kelcy Warren, the billionaire owner of Energy Transfer Partners. 
Conservatives for American Excellence spent around $600,000 in the primary to help Van Epps. The organization has received most of its donations from Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, billionaire owners of two hedge funds.
Club For Growth’s main backers are Yass and Virginia James, a long-time conservative donor and supporter of private school vouchers. Club for Growth also funds the School Freedom Fund, which spent around $850,000 to help Van Epps in the primary and spent more than $3.3 million in 2024 to elect a slate of pro-private-school voucher supporters to Tennessee’s state legislature.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/behn-vanepps.jpg,,,2025-11-25 06:56:16.076590

(Justin Paget | Getty Images)An in-patient psychiatric treatment facility for children is closing in Cabell County, decreasing the number of beds the state has available for kids experiencing severe mental health crises. 
Barboursville School has 22 beds for children who have psychiatric disorders and need specialized, 24/7 care. 
“After much consideration, the decision has been made to close Barboursville School,” said Leslie Clagg, director of business development for River Park Hospital, which operates the facility located in Barboursville Park. 
“Our intention to close by Feb. 4, 2026, comes after completing a comprehensive, careful review and evaluation of multiple factors including the environmental impacts of recent flooding and cost required to renovate the aging leased building,” she said on Monday. “River Park Hospital is committed to working with the families/guardians of each current resident to identify and facilitate a smooth transition to another appropriate facility.”
Barboursville School was built in 1986 as an off-site facility for River Park Hospital. The state owns the building.
Universal Health Services, which operates River Park Hospital, is not renewing its lease with the state. 
“The West Virginia Department of Human Services was formally notified in early November by Universal Health Services of its intent to terminate its lease for the property and cease services at that location. DoHS is actively exploring all available options to ensure continuity of care, and the safety and well-being of the children we serve remains our highest priority,” said department spokesperson Angelica Hightower.
DoHS didn’t respond to a question about whether the state had enough available psychiatric treatment patient beds for children in West Virginia. 
Foster care officials have said that West Virginia doesn’t have enough in-state treatment options for kids in need of specialized mental health or behavioral care, leading the state to send hundreds of children out-of-state for help. It has also led to some children living in hotel rooms while in the state’s care.
Del. Evan Worrell
Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, said he is gathering more information, including whether DoHS will continue work with any other providers to move into the building and continue in-patient mental health care for children. 
“I do have concerns,” he said. “I want to make sure that there’s a proper plan for every one of these children to continue to receive the care they need.”
Clagg said the decision to close Barboursville School did “not affect River Park Hospital’s other psychiatric residential treatment programs and acute inpatient programs.”
River Park will continue to offer in-patient psychiatric residential treatment to children at its other location, including a 30-day diagnostic program for children ages 10 to 17. An abuse reactive program, known as Bridge, offers psychiatric treatment for children ages 8 to 12 who have been sexually, physically and emotionally abused and are experiencing challenges stemming from the abuse.
“River Park Hospital remains committed to supporting the behavioral health needs of our community and improving the quality of life for patients through individualized treatment,” Clagg said.

(Photo courtesy of the Texas-Louisiana Canid Project)A new kind of creature is making its home where the prairies of Southwest Louisiana turn into brackish coastal marshes. 
It’s a coyote, kind of, with bigger ears and longer legs that have adapted to live among the tall wetland grasses in Cameron Parish. Believed to be unique to this corner of the Gulf Coast, they have evolved to cope with manmade changes to their environment thanks to their genetic connection to the red wolf, a species declared extinct in the region around 40 years ago.  
Scientists are now working to better understand this new species, both for the sake of scientific discovery and to understand how to best live with them. 


What is a canid?
Canids belong the biological family Canidae, which includes dogs, wolves, coyotes, foxes, dingoes and jackals.


“They’re definitely not a red wolf, but they’re not typical coyotes either,” said Tanner Broussard, a graduate student at McNeese State University and field supervisor for the Texas-Louisiana Canid Project, which has made researching the hybrid its sole focus. His group has joined forces with the Wolf Conservation Center, McNeese and the Canid Project, a separate coyote rehabilitation program in Louisiana. 
Broussard’s days involve riding throughout the farmlands and prairie of Southwest Louisiana on a four-wheeler, setting traps to catch the hybrid coyotes. He’s part of a small team of researchers and students capturing the animals for tagging, bloodwork and measurements to understand their red wolf genetics.

“That’s kind of where our project is, trying to figure out why they’ve been able to retain those genetics and then also assess what exactly these animals are,” Broussard said.  
Joey Hinton is a senior research scientist with the Wolf Conservation Center, based in Salem, New York. His prior research points to strong evidence of red wolf ancestry in the coyotes found along the Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Texas.
“They’re really built for surviving in that coastal marshland complex” where coyotes historically haven’t lived, Hinton said. “They seem to have carved out a unique niche there along the coast.”
Hunting and development led to the disappearance of the red wolf from the southeastern United States in the 19th century. As their numbers dwindled, the need for a large predator emerged as populations of invasive species such as nutria and feral hogs increased. This readily available food supply led coyotes to expand into areas they hadn’t previously occupied. 
As the two species’ paths crossed, red wolves began to breed with coyotes. 
Decades later, their offspring retain a surprisingly high level of red wolf DNA, Broussard said, and it’s this genetic blend that’s helped the hybrid thrive in the coastal marsh. 
Broussard said its progression is similar to the sea wolves of British Columbia, a subspecies of gray wolves that have adapted to a coastal environment with special features like webbed feet to make them better swimmers. 
“We’re kind of seeing a similar thing happen with our coyotes, where they’re becoming like a wetland-adapted coyote, which is largely in part from those mix of genes from the red wolves,” he said. 
The hybrid’s bigger body helps it swim across canals that weave throughout the landscape, a legacy of the fossil fuel and shipping industries. Longer legs let them see over tall wetland grasses as they search for prey. Smaller heads and larger ears allow them to target prey that includes nutria, feral hogs, rabbits.
Researchers say it’s the very nature of Louisiana that helps these wolf-coyote hybrids thrive. 
Hinton and Broussard are exploring the theory that the animals are doing so well in Southwest Louisiana because of its concentration of wildlife refuges along the coast, along with Interstate 10 acting as a manmade boundary to the north.   
“Areas that have the higher red wolf ancestry in their animals are typically areas that there’s a lot less people around, so they’re not getting shot as much or hit by cars,” Broussard said.

In coastal Cameron Parish alone, there are three national wildlife refuges: Cameron Prairie, Lacassine and Sabine.
“Those areas are very isolated. There’s not a lot of human interaction with them because a lot of areas are gated. People can’t get back in there,” Hinton said. 
“It allows them to retain that red wolf ancestry, pass it on for breeding,” he added.
The researchers want to continue studying these new creatures, including their impact on nutria populations. 
“They feed on certain types of small mammals, keep those numbers in check. They consume wild fruit and become dispersers of certain plant species that could be beneficial …” he said.
Hinton hopes the research can be used, in part, to better educate the public on how to live alongside these unique animals.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/24002M-standing-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-11-25 06:56:16.076590

(Photo courtesy of Lindsay Nohl)If you live in a town like Driggs, and an area like the Teton Valley, what possibly could go wrong?
It fits the definition of paradise with its abundance of outdoor recreation. The Teton and Snake River mountain ranges are the backdrop to skiing, hiking and mountain biking. And there are few better places for fly fishing. With a population of just over 1,600, Driggs is as far away as one can get from the rat race of the rapidly growing cities.
But Sara White, executive director of the nonprofit Mental Health Coalition of Teton Valley, sees a darker side. It’s a place where suicides have occurred all-too-often.
The coalition was formed in 2009 after 19 suicides. But White says the need for mental health has not gone away, and the suicide threat remains. 
“Idaho always has been in the top 10 with suicides, and it isn’t just one thing,” she says. “The cost of living is high, housing is hard to find and there are limited resources. And in communities such as this, people don’t think they need help.”
That’s a barrier that White and members of the coalition are trying to break. More than 20 mental health providers, and as many as six free counseling sessions, are available for those who live or work in the Teton Valley or Alta, Wyoming.
A few years ago, Lindsay Nohl needed help in a big way, and she credits the coalition for saving her life. Her story started six years ago while mountain biking. Her foot slipped off a pedal, and she landed squarely on her chin.
Lindsay, who once considered playing professional soccer, thought nothing about the incident. She had taken more than a few spills in her life, but this one was different.
“Within a month, I started experiencing anxiety and suicidal thoughts. It got worse – insomnia, memory loss and inability to concentrate,” she said. “I couldn’t drive, I was unable to work and I had digestive issues.”
That wasn’t the Lindsay Nohl that her friends knew. She’s 47 now, but much younger in terms of athletic skills. She’s a mountain bike coach, works as a strength and conditioning coach at a local gym and recently she landed a part-time job with the coalition. Her personality is upbeat, but during her ordeal she struggled with getting out of bed and showering.
She moved to the Teton Valley full-time in 2020 and connected with a coalition counselor, Jenn Carter, who asked the right question. 
“She asked me about head injuries, and the bike crash kind of flashed before my eyes. Nobody had asked that,” Lindsay said. From there, Lindsay was able to get the treatments, medications and physical therapy she needed, and by June of 2020 she was participating in a bike race.
“It took a full year to get functional, and I still have issues with focus and short-term memory,” she said. “But with the correct diagnosis, I was able to understand what was wrong with me.”
And through her part-time work with the coalition today, she knows she’s not alone in dealing with life’s challenges in the Teton Valley’s version of “paradise.”
“This is a great place to live, but it’s really hard to survive financially. I’m having trouble paying my rent now, and then there are groceries. I can barely make it work right now. At least I can work, drive and cook,” she said.
“In rural Idaho, people will say they don’t need help, but it’s OK to see a therapist,” she said. “It’s not because you are weak, but it’s because you are strong.”
And Lindsay is convinced that people can be even stronger if they take advantage of the counseling sessions and the variety of other activities offered by the coalition – such as school-based counseling, and workshops on a multitude of mental-health topics. The coalition’s website includes information about suicide prevention.
“Not all mountain communities have mental health coalitions, but every mountain community should,” Lindsay says.
She’s lucky to be living in a place that does.

Adrian Smith in the 2026 midterms.
The state’s rural, sprawling 3rd Congressional District includes central and western Nebraska and much of the state’s northeastern and southeastern edges. It’s one of the nation’s most conservative congressional districts by political party registration and voting history.

Cohen’s bid comes after launching an exploratory committee in August. Smith already faces a Republican primary challenger in former U.S. Border Patrol agent David Huebner. Democrat Becky Stille, an agricultural lab tech, is running for the Democratic nomination.  
Cohen, from Lemoyne near Lake McConaughy, said in a statement,  “Nebraskans are fed up with a two-party system that forces us to choose between extremists.” 
Cohen’s campaign website says he supports responsible gun rights, legalizing and regulating marijuana and ensuring that crops can be grown in Nebraska, because the agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable to climate change. He also wants to “require paper ballots in every election,” he wrote on his site, as he doesn’t “fully trust electronic voting machines,” and says he believes in regulated capitalism.

He said voters are “tired of a system that rewards politicians for speaking in sound bites … I won’t sit quietly while those who should represent us destroy agriculture and cut rural healthcare to give tax cuts to billionaires.”
Cohen added he “will represent rural Nebraskans, not party bosses or big donors.”
Smith campaign spokesman Chris Peterson has previously said Smith’s “conservative record reflects the priorities” of the 3rd District.
“Congressman Adrian Smith is a proven and trusted conservative fighting for Nebraskans alongside President Trump to secure the border and stop illegal immigration,” Peterson said. 
Cohen would be another nonpartisan candidate in Nebraska’s 2026 election. Former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn, a registered nonpartisan, is in a competitive race against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts.

About 85% of the children Washington Pediatrics treats are insured under Medicaid. Beaufort is a small, rural, economically disadvantaged county surrounded by others like it. Families travel far, sometimes up 90 minutes, to get to the office in  Beaufort’s county seat, Ainsworth said. 
“There’s nothing else around,” she said. “We’re kind of a catch-all.”
Independent primary care practices like Ainsworth’s are struggling to cope with the state’s 8% rate cuts for the care they provide to people who use Medicaid. Independent practices aren’t owned by large hospital systems that have more sources of income and are likely better able to absorb rate cuts. 
Community Care of North Carolina, an organization that supports independent physicians and their practices, asked a group made up of mostly independent practices how they would respond to the rate cut. More than 60% said they would need to limit the Medicaid patients they see or stop taking on new ones, while 24% said they may need to stop treating Medicaid patients altogether. And 22% — one in five — said they may need to close. 
More doctors closing their doors to Medicaid patients would mean additional hurdles to treatment for rural residents who already tend to travel farther to get to doctors and who are more likely to use Medicaid as their insurance than suburban or urban residents. 
More than 39% of people who use Medicaid live in rural counties, according to a report from the NC Rural Center. Rural residents are about 35% of the state’s population.
According to the Sheps Center for Health Services Research at UNC, about 20 of the state’s 100 counties had no practicing pediatricians last year. 
“These practices in rural areas — after a while, they may not be able to survive if this goes on,” said Gregory K. Griggs, NC Academy of Family Physicians CEO. “And once they’re gone, they’re not opening back up. It’s going to hit our areas of the state that already have access problems the worst, because those are the areas of the state that have higher percentages of Medicaid.”
Ainsworth said she will continue to welcome children who use Medicaid, but will likely cut expenses by “tightening our belt.” That means not replacing staff members who are leaving and ending plans to recruit a new doctor. 
“We’ve always taken Medicaid,” said Ainsworth, a member of the CCNC board of directors.  “I can’t stop taking Medicaid patients. I can’t drop them both financially or ethically. We’ll continue to see new patients. That’s just what we’re going to do.”
The Medicaid program needed to find a way to save $319 million over eight months, said DHHS Secretary Devdutta Sangvai. 
DHHS imposed rate cuts from 3% to 10% for Medicaid services beginning Oct. 1, with Sangvai and Democratic Gov. Josh Stein saying the state legislature did not provide enough money for the Medicaid program to operate until June 30 of next year. 
“There’s no way we did this with the idea that no one is going to get hurt,” Sangvai said. “We need to get this funded so that we can start reprocessing claims, making people whole, and focus on getting people healthy.”
The impact of the cuts differs depending on what services are provided, who is providing them, and where practices are located, Sangvai said. 
There was no way to fine-tune rate cuts based on geography, he said. 
Republican legislative leaders say the reductions are premature, and Medicaid has enough money to last into next year without cutting rates. 
Dr. Mark McNeill, president of the NC Academy of Family Physicians, has met with both Stein and Republican legislative staff since rates were cut. 
“I sincerely think all parties sincerely want to get a solution in some way shape or form,” he said. 
McNeill said he wanted to emphasize in those meetings how lower rates will affect family practices, particularly independent practices.

“We’re already struggling with access to primary care,” he said. “This is just making it so much worse.”
McNeill, whose office is in Asheville, has decided to stop accepting new Medicaid patients until the rate cuts are reversed. Between McNeill and the other doctor in the office, about 15% of the practice’s patients are on Medicaid.  
The state must seek permission from the federal government for the rate cut. DHHS must have the request into the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services by Dec. 31. 
If the funding controversy is resolved, the state must go back to CMS for permission to reverse the cuts. 
McNeill wonders whether there’s a chance that CMS won’t allow the state to restore the rates. The Trump administration has been eager to reduce Medicaid spending. The “Big Beautiful Bill” Act on taxes and spending cuts about $1 trillion from Medicaid over 10 years. 
Sangvai agrees there is a risk CMS will refuse to allow North Carolina to restore its Medicaid rates if funding increases, but he’s confident that won’t happen because the funding issue involves state money.
“I’m optimistic that CMS will allow us to take the corrective action in that second filing,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2235105609-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 06:56:16.076590

(Courtesy of Gomez family)On the night of Oct. 8, a man named Delmar Gomez drove to pick up his younger brother from a mechanic’s shop on Lamar Avenue. He never came home.
On the return trip, law enforcement officers with the Memphis Safe Task Force pulled over his 2011 Toyota Tundra pickup and arrested the brothers on immigration charges.
The Guatemalan brothers — both longtime Memphians — are known in national Pentecostal Christian circles as well-traveled worship singers, performing at churches from New York to Florida.
They were moved from one immigration detention center to another, finally arriving at a lockup in Louisiana, more than 300 miles from Memphis. The younger brother, Eber Gomez, a 30-year-old with no known criminal record, was soon deported, leaving behind a wife and two young children in Memphis.
Delmar Gomez, a 38-year-old husband and father of four U.S. citizen children, is still holding on. Though he had only minor motor vehicle violations on his record, he’s spent more than 40 days in an immigration detention as he heads into a hearing Tuesday that could result in his deportation.
Not only did the Trump administration lock up the brothers, the government published a news release with false information portraying Delmar Gomez as one of 11 “worst of the worst” immigrant criminals in Memphis.
The allegations deeply upset his wife, Sandra Perez.
“I want people to know that all of the charges that they’re accusing him of now are false, that none of that is true,” she told the Institute for Public Service Reporting in a Spanish-language interview. “He’s a person who is very respectful, honest, very hardworking. He is a good person.”
The news release included the false claim that Delmar Gomez had been arrested on an aggravated assault charge. The claim was re-published on at least one local TV station’s website.
In a second version of the news release, the Trump administration published Delmar Gomez’s mug shot and misidentified him as “Miguel Torres, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico arrested for selling synthetic narcotics, vehicle theft, traffic offense and drug possession.” The same caption also appears under another man’s photo.
Delmar Gomez was misidentified as “Miguel Torres” in this Department of Homeland Security news release.
Weeks later, the government has not corrected the misidentification, or explained how it happened, even after a reporter repeatedly asked about it.
The situation reflects broader issues. The Trump administration is conducting a massive immigration crackdown in Memphis and across the country, spending billions of dollars to arrest, detain and deport people, using stories of criminal immigrants as justification for harsh treatment.
The arrest and detention of the Guatemalan singing brothers illustrates the sharp contrast between the administration’s rhetoric — that it’s arresting hard-core criminals — and the reality on the ground in Memphis and across the country: that it’s mostly arresting immigrants with minor criminal records or no criminal record at all.
As of this month, 74% of immigrants in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. Many of those who were convicted committed only minor offenses, such as traffic violations.
Detailed numbers for Memphis are not available. The top state prosecutor in the Memphis area, Steve Mulroy, told The Institute in October that immigration arrests account for about 20% of total task force arrests, and most of the immigrants have no criminal history other than unlawful presence in the United States.
Delmar Gomez’s wife Sandra acknowledges her husband entered the country illegally in January 2005, more than 20 years ago.  He was 17 at the time.
Sandra said Delmar was unable to gain legal immigration status, but has lived a clean life.
Delmar Gomez’s attorney, Skye Austin with advocacy group Latino Memphis, said she is aware of the federal government’s news release that included the false information.
“When I was first made aware of it, my immediate thought was, ‘Do people think that all Hispanics look alike?’ ” Austin said. “Do people think that it is OK to mix up names and faces and histories?”
There is no evidence that Gomez was ever accused of aggravated assault, drug dealing, vehicle theft or any other major crime, she said.
The Institute for Public Service Reporting conducted its own independent records search and was unable to locate any such criminal charges against Delmar Gomez.
Austin said Gomez’s entire criminal history consists of six traffic tickets issued over a period of nearly two decades, from 2006 to this spring. The tickets were for violations such as driving without a license and without insurance — both misdemeanors, and an Atlanta ticket for driving too fast for conditions and a related driving charge. The most recent ticket came this March, when he was cited for following too closely and driving with an expired tag, she said, adding that prosecutors dropped those charges.
“I think that people should view this as unjust and that this is the opposite of the narrative that we’ve seen where criminals are being taken into detention,” she said. “Because my client’s not a criminal. He is an everyday hard worker just trying to provide for his family.”

From work and singing to detention
Delmar Gomez’s wife Sandra spoke in an interview in the kitchen of her family’s East Memphis home, which is decorated with a poster depicting the Ten Commandments.
She said she learned of the arrests when Eber Gomez called her on the way back from the mechanic’s shop, when the two brothers were in Delmar’s truck. Delmar was driving, but Eber blamed himself for what happened, she said, because if hadn’t needed the ride, Delmar wouldn’t have gone on the errand at all.
“He just told me ‘I’m sorry, it’s my fault that they stopped us.’” she said. “And I told him ‘It’s not true.’
He said ‘Yes it is. Listen.’ And I heard them (law enforcement officers) talking in English.”
“‘Now we can’t do anything,’ he told me. That’s all he said.”
Sandra Perez is a stay-at-home mother to four children who range in age from 17 to three. Delmar Gomez is the family’s primary breadwinner and earns money mainly by mowing yards. He has a lineup of about 60 houses, and he and his father typically mow about 30 yards one week, then about 30 more the next, his wife said.
He’s also a lead vocalist for a Christian band called Agrupacion Vision Emanuel, or Vision of Emanuel Group, which has produced studio recordings and professionally edited music videos.
In the band’s music videos, Delmar Gomez stands in front of as many as 15 musicians, singing passionately at scenic locations including Shelby Farms, the Overton Park shell, and near the “Memphis” sign on Mud Island. One of the videos has been watched more than 400,000 times.
His younger brother Eber Gomez has worked as a roofer and sang with a different touring band called Adoradores de Cristo Memphis, which means “Christ Worshipers of Memphis.”
The two bands have traveled as far away as Chicago, Florida, Alabama, New York and Atlanta to perform at weddings, church anniversaries and other Pentecostal church events, family members said.
Delmar Gomez’s band doesn’t treat these performances as a money-making endeavor, his wife said.
“They don’t charge. They go for faith. If the brothers (at the other churches) want, they give them an offering for their expenses, and if they don’t, they cover their own expenses,” his wife said. “They go for love of the work of God.”
Amid a surge of well over 1,000 federal agents and state troopers in Memphis, community groups say law enforcement officers are arresting and detaining immigrants every day here, often in traffic stops.
The Memphis Safe Task Force has released little information about the immigration arrests. In a statement early this month, the task force said it had made 319 immigration arrests in October.
That’s about 17% of about 1,900 total arrests.
As of November 17, the task force arrest total had risen to 2,790 arrests, Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Ryan Guay said in an email to The Institute.
He did not say how many of these were immigration arrests, referring questions to the Department of Homeland Security, which did not respond.
Delmar Gomez was taken to an ICE office near the airport, then an immigration prison in Mason, Tennessee, then a lockup in Alabama, and finally to a big ICE prison in Jena, Louisiana, his wife said.
She said she wants one thing. “That they let him go,” she said through tears. “That he can be with my family and with me, because he’s been a good person. To be together as a family and work on the things of God, that’s been our desire.
“We’re a very decent family, and it’s unfair what they’re accusing him of.”
Mass deportation campaign
The federal government generally has treated unlawful presence in the United States as a civil violation, not a crime. Under prior presidents, including Republican George W. Bush and Democrats such as Barack Obama and Joe Biden, it’s unlikely people like the Guatemalan singers would ever have been detained.
The background: Businesses wanted a low-cost, reliable workforce. Congress didn’t want to increase legal immigration.
The federal government found a solution: quietly tolerate illegal immigration. Consequently, the government usually enforced immigration law only at the border.
But in non-border areas like Memphis, the federal government rarely bothered to expel unauthorized immigrants, unless the immigrants committed crimes. Unauthorized immigrants like Delmar Gomez could live normal lives – working and raising families, but they often had no way to gain legal status.
The Trump administration has thrown out the practice of non-enforcement and is arresting people who have allegedly committed civil immigration violations, but have no other criminal history. It is also arresting some people who have legal immigration papers, and has even arrested and detained U.S. citizens, most of them of Hispanic origin.
The October 20 news release involving Delmar Gomez demonstrates how Trump’s government is also publishing false information about specific immigrants in Memphis and across the nation.
It’s part of a broader pattern by President Trump and his administration of portraying immigrants as dangerous and evil. Trump famously launched his first presidential campaign in 2015 by calling Mexicans “rapists” and claimed in a presidential debate last year that Haitian immigrants in Ohio are eating other people’s cats and dogs.
Today, the administration sometimes labels immigrants as “terrorists” as justification for deporting them.
In high-profile cases, including a big raid on an apartment building in Chicago, nonprofit news outlet ProPublica has found that those claims were frequently false — that the so-called “terrorists” are often ordinary immigrants with no criminal records.
In fact, multiple studies from the Cato Institute, the U.S. Department of Justice and other researchers have concluded that immigrants are less likely than U.S. citizens to commit crimes — even if the immigrants are in the country illegally.
The Institute contacted the White House for comment for this story. Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson responded by criticizing the reporter.
“Violent criminal illegal aliens who murder, rape, and assault innocent American citizens deserve to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. It’s despicable for any so-called journalist to try and compare these monsters with law-abiding immigrants. This is why no one trusts the media.”

News release includes unverifiable claims
Memphis TV station Action News 5, which had originally re-published the government’s false aggravated assault claim about Delmar Gomez, has since broadcast a follow-up story saying there’s no evidence to support it.
Not only does the government’s October 20 news release include false information about Delmar Gomez, it also includes unverifiable information about at least four other men arrested in the Memphis area.
For instance, the news release says a man named Jardi Caal Requena was arrested “for domestic violence and for making a physical threat.” A reporter with The Institute found no criminal records for anyone with this name in local or federal courts.
The news release claims that a man named Simeon Sosa-Camargo had been convicted of “smuggling aliens into the U.S.”
Federal records show that a man with the same name was convicted in Texas for at least three cases of entering and re-entering the U.S. illegally.
But The Institute found no record that he was ever convicted of human smuggling.
The news release says a man named Wilmer Flores Godoy was convicted of “illegal alien in possession of a firearm and arrested for larceny.”  A man named Wilmer Flores was arrested on a felony domestic violence charge in the Memphis area in 2024, and the case was dismissed in October.
But a reporter found no local or federal court records related to gun possession or larceny.
Delmar Gomez is misidentified in the news release as Miguel Torres, a man from Mexico whom the feds accused of drug dealing, vehicle theft, traffic offense and drug possession.
A search for the real Miguel Torres turned up little – the name is common, with hundreds of criminal cases against people with that name in the nationwide federal court system.
But a reporter found no records that matched those allegations for Torres in the Shelby County criminal court system or in federal courts for the western district of Tennessee.
The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to written questions about the Delmar Gomez case and the other men mentioned in the Oct. 20 news release.
Younger brother accepts deportation
The father of the two brothers, Ramiro Gomez, told a reporter he originally had eight children. One of them, Jaime Gomez, was a heavy drinker who was found dead in the Mississippi River several years ago, he said.
By contrast, he said arrested sons Delmar and Eber are clean-living family men. “What I want is for my sons to come back. My grandchildren need them,” he said.
Days after that interview, on Oct. 30, the younger brother, Eber, accepted deportation back to Guatemala, according to an online system that allows people to search immigration court hearings by an identifying number. He arrived back in Guatemala on Saturday, Nov. 8, his father said.
Ramiro Gomez said he had spoken with his son briefly by phone from Guatemala, but he didn’t have a chance to talk with him about why he accepted deportation.
However, the Trump administration has made it extremely difficult for detained immigrants to win release on bond. Instead, detained immigrants are forced to fight their deportation cases from behind bars.
Critics say that by denying bond, the government is using the hardship of imprisonment to grind down immigrants’ will and ability to fight and pressure them to sign paperwork accepting deportation.
Ramiro Gomez said the deportation has caused severe hardship for his son’s wife and their two children. “She’s still at home and paying rent and food for the children.”

Delmar continues to fight deportation
Delmar Gomez remains behind bars in Louisiana. As of today, he’s been locked up for 48 days.
He is scheduled for an individual hearing Tuesday before Immigration Judge Maithe Gonzalez at the lockup in Jena, Louisiana.
Gomez’s attorney Skye Austin will appear via remote link from Memphis and argue for “cancellation of removal” — an immigration judge’s formal ruling that he should not be deported.
Her argument: Delmar Gomez has lived in in the U.S. at least 10 years continuously, and his deportation would harm his four U.S. citizen children. “I also have to prove that he is a person of good moral character and has not been convicted of a crime that would have serious immigration consequences.”
What would she say if an ICE attorney argues that his six traffic tickets for driving without a license, speeding and other violations show bad moral character?
“So, my pushback would be that a number of these traffic violations have been (dropped by prosecutors) or closed, and that my client does everything in his power to pay the fines and make sure that he has nothing pending with the court. He’s not causing any judicial delay or anything of that nature.”
Austin said she’s collected dozens of reference letters to present to the immigration court on her client’s behalf.
“Seven local ministers have written me letters, and that’s on top of again, neighbors, friends, clients of Señor Delmar just wanting to let people know, ‘Hey, this is a good man. I know him personally. I’ve known him for years,’ et cetera, et cetera.”
Most immigrants who go before Judge Gonzalez lose their cases, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.
In 2024 and 2025, the judge decided 148 asylum cases and denied about 87% of them, slightly higher than the denial rate of 78% across judges at the Jena immigration court.

“Mommy, where did Papi go?”
Meanwhile, Delmar Gomez’s children are struggling with his absence.
His oldest child, 17-year-old high school senior Nancy Gomez, said her father had only a limited education in Guatemala and is pushing for her to study.
She’s already been accepted to the University of Memphis.
“He always has given me advice on everything that I do and always has been proud of me and everything that I have done. And then I just want to see him again. I feel really something that has been taken away from me that I want back. Every time he came from work, I would hear his truck coming in, but now I haven’t heard that and I just want to hear it again,” she said.
“When the house is quiet and he comes from work, he fills the environment with his laughter. And he always be talking about his day and asks us about our day, how it was. And I just want to see him back. I just miss him a lot.”
As the adults showed a reporter a family album during a recent visit, the youngest child, three-year-old Betuel, spoke up.
“Mommy, where did Papi go?” he said in Spanish, crying.
His mother picked him up, gave him a hug and kissed him.
“He went to sing, my love,” his mother said.
“He’s working?” the boy said.
“Yes, my love.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s hemp industry has reached an agreement with state agencies, dismissing a lawsuit and enabling some businesses to keep selling Hemp-derived products such as THCA for a short time after new restrictions take effect. 
The Tennessee Healthy Alternatives Association announced it entered an order with the state Agriculture and Revenue Departments allowing businesses with licenses issued before Dec. 31, 2025 to continue using a 2023 regulatory framework until their licenses expire June 30, 2026. Such a move allows stores to keep selling many products that will be banned after a new law takes effect Jan. 1.
Because of the agreement, a pending declaratory judgment against the Agriculture and Revenue departments has been dismissed, the association said in a statement.
Part of the new law adopted by the legislature this year transfers regulatory authority over hemp products and beverages from the state Agriculture Department to the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission.
The new law also bans the hemp derivative, THCA, which converts into delta-9 THC – an illegal substance in Tennessee in greater than trace amounts – when smoked or heated. The synthetic cannabinoid, THCP, is also banned under the law.
Hemp industry attorney Clint Palmer, who testified before lawmakers this year, said about 75% of the market will be considered illegal under the new ban, which includes THCA flower and vapes. The new law will push consumers to synthetic cannabinoids, he said.
“If you ask your typical consumer, they’re gonna say gross,” Palmer said.
Palmer told lawmakers early this year hemp businesses will be forced to shut down despite spending millions of dollars to comply with state regulations.
State Sen. Richard Briggs, a Knoxville Republican, said during a committee meeting that the legislature should withdraw the bill and consider another one allowing recreational marijuana.
“Let’s be perfectly honest. It’ll help the businesses, we’ll have great revenue, and everybody smoking the stuff will be a lot happier,” Briggs said.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hemp-bill004-1024x761.jpg,,,2025-11-25 06:56:16.076590

(Photo by Cory Fontenot/ Courtesy Festival International)Pascal Danae feels right at home in South Louisiana.
Based in France, the Guadeloupean musician sings in Creole. A sousaphone, popular in New Orleans brass bands, covers the low-end in his trio Delgres. And the group got their U.S. market debut in 2016 thanks to Lisa Stafford and Festival International.
“The kind of music we make, that fusion of Creole from the West Indies, the blues, but also all the Caribbean vibes — it resonates in a very special way in Lafayette,”  Danae says.
So, of course, he’s itching to return for Festival International’s 40th anniversary in 2026 — if he can afford it.
It’s getting much more costly to keep Festival International, international. Visa costs for international musicians have soared, as have processing times. And it’s complicating the work of putting together a heavy-hitting lineup befitting a 40th anniversary. The bureaucratic hurdles have made American tours a riskier affair for international artists and a more expensive endeavor for stateside talent buyers like Stafford.
“It’s basically more than double the price of everything,” she says.
The situation has raised the financial pressure on festival’s organizers, who still rely on sponsorships, donations and hundreds of volunteers to produce the sprawling, multi-day takeover of Downtown Lafayette each April.
And it’s also begun to put limits on the kinds of acts Festival can import, with Stafford having an easier time pulling bands from Canada or who are already based in the U.S. In a given year, anywhere from 15 to 20 countries are represented in a Festival lineup.

“Your curation can kind of suffer, because there’s so many bands I want to bring in that I can’t,” says Stafford.
This week, Festival’s volunteer board launched a fundraiser pegged to the expense of international bookings. All told, organizers spend about $300,000 on talent costs, with roughly 30% going to fees associated with international artists, like Danae’s band, hailing from Paris.
Tabbing up visa application fees, legal bills, flights and prepaid taxes, it could cost upwards of $20,000 for Delgres to get here. And that’s before they get paid.
To be sure, importing international talent was never cheap. But it’s getting more difficult to sustain a diverse international roster as entry processes and costs intensify.
In her early days as Festival programming director in the 1990s, Stafford coordinated visa applications herself, trained by a local attorney with immigration experience. The process was more predictable and cheaper. Filing fees were in the neighborhood of $325 per visa then, she recalls. Today, those are up nearly eight-fold.
And as each year’s lineup got bigger, Festival began prioritizing artists with booking agents and referring them to lawyers who specialize in artist visas.
The trend has been years in the making, spanning several presidents and policy platforms.
“Each administration has its own ideas on how and who they want to have enter the country, how much resources they devote to the administrative state,” says Mel Puljic, a booking agent representing international artists.


Premium processing fees, which unlock the expedited timeline necessary to comfortably plan a tour, are now $2,805 for the artist. They were introduced in 2001 at $1,000, and climbed steadily to keep up with inflation until leaping to $2,500 in the first Trump administration, settling at the current price in the Biden era.
For artists and their agents, however, it’s not just about the cost, it’s also processing times that make planning difficult.
Puljic, based in Chicago, says the costs and bureaucratic snares have shifted his representation model. He now almost exclusively works with artists who can obtain three-year O-1 visas designated for people with “extraordinary ability,” instead of the more time-limited P visas often used by traveling artists and musicians.
A lifer in international music, Puljic has booked dozens of acts at Festival International over the years, including fest favs like Las Cafeteras.
Processing times have grown longer and longer — a 30-day federal shutdown didn’t help — raising the threat that a tour could be scuttled by delays at U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services.
Regular processing can take six months or more. Even premium processing, purportedly a 15-day turnaround, can drag on if USCIS asks for more documentation in a request for evidence. Along the way, applicants must show proof of their fame and credibility back home — press clips, videos, testimonials from influential people — and secure the endorsement of U.S. labor representatives (incurring another fee), and that’s just to complete the petition.
Arranging a visa interview can tack on another month once a petition is approved. As of October, USCIS requires that visa-seekers conduct their application interviews at U.S. embassies in their countries of origin, not residence.  That’s easier said than done for groups that may live and work in Europe but hail from Africa.
It’s a winding process, in other words, and one that comes with a lot of risk for artists and their agents.
“If you can’t get an O-1 visa, the chances of me representing you are next to nothing because I could literally be throwing away my money for a visa application,” Puljic says.
Meanwhile, the rumors of arbitrary or politically motivated denial haunts visa-seekers along the way.
Puljic says he’s not had any of his artists inexplicably blocked, but the anxiety is now a common one among artists planning tours in the U.S.
And that’s as demand for world music climbs in the U.S. “There’s a kind of contradictory crosscurrent thing that’s happening,” he says.
The complications before agents like Puljic and buyers like Stafford have set up a taller barrier for emerging international artists looking to get their big break in the U.S. For decades now, Festival International has been an essential springboard for that world.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Danae’s case, connecting with Stafford led to a booking agent and Delgres’ first American tour, including several other festivals.
“That’s how everything started for us in America,” he says.
Festival International is a must-book stop for international artists, a resume-builder that can lead to more stages and notoriety. The scope and pedigree are virtually unmatched — few festivals of its kind attract hundreds of thousands of people.
“People who operate in the space know that there’s a huge opportunity at the end of every April for international music in Louisiana,” says Puljic.
Of course, for artists like Danae, the lure is bigger than career-building. Coming to Festival is about coming to America and jumping into its melting pot.
“The heart of the music we play, part of it is there,” says Danae, “and not addressing that audience would be like walking on one foot or something. It would feel just wrong, you know.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CoryFontenot__4292022_0799-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 05:56:15.932429

Supporters say the approach yields positive outcomes. 
House Bill 144 would require counties to offer diversion to minors facing non-violent felony and misdemeanor charges, unless it’s their third or subsequent offense within three or fewer years. 
Listen to the audio recap:

“Decades of research show us unequivocally that when youth are charged with less serious crimes, they have better outcomes – for public safety and in their lives – when they are diverted from the juvenile justice system,” said sponsor Rep. Rick Krajewski (D-Philadelphia).  
The measure also would prohibit diversion programs from requiring kids to plead guilty or to pay any fees. 
Utah, Washington, Kentucky and South Dakota are among states where standardized requirements for diversion programs have been linked to reduced recidivism and incarceration among children. 
In Pennsylvania, all counties do offer diversion of some kind. And the vast majority of first-time juvenile offenders – more than 80% annually during 2020-24 – in Pennsylvania end up being diverted before their cases are fully adjudicated, according to the state’s Juvenile Court Judges Commission report from 2024.
But some advocates say programs’ setup and utilization rates vary widely across the commonwealth. 
The range was between 2% (Monroe County) and 69% (York County) of young people diverted before formal charges were filed, according to data in a report released by the state’s Juvenile Justice Task Force in 2021. 
“While we acknowledge that there are many local actors who are implementing diversion programs effectively, it cannot be ignored that a lack of guidance from our state statute means that a youth in Lancaster may not have the same opportunity for a second chance as a young person in Philadelphia or even York,” Krajewski said. “As a state legislator, it is my responsibility to ensure that every child, no matter their zip code or county, is given the same fair shot.”
Juvenile Court Judges Commission (JCJC) Executive Director Robert Tomassini raised concerns about relying on that data, which is from 2018, during an informational hearing about the bill earlier this fall.
The commission’s report from 2024 provides more recent statistics. They’re based on allegations rather than individuals.
However, this metric likewise ranges widely among counties between 35% (Monroe) and 96% (Northumberland), according to Children First PA.
Tomassini didn’t respond to requests for comment; JCJC colleagues deferred to him.
The House Children & Youth Committee passed the bill, 21-5, before recessing for the holidays. 
Rep. Scott Barger, who represents parts of Blair and Huntingdon counties, is among Republicans who voted in favor of the bill. He said he’s experienced diversion’s effectiveness firsthand as a vocational minister working alongside faith-based and secular programs. 
“I’ve seen diversion programs kind of intercept some of these kiddos from being treated as though they’ve got no hope for redemption, and bumping them towards a second chance or a different way of looking at life,”  said Barger, adding he does have some concerns about what expanding diversion would cost local governments. 
Research has documented saving money from using diversion short term because the programs cost less than “formally processing youth” – including potential stays in juvenile detention or residential placement. Studies have shown long-term benefits of diversion, including better public safety outcomes and enhanced life prospects compared to formal justice system processing.

Republicans Kate Klunk (York County), Brenda Pugh (Luzerne), Jamie Walsh (Luzerne), Gary Day (Lehigh) and John Schlegel (Lebanon) voted against it.
The measure echoes some of the recommendations from the Juvenile Justice Task Force. Diversion was among main focus areas for the panel, convened in the wake of revelations of abuse at Glen Mills in Delaware County and other residential facilities. 
Since the task force released a report with recommendations four years ago, two laws have since been enacted that explicitly address issues raised, according to Stefanie Arbutina, policy director of Children First PA, which tracks related legislation. 
One requires courts to revisit kids’ cases more frequently (every three months instead of every nine). Another standardizes the expungement process, establishing automatic triggers for courts to clean out minors’ records. 
Both stem from legislation sponsored by state Sen. Lisa Baker, a Republican representing all of Wyoming and Susquehanna counties and parts of Wayne and Luzerne counties.

But the big box stores aren’t the only place to find a good bargain. Small Business Saturday, the day after Black Friday, offers shoppers an opportunity to find great quality items at a competitive price and invest in their community.
Small Business Saturday has become a great way to kick off the holiday season. What began 15 years ago as a way to promote local businesses recovering from the Great Recession has blossomed into one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Last year, shoppers spent roughly $22 billion at their local businesses.

The holiday season is a time to celebrate and express gratitude. Here in the Centennial State, small business owners are particularly grateful for how elected officials in Washington, D.C., have stood up for Main Street. Back in July, Congress and President Donald Trump made the 20% Small Business Tax Deduction permanent, averting a major tax hike at the end of the year. This federal tax victory will go a long way in helping our small businesses navigate an uncertain economic environment.
There was less good news coming out of the statehouse, with lawmakers passing more red tape for our job creators to navigate, increasing their litigation risk, and eliminating the sales tax vendor allowance. Unfortunately, during both the regular and special sessions, the General Assembly made it more difficult to be a small business owner in Colorado.
Between rising prices, a tight labor market, and a decline in sales, small businesses across the country are heading into the holiday season with a little less cheer. According to a recent NFIB survey, optimism among small business owners declined in October, as job creators reported reduced sales and profits. And while many small businesses want to hire, filling open positions is becoming nearly impossible.
On Small Business Saturday and every day of the year, shopping small plays a big role in supporting our communities. In Colorado, Main Street businesses are the beating heart of our economy, accounting for more than 99% of businesses in the state and employing nearly half of working Coloradans, according to the Small Business Administration.
When you stop in at your favorite coffee shop, locally owned boutique, or family-run restaurant, your dollars go further. Nearly 68 cents of every dollar spent at a small business stays within the community where it’s spent and creates another 50 cents in local business activity.
Small businesses’ investment in the community goes well beyond providing good-paying jobs for our friends and neighbors. Oftentimes, it is small business owners who sponsor little leagues, contribute to school fundraisers, and help keep food pantry shelves stocked.
This holiday season, don’t forget to shop small. Our local businesses keep our communities strong and our economy growing.
When Main Street prospers, we all prosper.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)As we approach the 2026 General Assembly and election season, we have yet another example of Kentucky Republican officials and/or candidates behaving badly.
A few weeks ago, there was Calvin Leach running for state Senate after once writing online that young women are “promiscuous skanks,” “coddled americunts,” “party whores” and “damn sloots” (internet slang for slut).
When asked about this, Leach described his writing as dating advice, saying that diversity, equity and inclusion has gotten out of hand.
Now we have state Rep. TJ Roberts responding to a female citizen’s email with an AI-generated video of himself, superimposed over President Donald Trump, as the president said to a female reporter, “quiet, piggy.” 
Roberts stated that his response fit the tone of the woman’s initial email, writing, “The leftist activist posing as a PR specialist sent me a joke of an email, attacking law and order and our law enforcement community, so I sent a joke of a response.” He also posted the video on social media.
A citizen had questions. In what way was her email a joke? 
Rep. TJ Roberts, R-Burlington, posted an AI-generated video of himself, superimposed over President Donald Trump, as the president said to a female reporter, “quiet, piggy.” (X screenshot)
And yet, Roberts has a history of posting what he seemingly considers “jokes” on social media in which he demeans women. 
I know, because I am one of them.
In summer 2023, Roberts, of Burlington, posted four photos of firearms on Twitter/X and wrote, “Kentucky ‘journalist’ Teri Carter has to be the biggest Karen in Kentucky. Show off your guns and make her mad.” Days earlier he’d posted three photos of firearms with “Make a gun grabbing ‘journalist’ mad. Post black and scary guns.” 
Notably, summer 2023 followed the horrific mass shooting at Old National Bank in Louisville in which a mentally unstable 25-year-old walked into a store, legally purchased a firearm and ammunition, and days later shot five people to death – Thomas Elliott, James Tutt Jr., Juliana Farmer, Joshua Barrick, Deana Eckert – and injured eight. 
A few days after Old National Bank, David Huff and Deaji Goodman were killed and four others injured when someone shot into a crowd in Louisville’s Chickasaw Park. 
Rep. TJ Roberts, R-Burlington, speaks on during a July committee meeting. (LRC Public Information)
I wrote about both incidents, which appeared to trigger Roberts, whom I have never met nor spoken with.
A year later, over Fourth of July weekend 2024, there was a mass shooting at a 21st birthday party in Florence (Northern Kentucky, Boone County) in which four people were shot to death and three were recovering, including a 19-year-old girl. According to news reports, the 21-year-old shooter was on probation with a criminal history that included sexual assault of a 13-year-old.
After I wrote about this incident and mentioned Roberts’ prior social media statements (as listed above), he posted a photo of an AR-15 style gun on Twitter/X and wrote, “Every time a leftist posing as a “journalist” runs a hit piece on me for my total commitment to your constitutional rights, including your right to bear arms, I will buy a new gun and name it after the fake journalist. Meet Teri.”
On July 21 this year, following a church shooting, I emailed Senate President Robert Stivers, President Pro Tempore David Givens, House Speaker David Osborne and Speaker Pro Tempore David Meade, writing in part, “Mr. Roberts posted this (see attached below) on his Twitter/X account just days after the shooting of a state trooper and a shooting in a church. Is there no respect for the community? For survivors? For law enforcement? For the victims?”
I did not receive a response.
Roberts’ post showed a pie chart titled “Reasons I own a gun,” above which he wrote “FAFO” which stands for “f*** around and find out.” 
As a female writer in the internet age, I am used to ignoring internet trolls. But Roberts’ posts display a disturbing pattern of behavior and regular citizens — like the woman who wrote to him of her concerns re: a bill he has proposed for 2026 — deserve better than to be publicly mocked by a state representative saying “quiet, piggy.”
Is this conduct befitting a member of our General Assembly? Of the Republican Party of Kentucky? 
It seems the answer is yes.
Recently Bobbie Coleman, chairperson of the Hardin County Republican Party, made national news after she posted an AI video on the county party’s Facebook page with former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama portrayed as grinning apes. 
Kentucky GOP Chairman Robert J. Benvenuti III called Coleman’s video “vile and reprehensible” and said the party would take “the harshest action available” against those involved. 
That was a month ago. Where is this alleged “harshest action?”
Based on experience, I suggest we not hold our breath.
I do not know what has befallen the Republican Party of Kentucky, nor what has fueled Senate and House leadership’s continuing tolerance of such unprofessional and embarrassing behavior within their ranks. 
What I do know is that it is not work — the work they continually insist citizens do — and that none of it provides Kentuckians with jobs, affordable housing, food, education, medical care or public safety.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)When a group of gun rights advocates piled into House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi’s State House office to rail against a proposed assault-style weapons ban last spring, Shekarchi gave them some advice: Organize. Get involved earlier. Don’t come in at the last minute and complain.
David Levesque took the message to heart.
“If it wasn’t for the Speaker sitting in that conference room six or seven months ago, telling us ‘you need to be organized, you need to do this for the long fight,’ we probably wouldn’t be here now,” Levesque, a Narragansett resident and owner of Brewed Awakenings coffee houses, said in a recent interview.
Levesque got to work. He revived a dormant political action committee started during the pandemic to “fight against all the ridiculous rules and laws.” He made a website, registered the 501(c)4 with the R.I. Department of State, held fundraisers, and started to recruit 2026 state legislative candidates. 
The piece de resistance: a string of 40 political action committees — one statewide and one for every city and town in Rhode Island — allowing The League of RI Businesses to circumvent the $2,000-per-candidate annual campaign donation limit set by state law. 
“With 40 PACs aligned in mission, The League has the capacity to direct up to $1 million annually toward supporting new,  common-sense candidates and challenging extremist incumbents,” the business group boasted in a Nov. 17 press release. 



Taking it to the next level 
It’s a loophole already employed by seasoned political strategists to a much lesser, and less vocal degree. Amica, Bally’s Corp., and the state teachers’ union all have two PACs apiece, according to state campaign finance data. The Providence firefighters union has four PACS. The union representing local and state government and public school workers was the previous chart-topper, with five PACS.
“What the League of RI Businesses is doing is taking it to an extreme,” said Ric Thornton, campaign finance director for the Rhode Island Board of Elections. “It’s unprecedented.”
While not illegal, the move exposes The League and its financial beneficiaries to greater risk of reporting mistakes and violations. A candidate who receives a donation from The League’s Narragansett PAC, for example, would be wrong to report the donor as one of the sister PACs. 
Thornton has already devoted a member of his campaign finance team to track the money flowing in and out of the 40 PACs with the aim of catching potential mistakes quickly. While unusual, he didn’t see the move as a problem.










What the League of RI Businesses is doing is taking it to an extreme. It’s unprecedented.”


– Ric Thornton, campaign finance director for the Rhode Island Board of Elections 


But John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, does. 
“Structuring it this way could allow some very wealthy individuals to have an outsized influence on elections,” Marion said. 
Which is perhaps why federal campaign finance law states that only “nonconnected PACs” can max out annual donations to candidates.
Levesque, The League’s co-founder and manager of all 40 PACs, shrugged off concerns.
“Whether you have one PAC or 40 PACs, as long as you have your own separate bank accounts, which we do, and you abide by the state campaign finance laws as to how much you can share, there’s no problem,” Levesque said.
The municipal committees have yet to start raising or spending money. Most had a $5 or $10 balance, donated by Levesque or the statewide PAC, as of Sept. 30, according to the most recent state campaign finance reports.

Power in numbers 
Levesque promises large sums of money will start flowing fast. Already, the group has raised $60,000 collectively, Levesque said. 
“We’ve made more progress than the Democratic Party and the Republican Party,” Levesque said. 
In the three-month period that ended Sept. 30, the statewide PAC raised nearly $10,000, including $2,000 donations from Providence hedge fund manager Russ Jeffrey; Gary Gosselin, co-owner of Shannon Motors, and Walter Martish, who owns chemical company Lincoln Fine Ingredients. Levesque also personally donated nearly $450 in the third quarter. The state PAC ended the period with $2,314 cash on hand, after spending more than $11,000, including $9,000 for political consulting by Michael Levesque, a prominent figure in Rhode Island politics whose career includes two terms as West Warwick Mayor and leading the Rhode Island GOP Chairman. Michael and David Levesque are not related. 
David Levesque considers himself a political outsider. He’s never run for office, never run a campaign, never even finished high school, he said. His strategy comes from observations, lived experiences and deep-rooted ties to the business community. 
“I just pay attention, I read a lot, I listen to people,” he said.
Levesque identifies as a Republican, and vocal Trump supporter, but The League bills itself as nonpartisan. However, its “common sense” platform rings conservative, preaching “disciplined spending,” and “reasonable gun ownership rules” along with cutting taxes on retirement benefits, estate transfers and high-value second homes.
The three candidates endorsed by The League so far are Democrats, though their platforms appear less progressive than the incumbent lawmakers they are looking to unseat.
Mark Mesrobian, general manager of Bonnet Shores Beach Club, has The League’s endorsement to challenge Sen. Alana DiMario for Senate District 36. The PAC has also backed Laura Turini, a nurse anesthetist, as the Democratic challenger to Sen. Bridget Valverde in Senate District 35, and attorney Leah Bosclair to primary against Rep. Tina Spears in House District 36. 
All three incumbents supported gun restrictions, including a comprehensive state ban on assault- style weapons before it was watered down in a compromise reached on the final day of the 2025 legislative session.

Taking aim at progressives 
Levesque insisted that gun rights were one of many issues — not the sole focus —  The League considered in its endorsements. Mesrobian, for example, approached him with the interest in running a challenge to DiMario. 
“I am not targeting her,” he said of DiMario. “Mark came to me. We think he’s a better candidate than her. We need someone that’s going to be pro-business.”
DiMario in response pointed to her votes of support for relief for small businesses in the wake of the pandemic, workforce development initiatives and removing the state tangible tax.
“They are an anti-gun safety group, not a business group,” DiMario said. “If they were a business group, they would be looking at my record.”
DiMario also said her three consecutive legislative victories as a candidate who campaigned on gun safety show that district voters support stricter gun laws.










They are an anti-gun safety group, not a business group. If they were a business group, they would be looking at my record.


– Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat, on The League of RI Businesses 


Many of the Senate Democrats who The League is looking to challenge in  2026 primaries — identified on a webpage titled “The Wall” — also supported the attempt to oust the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, and later, after Ruggerio’s death, the challenge to now-President Valarie Lawson. 
For example, Democratic Sen. Ryan Pearson, Ruggerio’s former second-in-command who unsuccessfully battled Ruggerio for the president’s seat in Nov. 2024, and ran against Lawson in late April, is one of the candidates identified by The League on “The Wall.”
But Levesque said he is not interested in the personal political feuds of either chamber. 
“If there’s somebody up there who’s not doing what they are supposed to be, then we don’t want them there,” Levesque said. 
Pearson, for example, missed a string of Senate sessions following Lawson’s election — a sign of poor performance to Levesque.
Pearson acknowledged that he deliberately skipped a few legislative sessions directly after the April leadership election in order to give the newly elected Senate leaders “an opportunity to lead without distraction.” However, he highlighted his 13-year attendance record at the State House, including as former chair of the Finance Committee and later as majority leader, positions which often necessitated 10-hour days at the State House.
Levesque is much more open in his desire to oust Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat who voted alongside 11 Democrats to advance the more comprehensive assault weapons ban out of committee.  Levesque said Casimiro privately acknowledged her concerns with the proposed legislation in conversations with him, but recommended the bill anyway. And according to Levesque, Casimiro did not have a good explanation for her change of heart.
“We will do everything we can to get her out of office,” Levesque said.
Casimiro did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment.
Shekarchi, who is backing all incumbent House Democrats, disagreed with Levesque’s criticism of sitting lawmakers.
“Everyone in the House is doing their jobs,” Shekarchi said. Of Spears specifically, he added, “I think Tina is one of the best representatives we’ve seen in a long time. I will fully 100% support her.”
Talk vs. action 
Shekarchi remained skeptical that The League’s splashy announcements and big-money PAC strategy would amount to much.
“It’s a lot of talk,” Shekarchi said. “There are always people who come out guns blazing after I tell them to get involved. How well they actually do it, and how they perform, we’ll have to wait and see.”
Indeed, prior efforts to spur competition in state elections outside the confines of the two-party system have had little staying power, Marion said. There’s little trace left of the Moderate Party that former gubernatorial candidate Ken Block started in the early aughts. The conservative-leaning Rhode Island Taxpayers, also known as the Rhode Island Statewide Coalition and the Rhode Island Shoreline Coalition, disbanded in 2016 amid waning financial support, The Public’s Radio (now Ocean State Media) reported.
“For a really long time the history of America is a history of a two-party system,” Marion said. “Trying to sidestep that has generally been a fool’s errand.”
More productive to good government watchdogs: reforming the state campaign finance laws that let The League leverage a multi-PAC strategy in the first place.
Common Cause may include this proposal as part of its 2026 state legislative package, Marion said.
DiMario was also eyeing The League’s strategy as an opportunity for policy change.
“I am not really concerned about that,” she said of Mesrobian’s challenge to her seat. “Money doesn’t win elections. Hard work wins elections.”
But, she continued, “I think this provides an opportunity for the General Assembly to look at campaign finance laws and to see where we need to tighten up some loopholes to make sure that money can’t have an outsized influence on the outcome of elections.
The state Board of Elections could alternatively develop internal regulations, or propose legislation, addressing campaign spending by related PACs. Christopher Hunter, a spokesperson for the board, declined to comment.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Voters spoke loud and clear in this fall’s General Election: the cost of living is the most important issue for Virginians right now. That includes utility bills that continue to rise year after year. Lawmakers are debating how to bring those bills down in the midst of the unprecedented demand for power and climate change impacts.
“Our agenda is focused on lowering costs, lifting wages, expanding opportunity,” said House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth.
In recent days, House Democrats released some of their priority bills – two of which zoom in on energy efficiency in homes. Here’s a look at what these measures would accomplish.
 House Bill 3: Establishing an Income-Qualified Energy Efficiency and Weatherization Task Force 

The major utilities in the state, namely Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, already have weatherization and efficiency programs that customers can opt into. They also have upgrades and improvements programs for low-income households. However, Democrats want a task force to take a closer look at any barriers that may be keeping low-income customers from utilizing these programs.
The legislation establishes a group of at least 12 citizen members and representatives from the Department of Energy, Social Services, the Attorney General’s Office and a staff member from the Commission on Utility Regulation.
The task force will be expected to create a report by the end of Sept. 2027 on how many households meet the income requirements for efficiency programs, how many of those homes are in need of weatherization, how many homes have been submitted to providers for improvements but are on the waitlist, how many homes have gotten state or utility sponsored upgrades, and any barriers there may be in implementing the programs.
As part of the Virginia Clean Economy Act, Virginia utilities each have efficiency goals they are expected to meet, which means they have to find ways for their ratepayers to cut back on the amount of energy they use through smart thermostats, rebate programs for more energy efficient appliances, or rewards for using less power during high demand time periods.
Homeowners that would qualify for these programs would have to make 60% of Virginia’s median income, or 200% of the federal poverty level, whichever is higher.
 House Bill 2: Reducing heating related costs by requiring utilities to provide energy efficiency upgrades

On top of the requirements to meet energy reductions by certain years set out in the legislation, this proposed bill would implement a requirement that 30% of their qualified customers receive efficiency measures and improvements by the end of 2031.
The State Corporation Commission would have to deem those improvements to be in the public interest. Should the SCC’s make that determination the utilities would have to “lower each household’s total heating-related energy costs, which determination shall be subject to Commission review and approval, and based upon widely available and credible energy consumption and cost data,” according to the legislation.
The utilities would be able to work with the Department of Energy to utilize state and federal funding sources to aid in their efforts to implement the programs.
The proposed legislation also asks the utilities to report to the SCC by January 2028 about how much their efforts to reduce heating costs have translated into savings for customers and how it potentially cuts back on energy infrastructure needs such as transmission lines, power generation and the importing of energy.
Both of these bills will be considered in the 2026 General Assembly legislative session that begins Jan. 14.
The state previously received funding for efficiency programs through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Virginia joined the multi-state agreement in 2020, which brought the commonwealth into the cap and trade program aimed at reducing greenhouse emissions from the power sector. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin pulled the state from the agreement in 2024, stating that the additional $2 on utility bills to fund the program was an unnecessary tax. A Floyd County Circuit Court judge ruled last November that “the attempted repeal of the RGGI Regulation is unlawful, and thereby null and void,”
While the fate of the state’s involvement in RGGI is still held up in the courts, things could change under the Spanberger administration. The Gov.-elect has said she would put the state back into the agreement to bring that funding stream back for flooding and efficiency programs. However, it is not clear when that would occur.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Virginia’s financial analysts say education costs are poised to rise over the next two years — but with enrollment still in flux, lawmakers don’t yet know how much the state will ultimately have to spend. 
Last week, the House and Senate money committees met separately to assess what they will face across major funding areas, including K-12 education, over the coming biennium. The briefings were part of a broader effort to understand how to financially support Virginia as the state absorbs changes from the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” or HR 1, which will affect SNAP and Medicaid benefits.
Virginia will be responsible for offsetting at least some of the costs.
“Education funding continues to be a top priority,” said House Education Committee Chair Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke. “Clearly the impacts of HR 1 are creating havoc on forecasting further investments. We will work hard to fund education priorities in this chaotic environment.”
Because enrollment data is a core factor in calculating Standards of Quality costs — the formula determining how much the state and localities must contribute — both committees are still waiting for updated projections. Simultaneously, lawmakers have been considering ways to address the decades-old funding formula that researchers have found underestimates and inadequately accounts for English Learners and students with special needs. 
So far, data from the Virginia Department of Education show enrollment continues to decline, driven largely by declining birth rates and migration patterns. 
Kenita Matthews, a VDOE spokeswoman, told The Mercury the agency is still collecting daily membership counts from all 132 school divisions. The reports were due Sept. 30.
“Unfortunately, we have had numerous divisions with delayed submissions that have impacted the release of the latest attendance data,” Mathews said in a statement. “We have sent letters to the final remaining divisions that have not submitted their annual report as of November 18 copying their governing board chairs and board of supervisors chairs.”
Using data from the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia, VDOE staff told the Board of Education earlier this month that K-12 enrollment is projected to keep declining, with more than 30,000 fewer students expected statewide.
The board will receive a presentation on funding schools for the next two years at its Dec. 10 work session. Enrollment data for the current school year will be provided in January.
As part of the state’s rebenchmarking process, officials are reviewing the cost of maintaining direct aid to programs for the next two years. Both chambers estimate the baseline cost at no less than $844 million. Those areas include specialized student populations, targeted support, school operations, special incentives and personnel instructional expenses, which have risen. 
Salaries for the next biennium were adjusted to include two 3% salary increases for the 2024-2026 biennium, increasing the total base budget by $3.1 billion. Other projected costs include $134.4 million in one-time bonuses, a $332.3 million increase for students and specialized programs, $13.2 million for career and technical education and $18.4 billion for early reading intervention.
The committees are still seeking updates on sales tax revenue, English Learner enrollment and final inflation figures.
Analysts in the two chambers produced different projections for  the total cost of funding schools over the next two years — a gap of $122 million — tied to whether the state fully funds the Virginia Preschool Initiative. Planning and Budgeting estimated a cost of $120 million over the biennium.
The House used a lower estimate of $32.3 million, which aligns with typical spending.
Senate Education and Health Committee Chair Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, said supporting “high quality” schools is essential while balancing and meeting the state’s other urgent needs in crafting the next budget.  
“Education remains a cornerstone of our economic future, and we must remain committed to securing the resources to recruit excellent educators, maintain safe schools, and ensure students in every community can succeed,” Hashmi said in a statement to The Mercury. 
“At the same time, we cannot ignore critical pressure points on health care, behavioral health, and essential services for our most vulnerable residents. These areas also directly affect the conditions in which our students learn and develop.”
Lawmakers return to Richmond on Jan. 14 for the start of the General Assembly.

(Getty photo)If you have ever watched a loved one pull away from conversations, skip social events, or stop answering the phone, hearing loss may be part of the reason. It does not happen overnight, but little by little, struggling to hear can chip away at confidence, connection, and happiness.


Recognize any of these warning signs?
If so, it may be time for a hearing test:

People seem to mumble more often.
Your family says the TV or radio is too loud.
Telephone conversations are becoming difficult.
You frequently ask people to repeat themselves.
You notice ringing, buzzing, or hissing in your ears.
You no longer hear common household sounds.
Group conversations are hard to follow.
You hear, but struggle to understand words clearly.
You have trouble hearing when your back is turned.
Others tell you that you speak too loudly.



A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that older adults who treat their hearing loss retain one additional person in their close social circle compared to those who do not. Even one more friend or family member to talk with can make a meaningful difference. Staying connected keeps the mind sharp and the mood lifted.
Hearing loss is far more than a change in volume. When conversations become hard to follow, people naturally step back. They might smile and nod without catching everything or avoid group settings because it is tiring to keep up. Over time, that withdrawal can lead to loneliness, depression, and cognitive decline. Research now shows that treating hearing loss is among the top modifiable actions to reduce the risk of developing dementia, making hearing care an important part of protecting brain health and overall wellbeing.
The good news is that treating hearing loss has never been easier. Today’s advanced technology, including AI-powered hearing aids, automatically adjusts to surroundings and helps the brain focus on the sounds that matter most. These devices do not simply make things louder. They make life clearer and more natural.
There is also growing recognition that hearing care needs to be more accessible. Lawmakers are reviewing ways to expand Medicare coverage for hearing and balance services so older adults can get help without barriers. Hearing health is health, and it deserves the same attention as vision or dental care.
I meet many people who have waited too long to address their hearing loss, often because they did not know where to start or assumed help was out of reach. But once they take that first step, everything changes.










Hearing health is health, and it deserves the same attention as vision or dental care.


In my practice in Woonsocket, I see transformations like this every day. It is heartwarming to see a loved one begin participating in conversations again after a long period of withdrawal. A patient’s daughter-in-law was in awe as she watched her mother-in-law engage more at family gatherings, share memories, ask the great-grandkids questions and laugh at their jokes. Seeing this inspired her to schedule an appointment for her husband, who was beginning to show signs of hearing loss.
Although he was skeptical, trying on hearing aids helped him realize how much he had been missing. A month later, his students admitted they had stopped asking him questions because they thought he was ignoring them. He soon saw his classroom engagement rise and felt less exhausted after work. He had not realized that straining to keep up was causing physical fatigue.
Stories like this show how one person’s experience can encourage others to take action. In this family, helping the matriarch led to her son getting help. His experience then encouraged his aunt to revisit hearing aids after five years without them. Her frustrations were simple. They no longer fit comfortably. With some of the smallest devices available, I was able to show her custom options that suited her needs.
Hearing loss is not just an elderly concern. I have seen patients in their mid-thirties seek help after noticing that conversations were becoming harder to follow and that they were increasingly sensitive to loud noises.
One concerned wife brought her reluctant 35-year-old husband to the Woonsocket clinic. “I have to repeat myself so often that I sometimes do not even bother talking to him.” It was a painful statement for a young couple raising children. As a shy introvert working from home, he had not noticed much difference in his own life. But hearing his wife explain how it was affecting their family finally encouraged him to take the next step. After two weeks he shared that his sons were delighted he was more present, and he was amazed at how much he had been missing.
Every day, patients admit they never wanted hearing aids, but now they cannot imagine life without them. Hearing care enriches daily life, strengthens relationships, and supports long-term health.

In r[...]","Marjorie Taylor Greene speaks at an April town hall in Cobb County. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderCongresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene’s abrupt announcement that she plans to resign from office early next year is likely to send ripples through Georgia’s political landscape.
Greene, formerly among President Donald Trump’s staunchest allies, announced her plans in a video message Friday, citing frustrations with the political system and the president. In recent months, Greene and Trump had publicly sparred over topics including the release of the Epstein files.
Once she officially leaves office on Jan. 5, it will be up to Gov. Brian Kemp to set a date for a special election to replace her.
Kemp’s office said Monday that there’s no word on timing yet. State law gives the governor 10 days to issue a call for an election starting from the day of the resignation. After that, the election can be held after 30 days have passed from the governor’s order. That means the election could come in mid February at the earliest, though it will likely be held later.
A crowded field
Qualifying for the race will begin after Kemp officially calls for the special election. A race for an open seat usually attracts a lot of candidates, and the race to replace Greene is likely to be no exception.
Several candidates had already filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run against Greene when she was set to go up for re-election in November along with all of Georgia’s other congressional members. They include:

Republican Star Black, a Federal Emergency Management Agency employee and entrepreneur.
Republican actor Elvis Casely
Republican business owner Jeff Criswell
Republican Uloma Ekpete
Independent Rob “Rush” Ruszkowski

Democrat Shawn Harris, a retired Army Brigadier General and farmer who challenged Greene in 2024 and earned just over 35% of the vote, has announced plans to run again next year.
On Saturday, Christian Hurd, a U.S. Marine and Dalton resident, announced his plans to run on an “America first” platform including building new infrastructure and banning the purchase of single-family homes by private equity firms.
Members of Congress are not required to live in the districts they serve. Greene herself originally announced a run for a more moderate metro Atlanta district in 2019 but moved her home and her campaign to the 14th District after former U.S. Rep. Tom Graves announced his plans to retire, so the seat could once again see candidates declare from out of the district.
Downstream effects
A congressional race with no incumbent is also likely to attract sitting politicians looking to run for higher office.
“I think we’re going to see a lot of dominoes falling,” said Kennesaw State University professor of political science and former Cobb County Republican Party Chair Jason Shepherd.
A number of state senators are rumored to be considering heading up to Washington, and that’s all part of the process, said Emory University political science professor Andra Gillespie.
“This is actually kind of part of the natural life cycle of running for office,” she said. “When you have an open seat, which doesn’t happen often, especially in a safe district like the 14th District, when you have somebody who chooses to retire, that is kind of an expression of pent up ambition in terms of the number of people who end up running for the seat.”
Much of the Republican leadership in the state Senate already plans to run for higher office, and other GOP lawmakers could be attracted to an open seat in the deep red district.
State Sen. Colton Moore, a Trenton Republican, has openly flirted with a run.
“I’m exploring a run for Congress because Northwest Georgia needs a fighter who won’t bow to the swamp,” Moore said in a statement. “With Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation, I’m seriously considering stepping up to fight alongside President Donald J. Trump to advance the America First Agenda that’s turning our country around.”
Moore is popular among conservative voters in his district, but he has riled his party’s leadership under the Gold Dome, including in 2023 when the Republican Senate Caucus suspended Moore after he revealed their personal contact information as part of a pressure campaign to impeach Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.
Last year, Moore was arrested outside the state Capitol after trying to force his way into the House chamber despite being banned from entering. Moore had been exiled from the chamber by GOP House Speaker Jon Burns after speaking ill of the late House Speaker David Ralston, a Blue Ridge Republican, while Ralston was being posthumously honored in the Senate.
Other state senator names being tossed around by politicos as potential candidates include Majority Leader Jason Anavitarte, a Dallas Republican; Republican Sen. Ed Setzler of Acworth, author of the state’s religious freedom law and six-week abortion ban, and Republican Sen. Chuck Payne of Dalton, a U.S. Army veteran who chairs the Senate Committee on Veterans, Military and Homeland Security.
Anavitarte, Setzler and Payne did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.
The timing of the race could put wrinkles into the plans of potential candidates. The 2026 legislative session, when state lawmakers all come to Atlanta to pass laws, is set to begin Jan. 12 and could last through late March or early April.
Members of the state Legislature are banned from raising campaign money during the legislative session when running for a state office like governor, or when they are seeking re-election, but they are free to fundraise for a run at federal office like Congress.
“The question will be, however, obviously that if you’re down there working in the general assembly during the session, it’s hard to be back in the district campaigning, so the likelihood is you’ll see a number of them resign,” Shepherd said.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Staff cuts at an Ohio Planned Parenthood affiliate have been finalized, according to the union who represents workers there. Amid the cuts, staff were also notified that a clinic in the system will close this month.
Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio announced the plan for cuts in early November, but with the union in place, negotiations were necessary before details could be finalized.
The cuts came into play because of federal spending losses specifically for Planned Parenthood nationally, but also cuts to Medicaid, which makes up a significant base of patients for the organization.
Nationally, Planned Parenthood has said the Medicaid cuts will impact more than 1 million patients, and put more than 200 clinics at risk.
Two primary care/family planning clinics in Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region’s system already closed earlier this year due to the cuts.
The Greater Ohio affiliate’s union, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio Workers United, works under the Office of Professional Employees International Union Local 98.
Union organizer Clarie Randall told the Capital Journal that the reduction in force was implemented on Nov. 18.
Leaders at the affiliate confirmed the date the staff cuts went into effect, saying the cuts “impacted 17 staff members in family planning across the organization.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Staff were notified by affiliate leaders that the clinic in Franklinton would be closing as part of the staff reduction, with all workers at that location subject to the layoffs.
In their statement to the Capital Journal on Friday, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio said it has “altered staffing arrangements” at the Franklinton and North Columbus locations.
“Ultimately, we will close the Franklinton location on Nov. 28, 2025, and we will work to transfer these patients to our North Columbus location,” the statement read.
Leaders at the organization said the federal spending and Medicaid cuts amounted to about $10 million in losses for the Ohio branch alone.
Medicaid patients make up about 40% of the recipients of their care, according to Erica Wilson-Domer, president and CEO of the Greater Ohio branch.
So the loss of those patients on top of other federal funding cuts caused a need for “right-sizing” as Wilson-Domer put it when the reduction in force was announced in November.
The closure of the Franklinton clinic will leave 11 health centers across Ohio, along with two ambulatory surgical centers in Bedford Heights and Columbus.
Randall said the workers understand that “nobody wants to be doing these layoffs,” but some action had to take place.
This second reduction in force came “seemingly out of nowhere,” however, just months after the first staff cuts made by the organization in the summer of 2025.
“While we as the union have a different take on where the money could come from to fill the gaps, and think that management should be taking a little bit more of the burden on, there are financial holes to be filled,” Randall said.
The first cuts were also attributed to a lack of funding to sustain operations as usual.
The summer reduction cut a total of 20 staff members, 17 of which were members of the union.
“People definitely weren’t expecting this quick of a turnaround for another (reduction in force),” Randall said.
Wilson-Domer said in November that cuts to the tune of $2 million had already happened at the administrative level, and that area of the organization had “gotten as lean as we can go.”
Planned Parenthood state leaders have maintained that none of the federal funding they have received has gone to abortion care, since that has long been prohibited by federal law.

Concord and Laconia were the only two cities in New Hampshire to clear the way for social districts, where public drinking would be allowed in designated areas. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Voters in Concord and Laconia approved ballot measures earlier this month to allow “social districts” in their cities, and local officials are in the early stages of deciding what they’ll look like.
The districts were enabled by legislation that went into effect in September. The law allows towns and cities to create areas where certain alcohol laws are partially suspended to allow public drinking. Patrons will be required to drink alcohol only out of designated containers, with time limits set and signage posted for the districts.
While Portsmouth, Nashua, and Keene voters all rejected social districts, 52% percent in Concord and 56% in Laconia saw enough upside to grant their approval.
In Laconia, Kristin Bastille, the owner of Defiant Records and Craft Beer and the Candy Bar, is amped for social districts to come to her town. She was among the business owners who pushed city officials to put the measure on the ballot.
Bastille hopes to see a social district on Main Street where Defiant Record and Craft Beer is located. The various festivals and events the city holds — such as the Laconia Pumpkin Festival, the annual Charity Car Show, Laconia Bike Week, and Concerts on Canal — would be ideal times to have these social districts, she said. Laconia already allows outdoor drinking for some events, she said, but not without headaches.
“It’s kind of a process,” Bastille said. “Instead of just being able to automatically be allowed to do that and not be sectioned off. We’re usually in a small section where we can allow it. But for the car shows people automatically assume they can walk the street. So they’ll come out with a beer, and then they’ll try to cross the street or go down the street, and they can’t.”
During the same election in which Laconia voters approved social districts, they also elected Mike Bordes as mayor. Bordes, a three-term state representative, was a co-sponsor of the social districts legislation, House Bill 467. Now, as he prepares to take over City Hall, he is set to implement on the local level a bill he helped pass on the state level.
“A lot of times we cast bills, and we don’t really firsthand get to sculpt out what they become,” Bordes said. “So now we can actually take the bill and put it to action.”
Bordes said he believes social districts will be great for revitalizing downtown, boosting tourism, and bringing foot traffic to local businesses. He hopes to see a social district downtown around Canal Street, but plans to meet with his new colleagues on the city council and staff on the topic over the next few weeks as they work to establish the first social districts.
City Manager Kirk Beattie said because Laconia has lots of experience with festivals in which alcohol is consumed, “it’s not going to be a huge stretch for us to try to figure out how we want to do it and how we want to create these districts.”
In Concord, planning is in much earlier stages. Mayor Byron Champlin said the city hasn’t even fully decided whether it’s going to implement social districts.
“I think what’s important to realize here is that we’re not talking about a social district,” Champlin said. “We’re talking about the opportunity, if desired, to create one or more social districts.”
He said the ballot measure simply gives city officials the legal authority to implement social districts. He said the reason he supported putting it on the ballot was that, because the legislation requires voter approval, if the city didn’t do it this month, it would’ve had to wait until the next election in late 2027 to consider it again.
“I don’t think having a social district is automatic,” he said. “There are a lot of hoops that have to be gone through.”
Now, he said, bar and restaurant owners must come forward saying they would like to participate in creating a social district. The city council would then need to approve the plan and create guidelines. He said he hasn’t been in communication with any business owners yet.
He said one thing he would consider in any request is how a social district might affect Concord’s family-friendliness.
“If we were looking at Market Days (the annual downtown Concord festival), what would the impact be on Market Days being a family event?” he said. “Would this create any concern on the part of people with their kids downtown if people could be walking around with an open container?”
At-Large City Councilor Amanda Grady-Sexton said she’s seen a lot of excitement around social districts from her constituents.
Grady-Sexton said the issue should be referred to the city’s Public Safety Advisory Board, which she chairs, so the districts could be set up safely with assistance from the police and fire departments. Her hope, she said, is that social districts might help dispel Concord’s reputation as a sleepy town and spruce up downtown.
“That’s what the voters told me,” she said. “And that is absolutely what I heard: that people are looking for new energy. They are looking to find ways to keep young people in the community. Of course, affordable housing has been the number one challenge, but also, the reputational piece.

Parents of children and young adults who receive applied behavior analysis, or ABA, worry states’ cost-saving measures will make it harder for them to get vital services. About 5% of children ages 3 to 17 on public insurance have autism spectrum disorder, compared with 2% who have private insurance, according to a CDC survey.
Many families and autism therapists say ABA can help improve communication and social skills, sharpen memory and focus, and replace challenging behaviors with positive ones. ABA therapy can range from 10 to 40 hours per week in different settings, including home and school. That makes it expensive.
In 2014, the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services mandated that all state Medicaid programs cover comprehensive autism services for children. It did not explicitly require coverage of ABA, but by 2022, every state Medicaid program covered ABA.
In addition, more kids are getting diagnosed with autism as screenings increase. As a result, state spending on the service has skyrocketed. In Indiana, for example, Medicaid spending on ABA therapy grew from $21 million in 2017 to $611 million in 2023. The sharp increase has prompted Indiana, and other states, to take steps to control costs.
Meanwhile, federal auditors have begun examining states’ coverage of ABA services to ferret out fraud and abuse.










For such a costly and intensive service, the states need to explore how to best reimburse this benefit so that it's sustainable and promotes quality.


– Mariel Fernandez, vice president of government affairs at the Council of Autism Service Providers


Mariel Fernandez, vice president of government affairs at the Council of Autism Service Providers, a nonprofit trade association, acknowledged that states are facing difficult choices.
“For such a costly and intensive service, the states need to explore how to best reimburse this benefit so that it’s sustainable and promotes quality,” said Fernandez, who is also a board-certified behavioral analyst. “Is [the rate] going to bankrupt Medicaid? Is it going to ensure that people are actually receiving the service?”
The Medicaid changes included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed in July will increase the pressure: The law includes more than $900 billion in federal spending cuts over the next decade. Medicaid is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has described autism as a rapidly growing “epidemic” in the U.S. and has made it a major focus of his tenure. Kennedy has promoted the debunked theory that there’s a link between childhood vaccines and autism.
Curbing costs
Several states this year have considered curbing ABA costs by capping therapy hours, tightening provider enrollment rules, reducing reimbursement rates or changing patient eligibility rules. A bill in New York, for example, would establish a 680-hour annual cap on ABA services.
But nowhere has the issue been more prominent than in Indiana, where Medicaid has covered ABA therapy since 2016.
Governor’s group recommends ABA usage cap, rate changes as Medicaid costs rise

Historically, Indiana Medicaid has reimbursed ABA providers for most services at a rate of 40%, regardless of what they charged.
That “created some very strange incentives for a small portion of the provider network,” said Jason McManus, president of Indiana Providers of Effective Autism Treatment (InPEAT), which represents smaller ABA providers in Indiana and larger providers that operate in Indiana and elsewhere. “You had folks who were charging exorbitant amounts for the service.”
Beginning in 2024, Indiana lowered its reimbursement rate to about $68 per hour — and received plenty of pushback.
“That did have an impact on the provider community,” McManus said. “You had a lot of folks, smaller shops, who ended up closing their doors or consolidating with other organizations. So that was disruptive.”
And that year, the HHS inspector general issued a report which found that Indiana’s Medicaid program made at least $56 million in “improper” payments to ABA therapy providers in 2019 and 2020.
The state’s rapidly rising ABA costs and the federal audit prompted Republican Gov. Mike Braun to issue an executive order earlier this year creating a working group to examine ways to cut costs without compromising quality.
The group crafted recommendations to correct the problems identified in the federal audit and put ABA coverage on a financially sustainable path. Without changes in the state’s reimbursement policies, the group concluded, Indiana’s Medicaid spending on ABA therapy would reach a projected $825 million by 2029.
This month, Braun unveiled the group’s recommendations, which include the creation of a new ABA office to increase oversight and lower reimbursement rates, which the state has not yet detailed.
ABA allows people with autism “to obtain the highest level of independence that’s possible for them,” said McManus, who served on the working group.
“But from a state perspective, I can see how, if you’re purely just looking at the cost, you would say, ‘Wow, this is a cost that has grown over time, and if absent all other contexts, this is something we need to pay attention to, because it’s unsustainable.’”
Nebraska rate cut
In Nebraska, state officials also have been looking for ways to control spiraling ABA costs: Last year, Nebraska Medicaid paid out more than $85 million for ABA therapy, a surge from $4.6 million in 2020.
Democratic governors launch multistate public health alliance to counter Trump, RFK Jr.

In July, the state announced that it would cut its Medicaid reimbursement rates for ABA, including a 48% cut to reimbursement for direct therapy provided by a behavior technician. That brought the rate to $74.80 per hour, down from about $144 per hour. Rates for therapy by physicians or other board-certified professionals also were reduced by about 37%.
Many providers saw the cuts coming, as the state has had the highest hourly reimbursement rate in the nation.
“It would be fiscally irresponsible of the state to maintain that,” said Leila Allen, vice president of external affairs at Lighthouse Autism Center, which has ABA therapy centers in Nebraska as well as in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and North Carolina.
Sam Wallach, president of Attain, an ABA therapy provider that operates in Nebraska and a dozen other states and Washington, D.C., said the service is “life-changing for children and families.” He views the ABA reduction as a “correction” that will make it feasible for Nebraska Medicaid to continue to cover it.
“The previous rates were well above what most Medicaid programs pay nationally, and while that created short-term benefits, it wasn’t realistic or sustainable,” Wallach said.
But some providers are taking issue with the way Nebraska went about those cuts.
For example, the state provided only 30 days’ notice before making the change. “There were providers that within 30 days had to tell their staff, ‘We’re so sorry. We have to cut your salary by ‘x’ percent in 30 days,’” Allen said.
Nebraska also didn’t examine how much it costs to provide ABA in the state, she said. The new rate is closer to what neighboring states, such as Iowa, pay. But therapists are few and far between in sparsely populated Nebraska, and families there often have to travel long distances to reach ABA providers.
“There was no cost survey to determine what the cost should be,” said Allen. “They didn’t take into account that you do have to pay people a little bit more to be able to work as behavior analysts in Nebraska.”
Finding ABA therapists in Nebraska is particularly difficult for families with older kids. Angela Gleason, executive secretary on the board of autism advocacy organization Arc of Nebraska, has a 13-year-old son with autism. She said many companies only serve very young children, up to age 6.
“So for families like mine, it’s then hard to even find a company that will serve his age and will provide that kind of support,” she said. To be able to afford therapy, her son Teddy has Medicaid coverage as his secondary insurance. ABA therapy helps him with socializing and speaking with his speech delay.
“He needs a lot more help throughout his day than a normal 13-year-old without autism might need,” Gleason said.
North Carolina court case
In North Carolina, the cost of covering autism services, including ABA, will total an estimated $639 million in fiscal 2026, up 425% from 2022, according to the state’s Medicaid agency. About five autism providers made up roughly 41% of the state’s increase in spending in fiscal year 2023-2024, according to the state.
GOP-led lawsuit that could dismantle disability protections draws public backlash

Effective on Oct. 1, North Carolina Medicaid cut reimbursement rates for all kinds of health care services, arguing that state legislators had not budgeted enough money to keep up with rising costs. The reductions, which ranged from 3% to 10%, included a 10% cut to the reimbursement rate for autism services, including ABA therapy.
But the families of 21 children immediately sued the state Department of Health and Human Services to halt the move, arguing that it was discriminatory because it targeted children with disabilities.
Earlier this month, the families won a preliminary injunction temporarily halting the rate cut.
But families across the state are on edge as children with autism often see multiple providers — psychologists and speech language pathologists, for example — whose rate cuts were not paused, according to Allen, of Lighthouse Autism Center.
David Laxton, director of communications for the Autism Society of North Carolina, which is also a provider, said many providers won’t be able to absorb the rate reductions and continue operating.
“At some point, the math is not going to math,” Laxton said.
“It’s very stressful for families, because right now, there’s not an end in sight,” Laxton said. “There’s agreement that this [service] is very important, but there’s not been action to bring an end to the cuts.”

The Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles has fired a longtime employee nearly five years after investigators found he used his position to garner steep discounts on cars he bought from a towing company, according to a termination letter obtained last week.
The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica reported in March on the accusations against Dominik Stefanski and the DMV’s failure to take action against him or the towing company. The story was part of a larger series about how Connecticut’s towing laws have come to favor tow truck companies over vehicle owners and how the DMV’s lack of oversight has allowed abuses in the system. The DMV investigated Stefanski for over a year beginning in 2020 but didn’t fire him until early November, months after the news organizations’ story.
According to the 2020-21 DMV investigation, when employees of D&L Auto Body & Towing in Berlin, Connecticut, went to the main DMV office in nearby Wethersfield, they would make eye contact with Stefanski, who would then allow them to cut the slow-moving DMV lines. In exchange for this favor, the report said, D&L employees would allow Stefanski to select vehicles that had been towed by the company weeks or months before. D&L would then undervalue the cars on DMV forms, investigators said, allowing Stefanski to buy them cheaply and resell them for a profit.
In total, DMV investigators found that from 2015 to 2019, D&L sold 15 vehicles to an investment firm owned by Stefanski, who had worked for the agency since 1999 and was then a document examiner in the DMV’s main office. In one case, Stefanski bought a Cadillac for $1,000 and sold it for $17,500. The car was eventually sold by another company for $23,250.
In 2020, DMV investigators recommended that Stefanski be criminally charged for the scheme they alleged made him thousands of dollars, and they completed an arrest warrant. A prosecutor decided not to file charges, however, citing “prosecutorial discretion” and “insufficient evidence to meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” The prosecutor suggested the DMV could handle the matter internally.
But the DMV did not discipline Stefanski or issue fines against D&L in the years after the investigation. The agency declined to comment on the firing and declined to answer specific questions about the investigation.
Stefanski was placed on paid administrative leave in March, two business days after the story was published. He earned just over $72,000 annually. The Nov. 6 termination letter notes that he was fired for misconduct “when you used your position for financial gain.” 
Stefanski said he has appealed and anticipates having a hearing next month. In an interview with reporters earlier this year, Stefanski maintained that he hadn’t done anything wrong.
Reached by phone last week, Stefanski said that after the news organizations published the article, he had a hearing in which he presented evidence, including a check he received as a loan to buy one of the vehicles. He said the check proves he paid more for the vehicle than the warrant indicated.
The state rejected Stefanski’s argument.
“The agency did not find that the information presented provided any basis to mitigate the contemplated penalty of dismissal,” the termination letter said.
A D&L official declined to comment on the firing but said previously in a statement that the manager working with Stefanski was fired and that the company is working with the DMV “to ensure that this type of situation doesn’t happen again.”
“The company’s manager at the time acted on his own and thought he was doing the right thing by selling in-operable cars,” the statement said. According to investigators, many of the cars were in good condition.
Stefanski said his union is helping him with the appeal, but he declined to give details until it is over.
Logan Williams, a representative of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 4, which represents DMV workers, said the union can’t comment on the specifics of the case but that the rights of workers “derive their strength from the integrity of due process.”
“Every Union exists to defend this process and our members’ rights,” Williams said in a statement. “Whenever discipline is handed down in the workplace, our union has an obligation to ensure that the process is followed and that our members have access to due process.”
Stefanski said no one at the DMV indicated why he was being fired close to seven years after the incidents and five years after DMV investigators learned what was happening.
“They didn’t give me an explanation. They actually didn’t give me nothing,” Stefanski said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0219_SR_Towing_016_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 05:56:15.932429

(Photo by Morgan Trau.)The Ohio Senate unanimously passed an academic intervention bill last week aimed to help students who score below proficient on state assessment tests. 
Ohio Senate Bill 19 would allow a public school student who scored below proficient in a state assessment test in math or English language arts to receive academic intervention services at no cost. 
The bill now heads to the Ohio House for consideration. 
“Our educational system must be responsive to the needs of our students,” said Ohio Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware. 
“If we are unable to say that our students who need the most help are in fact receiving assistance from their school, we are putting the interest of the adults ahead of the needs of the children.”

A fifth of Ohio students scored limited proficiency in English and almost a third of Ohio students scored at limited proficiency in math during the 2022-23 school year during state achievement tests, said Brenner, who introduced S.B. 19 bill earlier this year. 
“A disturbing number of Ohio children are in need of significant and prolonged academic intervention before it is too late to address their desperately needed learning loss,” he said. 
“Once a student demonstrates proficiency on a state assessment, they would no longer be required to receive academic intervention services, though the school may continue providing such services to students, if they so choose.”
State achievement tests assess a student’s comprehension in various subjects, including math and English. A student is assessed at one of five proficiency levels —  limited, basic, proficient, accomplished, and advanced. 
“Generally speaking, a student will need to answer approximately a quarter of the test questions correctly in order to achieve a rating of basic,” Brenner said. 
Ohio math and reading scores continue to be below pre-pandemic levels, according to the latest report from the National Center for Education Statistics.

The academic interventions in the bill must be evidence-based and could include high-dosage tutoring at least three days a week, additional instruction time, and an extended school calendar. 
Ohio S.B. 19 also deals directly with math intervention. 
The bill would require school districts or individual schools to come up with a math achievement improvement plan if 51% or less of the district or school’s students who took the third grade math achievement assessment scored at least a proficient score on the assessment.
Under the bill, schools would be required to develop math improvement and monitoring plans for each student that qualifies for math intervention services within 60 days after getting the student’s third grade assessment math results.
A math improvement and monitoring plan would identify the student’s “specific math deficiencies,” describe the additional instructional services they will receive, offer a chance for their parent or guardian to be involved, outline a monitoring process and offer high-dosage tutoring at least three days a week.
“Math is absolutely essential to our economy, to our national defense, to promoting peace throughout the world,” said Ohio Sen. Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster. 
“Nothing happens without math. Business don’t transact. Machinery doesn’t work. Engineering, architectural designs don’t happen. Everything depends, ultimately, on the basis of good math.”

(Photo by Douglas Rissing/Getty Images)New England winters can get wicked cold. Last week, five of the region’s states launched a $450 million effort to warm more of the homes in the often-frigid region with energy-efficient, low-emission heat pumps instead of burning fossil fuels.
“It’s a big deal,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. ​“It’s unprecedented to see five states aligning together on a transformational approach to deploying more-affordable clean-heat options.”
The New England Heat Pump Accelerator is a collaboration between Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. The initiative is funded by the federal Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program, which was created by President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The accelerator’s launch marks a rare milestone for a Biden-era climate initiative amid the Trump administration’s relentless attempts to scrap federal clean energy and environmental programs.
The goal: Get more heat pumps into more homes through a combination of financial incentives, educational outreach, and workforce development.
New England is a rich target for such an effort because of its current dependence on fossil-fuel heating. Natural gas and propane are in wide use, and heating oil is still widespread throughout the region; more than half of Maine’s homes are heated by oil, and the other coalition states all use oil at rates much higher than the national average. The prevalence of oil in particular means there’s plenty of opportunity to grow heat-pump adoption, cut emissions, and lower residents’ energy bills.
At the same time, heat pumps have faced barriers in the region, including the upfront cost of equipment, New England’s high price of electricity, and misconceptions about heat pumps’ ability to work in cold weather.
“There’s not a full awareness that these cold-temperature heat pumps can handle our winters, and do it at a cost that is lower than many of our delivered fuels,” said Joseph DeNicola, deputy commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
To some degree, the momentum is shifting. Maine has had notable success, hitting its aim of 100,000 new heat pump installations in 2023, two years ahead of its initial deadline. Massachusetts is on track to reach its 2025 target, but needs adoption rates to rise in order to make its 2030 goal.
The accelerator aims to speed up adoption by supporting the installation of some 580,000 residential heat pumps, which would reduce carbon emissions by 2.5 million metric tons by 2030 — the equivalent of taking more than 540,000 gas-powered passenger vehicles off the road.
The initiative is organized into three program areas, or ​“hubs,” as planners called them during a webinar kicking off the accelerator this week.
The largest portion of money, some $270 million, will go to the ​“market hub.” Distributors will receive incentives for selling heat pumps. They will keep a small percentage of the money for themselves and pass most of the savings on to the contractors buying the equipment. The contractors, in turn, will pass the lower price on to the customers. In addition to reducing upfront costs for consumers, this approach is designed to shift the market by encouraging distributors to keep the equipment in stock, therefore making it an easier choice for contractors and their customers.
These midstream incentives are expected to reduce the cost of cold-climate air-source heat pumps by $500 to $700 per unit and heat-pump water heaters by $200 to $300 per unit. When contractors buy the appliances, the incentive will be applied automatically — no extra paperwork or claims process required.
“It should be very simple for contractors to access this funding,” said Ellen Pfeiffer, a senior manager with Energy Solutions, a clean energy consultancy that is helping implement the programming. ​“It should be almost seamless.”
Consumers will also remain eligible for any incentives available through state efficiency programs, such as rebates from Mass Save or Efficiency Maine, but will likely not be able to stack the accelerator benefits with federal incentives like the Home Efficiency Rebates and Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate programs.
Program planners expect to be finalizing the incentive levels through the end of the year, enrolling and training distributors in the early months of 2026, and making the first participating products available in February 2026, said New England Heat Pump Accelerator program manager Jennifer Gottlieb Elazhari.
The second program area is the innovation hub. Each state will receive $14.5 million to fund one or two pilot programs testing out new ways to overcome barriers to heat pump adoption by low- and moderate-income households and in disadvantaged communities. One state might, for example, create a lending library of window-mounted air-source heat pumps, allowing someone whose oil heating breaks down the time to research replacement options rather than just installing new oil equipment.
The innovation hub will also include workforce development and training. Organizers are talking with contractors and other partners to figure out where the gaps are in heat pump training. In the first few months of 2026, they will develop a program with a target start date in April.
The goal will be not only to ensure that there are tradespeople with the needed skills to install the systems, but also to lay the groundwork for faster adoption by spreading knowledge about the capabilities of the technology and the available incentives.
The third major area of the accelerator is a resource hub to aggregate information for contractors, distributors, program implementers, and other stakeholders. Overall, organizers hope to have all three hubs operational in spring 2026.
Accelerator planners expect programs to boost adoption even as a federal tax credit of up to $2,000 on heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters is phased out at the end of the year, leaving states leading the way on clean energy action.
“At the state level, this is one example of a way we are helping to make progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but with a solution that can help people take control of their energy costs,” Dykes said. ​“That’s really what we’re focused on.”

Janet Mills, is currently undergoing treatments for skin cancer, but said she may have to forgo insurance next year due to spiking costs. (Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Rachel Phipps, a retired social worker from Kennebunk, was diagnosed last month with skin cancer, which she has been getting treatments for. If the cancer isn’t gone by her follow up appointment in December, Phipps said she won’t be seeking additional treatment because her and her husband have decided to go without health insurance.
Phipps currently pays about $200 a month for her marketplace health insurance plan, covering herself and her husband, who owns a small woodworking business in Sanford. But without federal subsidies, her monthly premium will go up to $2,000 with an almost $15,000 out-of-pocket deductible, which they can’t afford.
“I’m not choosing to not have health care insurance next year, but I can’t afford $49,000 in health care,” she told Gov. Janet Mills, U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree and several other officials at a roundtable in South Portland on Monday. 
“So I might be one of the 51,000 people that they know will die next year without the extension of the tax subsidies,” she said, citing a June study from the Yale School of Public Health, which warned that the proposed changes to Medicaid and increasing health insurance costs could lead to tens of thousands of preventable deaths. 
That estimate was even before the pending expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits, which subsidize the cost of marketplace health insurance for millions of Americans, including approximately 60,000 Mainers. 
Since Congress has not yet extended those credits, thousands of Maine residents — who are predominantly small business owners, older people or individuals that buy plans on the marketplace — now face significant increases in health costs. Experts are warning that the ripple effects of this increase will be felt by everyone, and will eventually result in an overburdened health care system with reduced services.
At the roundtable on Monday, Mills and Pingree called on the Trump administration to extend the subsidies in order to protect the state’s health care system and, by extension, Maine’s economy. 
Mills, who is currently challenging Republican Susan Collins in next year’s Senate race, said “it is time” for the country to develop a universal health care program.
“Whether you call it Medicare for All or something else, it’s clear the people of the United States deserve a universal health care plan and I would be committed to finding a way to get there,” said Mills, who signed an order expanding Medicaid in Maine on her first day as governor.
In the meantime, the governor said Maine would work to extend the state marketplace’s enrollment deadlines if Congress opts to extend the credits.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has pledged to hold a vote on the subsidy the first week of December, though House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has not made such a promise. Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee began more broad discussions about how to address rising health care costs last week. 
“The bottom line is more people will choose to go without health insurance if they can’t afford it,” Mills said, “delaying care until they wind up in the emergency room we’ve met and then with medical debt that lasts a lifetime.” 
“This has been deeply concerning to us, and now we are in the thick of it,” Pingree added.

Maine’s uninsured rate fell from 15% in 2019 to about 9% in part because of the enhanced premium tax credits that allowed more people to buy marketplace plans, according to Maine Bureau of Insurance Superintendent Bob Carey, who also attributed the rise to the expansion of Medicaid in Maine. 
If the tax credits expire, “it won’t have a direct, immediate impact on the uninsured rates but it will eventually for sure,” said Carey, whose agency regulates insurance providers that offer plans through the CoverME.gov state marketplace, after the round table.
More than 2,000 people who buy marketplace health insurance have already canceled their 2026 coverage, according to Hilary Schneider, director of the Office of the Health Insurance Marketplace. Thousands have also chosen to purchase high deductible plans, she said, making themselves liable to pay large amounts out of pocket, because that is all they can afford.
“Even for those who have enrolled and have decided that they can afford the 2026 coverage, they are paying more than last year,” she said. “This is another necessary household cost, and it is rising as household budgets continue to get squeezed.”
During the event, Carey warned people to be wary of scammers selling cheap plans, which people may resort to as authorized plans through CoverME.gov get more expensive. 
“People are going to start looking at alternatives, which worries me, because I’m going to have to deal with the consequences,” Carey said. “If people resort to alternatives that aren’t regulated by the bureau, these bad actors aren’t regulated by us, they don’t answer to us.”
These cheap plans don’t cover most services — something that customers often learn after they are already on the line for those costs, which Carey said can be worse than being uninsured.
Lack of affordable alternatives 
The cost of insurance is increasing in general next year, including for those who have insurance through their employers, because health care services are getting more expensive, Carey said. 
But the steepest increases will be felt by people like Phipps, whose tax credits are expiring.
Ossian Riday of Topsham told the panel that he originally delayed starting his own business because he was worried about insurance costs, and was only able to after the enhanced premium tax credits were put into place.
Last year, Riday was paying roughly $8,000 a year for his family, which rose to $13,000 this year. Now, if the subsidy expires, Riday’s family faces an annual rate of $29,000, which with out-of-pocket costs could go as high as $42,000.
“This is basically the equivalent of purchasing a new car every year,” Riday said. “The medical insurance system in the U.S. is broken, and without government intervention, it will only get worse.” 
Since the federal government shutdown concluded without an extension of the credits, Mainers have been warning about what their projected costs would mean for their lives and livelihoods.
At a Friday press conference hosted by the Maine Democratic Party, Portland-based artist Justin Levesque shared how he was born with a chronic condition called hemophilia, which makes him dependent on medication. 
Levesque said his insurance premium could double or triple, going up to $600 or $700 a month, which would throw his future as an artist into question.
“If folks can’t access their medication because they can’t even afford the premium, we’re going to see deaths, and we’re going to see people coming to harm,” Levesque said. “The ACA, being able to afford it, has changed my life. It has allowed me to follow my dreams and I’m really worried about the future.”
Pingree said Monday the people who will lose health insurance — small business owners, farmers, service industry workers and artists — make up a large portion of Maine’s economy. 
“Based on so many of these stories, there isn’t anywhere to turn, there isn’t an affordable plan,” she said. This is going to “have a huge detrimental impact on the Maine economy and the things we’re so proud of, growing our small businesses and our entrepreneurship and keeping more people in Maine.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1334-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-25 04:56:27.499571

And Republican businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, right, who has been officially endorsed for governor by the Ohio Republican Party. (Photos/Graphic by  WEWS.)The Ohio governor’s race is narrowing as Democrat Dr. Amy Acton gears up for a fight against Republican Vivek Ramaswamy, likely avoiding a costly primary battle.
“Together, we are going to build the Ohio that we all want to live in,” Acton said in an interview on Friday afternoon.
Former Congressman Tim Ryan announced this morning that he will not be running for governor. This means Acton will remain the Democratic frontrunner.
But for Acton, Friday was just another day on the campaign trail.
We asked Acton if Ryan’s announcement came as a surprise.
“People like to create stories and drama, but I can tell you the work that we’re doing on the ground every day has been my focus,” Acton said.
She is also focused on facing off against Ramaswamy.
GOP leader Tony Schroeder said he was never worried about Ramaswamy’s chances, but the party would be more prepared to fight Ryan.
“Our great vice president, then-Senator JD Vance, showed us a pretty good lesson on how to defeat Tim Ryan, and the playbook was already there,” Schroeder said. “I think the playbook would be a little different this time.”
Each candidate is focusing on affordability, but Acton hopes to sway voters by supporting public education and health care.
Ramaswamy hopes to, and is succeeding, at getting the backing of Ryan’s former union support.
“While the Democrats have spent months fighting to secure their shrinking base, Vivek has been talking to voters of all political persuasions to build an unprecedented coalition of support that includes conservative leaders and farmers to truckers and labor unions — and we’re just getting started,” Ramaswamy’s spokesperson Connie Luck said after Ryan’s decision was announced.
“If you’re receiving union backing as a conservative Republican, you’re reaching a different sort of coalition, and I think that’s what we’re looking at coming into 2026,” Schroeder said.
Both Ramaswamy and Acton are also trying to make their campaigns about uniting the state, with Acton reminding the public that she worked closely with Gov. Mike DeWine.
The governor, unlike the majority of the Statehouse and congressional leaders, has not endorsed a candidate.
Previously, he told us he would support the Republican Party. Several weeks ago, he told us he would be endorsing Ramaswamy “soon.”
We asked him Friday why he had not endorsed Ramaswamy yet.
“That’s coming very soon,” he responded.
Pressed on when, but the governor smirked.
Acton and Ramaswamy have raised record amounts, money that Acton will get to save for the general election — instead of a contentious primary.
We asked Acton if she thinks the Democratic Party can now fully come together to support her.
“Well, I think what I’m seeing is that people in Ohio are uniting, uniting to create the kind of state that we all want to live in, that we all deserve,” Acton said.
She said she has started vetting for her lieutenant governor, which both she and Ramaswamy are expected to announce in the coming weeks.
Other candidates who have filed to run for governor include Republican Philip Funderburg, Democrat Jacob Chiara, and independent Tim Grady.
Heather Hill had previously announced she would run as a Republican but later stated she would run as either a Libertarian, an independent, or a member of Elon Musk’s America Party — a party that is not yet recognized in Ohio.
Together, that group has reported having about $1,500 cash on hand.
In contrast, Ramaswamy reported raising $9.7 million, and Acton reported about $1.4 million.
To make the primary ballot, a governor and lieutenant governor candidate must collect petition signatures together.
Party candidates have a deadline of Feb. 4.
For major parties, teams must collect at least 1,000 valid signatures, and minor parties have to collect 500.
Independents must have 5,000 signatures in by May 4.

(Getty Images)If you practice social work in Kansas or Missouri, you already know that access to care is more than a clinical question. It is a social justice question.
With the recent federal government shutdown and the expiration of pandemic-era telehealth waivers for Medicare, we are now witnessing disruptions that directly threaten vulnerable clients, our practices, and the wider social welfare network.
In October, funding and authorizations for key telehealth flexibilities under Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services lapsed. These waivers had allowed Medicare beneficiaries to receive telehealth services from home, including audio-only in many cases, removed geographic or originating-site restrictions, allowed a broader list of providers, and sustained the “hospital-at-home” model.
Although CMS says providers may still furnish telehealth services, reimbursement is no longer guaranteed.
For social workers in Kansas and Missouri, our clients face transportation barriers, rural isolation, chronic illness, caregiving demands, mental health needs, and limited mobility. Telehealth has offered a lifeline: home-based services, flexible scheduling, connections across distances. The sudden uncertainty or withdrawal of coverage threatens these gains.
Social workers often deliver or coordinate mental health, substance use, family support, trauma recovery, and other interventions. The tele-behavioral-health flexibilities have been among the more stable, but the broader telehealth framework’s disruption increases the potential for fragmentation of care. And while some behavioral health “home rules” are permanent, many allied services are now destabilized.
The dilemma faced by practitioners in Kansas and Missouri is: Do they continue telehealth with risk of non-reimbursement? Do they revert to in-person only and lose clients who cannot attend? Do they shift staff, workflows, scheduling, risk financial loss, and cut services? This is a major burden on the social work infrastructure.
In the rural counties of Kansas and Missouri, where provider scarcity, long travel distances, and transportation already existed as barriers, telehealth offered a way to increase access. Rolling back those flexibilities threatens to widen disparities and access to critical services.
Social workers have always stood at the intersection of care and policy. This moment is no different. It demands raising our voices with state legislatures, federal representatives, provider coalitions, and communities to ensure that access isn’t rolled back at a time when many of our clients have fewer alternatives.
A stable, predictable telehealth reimbursement environment is critical. Our state practices cannot carry indefinite uncertainty while caring for older adults, rural clients, homebound persons, trauma survivors, and families. Making telehealth flexibilities permanent, or at least multi-year, is not a luxury. It’s a necessity for continuity of care, especially in underserved regions.
Funding and reimbursement must account for the full spectrum of care — not just physician visits but therapy, social work, behavioral health, speech/OT/physical therapy, case management, and community-based wraparound services.
Kansas and Missouri should consider state-level policies and reimbursements to supplement or backstop federal gaps, ensuring no one falls through the cracks when federal policy fluctuates. Social workers in community-based settings, especially those serving marginalized populations, should be included in crafting telehealth policy and program implementation, given our experience with access, equity, digital divides, trauma-responsive care, and culturally sensitive outreach.
To my colleagues in Kansas and Missouri, review your service models. Identify which clients rely on telehealth and map out alternative plans in case reimbursement is delayed or revoked.
Document the impact on clients who lose access or experience delays in services, and increased emergency visits or crises triggered by disruptions. This evidence will be crucial for advocacy. Engage with state chapters of the National Association of Social Work, other social work associations, Medicaid directors, and local behavioral health authorities to raise these issues and propose solutions. Most importantly, communicate with your clients. Be transparent about possible changes. Some may no longer qualify for certain telehealth visits or may have to shift to in-person. Your honesty is especially important during times of upheaval.
For social workers in Kansas and Missouri, this is a moment of real risk and real agency. The lapse of telehealth waivers isn’t just a bureaucratic hiccup. It has the potential to undo gains in access, equity, trauma-responsive care, and community-based support that our profession has worked hard to build. But it is also an opportunity to show how social work bridges practice and policy, care and advocacy, local realities, and federal frameworks.
Our clients deserve no less than consistent, accessible service. Our states deserve a system that leverages telehealth’s promise. And our profession must step forward to ensure no one is left behind.

In his recent article, Nick Evans quotes Ohio state lawmaker Thaddeus Clagget as saying, “(i)t makes no difference the ability of a donkey to speak, that does not make the donkey a human, okay?”
As directors of the Laboratory for the Future of Citizenship, which studies how technology is reshaping the legal and philosophical foundations of personhood and belonging, we agree. But we have concerns about the approach Ohio House Bill 469 takes to AI safety, not only for Ohio, but as precedent for other jurisdictions.
If passed, it would be one of the most sweeping and consequential pieces of AI legislation in the country because it would outlaw not only human-AI marriage, but also rule on a question of metaphysics — whether it is possible for beings made of metal and silicon to have feelings.
It would go even further than the recently-passed law in Utah, which declares that no AI can ever be a person, no matter how person-like it may become.
What’s in Ohio’s proposal banning AI personhood

The stakes are high.
According to a recent survey conducted by the Center for Democracy and Technology, 19% of around 1000 9th to 12th graders surveyed said that they or someone they knew had been in a “romantic relationship” with an AI.
To be clear, we agree that humans should not be allowed to marry large language models like ChatGPT.
We also agree that it is unlikely that today’s AI systems are conscious or sentient (one of us is a philosophy professor, and the other is a human rights lawyer. We have thought about these questions quite a bit).
The problem is that Ohio’s bill doesn’t stop there.
Ohio H.B. 469 defines “artificial intelligence” so broadly that it could apply to “any software, machine, or system capable of simulating human-like cognitive functions, including learning or problem solving.”
This is far-reaching.
Consider the future of medicine: neural implants that use AI to restore memory in people with Alzheimer’s, or prosthetic limbs driven by machine-learning algorithms interpreting neural signals.
Under the bill’s current language, such systems could qualify as “artificial intelligence.”
If part of a person’s cognition or motor control is mediated by AI, does that make them partly AI?
Would Ohio’s law mean that a veteran with a bionic limb or a patient with an AI-driven brain implant couldn’t legally marry?
The drafters of the bill surely didn’t intend that outcome, but that’s the point.
Overbroad definitions make bad law. Instead of limiting its scope to what currently exists and is known about AI, the law attempts to legislate the unknown and unknowable future of a tech that just a few years ago would have sounded like impossible science fiction.
Imagine if someone had written a law in the 1700s setting a forever speed limit of 10 miles per hour for all wheeled transport. That might have made sense for carts, but not so much for airplanes.
Yet that’s what this bill attempts to do for artificial intelligence.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Consider animals.
The law asserts that animals are not people. That is why you cannot marry them.
It is not necessary to add that animals don’t have feelings (as we philosophers would put it: that they aren’t “sentient”, or “conscious”). It is a question of fact whether animals have feelings, not a matter for the law to decide.
And we don’t need to deny that animals can have feelings to explain why it isn’t ok (and shouldn’t be legal) for humans to marry them.
Yet, bill H.B. 469 declares that no AI systems may ever be sentient or conscious.
Contrast H.B. 469 with the model rules on declaring a human to be brain dead, The Uniform Determination of Death Act, which contains numerous scientifically established indicators that must be met and is frequently reviewed and updated with the latest findings on consciousness in the human brain.
If the Ohio bill passes, no amount of testing or indicators could ever be enough to establish AI consciousness, no matter what might develop in the future.
None of this means we should open the door to exploitative or absurd forms of “AI marriage.”
Laws can and should protect vulnerable people from predatory relationships with software, as well as from corporate manipulation of emotionally dependent users.
But a sound approach would define the problem narrowly, for example, banning contracts or ceremonies purporting to create legal marriage with text-based auto-regressive LLMs, rather than issuing sweeping, metaphysical bans that will age as badly as 18th-century laws about airplanes.
We commend Ohio in taking the initiative to lead in AI governance, but what we need is humility.
Lawmakers should invite scientists, ethicists, and legal scholars into the drafting process and build in a requirement for periodic review as the technology evolves. AI is moving fast, but we must not panic.
Premature legislation can cause problems in the future, just as inadequate legislation may.

Many organizations that feed families, house the homeless, mentor children, and care for the most vulnerable in our communities have had to scale back their programs after critical federal support was cut.
In October, the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance released a survey of 72 nonprofit organizations. Of that group, 33 percent reported federal funding loss or delay in federal funding, and 44 percent said they had to reduce or eliminate their programs as a result. These nonprofits are the front line of Connecticut’s social safety net. When one falls behind, the ripple effect is felt across schools, hospitals and neighborhoods. That strain is only growing as federal funding shrinks and demand for services continues to rise.
National data from earlier this year paint the same picture. Most nonprofits can’t cover their full operating costs without the support of government funding. Without their financial support, somewhere between 60 to 80 percent of nonprofits in each state would be operating in the red.
Nonprofits have long been critical partners in meeting community needs. But they can’t carry the burden alone when the foundation beneath them has shifted. Here in Connecticut, the sudden loss or freeze of federal funds has left organizations scrambling. Food banks, domestic violence shelters and community clinics have reported scaling back their services or delaying programs, leaving the people who rely on them the most without the support they need.

That impact hits home. Frontline staff and volunteers have no choice but to stretch limited resources to meet the growing community needs. I think about all the parents waiting for a hot meal for their children, seniors relying on a clinic and families seeking shelter. When nonprofits are forced to cut back, people feel the consequences immediately and deeply.

My career in philanthropy has been dedicated to making generosity more accessible, smarter and impactful. From co-founding a global education nonprofit to creating early online giving platforms and now launching Charity Bridge Fund, I’ve seen how connecting donors to real-time needs can make a significant difference. The goal is simple: make sure nonprofits that are struggling receive the support they need to ensure they can continue to serve their communities. 
Charity Bridge Fund is a new initiative designed to help donors stay informed on the impacts of the widespread loss of federal funding. For decades, the federal government helped safeguard many of our country’s basic needs, supporting food access, housing stability, education and community health. With recent reductions in federal funding, many of these essential needs are now at risk, reminding us that private giving must also help sustain the core services that keep our communities strong. 
This initiative raises awareness of the urgent needs created by loss of funds, offering a list of affected projects by cause and geography, insight into the short-term impact of sudden decreased funds, and the long-term societal risk of losing critical social programs. 
As we work to protect this vital network, it’s important to understand what these changes look like on the ground. We invite nonprofits to share their stories on the platform, detailing how these cuts have impacted their work. Doing so provides access to matching dollars and opportunities for broader visibility, helping elevate their voices and drive meaningful action.
The safety net only works when every part holds together. Our local nonprofits have carried us through recessions, pandemics and policy shifts. Today, many of them are at risk. If we want them to survive, we must act now. Every donation, step of support and connection made today helps protect the people in our community tomorrow. 
Connecticut’s nonprofits are holding the line. It’s time for us to ensure they have the support they need.

Crankfield, a counselor at Crofton High School in Anne Arundel County, was named the 2026 American School Counselor Association National Counselor of the Year last week. She is the first Marylander to win the national award that was started by the association in 2008.
She will be honored by the association in Washington, D.C., in January and recognized by the state Board of Education at its Dec. 9 meeting.
“Ms. Crankfield is an exceptional school counselor and an even more remarkable person,” Crofton High School Principal Greg Ryan said in a statement. “She empowers students to thrive academically, socially and emotionally, while also strengthening our staff by fostering positive relationships, encouraging collaboration, and challenging us to bring our very best to our students each day.”

Crankfield has been a school counselor since 2010, and has been at Crofton since it opened in 2020. It was in that year, according to the school counselor association, that Crankfield disaggregated course enrollment data to determine whether the school had a course access gap, particularly in honors and Advanced Placement courses.
The data showed Black and Latino students were disproportionately taking standard-level courses rather than honors and Advanced Placement classes.
The association said Crankfield created guidelines for middle and high school teachers to use when making core course recommendations. In addition, she collaborated with the testing coordinator and department chairs in several content areas to promote higher-level courses and honors and advanced placement electives that met students’ interests.
Over time, Crankfield’s work decreased the access gap for students so that the advanced lever courses more reflects the diversity and composition of the Crofton High School student population.
“Danielle represents the very best in professional school counseling from her commitment to her students’ academic, college/career and social/emotional success, to her reputation among her peers as Crofton High School’s ‘North Star,’” Molly McCloskey, a member of the counselor of the year selection committee, said in a statement. “Her excellence is not only in what she does, but in the way she does it – authentically and with an eye toward meaningful, measurable results.”
Crankfield credited her colleagues and her students for her success.
“I stand alongside an amazing team with strong district support that I could not do this work without. This work will continue and we will make the program even better,” Crankfield said in a statement.
.To every student, whether on my caseload or not, this award is because of you. Your success. Your ability to do what you want in this world is what motivates me every single day,” she said in her statement. “This is for you.”
The award was open to state school counselors of the year from all 50 states. Crankfield was one of five national finalists, who included elementary school counselors from Woodbridge, Virginia, and Youngsville, Louisiana; a middle school counselor from Burlington, North Carolina; and a high school counselor from Kahului, Hawaii.
All five will be honored in Washington, D.C., in January. They will also participate in online events during National School Counseling Week starting Feb. 2-6.

On Monday afternoon, Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced he had selected Ralph Samuels, a former state legislator, businessman and tourism expert, to serve on the board in a public seat formerly occupied by Richards, whose term was slated to expire this year.
The board directs Alaska’s $85 billion Permanent Fund, whose investments are the source of more than 60% of the state’s general-purpose revenue. That money is used annually for services and the annual Permanent Fund dividend.
Richards had served on the board since 2015, first under then-Gov. Bill Walker, and then under Dunleavy, who appointed him to a four-year term as a public member of the board in 2021. 
Richards did not immediately answer a message left on his cellphone. It was not immediately clear whether he had sought another term but was passed over by the governor.
Samuels also did not immediately answer a message left on his cellphone.
A statement announcing Samuels’ appointment did not include a comment from Richards or note his departure.
Of Samuels, the governor said, “He is a lifelong Alaskan with an innate understanding of our state’s business and political landscape. As a Trustee he will bring that experience and insight to managing Alaska’s sovereign wealth fund not only for today, but for future generations of Alaskans.”
Under Richards, who chaired the Board of Trustees from 2018 through 2022, the board launched a controversial in-state investment program that has yet to deliver positive results. 
The board in recent years has also intensified its warnings about the threat that the fund may run out of spendable money in the coming years. 
An analysis paper commissioned during Richards’ time on the board suggests that a constitutional amendment may be needed to change the Permanent Fund’s structure to firmly cap the amount of money that may be spent from the fund and to consolidate the fund’s current two-account structure.

Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal appeals court was wrong when it ordered a new trial for Jeremiah Antoine Sweeney, who was convicted of second-degree murder for an April 2010 shooting in Prince George’s County, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday.
In a unanimous, unsigned ruling, the justices reversed the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which the high court said had wrongly ruled for Sweeney based on a claim that he “never asserted” in his appeal.
The justices wrote that Sweeney made “one, and only one claim” in his appeal — that his attorney at his trial was ineffective. His attorney put on no witnesses or evidence, and failed to question jurors to see if they had been influenced by one juror who made an unauthorized visit to the crime scene.
“Instead of ruling on that claim, the Fourth Circuit devised a new one, based on a ‘combination of extraordinary failures from juror to judge to attorney,’” the high court said in its ruling. “The Fourth Circuit’s ‘radical transformation’ of Sweeney’s simple ineffective-assistance claim ‘departed so drastically from the principle of party presentation as to constitute an abuse of discretion.’”
Attar, co-defendants plead not guilty in alleged blackmailing scheme

The justices wrote in their brief, four-page ruling that “’the parties frame the issues for decision,’ while the court serves as ‘neutral arbiter of matters the parties present.’” It sent the case back to the circuit court with instructions to reconsider Sweeney’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim only, in light of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which severely limits relief on appeal.
The Maryland Office of the Attorney General, which represented Prince George’s County in the case, declined to comment Monday on the high court’s ruling.
Jo-Ann Tamila Sagar, listed as an attorney for Sweeney, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A Prince George’s jury found Sweeney guilty in 2011 of second-degree murder, attempted murder and weapons violations in a 2010 shooting during an argument over stolen marijuana, that ended up killing a bystander 75 yards away. He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms, plus 30 years.
Sweeney’s state court appeals were rejected, and his first post-conviction appeal to the federal system — claiming ineffective assistance of counsel — was turned down at the district court level.
But a divided three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit disagreed in March, ruling that Sweeney deserved a new trial.
Circuit Judge Roger Gregory, in a 46-page opinion joined by Judge Terence W. Boyle, wrote that the case was built entirely on eyewitnesses who identified Sweeney “as the shooter — late at night, on a crowded street,” where “vantage point was an issue; light was an issue,” and a murder weapon was never found.
When Juror No. 4 went to inspect the crime scene on his own, and then joined deliberations with the rest of jury before the judge was alerted, it threatened Sweeney’s right “to a fair and impartial jury, reaching a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in the courtroom,” Gregory wrote. But he said Juror No. 4 was “just the tip of the iceberg.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Despite this, the judge allowed Juror No. 4 to return to the jury lounge with the other jurors for over an hour, with no instruction that they not deliberate,” according to the opinion. “After ultimately excusing Juror No. 4, the judge never instructed the remaining eleven jurors that they were not to consider anything Juror No. 4 had told them.”
“Judge and defense counsel both failed in their responsibilities. The trial court judge did not properly inquire into the jury taint” by Juror No. 4, he wrote, and Sweeney’s attorney “rendered representation far short of what is objectively reasonable.”
“The breakdown of the judicial process in this case – from juror to judge to attorney – deprived Sweeney of his constitutional rights, and he is therefore entitled to a new trial,” Gregory wrote.
But Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr., in a 50-page dissent, said that Sweeney raised only one claim in his appeal — not receiving competent representation at trial. Despite that, the majority “raises on its own, and then decides the case on, a totally different ground from what Sweeney argued to the state courts, to the district court or to us on appeal,” justifying its decision based on “the special circumstances” of Sweeney’s case.
“That alone is a problem. What’s the standard for this? It seems purely subjective. Like beauty, special  circumstances are in the eye of the beholder,” Quattlebaum wrote.
“We are not free to scour the record for issues that we think are important when the parties never raised them below and then dispense our subjective views of justice. That, however, is exactly what the majority does,” he wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC03528-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 22:56:53.302076

King/Mississippi Today)Illicit drug overdoses and the deaths they cause are trending down this year, despite spikes in a handful of states, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A handful of places with rising overdoses are responding to the problem with cooperation, they say, by sharing information about overdose surges and distributing emergency medication.
“The national conversation is just about warships in the Caribbean and drones and borders,” said Nabarun Dasgupta, who studies overdose trends at the University of North Carolina. “It discounts this huge groundswell of Americans taking care of Americans.
“There’s a huge amount of caregiving and tending to the needs of local communities that is being done in a non-flashy way because this is hard, slow work.”
Overdose deaths have been dropping steadily since 2023. As of April, the latest date available, deaths were at 76,500 for the previous 12 months — their lowest level since March 2020. A pandemic spike in overdose deaths drove the number as high as almost 113,000 in the summer of 2023, according to federal statistics.
President Donald Trump has ordered more than a dozen military strikes against boats in the open waters of the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean since Sept. 2, claiming without publicized evidence that their occupants were drug runners bringing narcotics to the United States. Nearly 60 people have been killed.
The bulk of deadly fentanyl is smuggled over the border with Mexico in passenger cars, according to a September report by the federal Government Accountability Office. Chemicals and equipment, mostly from China, are smuggled in via cargo trucks, commercial ships, airplanes and the mail, according to the report.
A more timely indicator of overdoses — nonfatal suspected overdose patients in hospital emergency departments — was down 7% this year through August compared with 2024, according to Stateline’s analysis of CDC statistics.
The nonfatal overdoses were up for the year in only a few states and the District of Columbia. The largest spikes were 17% in the District, 16% in Rhode Island, 15% in Delaware, 11% in Connecticut and 10% in New Mexico, with smaller increases in Colorado, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, South Dakota, Utah, New Jersey and Minnesota.
Other states saw drops in nonfatal overdoses: Maryland had the largest decrease through August, about 17%.

But Baltimore had an attention-grabbing cluster of 42 overdoses between July and October, all within the same neighborhood. No fatalities were reported. The cluster led the city to set aside $2 million in October for more mobile services, harm reduction and social supports to fight overdoses.
New Mexico is seeing more overdoses and more deaths than the previous year in three counties on the Colorado border. In response, New Mexico is distributing both warnings and naloxone, an opioid-overdose antidote.
Officials are giving naloxone to storekeepers near overdose sites and alerting those seeking services about the deadly threat in the local supply.
“We started planning naloxone saturation and different types of outreaches so we can hopefully stem this from getting even worse,” said David Daniels, harm reduction section manager in the New Mexico health department.
“Putting messaging directly into clients’ hands is extremely valuable. That might be, ‘If you’re choosing to use, don’t use the regular amount. Maybe you should use a quarter of it. Test it out first,’” Daniels said.
The three counties in New Mexico — which include the capital city Santa Fe, ski resort Taos and Española, the setting of the 2023 TV black comedy series “The Curse” — saw about 438 more deaths from July through September than they did during the third quarter of 2024, according to Stateline calculations. That’s more than double the 383 overdose deaths for the area during the same time period last year.

Roger Montoya, a former Democratic state representative who runs an arts nonprofit in Rio Arriba County, said most of the deaths there have been among homeless substance users.
A local hospital has responded with programs to get treatment for more people, and his own Moving Arts Española group concentrates on helping children and young people break a cycle of economic despair that often leads to addiction and homelessness, he said.
“We try to redirect and strengthen the resiliency of young people who largely are being raised by grandparents and kin because mom and dad are either dead, on the street or incarcerated,” Montoya said.
But most states with overdose increases are still showing fewer deaths, mostly because the drug supply in the eastern United States is more likely to be cut with sedatives that don’t have the same deadly effect as fentanyl, though they can cause overdose.
The drugs linked to Baltimore’s mass overdoses were cut with an unusual, powerful sedative, according to federal testing. The sedative can cause people to lose consciousness but can’t itself be treated with reversal medication such as naloxone.
By contrast New Mexico’s tests on this year’s clusters generally found more deadly fentanyl than usual in the local supply, said Phillip Fiuty, a technical adviser on adulterant testing in the state health department.
Scott announces grants to combat overdoses in Baltimore after another mass overdose event

“We’re not seeing the type of adulteration they’re experiencing on the East Coast. Once something is in New Mexico, there’s little to no adulteration,” Fiuty said.
Some East Coast states are seeing more overdoses but fewer deaths. Rhode Island warned of spikes in nonfatal overdose in August and September, but deaths through September were still lower than during the same period last year, according to state figures.
That’s not always the case. Connecticut reported a surge of both fatal and nonfatal overdoses near interstate highways in May and June.
“One of the factors is change in the illicit drug supply or bad batches. I think that’s what’s playing out now. The drug supply is increasingly unpredictable,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
The association has a suggested framework for community response to spikes, but cities and counties may be hampered by a new aggressiveness on enforcement and more hostility to local efforts to stop deaths, she said.
The current Trump administration has shown some reluctance to support community harm reduction techniques, she said. That includes the temporary suspension of $140 million in funds for a program called Overdose Data to Action, known as OD2A, that the first Trump administration started to sound the alarm when spikes happen.
“Given recent cuts to health care and substance use and overdose prevention services that we’re seeing, that is impacting some of the work on the ground,” Freeman said. “It’s pushing people away from being able to make the changes they need to make to change their lives. It has the potential to create more of an overdose problem.”

(Source: Waymo)Earlier this year, Montana passed a law allowing for the use of autonomous vehicles on the state’s roadways.
Part of the bill  — Senate Bill 67 —also gave the state’s Department of Transportation and Department of Justice some rulemaking authority over their use. 
“The intention of this legislation is to get all parties to the table to promote the safest ways to promote autonomous technology incorporating the diverse roadways, weather, and animal-human encounters in Montana and to make Montana the showcase for advancing new technologies in transportation,” the bill’s preamble states.
The Legislature’s interim transportation committee has taken up the issue as part of a study into mass transportation and sent state Sens. Russ Tempel and Denley Loge on a mission to Arizona to find out more about Waymo, an autonomous taxi service.
The pair spoke about the experience during the transportation committee meeting on Monday.
“When Senator Tempel ordered up the Waymo, a car pulled up with a little ball on top, and his initials were on it. That’s how we knew that was the one that was coming for him,” Loge, an St. Regis Republican, told the committee.
“It’s comparable to a taxi price, but it is impressive,” he added
They described that it changed speed limits appropriately, if fast (“It wasted no time,” Loge said) and that it turned corners well. It recognized a pickup truck pulling out in front and was able to change lanes without issue, they added.
Meetings with Waymo gave them an opportunity to see more of their business. Waymo officials were mum on the financial side of the business, but did describe the learning abilities of the software the cars run on. Essentially cars take photos of the route, learning curb heights and even if there’s a new pothole. They added that it seemed to perform well around pedestrians.
With emerging obstacles like a pothole, the car will download that information when it gets back and the other cars will now have the knowledge of the pothole as well.
“There was one instance there was a car backing out of a parking spot. It waited till that car got backed out, and then it took that spot to go into the charger,” Loge said. “And I asked the guys, I said, is it like milk cows? They go back to the same stall? And they said, ‘No, they talk to each other, and whatever stall is open, they go to, and if somebody’s backing out, it waits, or it backs up, if it has to.’ It’s pretty incredible.”
The committee did have some questions, including on animal collisions and road conditions. Part of SB 67 gives the Department of Transportation some authority over that matter, including limiting autonomous vehicles in certain situations, but also allows the department the ability to exempt them as well. 
“The Department of Transportation may exempt from limitation commercial vehicles with an automated driving system that are demonstrated to be capable of operating safely during dangerous road conditions,” the bill reads.The company is testing their vehicles in Buffalo, New York, though has been mostly limited to southern markets, they said.
The Department of Justice has some authority, too.
“The Department of Justice shall consult interested stakeholders prior to proposing rules on vehicles with an automated driving system, such as members of the transportation interim committee and representatives of law enforcement agencies, motor vehicle and insurance industries, drivers, pedestrians, and tribal and local governments.”
The lawmakers also got some advice on rulemaking from the mayor of Mesa, who said part of the reason Waymo came to the city was because they didn’t put any restrictions up.
“One thing he mentioned was, ‘Be careful putting any restrictions on these things until they work through it and explain to you what they’re capable of,’” said Tempel, a Chester Republican.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WAYMO-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 21:57:20.416623

Ned Lamont’s reelection kickoff found  Connecticut voters give him a solid approval rating, but a significant minority are “indifferent or neutral” about him serving a third term.
A Nutmeg State Poll released Monday by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center found voters approve of his performance by a margin of 55% to 38%, a net approval rating of +17, virtually unchanged since September.
Lamont’s challenger for the Democratic nomination, Rep. Josh Elliott of Hamden, barely made an impression among likely Democratic voters after four months of campaigning. Nearly 80% had no opinion of him, while 69% had a favorable opinion of the two-term governor.
If a Democratic primary were held today, the poll found Lamont outpolling Elliott, 55% to 7%, with 37% undecided and 2% saying they would write in someone else.
The data released Monday offered no matchups between Lamont and either of the two Republican candidates, Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich or former Mayor Erin Stewart of New Britain.
Overall, 34% of voters were enthusiastic (11%) or satisfied (23%) about Lamont’s candidacy for a third term, while 31% were dissatisfied (21%) or angry (10%), 28% indifferent or neutral, and 6% unsure. 
Among Democratic voters, the poll found little evidence of the dissatisfaction that liberal Democratic lawmakers have expressed about Lamont over his refusal to embrace a more progressive tax code or higher spending.
Eighty-seven percent of self-described liberals, 76% of progressives and 63% of moderates had favorable opinions of Lamont. Forty-eight percent of socialists had a favorable opinion, but only 15% of socialists were negative. 
Asked to name the most important problems facing Connecticut, the cost of living was named by 22%, following by taxes (18%), housing (15%), jobs and the economy (10%) and immigration (5%). Four percent mentioned national issues or the federal government.
The poll was conducted from Nov. 12 to 17 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5% percent on questions posed to all voters and 6.5% on questions posed only to likely Democratic voters.

As urban Alaska’s electric utilities look to import natural gas to fill a looming supply gap, residents and businesses face a future surge in electricity and heating prices.
 




Some of the price increase is unavoidable: Importing gas will require expensive infrastructure, and those construction costs will be paid by consumers.
 




But observers of the state’s urban electric and gas utilities are now warning of an even more painful possibility: Customers could be charged tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars for work that may not benefit them.
 



Urban Alaska’s privately-owned gas utility, Enstar, hopes to bill its customers to reimburse a project developer’s study costs for one import project — even if the project isn’t built.
 


There’s also a risk that the region’s utilities could build two separate import projects to meet differing priorities and timelines when one project could be enough to meet demand.

“The ultimate horror show is we end up with two projects,” said Antony Scott, a former Alaska public utility regulator who now works as an analyst for a green energy organization, Renewable Energy Alaska Project. “If each project is going to cost a half a billion dollars and you have two of them, then we’re paying half a billion for no reason.”
Scott is personally skeptical that more than one import facility will ultimately be built given the substantial expense involved, and he thinks competition could be good for consumers as long as only one project emerges.
But for now, two separate projects are moving ahead.
Collaboration, then a split
One of the two projects is led by Harvest, an affiliate of the privately held oil and gas company Hilcorp.
Harvest’s project would repurpose a dormant liquefied natural gas export plant on the Kenai Peninsula so that it can receive cargoes of LNG shipped in from outside Alaska.
The retrofitting plan, according to utility studies and officials involved, could cost $500 million or more, and it has at least one major potential customer lined up: Anchorage’s cooperatively owned electric utility, Chugach Electric Association, which has endorsed the project. Harvest last week announced that it had finalized a deal to buy the plant from its previous owner for an undisclosed sum.

Meanwhile, Enstar, the natural gas utility, is working with another energy company, Glenfarne, on a separate project, also on the Kenai Peninsula.
That project would involve construction of new LNG imports infrastructure and, according to Enstar President John Sims, could also cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
Urban Alaska’s other three electric utilities — one on the Kenai Peninsula, one in the Mat-Su north of Anchorage, and one in Fairbanks — could end up procuring imported gas from either project, though no formal agreements have been announced.
The parallel development efforts represent a significant split among urban Alaska’s utilities — which, according to regulators and watchdogs, also drove up costs for consumers by failing to coordinate when they spent $1.5 billion on new power plants and other infrastructure in recent years.

Sims acknowledged as much, and said he’d welcome intervention from regulators to encourage closer collaboration.
“It’s a mathematical certainty. All the load on the same project reduces the cost,” Sims said in an interview. “This isn’t the only example where utilities can’t work together and it’s cost ratepayers more.”
Chugach, Enstar and the other urban Alaska electric utilities had previously been studying import projects cooperatively in an Enstar-led working group they formed in 2022 in response to the impending gas shortage.
But then, earlier this year, Chugach effectively split off in its partnership with Harvest, according to Sims — who said in an interview that he was “very surprised” and only learned of that separate project when he heard a rumor about it the night before it was announced.
The announcement underscored an already tense relationship between Enstar and Hilcorp, the Harvest affiliate. The two companies had been feuding in court over the terms of an existing, unrelated natural gas supply contract.
Sims has said publicly that his company is not interested in participating in a project that could further consolidate the position of Hilcorp, which is currently urban Alaska’s dominant supplier to utilities of locally produced natural gas.
The Enstar-Glenfarne project, Sims said, would have the advantage of being what’s known as a “greenfield” facility — meaning it’s newly built — in contrast to the existing facilities that Harvest wants to repurpose.
“If you’re going to be spending half a billion dollars, I’d much rather do it on greenfield than something where I don’t know what I’m digging into,” he said.

A spokeswoman for Chugach, the Anchorage electric utility, said that the region’s dependence on Hilcorp is not inherently problematic and that the company has been an “excellent business partner.”
Chugach, said spokeswoman Julie Hasquet, is pursuing the retrofit because of how quickly the project can launch — as soon as 2026, according to Harvest. Chugach’s primary contract for locally produced natural gas ends in 2028, while the Enstar-Glenfarne project isn’t expected to come online until 2029 at the earliest.
“Our plans are not only the most cost-effective and closest to completion but are designed to be flexible, scalable and work with other long-term supply options to continue offering valuable service to Alaskans well into the future,” Harvest’s chief executive, Jason Rebrook, said in a prepared statement.
Sims said he thinks utilities could work together to stretch out scarce gas supplies so that Chugach could wait until the Glenfarne-Enstar project comes online.
No ‘blank check’ for Enstar
Some of Enstar’s customers, meanwhile, are raising concerns about what they describe as an unusual arrangement with Glenfarne that they say shifts risk to consumers.
Enstar, in filings with state utility regulators, said Glenfarne is expected to spend up to $48 million studying the project before making a final decision on whether to build it. If it’s not built, Enstar will still have to reimburse Glenfarne for those costs — and it aims to raise that money by billing its customers.
Residential consumers would see increases to their bills of $15 a month over the course of a year, Enstar said in its preliminary filing with the Regulatory Commission of Alaska in January.
That filing drew sharp objections from some watchdogs and consumers. One lawyer representing a pair of Anchorage commercial real estate firms wrote in a comment that Enstar “seeks to shield its shareholders from any risk associated with exploring the potential construction of a project that may never provide any benefit to ratepayers.”
“Speculative, non-regulated projects that Enstar wants to engage in are an Enstar shareholder and owner issue, not a ratepayer issue,” Robin Brena, a veteran energy lawyer and co-owner of one of the real estate firms, said in a phone interview.
The commission rejected Enstar’s request for preapproval to bill customers up to $48 million to pay Glenfarne, saying in a formal order that it would not give Enstar a “blank check.”
Commissioners did, however, say they would consider allowing Enstar to recover up to $42 million once the money is spent — if the company can show those expenses were reasonable, among other conditions.
A Glenfarne spokesman referred a request for comment to Enstar.

Jim Pillen said his team is ""working our tails off"" to ""make lemonade"" out of the sour announcement that the Lexington Tyson Foods plant is to close in January. Dec. 27, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska “got our butts kicked” by the Tyson Foods decision to close a Lexington beef plant employing about 3,200 people, Gov. Jim Pillen said Monday. But he sees a possible Hail Mary pass to resurrect the industrial property.
Pillen, in an interview with the Nebraska Examiner on the agribusiness closure, said he learned officially of Tyson’s decision Friday at noon, just a few hours before the Arkansas-based multinational corporation made the news public.

He said his team had been seeking a meeting with company officials amid the struggles faced by the cattle industry, including cutters and other meat processors facing lower cattle supplies and higher retail prices for beef. 
The governor said he was told a key contributor to Tyson’s decision involved the age and inefficiencies of the Lexington factory, which was built decades ago to manufacture combines and other farm machinery. 
The “good news,” Pillen said, is that Tyson officials are exploring other options for the Lexington property, including repurposing it into a specialty, “value-added” agricultural operation akin to Tyson’s Omaha plant that produces millions of pounds of raw and cooked bacon. 
 Specialty meat operation? 

His hope, he said, is that the company might take a cattle carcass, for example, Pillen said, and create a specific type of steak or other commodity and make something people want, as does Tyson’s Omaha plant. 
“There [are] discussions going on within the Tyson organization, ‘How can we turn that plant into a value-added plant with either pork, beef or poultry because they’re in that space. That’s a real-life possibility,” Pillen said.
Tyson Foods did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The governor harkened back to the origins of the Lexington Tyson plant. It was built originally to manufacture farm implements for Sperry-New Holland, which during the farm crisis in 1985 announced it would close and eliminate 940 jobs.
IBP in 1990 opened the property as a converted meatpacking facility. The company later was acquired by Tyson Foods, doing pivotal work for ranchers in west-central Nebraska. Pillen said the plant might have survived this round of Tyson cuts had it been tailor-made for beef production.
“My guess would be that if that plant would have been built brand new from scratch, this is a conversation that wouldn’t be taking place,” Pillen said. “They took lemons after New Holland and made lemonade out of it for a while. But as it got really, really competitive, [and] it’s not really one of the best plants in the United States.”
Asked whether workforce availability problems influenced Tyson — including limited availability of temporary foreign workers and immigrants who have staffed many of the cutting-floor jobs — Pillen said he was told the Lexington plant had a “great team,” which “made it extra hard.”
“Tyson wants to turn it into something because … when you have a great team of people, the last thing you want to do is walk.”
 ‘Lived this nightmare before’ 

Nebraska’s congressional representatives have taken a harder line on the closing than Pillen, who defended Tyson as an American-owned meat-processing, protein provider. He has said he is not an advocate of foreign-owned businesses crowding the food space.
Nebraskans lament Tyson decision to close Lexington plant with 3,200 workers

Pillen’s family runs a massive hog and hog genetics operation based in Columbus, and his family has a significant ownership stake in a pork-production plant in Fremont. He said his family has long done business with Tyson’s plant in Madison. The company also has a major plant in Dakota City.
U.S. Rep Mike Flood, R-Neb, said in a video on social media that “we’ve lived this nightmare before,” when Tyson pulled out of Norfolk nearly 20 years ago.
He said the Tyson decision for Lexington “brought a lot of emotion back.” In 2006, he was a new state senator representing Norfolk when he said he got a call that the Norfolk plant would close and eliminate 1,300 jobs.
He showed a video of the abandoned Tyson plant in Norfolk and asked Tyson to help resurrect the Lexington facility in some way, even if for another company.
“We can do this much better,” he said. He also said, “There is life after Tyson,” adding that he worked with a local hospital in his northeast Nebraska town to build a nursing school. He said it helped create a “regional medical destination” with a health service system he called “unparalleled for a town our size.”
He said his city’s downtown has since seen major revitalization projects. 
 ‘Dude ranch’ fascination

Pillen acknowledged Tyson’s presence in other communities, saying,  “I think it’s incredibly important we’re focused on what we have.”
He said the state and its agricultural-focused economy cannot afford to feel sorry for itself. 
“What are we going to do?” he asked. “Wallow in the muck  … or are we going to roll up our sleeves and try to solve something?” He said he has spent much of his time since Friday “calling people and getting input” on next steps.

He said he has been privy to conversations about what it would take for the new Sustainable Beef in the North Platte area to take on a second shift  — perhaps opening slots earlier than anticipated for some Lexington-based workers. 
The Lexington plant is to close around Jan. 20. 
Pillen said one of the easiest, short-term ways to help might be to bus or transport former Lexington plant workers to the North Platte plant. He said Sustainable Beef already has hired many of their first 800 workers and a chunk was from Lexington. 
“So that transfer has been taking place,” he said. “We’re talking to people on all fronts to be able to get ideas and bring people together.” 
Pillen, Nebraska’s first farmer-governor in more than a century, talked about reasons behind the U.S. cattle shortage that has impacted meatpacking companies and processors. 
Among factors reducing the heads of cattle being raised, Pillen said, are extended drought conditions that shrank “mama cow herds” and bad winters that hurt cattle conception rates. He said the 2023 winter reduced herds and births by more than 300,000 cattle in Nebraska alone. 
Also, he said much ranch land is being gobbled up by rich people that prefer operating a “dude ranch” over raising cattle, which has contributed.
 ‘Gotta make lemonade’ 

Pillen said the number of jobs eliminated by Tyson may be lower than the 3,200 the company reported because of fewer shifts being run during tight times. But he called the loss devastating to a community of about 11,000 people in Dawson County. 
He urged Nebraskans to consider donating to charitable organizations, including local churches and civic groups trying to gather help for affected workers and their families over the holiday season.
He said Tyson didn’t ask for state incentives or other changes to keep the Lexington plant open. He said ag producers and industrial users are more interested in lasting property tax relief.
Tyson’s cuts stretched beyond Nebraska’s Lexington plant, which slaughtered up to 5,000 cattle a day, according to industry reports. The company said it was also downsizing a Texas beef plant to a single shift each day from two.
“We’re working our tails off,” Pillen said of his team. “This was a bad lemon drop day. But we gotta make lemonade out of it.”

Brad Little gives a press conference after delivering his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, in the Lincoln Auditorium in the Idaho Capitol. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Facing a significant projected budget deficit, Idaho lawmakers will have major spending and cutting decisions to make during the upcoming legislative session, Gov. Brad Little said Monday, though he remained seemingly optimistic.
Little, during an Idaho AARP telephone town hall, addressed questions regarding education, health care, immigration, and other issues. 
“There’s going to be some significant decisions that the Legislature is going to make this year, but I would project that generally, the state will continue with their upward trajectory,” Little said. “Right now, we’ve already had to dial back spending a little bit, mainly to compensate for some of the tax bills that we did in previous years and the (federal) Great Big Beautiful Bill is going to have another impact.” 
A recent Idaho Fiscal Policy Center report found that tax cuts over the past five years have reduced the state’s revenue by $4 billion since 2021, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
New report shows 5 years of Idaho income tax cuts have reduced state revenue by $4 billion

The projected budget deficit for the current fiscal year is $58.4 million, the Sun previously reported. The projection does not include the impact of the federal tax and spending budget package, or “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which could result in an additional $284.4 million reduction in annual revenue, according to an analysis by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy.  
The budget shortfall is estimated to increase over time, with one scenario shared with state budget committee members this month showing a potential $555.2 million deficit for fiscal year 2027.
Little said that about 22% of the state’s general fund is set aside in a rainy day fund for emergency use. 
“I don’t think it’s raining. I think there’s some clouds out there, but I don’t think it’s raining,” he said. “… our ethos in Idaho is, don’t spend money we don’t have, save for a rainy day, be prudent about it, don’t grow government too much, and that’s what we’ll continue to do going forward.” 
 Little: Private school choice tax credit unlikely to increase this year

Two callers questioned the governor about the school choice tax credit approved in 2025, which set aside $50 million for a $5,000 per student credit that could go toward education expenses, including private school tuition. House Bill 93 allows families with incomes at or below 300% of the federal poverty level to receive the money in an advance payment rather than reimbursement later. 
One caller questioned why Little signed the bill when more than 86% of those who contacted his office about the bill asked him to veto it, Idaho Education News reported
A Twin Falls resident asked, “Would you at least veto any increase, even if you won’t do anything about what you signed already?” 
Little responded that he would “be very surprised” if the Legislature added money to the program, because it’s still in its infancy. 
“We haven’t even started it yet, we’re just getting the rules in place to see how it works,” he said. 
He also said he signed the bill because he proposed school choice legislation in his 2025 State of the State Address, and said the bill met enough of his requirements to be “contained” and “means-tested,” or targeted only at certain income groups. 
The bill in its first year prioritizes families at or below the 300% poverty level, which for a family of four is an annual income of $96,450. However, in the later years, it prioritizes families who have previously received it. 
He also received a question about the accountability guidelines in the legislation and not being “as stringent” as they are for public schools. The requirements under the bill include that the money goes to K-12 education “that includes, at a minimum, English language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies,” according to the bill language. 
Little said the regulations on public K-12 schools are overly burdensome. 
“I, frankly, think we ought to look at the rules we have for public schools and make them more akin to charter schools,” he said. “I’m all for that.”

 Medicaid may face further cuts 

A St. Anthony resident, who said she had a child with autism and owned an agency that provided services to people with disabilities, questioned Little about the recent 4% cut to provider reimbursement rates for those who serve Medicaid patients. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced the cuts in August, a week after Little directed state agencies to cut mid-year budgets by 3% in response to the projected budget shortfall.

Little said that the budget for the program had grown too much. 
“As I look forward to Medicaid funding this coming year, it’s going to be a challenge again,” he said. “The bottom line is, the growth in Medicaid, both at the federal level and the state level, has been so large that it was just a matter of either terminating the program … or basically, dialing back the level of it so that my Medicaid budget balances, and we can live within the means we have there.” 
He noted there’s “not going to be a lot of new money this year,” and that the state was awaiting decision making by Congress regarding health care premium tax credits, which help keep insurance premium costs lower for private insurance purchased through the state marketplace and are set to expire this year. 
The congressional tax and spending megabill also included reductions in federal Medicaid spending of around $1 trillion over the decade. 
 Some lawmakers hope to address women’s health care shortage

A Lewiston resident said his adult children had moved out of Idaho because of a lack of job opportunities and because of Idaho’s strict felony abortion ban. 
“It’s just not reasonable or logical that they can’t be treated for miscarriage in Idaho, if they have severe complications of pregnancy, they have to go out of state to get treatment,” the caller said. 
Idaho’s law makes it a felony to provide an abortion in almost all cases except to remove a dead fetus, treat a molar pregnancy, prevent the death of the mother, and narrow circumstances involving rape and incest if a police report is provided in the first trimester. 
A study published this year found that Idaho lost more than a third of its practicing obstetrician providers since the state’s abortion ban went into effect, the Sun reported. 
Some Republican state lawmakers, including Rep. Mark Sauter, R-Coeur d’Alene, and Sen. Jim Woodward in the 2025 session, introduced legislation to add an exemption to the ban to protect the health of the mother, rather than prevent her death. None of the bills have received public hearings. 
Little noted that women’s health has been an issue discussed since the bill went into effect upon the U.S. Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022. 
He said there are “well-meaning people that are talking about some changes to that legislation.” 
“Idaho is never going to be a place where it’s a preferred place for abortions. That’s my position. That’s position the most Idaho,” he said. “But we want women’s health to be available at the highest level.” 
 Four ICE agents in Idaho, Little says 

A caller asked about immigration enforcement in Idaho, as it has escalated nationwide. 
Little said there are four federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents in Idaho. 
The governor noted that the Idaho State Police has signed what’s called a 287(g) agreement with the  ICE. The state approved ISP to spend up to $300,000 from the governor’s emergency fund to transport undocumented people to ICE detention facilities for deportation. 
Little said Monday the program is focused on people who have been convicted of separate crimes. 
“After they go through their due process, rather than turning them back out on the street that they’re they’re sent to their home country,” he said. 
Through this agreement, the state has transported more than 50 people to ICE detention centers. An analysis of criminal records by the Idaho Capital Sun found that most but not all had had convictions in Idaho, with some being charged and transported before their cases completed and a couple who had faced charges that were later dismissed.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Nov. 20, 2025.
For the second time in just over a year, farm workers and immigrant rights advocates last Saturday staged protests at multiple Hannaford supermarket locations to pressure the regional grocery chain to guarantee better labor conditions for dairy workers.
Locally, protesters gathered outside the Hannaford in Morrisville’s Fairground Plaza on Nov. 15 to push the company and its multinational Dutch parent company, Ahold Delhaize, to participate in immigrant rights advocacy group Migrant Justice’s Milk with Dignity program.
The Milk with Dignity program asks participating corporations to pay more for dairy products to ensure better working conditions for workers on dairy farms. Vermont-based ice cream giant Ben & Jerry’s has participated in the program since 2017.

In October, Vermont Way Foods, a progressive distributor of Vermont products, announced a partnership to allow Migrant Justice to monitor working conditions in their products’ dairy supply chain, and even promoted the partnership with a “Cheese with Dignity” product.
In a survey conducted by Migrant Justice of Vermont farmworkers, over two-thirds of survey takers said they make less than minimum wage — in some cases far less — while another two-thirds reported suffering an injury due to working conditions.
Though Migrant Justice has targeted Hannaford in pressure campaigns to join Milk with Dignity since 2019, the campaign has escalated since protestors last appeared at the Morrisville location in October 2024.
In April, Migrant Justice filed a complaint with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international trade forum in which 37 countries develop policy around economic trade, alleging “grave human rights violations” in Hannaford’s dairy supply chain.
With Hannaford under greater pressure, protestors returned to Fairground Plaza Saturday, Nov. 15 with makeshift instruments, blaring music and chants in English and Spanish, handing out flyers to would-be shoppers and asking them to boycott the supermarket for a day.

Ahold Delhaize responded by commissioning an independent human rights investigation. Migrant Justice “recently hosted the investigators charged with looking into labor violations, connecting them with workers on farms supplying Hannaford-brand milk,” the group said in a website post promoting the Nov. 15 protests, as investigators return to the Netherlands to submit their report.
Representatives for Portland, Maine-based Hannaford grocery or Ahold Delhaize did not respond to requests for comment.
With Hannaford under greater pressure, protestors returned to Fairground Plaza on with makeshift instruments, blaring music and chants in English and Spanish, handing out flyers to would-be shoppers and asking them to boycott the supermarket for a day.
A farmworker employed on a farm that guarantees fair labor conditions as part of the Ben & Jerry’s supply chain and asked that his name be withheld due to concerns of retaliation said that he valued the working conditions guaranteed by the Milk with Dignity program compared to what he sees on other farms.
“I have a voice, and I know that I have rights,” he said in Spanish, according to Migrant Justice spokesperson Will Lambek, who acted as translator. “For example, if I get sick, I can take a day off and I’ll still be paid for it. For Hannaford supply chain workers, even if they get sick, they have to keep working.”
Hannaford responded with an increased security detail, employing not just private security guards as they had the previous year but also law enforcement with the Morristown Police Department and the Lamoille County Sheriff’s Department. Officers questioned anyone attempting to park in the Hannaford parking lot to ensure only customers were allowed.
Farmworkers and activists gathered publicly on Nov. 15 even as federal immigration detainment actions have become increasingly common, with nine people detained in Hardwick in September and another seven detained after a targeted raid at a gas station in Jeffersonville earlier this month.
Eight people were detained after an immigration police raid on a Franklin County dairy farm in April, and Jose Ignacio De La Cruz, an organizer with Migrant Justice, and his stepdaughter were detained after being pulled over on the road by the United States Border Patrol in Richford in June.
“We are here again, speaking up and demanding our rights, and there is a lot of risk to that,” the farmworker said. “We understand that, but if we were to let ourselves be conquered by our fear, that would be letting them win.”

Gianforte and USFS Lolo Forest Supervisor Ben Johnson holding the permit for the 2025 State Capitol Christmas Tree
Most years, the tallest Christmas tree harvested in Montana, as far as the Daily Montanan is aware, takes up residence under the Capitol rotunda in Helena for the holiday season, towering nearly three stories tall and adorned with more than 3,500 lights.
On Monday, as Gov. Greg Gianforte looked on, foresters felled this year’s Capitol Christmas tree in the Lolo National Forest.
Near Seeley Lake, a Good Neighbor Authority project between the state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation and the U.S. Forest Service provided an active forest management site to harvest the Douglas Fir that will serve as the state’s Christmas tree, all while contributing to the health of the forest.
“Each year, it’s a privilege to bring a tree from our public lands into the state capitol for all to enjoy,” Gianforte said in a statement. “Through the Good Neighbor Authority, the State of Montana and the Forest Service work together to actively manage our forests and improve their health. This year’s tree is an example of the good work happening to reduce fire risk in Montana.”
A spokesperson for the governor’s office said they didn’t know how tall the Douglas Fir was, but will have a better idea once it’s installed in the rotunda.
The Capitol Christmas tree is selected from a different parcel of public land around the state each year. Similarly, the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., displays a Christmas tree harvested from a different National Forest each year. The last tree from Montana — a 79-foot tall Engelmann Spruce from the Kootenai National Forest — was selected in 2017.
This year, a 53-foot red fir named Silver Belle all the way from the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest in Nevada arrived in D.C. over the weekend to become the nation’s Capitol Christmas Tree.
Montana has a long history of producing commercial Christmas trees.
At its height in the middle of the last century, northwest Montana was shipping more than 4 million trees to homes around the country, earning the town of Eureka the nickname “Christmas Tree Capital of the World.”
Now, Montana doesn’t rank in the top 20 states for growing commercial trees, with just 6,338 cultivated trees harvested in 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
However, following the governor’s lead, Montanans are able to harvest trees from the state’s vast public lands — data that is not available from state or federal agencies — creating a tradition for many Montana families.
The 2025 State Capitol Christmas tree will displayed in the Capitol rotunda throughout the holiday season. The governor and first lady invite Montanans to join them at the Capitol for a tree lighting ceremony on Monday, Dec. 1, at 5 p.m.
The governor encourages Montanans to participate in the unique tradition of harvesting Christmas trees from public lands to benefit forest health and resiliency as well as improve wildlife habitat.
Cutting any trees on state trust land requires a permit from the local DNRC field office. The cost is $10 per tree. To find a local DNRC field office to secure a permit in person to harvest a Christmas tree, see the map here.
Montanans can also harvest trees from National Forest land with a $5 permit, though some restrictions on height and species apply to trees from federal land.
Forest Service permits can be obtained online by visiting recreation.gov and searching “Christmas tree” and the forest you plan to cut it from, i.e. “Flathead National Forest, Lolo National Forest.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image001-1-1024x702.jpg,,,2025-11-24 19:56:59.017689

She worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service until she lost her job as part of the Trump administration's reduction of the federal workforce. (Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)When 9-year-old Liz Renner visited the Gavins Point National Fish Hatchery in southeastern South Dakota with her grandfather, she was hooked.
In adulthood, she devoted more than a decade of education and work to understanding the intricacies of fish biology and conservation. Then, in May 2024, she was hired to work at the hatchery as a fish biologist and member of the Pallid Sturgeon Recovery Program, working to save the endangered species of fish.
“But it felt more like a nightmare at the end than a dream come true,” said the 31-year-old, originally from Crooks.


From insiders to ousted
This is the first of four stories about federal government employees or contractors in South Dakota affected by the Trump administration’s reduction of the federal workforce.
Read the series >


Renner was laid off in February under Department of Government Efficiency action, reinstated in March, and then offered and accepted a deferred resignation weeks later because she feared she’d be let go again later on. She was paid her federal wages through the end of September in exchange for her leaving her position.
“I finally felt like I could breathe after I left the hatchery for a second time,” Renner said. “It was a sense of relief that the roller coaster was done for me.”
Renner was one of about 154,000 federal employees who took buyouts — officially known as deferred resignations — offered by the Trump administration earlier this year as a way to reduce the size of the federal workforce. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor said recently that he expects the total decrease in the federal workforce to reach more than 300,000 eventually.
Of the 45 probationary employees laid off in February in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Mountain-Prairie Region, which includes eight states, Renner said she was one of at least 25 who didn’t return, either because they were not reinstated after DOGE cut them or because they accepted a buyout. Probationary employees are recent hires, usually in the first year of their position. Their loss burdened remaining employees with larger workloads and a hectic summer, Renner heard from her former colleagues.
‘My trust in these institutions is forever shaken’
At this point, Renner is grateful she was able to stay in her field and in the Midwest. Many other former federal biologists are not as fortunate, she said.
Renner moved in with her grandmother in Lyons, South Dakota, and splits her time between there and Lincoln, Nebraska, as a post-doctoral fisheries biologist at the University of Nebraska.
Now she researches, teaches and mentors students, and warns them about what they face. Their most promising options, she tells them, are finding a program out of the country, working in private consulting or with nonprofits, or working in liberal states with legislatures that prioritize conservation funding. 
Due to federal workforce reductions, Renner said, those recent graduates may be competing for an entry-level or seasonal job against someone with a master’s degree or over 10 years of experience in the field. Other peers have left the fisheries field altogether.
Renner remains passionate about research to conserve, propagate and reintroduce threatened and endangered fish and improve water quality in the state. She plans to stay in the field and look at ways to accomplish her mission outside of the federal government.
“My trust in these institutions is forever shaken,” Renner said, adding that if federal cuts continue, “I don’t know what young person in good conscience could look at what’s happened and say, ‘I want to work for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.’”

Nate Blouin is jumping into the race for a newly drawn congressional district favoring Democrats.  
Blouin is running for Congress in 2026 instead of a second term in the Utah Senate because he wants to stand up to President Donald Trump and work on making housing more affordable, he told Utah News Dispatch Monday.
“People are having to decide between a mortgage or child care, and that’s unacceptable. We should be able to provide people in the richest country in the world with all of those opportunities,” Blouin said. 
Blouin, 36, said he believes Congress needs more representatives who are younger and understand what it’s like to navigate today’s economy with student debt. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

Earlier this month, a Utah judge rejected a map proposed by the state’s Republican-controlled Legislature, saying it did not comply with a 2018 voter-approved law establishing an independent redistricting process and neutral map-drawing criteria. 
The judge selected boundaries pitched by a coalition of voting rights groups and citizens, creating the state’s first Democratic-leaning district in 20 years. 
Blouin’s announcement this week follows those of former state Sen. Derek Kitchen, state lawmaker Katheen Riebe and former congressman Ben McAdams, all declaring a bid for the U.S. House seat ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 
Blouin was elected to the state Senate in 2022 and represents parts of Sugar House, Millcreek, Murray, West Valley City and South Salt Lake. He said the entirety of his current district is contained in the new District 1.
“I know from these constituents that I’m standing up for the stuff that they — the values that they — believe in, and I’m going to keep doing that,” Blouin said. 
Outside of serving in Utah’s part-time Legislature, he is a communications strategy consultant working with clean energy and environmental groups.

Producers, meanwhile, remain concerned about the cost of inputs, commodity prices and markets.
The report said Iowa corn harvest, at 99% of acres harvested, is “virtually” complete. The national report shows the other top corn-producing states have on average just 4% left to harvest. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said farmers delivered a “significant crop” in 2025 despite “variable” weather conditions, disease and a challenging agricultural economy.  
“Strong production requires strong markets, and we will continue working to build and diversify demand at home, across the country and around the world,” Naig said in a statement.

According to the report, 67% of topsoil moisture and 66% of subsoil moisture across Iowa is adequate. South central Iowa has the driest soil conditions with about 60% of topsoil and subsoil short of moisture. 
State Climatologist Justin Glisan said the statewide average precipitation for the Nov. 17 through Nov. 23 reporting period was 0.20 inch. That means precipitation was about half of the normal of 0.43 inch.
Glisan said the statewide average temperature for the period at 43.8 degrees Fahrenheit was 6.1 degrees above the normal.
Will Cannon, a board member with Iowa Corn Growers Association and a farmer in Jasper County, said his harvest wrapped up in a “pretty typical timeframe” though he said almost everyone he has spoken to had a handful of fields with “disappointing yields.” 
Cannon said these fields were hit with disease, like southern corn rust, or seemed to reach maturity quickly but with small kernel sizes. His estimations, and conversations he’s had with other growers, point to the warm overnight temperatures as the crop matured as the cause. 
“I think about everybody’s got at least one or two fields that were like that this year,” Cannon said. 
He said marketing corn this season has been “interesting” because the lack of federal farm reports during the 43-day government shutdown this fall meant producers were “flying blind.” 
The latest crop production report from USDA estimated corn yields were at 186 bushels per acre nationally, though the report does not include October yields due to the shutdown. Cannon said he expects the next report will show lower yield figures that will help some farmers’ marketing strategies. 
“There’s going to be a lot of people paying attention to that report, because, in theory, that’ll probably be the most complete report we’ve gotten in many, many months,” Cannon said. 
Iowa Capital Dispatch spoke with Cannon in early October about ag trade uncertainty, in particular with China. 
Since then, China agreed to purchase U.S. soybeans and remove tariffs on agricultural commodities like corn. 
Cannon said from his perspective, there is still uncertainty in the market and a general unease about the farm economy. 
He said on the other hand, he has been encouraged by conversations and legislative efforts to address some of the “fundamental issues in farming” like consolidation and high input costs. 
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley and U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, both Republicans from Iowa, have introduced legislation known as the Fertilizer Research Act that would require a government study on consolidation and pricing in the fertilizer industry. 
Grassley additionally led a hearing in the Senate in late October about consolidation in the fertilizer and seed industries that he alleged are causing elevated input costs. 
“Whatever you want to call it right now, farmers are still incredibly concerned about what it’s costing to produce the crop, and what the price is right now,” Cannon said. “There’s still a tremendous amount of concern about what it’s going to cost for next year’s crop to produce it.”

If approved and the required 31,164 signatures for constitutional ballot measure are gathered, submitted and verified, the measure would appear on the 2026 general election ballot in November with the free meals beginning during the 2027-28 school year.
Robin Nelson, chair of the ballot petition’s sponsoring committee, said the effort to provide school meals to North Dakota students for free began with a small team of citizens in preparation for the 2021 legislative session. While legislative proposals have failed, she said polling shows it is popular with the public.

“We carefully brought it through the proper channels legislatively and, due to the high approval rating across the state of North Dakota, we weren’t going to stop if this is what our North Dakota citizens want,” Nelson said.
Free school lunches for all students received 79% support in a recent North Dakota United poll. In 2024, a poll by the North Dakota News Cooperative revealed 82% of those asked support more government involvement in providing school meals.
She also said the measure would affect every public school student in North Dakota and private and tribal schools can opt-in to the program.
Nelson is a school board member for Fargo Public Schools and the CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of the Red River Valley, but she said she will be working on the ballot petition as a private citizen.
During the 2025 legislative session, two bills were introduced that would have provided breakfast and lunch for every North Dakota student, attending public or private school, at no cost to the student. Both bills failed in the North Dakota House of Representatives, with some lawmakers citing a need to balance the state budget while others said a federal program was adequate.

In submitted testimony, Lynelle Johnson, director of child nutrition and food distribution programs for the Department of Public Instruction, said the department estimated the cost to provide a breakfast and lunch to every North Dakota student would be about $140 million for the current biennium.
In the funding estimate, Nelson said the measure relies on schools receiving 100% reimbursement from federal free or reduced meal programs. Federal programs provide free school meals to students with household incomes at, or below, 130% of the federal poverty level, and partial reimbursement for households below 185% the federal poverty level. 
Legislators have used state funding to slightly expand who qualifies for free and reduced meals. Earlier this year, legislators added about $7.3 million in state funding. With the change, a family of four with income of $72,000 a year qualifies for free school meals. 
If the measure passes next year, the petition would allow state lawmakers to fund the program how they see fit. However, if lawmakers don’t identify a funding source during the 2027 legislative session, language in the petition would require it to be funded from the Legacy Fund earnings. That fund also provides money for property tax relief through the primary residence tax credit.
Amy Jacobson, executive director of Prairie Action ND and member of the coalition, said when kids are fed, they are more productive in the classroom.
“This is something that will directly impact a family’s ability to have more money in their pocket book and be able to spend that on other necessary needs that they do have,” Jacobson said. “There is nothing better that North Dakotans could be investing in than our future, and that is our children.”

""And a claimant will need to present a claim demonstrating injuries and causation.""","The temporary FEMA disaster recovery center in Mora, pictured June 7, 2022, during the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. FEMA officials said on Nov. 21, 2025 that those seeking compensation for recent well contamination will need to first prove “injuries and causation.” (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Officials with the federal claims office overseeing a multi-billion-dollar compensation fund for New Mexico’s Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims told Source New Mexico they will consider paying to address newly found well contamination, but only if victims first prove “injuries and causation.”
A recent independent geologic study discovered high levels of heavy metals in several dozen private wells in Mora County, findings the study’s author attributed to fire suppressants firefighters used in battling the 534-square-mile wildfire that raged for several months in spring and summer 2022. 
Geologist Kate Zeigler’s report — which documented elevated levels of metals like antimony, manganese and uranium beyond federal safe drinking water limits — also prompted the state Health Department to issue a health alert, warning families using the wells to drink bottled water and citing fire suppressants as a potential source for the contamination. Other state and local agencies have also since stepped in to donate pallets of bottled water to the area. 
Meanwhile, some Mora County residents and U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) have called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency to use some of roughly $2 billion remaining in a compensation fund it oversees to help address the issue. The FEMA claims office responded Friday afternoon with answers to Source New Mexico’s questions about whether it will award compensation for claims for the latest contamination. 
New Mexico officials, Mora residents say feds should respond to groundwater contamination

Officials wrote in an unsigned statement that, “FEMA does not make determinations related to recent reports of heavy metals in drinking water in Northern New Mexico” and that the office “is not authorized to conduct studies of potential damages caused by the fire.”
Still, the statement said the office would consider claims individuals and households bring regarding contamination.
“Heavy metals caused by the fire can be compensable, and a claimant will need to present a claim demonstrating injuries and causation,” officials said in the statement.
Congress awarded FEMA $5.45 billion with the aim of “fully compensating” victims of the wildfire, which resulted from two botched prescribed burns on federal land in early 2022. In addition to burned property and smoke damage, the fire also caused widespread floods and debris flows, known as “cascading events,” for which the office has also agreed to pay. 
According to the latest figures, the office has paid about $3.24 billion in compensation. 
In an emailed statement to Source on Monday afternoon, Leger Fernández called on FEMA to quickly establish a process to address the heavy metal contaminants “rather than being dismissive.” 
“The office can and should create a protocol to quickly address these claims, similar to what they have done in other instances of loss,” she said.
Given that she helped draft and pass the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act, which created the compensation fund, Leger Fernández said she knows the bill’s legislative intent, which is to pay for the fire, as well as flooding and other ensuing harms.

“The cascading events from the fire, including the flooding and now the water contamination, must be compensated,” she said. “Given that water is essential to life, these claims must be processed as expeditiously as possible.”
Paula Garcia, a lifelong Mora resident and director of the New Mexico Acequia Association, said the agency needs to be more proactive to deal with the latest environmental threat the fire caused. 
“The claims office should make a determination based on available data that the fire retardant drops caused elevated levels of heavy metal in our water. They don’t have to do their own study, she told Source. “It is within their power to make a determination on existing data on causation.”
She said she’s also unsure how claimants can prove “injury,” at least while compensation is still available through the fund. 
“Heavy metals have long-term impacts. I don’t see how an individual could demonstrate injury. Making people demonstrate injury and causation is a way to weed people out,” she said. 
According to the Health Department, prolonged or high-concentration exposure to the metals can damage kidneys and the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Infants, young children and pregnant people are the most sensitive, particularly to arsenic and manganese, which can affect brain development and cause other health effects. 
In the statement, the claims office noted that if a connection between the fire and the contamination is proved, the office would reimburse claimants, and encouraged people to contact claims office navigators to work on reopening or adding to their damage claims.
The statement also declined to respond to recent criticism from Leger Fernández and other members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation about the office’s treatment of “cascading event” claims. In a Nov. 6 letter, the delegation said FEMA was not acting quickly enough or at all on claims for new flooding damage. 
The statement provided to Source said FEMA does not comment publicly on its responses to congressional inquiries, but officials noted that claims can be reopened in some cases. 
“However, not all issues that arise from after the fire are caused by the fire, and in some cases requests for additional compensation have been found ineligible,” the statement reads.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_5381-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

(Photo via FWC)Florida’s first bear hunt in a decade will take place as scheduled next month after a state judge on Monday denied a motion by a conservation group to stop it from taking place.
Leon County Circuit Judge Angela Dempsey denied the temporary preliminary injunction sought by Bear Warriors United, which argued the hunt authorization was based on outdated data and will harm the bear population in Florida — right now estimated at around 4,050.
The group filed a lawsuit in September seeking to stop the 23-day hunt, after it was approved by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) in August and is scheduled to take place from Dec. 6 to Dec. 28.
“I’m going to find here that the plaintiff has not met their burden on substantial likelihood of success on the merits,” Judge Dempsey said at the end of a two-and-half-hour hearing that took place via Zoom on Monday.
“The 2015 hunt was found constitutional under the rational basis test and this hunt is significantly more conservative than that hunt in 2015, both in number of bears that could be harvested as well as the timing, when it’s a little less likely for more female bears to be killed.”
Supporters of the hunt point to increased interactions between bears and humans and consequent fears of attacks.
Questions about the data
Bear Warriors United contended the FWC was relying on “stale and outdated” data to reach the conclusion that the best way to manage the black bear population in Florida was a regulated hunt.
The most dramatic part of the hearing was an exchange between Thomas Crapps, attorney for Bear Warriors United, and FWC bear management coordinator Mike Orlando. Crapps asked Orlando at one point whether it “wouldn’t be more prudent to wait to get that information to decide whether or not a hunt was appropriate, based on more current data?”
“Actually, the science that we have now is actually very good data and, as those population estimates come in over time, we have the ability to actually adjust harvest rates and other things. But no, the population estimates that we’re working with right now are fantastic,” Orlando responded. “It’s good science.”
Orlando said that it takes up to two years for FWC to conduct a population study. That prompted Crapps to ask him why not wait to get more current data before making such an important decision?
“Because we will never have new data. It will always be old,” Orlando said. “So, what we’re doing again is taking a very conservative estimate approach to the hunting season, using the best available science that we have and, any new science that comes in, we will make adjustments. We have to be adaptive. That’s management 101.”
This will be the first bear hunt in Florida since 2015, when the hunt was shut down at the end of its second day after nearly 300 bears had been killed.
The bears are spread out across the state in seven areas known as Bear Management Units by the FWC. In justifying the hunt, the agency has said that, since 2015, the four largest subpopulations of bears have grown annually, and no subpopulations have shown evidence of decline.
Plan calls for removal of 172 bears in four ‘hunting zones’
The plan now allows for the removal of 172 bears from four “bear hunting zones” — 68 in the East Panhandle; 31 in the North; 18 in Central Florida; and 55 in the South hunting area.
To participate, individuals must have been at least 18 years old by Oct. 1 and hold a hunting license and a bear harvest permit. Bear harvest permits cost $100 for Florida residents and $300 for non-residents and are not transferable. It cost $5 to submit an application, and there was no limit on how many applications individuals could submit.
However, not all of those who have received a permit will use it to kill a bear.
News 6 WKMG in Orlando reports that 44 people selected for the bear hunt are against killing bears. “By the time it’s all over with, we’ve got at least 52 of the 172, which will reduce the number of bears killed down to about 120 or less,” said Chuck O’Neal, president of Speak Up for Wildlife.
In his closing statement representing Bear Warriors United, Crapps noted that agency staff presented the first report on the Florida Black Bear Management Plan in December 2024 with a recommendation that no immediate action was needed.
“And it’s the FWC commissioners then direct them to have a hunt,” he said. “At that point, the science is being driven by the politics. And that is wrong.”
Not true, argued attorney Rhonda Parnell, representing the FWC.
“The science is sound,” she said. “Bears have always been a game animal. This hunt is no different than any other hunt, whether it is deer, turkey, quail, etc. We are the ones who get to make that determination. It is not for the court to say, ‘Well, you can determine deer hunting, but you can’t determine bear hunting.’ That would be an impermissible ruling by this court.”
Litigation will continue, as Judge Dempsey declined FWC’s request to dismiss the lawsuit. A hearing on that motion will take place on Dec. 15 — halfway through the bear hunt.
In a survey conducted by the FWC of more than 13,000 self-selected participants, 75% opposed the proposal, with just 23% in support. Other polls, such as a Remington Research survey commissioned by the Humane World for Animals, showed that 81% of Florida residents oppose the reopening of bear-hunting season.

About a decade ago, Ferguson, then Washington’s attorney general, chose her to lead his office’s new civil rights unit devoted to investigating and enforcing anti-discrimination laws.
On Monday, Ferguson, now governor, named Melody as Washington’s newest state Supreme Court justice.
Melody, 43, will succeed Justice Mary Yu, who announced her retirement in September. 
“Anyone who has had any interaction with Colleen in a legal setting would all agree that she has a brilliant legal mind,” Ferguson said at a news conference in the Supreme Court chambers at the Temple of Justice in Olympia. 
Melody said “the toughest question” in the hiring process was why she wanted to leave a job she so enjoyed.
“I never dreamt of being a judge,” she said. She added that working the past decade with individuals and juries, and in courthouses across the state, incited the desire.
Though the U.S. Supreme Court and federal courts are in the headlines, “state courts are actually the place where most of us who are able to access justice go to seek it,” Melody said, adding that they have “never been more important than they are right now.”
Yu will leave the court at the end of the year. An election will be held next year to complete the remainder of Yu’s term, which runs through Dec. 31, 2028.
This is Ferguson’s first appointment to the state’s high court. Sixteen people applied. He said he was evaluating applicants for their intellectual capacity, work ethic and ability to build consensus with other justices.
Melody, a native of Spokane and graduate from the University of Washington law school, worked previously in the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.
Ferguson, then attorney general, created the Wing Luke Civil Rights Division and hired Melody to guide the new department in 2015.
In her tenure, Melody has established the division as a “national powerhouse” for standing up for the rights of Washingtonians, “and, we’ve seen, many Americans as well,” Ferguson said.
In 2017, Melody helped lead Washington’s successful challenge to President Trump’s first travel ban, which barred the citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.
This year, Melody’s team won the first temporary restraining order against the second Trump Administration’s attempt to revoke birthright citizenship, protecting the constitutional rights of everyone born in this country.
“She’s a unique talent,” Ferguson said.
Washington’s nine state Supreme Court justices are elected to six-year terms with vacancies filled by appointment of the governor until the next general election. The only requirement for the office is that a prospective justice be admitted to the practice of law in Washington state.
Justice Sal Mungia, the newest member, was sworn into office in January following his narrow election win in November 2024. 
Each year, justices are asked to review more than a thousand cases, mostly from state appeals courts and some from superior courts.
Melody, during her remarks Monday, noted problems with declining credibility in courts and said that “the rule of law seems more fragile than it has to me at any point during my lifetime.”
“It seemed important to me,” she said, “that people of goodwill, who are willing to work hard and who have deep faith in the courts as cornerstones of democracy, that those people be willing to raise their hands and serve.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-2-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

The five-member search advisory constituency, announced Thursday, is tasked with helping to vet candidates for the historically Black university’s next leader, according to the IHL board. 
The board also announced plans to begin recruiting candidates to be Jackson State’s next president in December. The top job at Jackson State has been vacant since May, after Marcus Thompson resigned without explanation less than two years into his tenure. Thompson was the third president to depart in five years. 
Denise Jones-Gregory, who was the provost and vice president of academic affairs, is serving as the interim president. 
The constituency members “were selected for their professional insight and long-time connections with Jackson State University,” John Sewell, director of communications for the IHL board, said in an email.
The search advisory constituency group members are: 

Nicholas J. Hill, dean of the College of Business 
Candice L. Jackson, secretary of the faculty senate and an associate professor in the Department of English, Foreign Languages and Speech Communications 
Deidre L. Wheaton, associate dean of the College of Education and Human Development
Retired Brigadier General Robert Crear, Jackson State Development Foundation advisory board member
Patrease Edwards, national alumni association president

Some alumni still question if the IHL board will allow the group full agency to properly vet candidate applications and approve of candidate finalists. Jackson State alumni and supporters have questioned the IHL board’s opaque search process, advocating for more stakeholder input into selecting the next president.  
The creation of the constituency group is one way the board is acting on concerns from JSU alumni and supporters who want more input in the search process. Last month, the board voted unanimously to create the group.
IHL board policies allow for the creation of an advisory group of up to 15 members. It’s not clear why they selected only five. John Sewell, a spokesman for the board, did not directly respond to a question from Mississippi Today about the rationale for the group size.
The IHL board has not used an advisory group to assist with Jackson State’s president searches since 2017. That search resulted in IHL hiring William Bynum, who was unpopular among alumni and constituents — but Bynum wasn’t on the list of finalists the constituency group recommended. 
The board ultimately rejected the group’s input and named Bynum president of the university. Bynum resigned in 2020 after he was arrested in a prostitution bust that ended his presidential term. 
In 2022, the IHL board revised its policies to provide for a search advisory constituency. 
The advisory group should have a meaningful stake in the selection of Jackson State’s next president, said Mark Dawson, chairman of Thee 1877 Project, an alumni-led group advocating for transparency in the selection process. The number of alumni selected for the advisory group is disappointing, he said, and the individuals the IHL board selected for the advisory group doesn’t represent a breadth of alumni voices.
“Members should have the full ability to reject and approve candidates. As constituents, we should also know who the potential finalists are for university president,” Dawson told Mississippi Today.  “Our group will continue to advocate for a fair, transparent search and the opportunity for all constituents and stakeholders voices to be heard and involved in the university’s president search.” 
Sen. Sollie Norwood, a Democrat from Jackson, said he would want more representation of students and community in the group, but ultimately, those chosen will have the best interest of the university at heart. 
“My hope is that after all this we will have a leader in place. We’re missing out on a lot of opportunities, and we all need to galvanize and work together to take Jackson State to a place where it should rightfully be,” Norwood said. 
Since August, the IHL board has gathered constituent feedback to shape the role before it starts to seek potential applicants. The job profile will provide an overview of Jackson State as well as information on issues and challenges stakeholders presented during campus listening sessions in October.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/06182234/JSU18.jpg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill is condemning the Trump administration for launching an investigation into an Arizona senator accused of misconduct by the Pentagon.
U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday said U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Arizona) brought “discredit upon the armed forces” for joining other Democrats last week in a video telling military members they have the right to refuse to follow illegal orders. Kelly is a retired Navy captain.
Sherrill, a Democrat and former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot, in a statement called the Trump administration’s targeting of Kelly “another abuse of power by the most incompetent and unfit Secretary of Defense in our nation’s history.”
“Sen. Mark Kelly — a New Jersey native and fellow U.S. Navy veteran — has served our country with distinction, both in combat and space missions. Now, Hegseth wants to prosecute him for stating unequivocally that service members must follow the law and the Constitution — a reminder that Hegseth himself should heed,” she said.
Sherrill was elected governor earlier this month, and takes office on Jan. 20.
The six Democrats who appeared in last week’s video have been battling Trump since it dropped, with Trump accusing them of “seditious behavior at the highest level.” The Pentagon on Monday said potential repercussions for Kelly include recalling him to active duty for court-martial proceedings. 
Kelly said on social media that he would not be intimidated out of “holding this administration accountable.”
“I’ve given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution,” he said.
Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Kelly and the other Democrats in the video were encouraging “disorder and chaos within the ranks.”
“Not a single one of them … can point to a single illegal order that this administration has given down because it does not exist,” Leavitt said. “They knew what they were doing in this video and Sen. Mark Kelly and all of them should be held accountable for that.”

The lawsuit, filed last week in state court, asks a judge to pause Magellan of Idaho’s plans to cut specialized mobile teams that treat patients with severe mental illness who have struggled in routine settings. The cuts, providers argue, would effectively end the program, risking worsening mental health conditions and violent episodes in communities. 
“This is critical care — without their medication, these patients pose a serious threat of harm to themselves or others,” attorneys for the clinics wrote in support of their motion for a stay on the planned cut.
Magellan’s cuts, announced late last month, stem from the state’s attempts to avoid a projected budget shortfall, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. The private company, which runs Idaho Medicaid mental health benefits, plans to cut peer support services and the mobile treatment program, called Assertive Community Treatment, on Dec. 1.
Spokespeople for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and Magellan Health declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying they don’t comment on pending litigation.

 Lawsuit follows outcry over the cuts

Four mental health clinics — Access Behavioral Health Services, Tueller Counseling Service, Riverside Recovery and Mental Health Specialists — filed the lawsuit against the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. 
The providers argue that the state can’t change payment methods for the Assertive Community Treatment program “without following the required procedures; without publishing its decision and the reason for it; and without otherwise complying with applicable law.”
Idaho Medicaid contractor to cut critical services for people with severe mental illness

Days before the lawsuit was filed, several leaders of the mental health clinics that sued the state told the Idaho Capital Sun they feared these cuts could risk violent episodes in communities. 
Many of the roughly 400 to 500 people on the program will end up homeless if the program ends, Tueller Counseling Service Clinical Director Tom Tueller previously told the Sun.
In a news release Saturday, the Idaho Association of Community Providers said the program ending would shift costs to police, jails, local governments, hospitals and emergency medical services. The group’s analysis said the program costs the state $7 million each year.
“Idaho is eliminating every evidence-based program for its highest-acuity psychiatric populations,” the analysis found. “These cuts will not save money — they will destabilize six distinct populations and shift $150-180 (million) in new costs to Idaho’s hospitals, counties, EMS systems, and child-welfare programs.”
A Change.org petition opposing Magellan’s cuts has over 7,500 signatures.

The money will come from the Public Transit Trust Fund, which is broadly used for capital projects, and will be used in part to comply with federal mandates following a series of fires on SEPTA railcars.
“800,000 riders depend on SEPTA every single day, including 55,000 students who rely on SEPTA to get to school,” Shapiro said at a press conference Monday in Chester County. “… Mass transit is critical to our commonwealth’s success, it is critical to our commonwealth’s economy, and it’s critical that we invest in it.”
SEPTA is the largest mass transit authority in Pennsylvania. Earlier this year, its leaders warned that the agency was entering a “death spiral” unless lawmakers could find a new source of funding.

Ultimately, the Shapiro administration directed funding from the state’s Public Transit Trust Fund to SEPTA to keep the transit authority afloat. However, many Democratic state lawmakers and mass transit advocates say a long-term solution — and more money — is still needed.
The $220 million Shapiro announced for SEPTA today, the second major investment in a matter of months, will be used to repair and maintain its existing fleet, purchase new equipment, upgrade infrastructure in SEPTA stations, and replace catenary wires for trolleys and railcars.
SEPTA General Manager Scott Sauer said the projects are necessary to “overcome the current crises” and “prevent problems moving forward.”
“We’re looking at every mile of infrastructure, each railcar, bus and all the other equipment that SEPTA runs to make sure we are putting out safe and reliable service each day,” he added.
SEPTA had already been carrying out a series of safety improvement projects following an emergency order from the Federal Railroad Administration after an investigation into five fires on Silverliner IV railcars used by the transit authority which had passengers on board.
The Governor made the announcement at SEPTA’s Frazer Shop & Yard in Chester County.
A long fight over transit funding
When budget negotiations began in February, mass transit funding was a key point of disagreement at the state Capitol between Democrats, who have a large Philadelphia-area caucus, and Republicans, who are more likely to represent rural parts of the state and object to increases in recurring spending.
Shapiro and Democrats had pushed to increase the share of sales tax the state directs to transit authorities in all 67 counties, which cover urban, rural and suburban areas. But Republicans in the state Senate ultimately blocked those efforts, citing, in part, failures by the largest transit authorities to tackle issues of crime and fare evasion. 
Roughly 1 million Pennsylvanians — about one in 13  people in the state — use mass transit every day across the commonwealth.
“Sadly, the Republicans who lead the Senate have been unwilling to come up with a deal to deliver reliable, recurring funding for mass transit,” Shapiro said at Monday’s press conference. “That left SEPTA in a position earlier this summer where they didn’t have enough funding for their operating costs at their operating service levels.”
What’s at stake over proposed increase in mass transit funding in Pa.? 

While budget negotiations dragged on last summer, SEPTA announced a series of fare raises and service cuts to offset what they called a lack of state funding. However, the Court of Common Pleas blocked the proposed cuts to bus and rail service, saying they disproportionately impacted low-income and minority riders..
The Shapiro administration then directed $394 million in capital projects funding to SEPTAy, effectively ending the fight over new transit funding in the 2025-2026 state budget.
It was a victory for Republicans, who had pushed to fund the state’s transit authorities with money from the Public Transportation Trust Fund, which they said contained more money than necessary for just the capital projects it was intended for.
“We have been consistent in recognizing the value of transit while making it clear investments by taxpayers need to include reasonable accountability measures,” Sen. Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) said in a statement Monday. “It was not until our transparency efforts shed light on the massive fund balance that the Governor’s hand was forced to finally make these resources available for their intended use.”
But SEPTA and other transit authorities say the solution was only a stopgap, and are continuing to push for a new source of recurring revenue that will keep them afloat into the future.
“For the second year in a row, Gov. Shapiro has stepped up and offered a lifeline to public transit in the southeast,” said Sauer.
In 2024, Shapiro unilaterally diverted $153 million in federal highway to SEPTA, a move that Republicans in the statehouse objected to.
Shapiro was also joined Monday by Democratic allies, such as Philadelphia Mayor Charelle Parker, Senate Appropriations Chair Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia) and House Transportation Chair Ed Neilson (D-Philadelphia).",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SEPTA-Bus-2025-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

Dalya Attar (D-Baltimore City) pleaded not guilty Monday to federal extortion charges alongside her two co-defendants, during a brief appearance in U.S. District Court in Baltimore.
A federal grand jury indicted Attar in October, on charges that she attempted to blackmail a political consultant who she feared would spread negative information about her to thwart her 2022 reelection campaign.
Prosecutors allege that Attar’s brother, Joseph Attar, took part in the plot, as did a campaign volunteer, Kalman Finkelstein, a Baltimore City police officer who has been suspended without pay.
Attar, brother and campaign volunteer charged with reelection extortion plot

All three, who were released from federal custody, appeared together in the courtroom Monday morning before Magistrate Judge Douglas R. Miller, each represented by their own attorneys. During the brief proceedings, each defendant rose and affirmed that they understood the charges, before formally entering their pleas.
Judge Miller set a Dec. 15 deadline for pretrial motions, though either side could request an extension.
Jeff Ifrah, an attorney for Dalya Attar, issued a statement after Monday’s hearing that said he plans to file a motion to dismiss the case. Attorneys representing the other two defendants declined to comment following Monday’s proceedings.
Attar, 35, was first elected to the House of Delegates in 2018, as a Democrat representing Baltimore’s District 41, and reelected in 2022. In January, she was appointed to fill the District 41 Senate seat, which became vacant when former Sen. Jill Carter stepped down.
Besides serving in the General Assembly, Attar is a lawyer and a former Baltimore City assistant state’s attorney.
Prosecutors allege that as Attar prepared for her 2022 reelection bid for the House of Delegates, Attar grew concerned that a political consultant, who was not identified in court documents, would attempt to derail her campaign, according to her indictment.
The three defendants, alongside unnamed co-conspirators, colluded to install cameras inside smoke detectors in a room where the consultant was staying, and videotape the consultant having an extramarital affair.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I just want her to be a non-issue in my mind and in reality that won’t happen as long as she is relevant or doesn’t have anything to worry about,” the then-delegate wrote in a January 2020 message.
Joseph Attar ultimately used the footage to threaten both the consultant and the married man with whom she was having the affair.
Each of the three defendants face charges including conspiracy, extortion and interception and disclosure of a wire, oral or electronic communication.

“You decided to commit fraud and murder,” Judge Christina Reiss said in imposing the prison term for Serhat Gumrukcu in the 2018 killing of Gregory Davis of Vermont.

BURLINGTON — Calling his crimes “brutal” and “brazen,” a judge ordered a former California man to spend the rest of his life behind bars for leading a cross-country murder-for-hire plot that led to the death of a Vermont man.
The sentence handed down Monday by Judge Christina Reiss in federal court in Burlington came after 43-year-old Serhat Gumrukcu maintained his innocence and claimed he played no role in the events leading to the 2018 fatal shooting of 49-year-old Gregory Davis of Danville. 
“I didn’t plan it, I didn’t ask for it, “I didn’t know about it,” he said during the hearing.

This was the first time Gumrukcu spoke publicly since a jury convicted him in April following a five-week trial. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all charges, including murder for hire and conspiring to commit wire fraud. The verdict came after three other co-defendants reached plea deals and testified against him. 
In pronouncing the sentence Monday, the judge pointed out that Gumrukcu had the sole motive for the killing — silencing Davis, so he wouldn’t expose his deceitful business schemes — and that he should bear the consequences for his actions. 
“You decided to commit fraud and murder,” she said.
Gumrucku is a Turkish national who had been living in Los Angeles, California, for about a decade before Gregory Davis’ killing. In Turkey, Gumrukcu had worked as a magician before moving to the United States where prosecutors said he falsely posed as a medical doctor.   
Gumrukcu’s husband, William Anderson Wittekind, attended the hearing, sitting in the courtroom gallery behind him. After the hearing as Gumrukcu was placed in handcuffs and being led away, he turned to Wittekind and the two appeared to share a glance.
The three other participants in the plot were sentenced over two days in September to prison terms ranging between roughly nine and 16 years.
Gumrukcu was also initially set to be sentenced at that time, but sentencing was delayed after his attorney requested more time to prepare for the proceeding.
The murder-for-hire charge alone against Gumrukcu carried a mandatory sentence of life in prison, leaving little suspense about what sentence Gumrukcu would receive.
“I didn’t choose the sentence for you, Congress did,” the judge told Gumrukcu in formally imposing it.
In addressing the court, Gumrukcu said he made mistakes but still followed his principles and commitment to non-violence, maintaining that he wasn’t involved in the killing of Davis, despite the jury’s verdict.
Gumrukcu said he has sympathy for the family and what they have been through, but was saddened by the fact they believe he was involved in the plot. 
In her statement to the court, Melissa Davis, Gregory Davis’ wife, thanked all the people who worked to ensure justice, saying that she and her family are living proof that the legal system works.
Gregory Davis was the father of six when he was killed, and his wife was pregnant with the couple’s seventh child. 
Melissa Davis remembered her husband as “funny” and “brilliant” and described how his absence has been felt in every birthday, graduation, and holiday he missed. 
Still, she forgave Gumrukcu even if he had shown no remorse. She had previously addressed the four defendants in September and offered forgiveness to all of them, but Gumrukcu.
“It is not my job to condemn you — that belongs to God,” Davis told Gumrukcu on Monday. “My job is to live free,” she said, adding that forgiveness would allow her to move forward without anger or bitterness.
Gumrukcu and Gregory Davis had spent years prior to the murder working on a several million dollar business deal involving oil trading. Prosecutors had contended during the trial that Gumrukcu masterminded a plot to kill Davis because he was afraid the Vermont man was going to expose his fraudulent business tactics. Prosecutors added that Gumrukcu had sent fake emails and provided phony financial records. 
Jerry Banks, a former detention officer in Colorado, had been recruited by another plot member to serve as the hitman. Banks shot and killed Davis on a snowy night in January 2018 after kidnapping Davis from his home. Banks, posing as a deputy U.S. Marshal complete with a uniform and badge, showed up at Davis’ residence and told him was under arrest for racketeering.
Banks, according to prosecutors, then drove Davis away from the home in handcuffs before stopping a few miles away in a pull off in Barnet where he ordered Davis out of the vehicle. Banks then repeatedly shot Davis, killing him.
Investigators spent the next several years poring over business and banking documents and electronic records to piece together the links among the four men prosecutors would eventually charge for their roles in the deadly plot.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Zachary Stendig, one of the prosecutors, told the judge that while Gumrukcu quoted the nonviolence philosophy spoken by Gandhi, it would be Davis’ murder that would define Gumrukcu’s life.
Susan Marcus, Gumrukcu’s attorney, contested the prosecution’s argument that Gumrukcu had obstructed justice. 
But the judge disagreed with her, saying that Gumrukcu’s trial testimony – denying any participation in the murder-for-hire plot – amounted to perjury and obstruction of justice.
In addition to sentencing Gumrukcu, the judge ordered that all four defendants should pay a total of $1.36 million in restitution to Davis’ family.  
The payments made by each of the defendants toward that restitution would be based, in large part, on a percentage of their incomes. The restitution figure, according to prosecutors, was based on an estimate of the amount of money Davis would have earned had he continued to work up until his retirement age.
Davis’ estate has also filed a civil wrongful death lawsuit against Gumrukcu in federal court in Vermont, which remains pending. 
Melissa Davis, leaving the courtroom, spoke about Gumrukcu’s statement in court.
“He was trying to become the victim, and I reversed his lies with the truth,” she said. “Justice has been served.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)State lawmakers are recommending the General Assembly continue to ease regulations for housing developers and strongly consider funding to incentivize housing and infrastructure construction as Kentucky grapples with a significant housing shortage. 
A couple of lawmakers on the Kentucky Housing Task Force during a Monday meeting emphasized the urgency of the shortage as the panel released recommendations ahead of the legislative session beginning in January.
A national research firm hired by the Kentucky Housing Corp. estimated last year the state needs more than 200,000 housing units, including rentals and homes for sale. The gap could grow to over 287,000 units by 2029 without efforts to build or repair housing, the study said, with low-income renters being particularly squeezed by the growing shortage. 
Rep. Mike Clines, R-Alexandria, told his colleagues the legislature must act. “I do think it’s time for us to really write some legislation that’s going to make some changes for our housing shortage,” Clines said.
The nine-page memo of recommendations, created after four prior meetings of the task force that began this summer, recounted gathering input from a number of groups including the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, the libertarian think tank Mercatus Center, the Homebuilders Association of Kentucky, the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity and the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky. 
Most of the recommendations to lawmakers for the 2026 legislative session, when a two-year state budget will be crafted, focused on regulatory changes that seek to lower the cost of housing construction by either encouraging or mandating state and local governments “eliminate barriers” to building new homes. 
Those regulatory recommendations include: 

A two-year moratorium on any changes to state building and electrical codes “that would result in any increase to construction costs of residential units.” 
Allowing regulated third parties to issue permits for housing construction in lieu of the state. 
Recommending that local laws requiring a certain number of parking spots for housing developments “be reduced or eliminated entirely.” 
Various changes to the state building code that would “reduce costs to homebuilders.” One recommended change includes requiring only one staircase in multi-family and apartment buildings, the memo arguing that the cost is “exorbitant” to require additional staircases in larger housing developments “while any safety benefit is likely negligible.” 
Allowing religious institutions to build housing on their own land with less regulation, pointing to a bill filed, but not passed, in this year’s legislative session that aimed to do that.

The lawmakers on the task force write in their memo that the regulatory changes would build on bills signed into law during this year’s legislative session such as a law that prevents local governments from implementing certain restrictions on manufactured housing.
Sen. Robby Mills, R-Henderson, a co-chair of the task force, in a Lantern interview after the meeting said a large debate before the legislature is how far the state government will go in telling local communities how to regulate housing construction. Mills said he generally supports local government control but that “we’ve got to get active in building residential units.”
“We’ve got to allow more building to take place in Kentucky. And if it doesn’t happen then we need to step in, or we’re going to be, once again, falling behind,” Mills said. “I do believe the locals need to have an opportunity to act and react.” 
New take on factory-built could ease housing crunch, says Kentucky nonprofit

The task force recommends allowing local governments to establish “districts” within their boundaries where housing developers and local governments would be incentivized to build. 
The task force is also calling for lawmakers to strongly consider throwing state funding at the issue, especially to establish a revolving loan fund for housing infrastructure similar to a fund in Indiana and to create a state low-income housing tax credit to match an existing federal tax credit. 
Adrienne Bush, the executive director of the advocacy group Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, said she’s overall “pretty pleased” with the memo, including a recommendation that would increase the real estate transaction fees that go toward the state’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund that subsidizes housing construction. 
“We have this proven tool. It’s been working well for Kentucky,” Bush said, referring to the fund. “It just really hasn’t kept pace with what is needed to build and repair and renovate.” 
Bush said that “housing is fundamental” despite potential budget constraints. Republican legislative leadership is projecting a more challenging state budget due to federal funding uncertainty, and Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has said his administration is making adjustments after state revenue came in below projections for the last fiscal year.
“It is becoming clearer, clearer and clearer every day that without state financial intervention, Kentucky is going to continue to fall further and further behind in terms of our housing stock,” Bush said.
As the state budget is crafted, Mills said, a lot of things will “fall on the cutting floor because of the cost of Medicaid and other large ticket items.” He said he still planned to encourage his fellow lawmakers to put money into incentivizing affordable housing construction.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_9913-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota soybean industry leaders said Monday that a new trade pledge with China is lifting prices but hasn’t erased anxiety about how much farmers depend on a single foreign buyer.
“China’s the number one buyer of soybeans out of the United States,” said Tom Kersting, CEO of South Dakota Soybean Processors. “At times, they buy 60% of all the exported soybeans out of the U.S.”
Harvest of stress: Soybean farmers await help as tariff dispute closes China market

Kersting was one of the participants in a panel discussion about soybeans hosted by the Downtown Sioux Falls Rotary Club. South Dakota produced $2.3 billion worth of soybeans last year, the ninth highest value in the nation.
Kersting said China has “quietly” stepped back into the U.S. soybean market since Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the trade pledge in late October, after China had been boycotting purchases of U.S. soybeans in retaliation for tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. Soybean prices at grain elevators were “right around $9” per bushel before the news of the trade pledge, Kersting said, and are now “over $10.”
But farmers are not benefiting equally from the price bump. Some sold at lower prices before the trade pledge announcement.
“The prices really didn’t appreciate till after harvest was pretty much complete,” Kersting said. “The ones that had some beans stored, they’ll see those gains.”
By his rough estimate, a new $500 million Mitchell soybean processing plant that opened in September has added 25 cents per bushel in value to local cash bids. 
Lake Preston farmer Paul Casper said the price increase has pushed him “closer to break-even on beans,” while Trump’s tariffs have raised the price of farm inputs such as fertilizers.
Casper said Brazil has emerged as a rival to U.S. soybean farmers after years of infrastructure investment backed by China, which makes the future feel less certain. Yet Casper said he still has faith in Trump. 
“I’m still thinking this dealmaker dude has got something up his sleeve,” Casper said.

Kersting said the threat of tariffs nudged other buyers to the table, including Vietnam and Thailand, “who we sell a lot of soybean meal to.”
Both men warned that long-term overreliance on China leaves U.S. agriculture vulnerable.
“At the end of the day, you should not be making deals with people you don’t trust, and nobody trusts them,” Kersting said. 
Doug Sombke, president of the South Dakota Farmers Union, did not appear on the panel, but said weeks ago after the trade pledge announcement that Trump is attempting to put out a fire he himself started, “and the building is already charred.”
“We went backward from where we started, and we didn’t need to do that,” Sombke said. “This isn’t a win. We’ve been played.”
Sombke said the numbers he has heard regarding the trade agreement fall short of what producers were counting on. He said smaller and beginning farmers are being squeezed the hardest.
“Well-established farmers are just going to eat through some of their equity,” he said. “But the younger farmer, the smaller guy, doesn’t have that.”
Sarah Sellars, an assistant professor and Extension specialist at South Dakota State University, told South Dakota Searchlight that the trade deal is “positive in a market that’s been facing a lot of negative news lately,” but said farmers “are still facing really tight crop margins.”
“If we’re not factoring in the money given by government programs or crop insurance, the cost of production is higher than what we’re actually able to sell the crop for,” she said.
On Monday, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the Trump administration plans to announce a financial aid package for U.S. farmers and provide more details on the China trade deal within two weeks. The aid package is designed to compensate farmers with government payments for tariff-related losses.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in The Citizen on Nov. 20, 2025.
“No hunting” signs posted around Charlotte’s 50-acre Burn’s Meadow have stirred contention between an elected official and volunteer, resulting in the co-chair of the trails committee leaving his post after saying he was “harassed” by a selectboard member earlier this month.
Jack Pilla, co-chair of the trails committee, submitted a written resignation to the selectboard earlier this month and filed a formal complaint this week, saying selectboard member Lewis Mudge “verbally attacked” him after Pilla placed “No Hunting” signs along the perimeter of Burn’s Meadow.
Mudge, in a phone call, denied Pilla’s characterization of the conversation as “harassment,” and said his concern was rooted in the lack of proper procedure taken and the possibility that the new signs would open the town to a legal battle with an upset hunter.

Pilla said he received a phone call in September from someone wondering about hunting on other recreation paths located in the town. He said there’s always been discussion about whether hunting is allowed on town-owned lands that are near the extensive trail network. He often sees people out squirrel hunting, noting that seeing someone sitting up in a tree stand with a .22 while walking the recreation path can be off-putting for some trail users.
“That’s been a question I’ve had for many years and in the Charlotte Park and Wildlife Refuge, there is no hunting there,” he said. “I was on the [Charlotte Park and Wildlife Refuge] committee years ago, and I actually posted 290 acres of that entire park and not once did I have any negativity from the selectboard. I had some feedback from some of the locals who like to hunt there, but it is what it is.”
Pilla said former town administrator Nate Bareham — who resigned in October — gave him permission to move forward with the state’s procedure of posting the land.
The registration for Burn’s Meadow, located just off Greenbush Road, was submitted, with the town administrator’s signature, to the town clerk’s office on Oct. 13, citing the property’s proximity to the public trail system. “There are regular posted signs that the state wants you to use and that’s exactly what we used,” Pilla said. “And you have to date them, and then there’s a whole procedure of [posting] every 400 feet and it has to be on the perimeter. So, I did that.”
He said roughly 20 signs had been posted, although most, as of Monday, had been taken down, with a few still spotted along the perimeter. While the signs remained unbothered for a few weeks that followed, in November, he was contacted by Mudge. “Within a two-hour period, before I could even talk to him on the phone, he had called and texted and voice mailed me eight times,” Pilla said. “I call that harassment.”
He said after he finally called Mudge back, the conversation — which he said wasn’t really a two-way dialogue — lasted roughly three and a half minutes before he finally had to hang up. “He was just livid and was all over me,” Pilla said. “I couldn’t deal with any more of his yelling at me.”
For Mudge, the issue isn’t just whether there should or should not be hunting on town land. It was ultimately a concern over ensuring proper procedures and public input are being taken and the real possibility of opening the town to extensive legal liability. He learned about the signs from a hunter in town, who said he was prepared to consult a lawyer due to the issue.
And although Pilla went to the town administrator, Mudge says the green light should never have been given in the first place, seeing as a town administrator works under the direction and supervision of the selectboard.
“The signs say that we’re going to prosecute anyone who’s violating these laws,” Mudge said. “With all due respect to Jack, and I’m not saying that facetiously, he can’t post signs saying that the town is going to prosecute people without running that by the selectboard. The town administrator at the time, frankly, made a mistake that should have been raised with the selectboard and it wasn’t.”
Charlotte is not the only Chittenden County town in which committees are discussing how to balance the wide array of users on town-owned forests and land. The approach is, however, different.
The Citizen reported last week that the neighboring town of Hinesburg’s forest committee opted this year to close a large swath of the recreation trails in the Town Forest and the LaPlatte Headwaters Town Forest to all recreation except hunting from Oct. 25 to Dec. 14 in order to encourage the sport as a management tool to prevent over-browsing by deer.
Charlotte selectboard chair and liaison to the trails committee, Lee Krohn, did not comment on the situation or how the selectboard could chart a path forward. But in an email to Pilla following his resignation, both Krohn and Mudge expressed their dismay that Pilla had resigned from the town committee.
“Not happy you are resigning, Jack. You’ve done an admirable job on the trails committee,” Mudge wrote in an email to Pilla. “Sorry things got heated on the call, Jack. It is just that procedures were not followed correctly. I hope you will reconsider your resignation.”
Pilla, in his formal complaint, cited the town’s harassment policy as a violation and, in a separate email, requested that Mudge be removed from his selectboard seat. While his resignation remains as is for now, he did admit that he’s not sure how long he will be able to stay away from the trail work that he’s spent over two years dedicating his time to.
It remains unclear what the status of the posted signs are or how the selectboard will take the issue up. The selectboard and former town administrator have been drafting a new handbook for committees and commissions in town that they’re hoping will more clearly establish general rules of procedure for volunteers, public officers and boards.
But in this case, it may be too little, too late.
“I just don’t need this shit, selectboard members all over me when I am following procedure doing work on the trails,” Pilla wrote. “I’m a volunteer spending way too much time and energy to make a better place for people in this town and I don’t need to be yelled at by Lewis for following procedure.”
