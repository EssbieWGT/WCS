Larry Hogan (R) announced Tuesday that he will not challenge Gov. Wes Moore (D) for the governor’s mansion this fall.","Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) in a file photo from June.

Wes Moore's reelection. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).After considerable speculation on whether he would throw his hat in the ring one more time, former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) announced Tuesday, via an op-ed in The Baltimore Sun, that he will not challenge Gov. Wes Moore (D) for the governor’s mansion this fall.
In fact, Hogan declared he has “no intention of running for office again,” meaning his stunning political ascent, as a twice-elected Republican in a deep blue state, may be coming to an end.
In the piece, Hogan said he’s been “humbled” by calls from Marylanders urging him to run for governor a third time.
“Our eight years proved that Maryland is best served by leaders who understand that no one has a monopoly on good ideas,” Hogan wrote. “To my fellow Republicans: It is time to invest in a new generation of candidates who are ready to step up.”
A number of Republicans have already filed for the governor’s race, with others either running campaigns already or considering a bid. But none of them have the high profile of Hogan.
Moore’s campaign declined to comment on the development Tuesday, but it’s likely they are “breathing a sigh of relief,” said Todd Eberly, political science professor at St. Mary’s College of Maryland.
“It’s hard to imagine any Republican candidate being able to raise the amount of money that Hogan could,” Eberly said.
Poll: Moore approval numbers continue downward trend even as most voters would OK second term

Additionally, few, if any, Maryland Republicans who could run for the seat enjoy the kind of statewide name recognition that Hogan possesses, Eberly said. Maybe former Gov. Bob Ehrlich, who served from 2003 to 2007? Hardly any other names come to mind, Eberly said.
Meanwhile, the candidate filing deadline, on Feb. 24, is fast approaching.
“If you do not have the name recognition of a Larry Hogan, you’ve got to get into this now — sooner rather than later,” Eberly said.
That list includes Senate Majority Leader Steve Hershey (R- Upper Shore), who has explored running, but isn’t as well known as the two former Republican governors, Eberly said.
Hershey said Tuesday that he is “still thoughtfully considering what role I can play to help move our state in the right direction.”
“Maryland is facing serious budget and energy challenges that cannot be ignored, and it is clear we need fiscally responsible leadership to restore affordability, stability, and accountability,” Hershey said. “Any decision I make will be guided by what I believe is best for Maryland’s future.”
For the field of lesser-known hopefuls already in the race, Hogan’s announcement was welcome.
“This moment marks another important step on my journey toward the governorship,” wrote Ed Hale, a Baltimore businessman and owner of the Baltimore Blast indoor soccer team, who switched his affiliation from Democrat to Republican to run against Moore.
“I believe Maryland deserves steady leadership, fiscal responsibility, and a government that puts taxpayers first. I am committed to doing my very best for the people of this great state. Help is on the Way!” Hale wrote.
John Myrick, a Republican candidate for governor, wrote that he agrees with Hogan’s comments that “Maryland needs to look to the future, not the past.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“New leadership is needed.  Our next Lt. Governor, Dr. Brenda J. Thiam, and I look forward to restoring prosperity to Maryland once elected in November 2026,” Myrick wrote. “We thank Governor Hogan for leaving Maryland in a strong fiscal position — an advantage squandered by the current Governor.”
But the race will be exceedingly difficult for Republicans, who must surmount President Donald Trump’s (R) low approval ratings in the state, Eberly said.
Democrats’ insistence that they will not raise taxes during the current General Assembly session may make the road even more challenging for the GOP, he said.
“It increasingly allows this to be a referendum on Donald Trump and his leadership of the country, nationalizing what otherwise would be a Maryland race,” Eberly said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_june24_hogan-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 20:57:20.128666
,Mississippi Today,2026-01-21 01:29:48+00:00,Mississippi Today,Defense for ex-wrestler seeks mistrial in welfare fraud case,Anna Wolfe,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/20/ex-wrestler-seeks-mistrial-welfare-fraud/,Ted DiBiase Jr. speaks at the governor's Healthy Teens Rally in 2018.,"The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
An attorney for the only defendant yet to face a criminal trial in the seemingly never-ending Mississippi welfare fraud case has asked a federal judge for a mistrial after the team’s lead lawyer fell ill last week. 
The trial for Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr. was in the middle of its second week when the lead defense attorney, Scott Gilbert, experienced a health issue halfway through the day Jan. 14. Gilbert was in the middle of cross examining former Mississippi Department of Human Services Director John Davis – the former director’s fourth day on the witness stand – but never faltered in his questions before court stopped for a lunch break.

U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves did not immediately make a decision Tuesday on how to proceed with the case, opting to ask each juror whether they are available in February and how a pause in the trial may affect them. He said he will make a ruling on the motion for a mistrial shortly. If granted, the parties acknowledged that a new trial would be scheduled, possibly several months from now.
DiBiase is facing 13 criminal counts including conspiracy, wire fraud, theft of federal funds and money laundering in a broader alleged scheme to raid the state’s federal public assistance agency. He received roughly $3 million in federal funds from the agency through what prosecutors call  “sham contracts,” while DiBiase argues he was a lawful contractor. 
Another lawyer added to DiBiase’s defense shortly before trial, Eric Herschmann, made the case for a mistrial. 
He argued that DiBiase has a constitutional right to choose his own counsel and that the defendant has been working with Gilbert for nearly six years. The federal government first moved to seize DiBiase’s million-dollar Madison mansion – which it alleges was purchased with welfare funds – in 2020, though he was not indicted until 2023.
Herschmann said DiBiase chose well by selecting Gilbert.
“Mr. Gilbert’s cross examination of the government’s star witness was so outstanding that in the midst of the cross examination, the government indicated it was going to treat the star witness as a hostile witness on redirect,” Herschmann said.
When a party to a case treats its own witness as hostile, it generally means the witness gave testimony that was unfavorable or unexpected to that party’s case, and in turn, counsel may use strategies to get the witness to contradict or even impeach himself or herself on the stand.
Herschmann was referring to Davis. The prosecution first called Davis on Jan. 9 in its effort to build a case – using many long, sentimental text messages between Davis and DiBiase – alleging the wrestler ingratiated himself with the then-welfare director in an attempt to strike it rich off the federal public assistance program. 
The defense began questioning Davis on Jan. 12, displaying documents and social media posts to assert that DiBiase intended to carry out the services he was contracted to provide. Davis’ testimony supported many of Gilbert’s points, such as the fact that the men did not try to conceal what they were doing.

Herschmann told the judge Tuesday that he observed Gilbert’s condition during trial last week and recommended the team take a break. He said Gilbert soon visited a hospital. Herschmann said the team doesn’t expect to learn more about Gilbert’s outlook for roughly four weeks.
DiBiase is also represented by Sidney Lampton, whom Herschmann argued does not have the jury trial experience required to lead the case. Only Gilbert currently has the experience and knowledge to adequately lead the case that involves 6 million pages of records, Herschmann argued. He said preparing a new attorney could take months.
The government argued against the request for mistrial, saying DiBiase’s remaining lawyers are capable of trying the case and delays could jeopardize the testimony if witnesses become unavailable. It was divulged that Davis, for example, is currently undergoing treatment for cancer.
Herschmann, a former senior advisor to President Donald Trump, is involved in the Mississippi welfare fraud case by way of former NFL quarterback Brett Favre. 
Herschmann is representing Favre in a broader civil case that the state welfare department is bringing against dozens of people or entities that improperly doled out or received federal funds. Favre has not been charged criminally.
That litigation has dragged on since 2022. In recent months, Herschmann and the lawyers for other defendants in the case took a deposition from a former deputy state auditor, Stephanie Palmertree, who conducted the original audit exposing the misspending. There is a gag order in the civil case that many parties to that litigation have said prevents them from speaking to the media about the case. 
Palmertree left the auditor’s office to form her own accounting and consulting firm in early 2024 and DHS hired Palmertree in her new capacity to be the expert witness in the civil suit. After the deposition, and just before DiBiase’s trial, DHS filed to withdraw her as its expert witness. 
Herschmann said during his argument Tuesday that he, in Gilbert’s recent absence, worked throughout the weekend to sift through discovery in the DiBiase case.
He alleged he found conflicting information within the materials, such as transcripts, produced in the criminal case, which he recently joined, versus the civil case he’s been immersed in for years.
Without any more detail, and referring to Palmertree, Herschmann said, “She swore under oath that she fabricated evidence to the federal government.” 
In the DiBiase trial, Herschmann was expected to call Palmertree to the stand to question her handling of the audit – a long point of contention for Favre’s camp. Favre has denied the auditor’s office’s claim that Favre entered an agreement to give speeches in exchange for $1.1 million in payments from a nonprofit at the center of the scandal. Mississippi Today obtained and analyzed the agreement in 2022.
Palmertree’s attorney Melvin Priester Jr. said that because Palmertree has been called as a witness in the case, she cannot comment on Herschmann’s remarks other than that she stands by her audit.
“Any implication that she has somehow made a material misrepresentation is a mischaracterization of the evidence,” Priester said.
Herschmann also said the auditor’s office had admitted to destroying recordings. He suggested to Reeves that the criminal case requires a probe into these matters. 
Reeves asked the lawyer why this type of analysis hadn’t been conducted in DiBiase’s case up to this point. Herschmann said another lawyer is representing DiBiase in the civil case and the attorney had not requested a transcript of Palmertree’s deposition.
Reached for comment, auditor’s office spokesperson Jacob Walters said in a text, “OSA does everything by the book and Eric Herschmann will say anything to deflect from the fact that millions of dollars in welfare funds were misspent.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/06163106/ted-dibiase.png,,,2026-01-20 20:57:20.128666

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderGeorgia’s economy is showing signs of strength, but persistent inflation and slow job and wage growth have left consumers feeling sour about their finances. 
And the state economist, Robert Buschman, told lawmakers Tuesday that he expects that slow growth and higher inflation to continue. 
Buschman’s presentation to legislative budget writers put charts and graphs to the unease lawmakers are hearing from their constituents back home as affordability concerns take center stage under the Gold Dome. 
“Reluctance by businesses to hire suggests fewer opportunities to change jobs for better pay, and that those between jobs or entering the workforce will remain unemployed for longer, dragging on consumer confidence,” Buschman said. 
“Consumers also still feel squeezed by inflation. Incomes have not really kept up for the average worker. So consumer sentiment is weak,” he said. 
Inflation had been falling from the recent highs seen in 2022 but has crept back up to 2.7%. 
Buschman highlighted some bright spots for Georgia’s economy, like its low unemployment rate. But he said there are also worry-inducing factors at play, like the tariffs that have become a central element of President Donald Trump’s economic policy in his second term in office. Trump has issued new tariff threats in recent days in his pursuit of Greenland. 
The bulk of the cost of these tariffs fall on consumers and businesses, depending on much of the cost companies are willing to absorb to avoid losing sales in the short term, Buschman said. 
“As time passes, businesses, both domestic and foreign, have to pass more of the cost on to consumers to remain profitable, so we’ll see continuing upward pressure on consumer prices,” he said. 
There’s also the risk of other countries placing retaliatory tariffs on American exports. 
“Large exporting states like Georgia are the ones harmed the most by that,” Buschman said, noting that Georgia is the 12th largest export state. 
Buschman’s presentation was part of the kick-off for this week’s budget hearings at the state Capitol. The hearings continue Wednesday morning with agency heads who oversee social and health care services in Georgia.  
The state economist’s outlook also provides context for the words of caution Gov. Brian Kemp has been weaving into his public comments on the budget. As he wraps up his last year in office, the governor has been touting his administration’s conservative approach to the budget.

“It has allowed us to store up strategic reserves for the next economic downturn, ensuring you all or future legislators won’t be forced to cut critical services for Georgians when, not if, the next economic crisis hits,” Kemp said to lawmakers Tuesday. 
Kemp has proposed accelerating another incremental income tax rate decrease at a time when some legislative leaders are pushing for more aggressive steps toward eliminating it entirely. He has proposed cutting the rate to 4.99%, down from today’s 5.19%, and built his budget proposals on the assumption those revenues will be foregone. The already-planned cuts would happen three years faster than originally planned. 
He’s also proposing another round of bonus tax refunds for this year, paid for by funds from the state’s $14.6 billion reserves. With those payments to taxpayers and one-time infrastructure spending boosts, the state is still set to have about $10 billion left in reserves when Kemp leaves office next January. 
Buschman, who was appointed by Kemp, expressed skepticism about talk of eliminating the state’s income tax. A special Senate committee unveiled a plan earlier this month that would end the tax by 2032. 
“I think what the governor has been doing in lowering income tax rates slowly over time, as we were able to evaluate how much of our surpluses were structural surpluses, is the better way to go,” he said. 
Kemp told reporters Tuesday that he is optimistic about Georgia’s ability to weather any economic storms that may await. 
“We have been cautiously budgeting since we came out of the pandemic, because nobody really knew what this was going to look like,” he said. “So we’re prepared to deal with what’s going on in the world right now.”
It was also announced Tuesday that Kemp and first lady Marty Kemp would lead an economic development mission this week to Belgium and the United Kingdom. He will be there at a time of rising tensions between the Trump administration and America’s allies. 
“We cannot rest on our laurels. We’ve got to finish strong. We’ve got to keep finding people that want to grow jobs in our state so, God forbid, if somebody does lose their job, they’ve got other opportunities that pay just as well or better,” he said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1130240-scaled-e1768928913891-1024x794.jpg,,,2026-01-20 20:57:20.128666

(Photo courtesy of campaign)Democrat Garrett McGuire on Tuesday defeated Republican Christopher Cardiff in a special election to represent Virginia House of Delegates District 17, filling the vacancy left by longtime Democratic lawmaker Mark Sickles, who has joined Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s administration as secretary of finance.
By 8 p.m., McGuire led Cardiff with 80.4-19.5% out of 4,360 votes cast, according to unofficial results from the Virginia Department of Elections.
The victory allows Democrats to retain the Fairfax County–based seat, which has been reliably blue in recent election cycles and includes parts of Franconia, Rose Hill and surrounding communities. 
McGuire will serve the remainder of Sickles’ term, which runs through 2027. He is expected to be sworn in in the coming days. 
Sickles, a Democrat first elected to the House in 2003, stepped down late last year after Spanberger tapped him to lead the state’s finance portfolio, a move that triggered the special election. 
His departure was one of several that have reshaped the House since Democrats regained control of the chamber, as multiple lawmakers have left to join the new administration or pursue higher office.
In a statement Tuesday night, House Democrats praised McGuire’s win. 
“We’re excited to welcome Garrett to the House Democratic Caucus and to work alongside him to deliver a Virginia that lowers costs for families, keeps our communities safe, and stands firm against (President Donald) Trump’s attacks on Virginians’ rights and freedoms,” the caucus said.
McGuire, a longtime Fairfax County public policy professional and community leader, has chaired the board of United Community — the largest nonprofit serving the Route 1 corridor — and previously led the Fairfax-Falls Church Community Services Board, where he helped steer mental health and disability services through the COVID-19 pandemic and a major staffing shortage, his campaign biography says.
District 17 has favored Democrats by comfortable margins in recent statewide races. According to the Virginia Public Access Project, the district supported Democratic nominees for governor, attorney general and lieutenant governor in the most recent general election, and Democrats hold a significant edge in voter registration.
Tuesday’s contest marks the latest in a series of special elections prompted by turnover in the Democratic caucus. 
Earlier this month, Democrats held onto House Districts 11 and 23 in Northern Virginia, and retained two Richmond-area seats after incumbents exited the chamber. 
Those wins have helped Democrats maintain their comfortable majority as the 2026 General Assembly session gets underway.
With McGuire’s victory, attention now turns to the final special election on the calendar, a Feb. 10 contest in Senate District 39 in Northern Virginia. 
Democratic Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker of Alexandria will face Republican Julie Lineberry to fill the vacancy left by Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, who joined Spanberger’s administration as a senior adviser at the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority. 
If Bennett-Parker prevails, Democrats would continue to hold their narrow control of the Senate as Spanberger begins her first legislative session with a friendly General Assembly and an agenda focused on affordability, health care and reproductive rights.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A proposal to save a community hospital is among seven bills North Dakota legislative leaders advanced Tuesday for consideration during a special session.
Although the session that starts Wednesday is focused on federal Rural Health Transformation Program money, legislative leaders discussed 19 additional bill drafts.
Legislative leaders rejected a majority of the proposals, but voted unanimously to advance a bill drafted in response to the financial woes of Jacobson Memorial Hospital, the critical access hospital in Elgin.
Rural hospital on the verge of shutting down could be saved by lawmaker’s bill

The facility, which serves surrounding southwest North Dakota communities, is in danger of closing its doors, said Sen. Donald Schaible, R-Mott, the primary bill sponsor.
“We normally could wait for a regular session to introduce such a bill. But unfortunately, the Jacobson Memorial Hospital may not be able to survive until a regular session,” Schaible said. “They truly need our help.”
The bill would appropriate $10 million for emergency low-interest operating loans, to be administered by the Bank of North Dakota under an existing program, to hospitals in danger of shutting down in the state. 
The bill was assigned to the Joint Appropriations Committee for the three-day special session that will begin Wednesday. 
The committee also advanced two bills that relate to free school meals, proposals that are in response to a proposed constitutional ballot measure that’s circulating.
Property taxes
Lawmakers will consider a property tax bill that sponsor Rep. Craig Headland, R-Montpelier, says will clarify how the primary residence tax credit is applied.
Under legislation approved last year, homeowners are eligible for a property tax credit of up to $1,600 per year.
But the way counties are calculating that tax credit is diluting a 5% discount homeowners can receive for paying their property taxes early.
2 options for free school meals head to North Dakota special session

Headland’s bill would change how the early-pay discount is applied. Under his proposal, a homeowner could save up to $80 more per year.
The fiscal impact of the bill was not immediately clear. Counties factor in the early-pay discount into their budgets, ultimately assessing that discount back to the taxpayers.
Other approved bill drafts
Lawmakers approved a proposal from Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, to set aside $325,000 for litigation funding for the Public Service Commission and $1.5 million for North Dakota Information Technology to bring state websites and other digital content into compliance with American Disability Act requirements.
The committee also voted to forward a bill brought by Rep. Mark Sanford and Sen. Jonathan Sickler, both Republicans from Grand Forks, to authorize the University of North Dakota to use  money from a land sale for construction projects at the Ray Richards golf course or to support the school’s varsity golf teams.
What to know about North Dakota’s special legislative session

The committee also advanced a resolution brought by Rep. Glenn Bosch, R-Bismarck, celebrating the 175th anniversary of the YMCA.
The legislative committee rejected proposals that relate to redistricting, funding for Highway Patrol firearms and firefighter benefits.
The special session is scheduled to last three days but could last longer if lawmakers choose.
Lawmakers during a special session generally only consider bills related to the reason the session was called, though it’s up to the discretion of Legislative Management, a committee of legislative leaders, to accept additional proposals. 
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, said during Tuesday’s Legislative Management meeting he has concerns that approving bills that fall outside the original purpose of the session will set a precedent.
“I frequently hear, ‘Well, you did it for them, now do it for me,’ and I don’t know how we stop that train,” he said.
Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden, said the shorter timeline of special sessions means there’s a risk that legislation will not be reviewed with the same rigor as regular sessions.
“We are kind of rushing,” Klein said. 
Each bill will receive a public hearing, but the public will have a short window to provide comment. A hearing schedule and links to submit written testimony are available on the Legislature’s website.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Two bills that would address free or reduced school meals for North Dakota students will be considered by state lawmakers this week.
One bill, sponsored by Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, would mandate the state cover the cost for free school meals for K-12 students and mirrors a constitutional ballot measure. The Together for School Meals coalition is gathering signatures to put the issue to a statewide vote in November.
While the ballot measure would add the meal program to the state constitution, the bill would add the program to state law, making it easier for lawmakers to adjust if the program becomes too costly.
“We have talked to the supporters of the initiated measure and they are in full support of this bill,” Nathe said during the meeting. 
The bill advanced on a 14-3 vote of Legislative Management for consideration in the special session that begins Wednesday. 
Nathe’s free school meals bill is expected to cost $65 million for the 2026-27 school year, according to estimates by the Department of Public Instruction, and will be funded through the Strategic Investment and Improvements Fund.
“I think the ballot measure will pass,” said Gov. Kelly Armstrong in an interview Tuesday. “So, then the question becomes, do you want constitutionally mandated spending, or do you want it in legislation?”
During the meeting, Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, said she’s concerned the ballot measure process is being weaponized against lawmakers for policy considerations, and lawmakers shouldn’t be scared of protecting the state constitution.
“We are becoming a welfare state,” Myrdal said. “All of our kids in schools right now are fed. There are no hungry kids in school because we passed a law, even, to ensure that.”
A competing school lunch bill, sponsored by Rep. Ty Dressler, R-Richardton, was also advanced by the committee on a 14-3 vote and would expand the state’s current free and reduced school lunch program.
Dressler’s bill would expand the program to families earning up to 300% of the federal poverty level, which is about $96,000 for a family of four.
“I’m excited to present an alternative option,” Dressler said in an interview Tuesday. “I think it’s a good opportunity for voters to see there is more than one option instead of just passing the initiated measure.”
What to know about North Dakota’s special legislative session

He also said he wanted his bill to focus on the people who need the help.
“I think it’s a budget-friendly way of approaching an issue we can all believe in,” Dressler said.
During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers expanded the free and reduced school lunch program to include households earning up to 225% of the federal poverty level, which is about $72,000 for a family of four. 
Armstrong said he hopes lawmakers don’t lose sight of the purpose of the special session which is to allocate $199 million in Rural Health Transformation Program funding for the state that was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July as part of the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado voters along the Front Range could decide on whether to approve a new tax this year to help fund passenger rail service between Fort Collins and Pueblo.
Sal Pace, the general manager of the state’s Front Range Passenger Rail District, told lawmakers on Tuesday that the agency wants to get prepared for a ballot measure, whether it happens this year or later on. It is a process that will require a lot of public engagement and feedback.
It’s the agency’s “statutory mandate to receive public input on our plans before we refer a ballot measure,” he said during a hearing with the state Legislature’s Transportation and Energy Committee. “It’s a results-oriented approach that prioritizes milestones and evaluation metrics before referring a potential ballot question.”

The rail district was created by the Legislature in 2021 to oversee the planning, financing, construction and eventual operation of a passenger rail service along the Interstate 25 corridor. The body has the power to refer a tax to voters, but it decided not to in 2024, partially due to scant details at the time on how the service would work. Polling from that year, however, showed strong support for a 0.5% sales tax increase.
Now, the service development plan is nearly complete, and a finalized operating plan and station plans are set to be drafted soon. That gives voters a better idea of what their tax dollars would pay for.
“When I was hired as the general manager of the Front Range Passenger Rail District — I think two months and 20 days ago — was with the direction to aim for a 2026 ballot measure,” Pace said. Pace is a former state representative and longtime rail advocate.
He said there is a multi-phased approach to whether the agency will put a question on the ballot. If it doesn’t meet its goals by the end of each phase, it will not continue to the next one.
“So we’ll have two inflection points in our process over the next 10 months to determine whether or not to continue to move forward,” he said. The first phase will focus on ensuring technical and financial readiness for service and the second phase will focus on engagement.
The rail district, which encompasses all or part of 13 counties along the I-25 corridor, will launch an online platform this month to get public feedback on its plans, Pace said, and it plans to host 30 town halls by the end of April. The agency is also exploring branding options. A mocked-up image from the slideshow Tuesday, for example, shows an orange train with “Broncos Express” emblazoned on the side, zooming past snowcapped mountains.
The agency plans to ask for a bill during the legislative session that will redefine the district to align with the planned route, which was not certain in 2021.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Representatives of Iowa’s private colleges pushed back Tuesday against the narrative that baccalaureate degrees are sorely needed at community colleges, with lawmakers responding that something must change.
A House higher education subcommittee moved House Study Bill 533 to committee after hearing from private and community college leaders. The bill would authorize the state’s community colleges to offer bachelor’s degree programs, as long as they correspond with high-demand, unmet workforce needs.
Higher Education Committee Chair Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, chaired the subcommittee and was joined by Rep. John Wills, R-Spirit Lake, and Rep. Timi Brown-Powers, D-Waterloo. Community Colleges for Iowa released reports last year detailing the potential pros and cons of adding bachelor’s degree programs to community college offerings and presented findings to the committee during its first meeting of the 2026 session.

Gary Steinke, president of the Iowa Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, told the subcommittee that if this bill passes, some of Iowa’s private colleges would close. If one of these entities does close, he said, it’s not just a bunch of buildings shutting down, but also the shutdown of jobs, health care and more for the community where it is housed.
“Private enterprise cannot compete with tax-supported institutions, entities, stores, businesses, or anything else,” Steinke said. “It can’t happen and the outcome will be bad, and that makes me very sad.”
Steinke said he didn’t come to the meeting to “chastise” Iowa’s community colleges, as “they do great work,” but he rejected the existence of education deserts and said he’s never seen numbers on underserved students in different geographic areas of the state. Private institutions “spend an unbelievable amount of time” trying to learn students’ wants and needs, he said.
Brian Lenzmeier, president of Buena Vista University in Storm Lake, said the private university has been serving students on community college campuses for just over 50 years. They’ve transitioned away from offering face-to-face instruction at most of the colleges in recent years not because they wanted to, he said, but because they were losing students to online institutions like Southern New Hampshire University or the University of Phoenix.
Lenzmeier pointed out one recent partnership announced by Hawkeye Community College in November, which entered into an agreement with Arizona State University. This partnership was not an investment in the state, he said, and he believes there isn’t a big market for face-to-face bachelor’s degrees at community colleges.
Colleges like Eastern Iowa Community Colleges and Iowa Central have private colleges close to them or their satellite locations, he said, offering bachelor’s degrees at no cost to the taxpayer. Iowans deserve to know what the total cost of implementation is going to be, Steinke said, as well as how many institutions will be involved and if there will be any issues with accreditation or articulation agreements.
Jim Obradovich, speaking on behalf of Faith Baptist Bible College in Ankeny, said during the meeting he shares Steinke’s concern over geography, as the college’s two biggest programs are teaching/education and nursing. If this bill were to pass, he said it would allow a community college located a few miles away to compete with these programs — “the ones they’ve invested a great deal in.”
“We just kind of struggle a little bit to see how allowing community colleges to offer four-year baccalaureate degrees is our best use of those finite education dollars we have in the state,” Obradovich said.
Community Colleges for Iowa Executive Director Emily Shields said private colleges concerned about these questions should refer to the reports released last year, which include definitions of education deserts and other data. She added she believes community colleges have talked to their students and understand accreditation policies, “and we believe there’s both a need and an opportunity.”
“We have no desire to compete with the private colleges or put any of them out of business,” Shields said. “In the 24 states where this has happened, no private colleges have closed because community colleges are offering bachelor’s degrees.”
No more status quo
Wills said during the subcommittee meeting he was a nontraditional student who decided to attend Iowa Lakes Community College to start and Northwestern College to finish his higher education. At the time, he would have chosen to attend the private university even if Iowa Lakes offered bachelor’s degrees, but that wouldn’t be the case now with time and other constraints.
Community colleges will target the students who don’t have different higher education options available to them, he said, and he’s saying “yes” to the bill to get at that population.
“This has all kinds of different aspects and I think it’s a great idea, and I think that we should do it,” Wills said.
Brown-Powers has two private colleges, one public university and one community college in her district, she said, and their feelings toward the legislation are mixed. She feels for students who are “code bound,” but she said she’s hesitant to support the bill because there is no funding mechanism included and she’s wary of rumors of barring certain community colleges from inclusion in the legislation.
After hearing feedback from the public and his fellow lawmakers, Collins said he understands where the opposition is coming from but “the status quo is not an option.” Collins said he’s open to the conversation of potentially limiting the scope of the bill, but those who want to see limitations implemented must “be willing to come up to the table and negotiate.”
Bringing bachelor’s degrees to community colleges is not a hypothetical, with nearly half of U.S. states committing to the idea in some form, he said, and a single mom working as an RN in Burlington and a paraeducator in Council Bluffs deserve to have these opportunities.
“I am willing to look at these additional guardrails, but you have to bring them to me,” Collins said. “Until then, we will continue to advance this bill. In fact, we will be advancing this bill out of committee next week at the very latest.”

Jared Polis in 2025 signs into law a bill that implements Amendment 79, a constitutional amendment that guarantees the right to abortion and lifts a prohibition on public funds for care. (Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)After Colorado voters in 2024 approved Amendment 79 to enshrine the right to abortion in the Colorado Constitution, people seeking abortion care in the state can have that care covered by Medicaid as of 2026. 
But the success of the amendment depends on whether coverage actually results in patients accessing affordable abortion care, according to leaders with Colorado-based reproductive rights group Cobalt. 
Adequate Medicaid reimbursement rates for abortion care providers will determine whether providers are actually able to serve patients covered by Medicaid, Kiera Hatton Sena, political director at Cobalt, said in a press call Tuesday. Clinics may have to limit the number of Medicaid recipients they can treat or opt out of Medicaid entirely.

“This is incredibly acute for abortion care where providers already face elevated security costs, workforce shortages, and administrative complex fees,” Hatton Sena said. “Coverage alone does not equal access. Without the reimbursement rates that reflect the very real cost of care, staff, clinical time, follow-up, compliance, infrastructure, Colorado risks creating a legal right that patients cannot practically use.”
The effect of Amendment 79 will be measured by outcomes, including provider participation, geographic coverage and wait times, Hatton Sena said. Access in rural Colorado will be key, given the fewer providers there and patients traveling longer distances for care, she added.
“How the state continues to implement abortion coverage will shape whether or not constitutional protections coexist within a safe functioning health care system,” Hatton Sena said. 
Cobalt does not have specific data on how many people have accessed abortion care in Colorado through Medicaid so far this year, but Melisa Hidalgo-Cuellar, director of the Cobalt Abortion Fund, said the organization has seen “a handful of clients” who have had abortion care covered by Medicaid.
“It did feel like that success, that this work … that we’re doing alongside providers, this work that we’re doing alongside other advocates, is actually supporting abortion seekers (getting) that time sensitive, essential health care that they need,” Hidalgo-Cuellar said.
The various laws Colorado has passed protecting access to abortion before and after the passage of Amendment 79 affirms that “abortion is health care,” Cobalt President Karen Middleton said. Coverage of abortion care by public insurance will be treated like any other health care need, she said, which is “moving Colorado forward and setting the stage as a national model for this work.”
Colorado lawmakers in 2023 passed a law requiring private insurers to cover abortion care. It went into effect at the start of 2025. 
State and local government employees can also have abortion care covered by their health insurance since Amendment 79 removed a 1984 state constitutional amendment that prohibited the use of public funds for abortion.
Affordability is one of the biggest barriers to accessing abortion care, Middleton said, so solidifying insurance coverage for everyone amid federal and state funding cuts is critical. 
Cobalt is working with clinics and providers to ensure they are set up to accept Medicaid. The Cobalt Abortion Fund supports logistical costs that arise for people seeking abortion care, Hidalgo-Cuellar said.

Jefferson Ghrist (R-Upper Shore) Tuesday. (Photo by Steve Crane/Maryland Matters)Rural areas account for much of the area of the state, but not for many of the  voters. And that’s been a problem for lawmakers from rural districts.
That’s why they hope the newly formed Rural Caucus can finally let their voices be heard in state policy debates.
“Too often, rural issues are overshadowed by policy debates that are driven primarily by population density, rather than the reality on the ground,” said Del. Jefferson Ghrist (R-Upper Shore), co-chair of the caucus that had its first formal meeting Tuesday.
“The purpose of the Rural Caucus is very simple: To ensure that rural Maryland is heard, is respected and is thoughtfully considered in the legislative process,” Ghrist said at a news conference with fellow caucus members, Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks and House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel). The speaker created the caucus in December as part of a commitment to House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) as she assumed the speakership this year.
Atticks said the concerns of rural areas of the state are not that different from suburban and urban areas, but “the solutions are not one size fits all.”
“This is a different venue for those discussions, and the commitment from this speaker is wildly important” to that process, Atticks said.
That was echoed by Ghrist.
“Rural communities share challenges which include access to health care and secure and affordable electricity. Our transportation needs are very different. Workforce shortages, agricultural sustainability, health and safety and the ability of local governments to comply with state mandates with very limited resources is a big priority for the rural caucus,” Ghrist said. “They’re not abstract concerns. They affect real people every single day.”
When she announced the caucus in December, Peña-Melnyk acknowledged that with so much of the House coming from “the urban and suburban center of our state, I know that Western Maryland, the Eastern Shore, and Southern Maryland are not always at the table.” She said then that her office would have a “direct relationship” with the caucus, which aims to “elevate their voice and ensure that they are heard.”
The eight-member caucus is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, who come from Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore — and Howard County, said Ghrist, adding that virtually every county in the state has rural areas.
The caucus co-chair, Del. Natalie Ziegler (D-Howard) “is from the majority party, and she owns a farm, she lives in a very rural part of Howard county,” Ghrist said. “There are rural communities in Montgomery, Howard, Charles, Anne Arundel, Baltimore and Prince George’s counties. That’s the point I want to make. I think the county that has the highest acreage that’s in ag preservation is Montgomery County.”
The caucus is scheduled to hold weekly virtual meetings for at least the next five weeks, with lawmakers invited to bring their bills in for caucus review.
“I want to be very clear: The Rural Caucus is not partisan. We’re not partisan, we’re not ideological. We are practical,” he said.
Ghrist said members of the caucus is not looking for “special consideration or special treatment. We’re asking for thoughtful consideration, meaningful representation and policies that recognize our unique circumstances and contributions to Maryland. With the formation of the House Rural Caucus, rural Maryland now has a seat at the table.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2007-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 19:56:54.748793

The call focuses on a $3.5 million water contract with lithium miners and the Budd-Falen’s role approving it as part of President Trump’s Interior Department.
The post Federal lawmakers call for investigation of Wyoming’s Budd-Falen for possible criminal, ethics violations appeared first on WyoFile .","Two members of Congress asked federal officials Tuesday to investigate Wyoming lawyer Karen Budd-Falen for possible criminal violations while serving in President Donald Trump’s Interior Department.
A letter from Reps. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., and Maxine Dexter, D-Ore., to the Interior Department’s acting inspector general cites “new evidence … that demands immediate investigation.”
The correspondence under the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources letterhead focuses on a water contract between Budd-Falen’s family ranch in Nevada, a lithium mining company and Interior Department approval of the Thacker Pass Lithium mine in that state.
Reps. Huffman and Dexter question whether Budd-Falen, the third-highest-ranking person at DOI, “used her position at the DOI for self-enrichment,” violated ethical standards and broke federal law. The committee members’ Tuesday letter to Acting DOI Inspector General Caryl Brzymialkiewicz alleges the Nevada Lithium Corporation’s $3.5 million water contract with Budd-Falen family’s Home Ranch in Nevada was contingent on federal Interior Department approval.
Ms. Budd-Falen’s financial interests and official activities may have implicated federal ethics and conflict-of-interest restrictions, and possibly violations of federal criminal law.” Jared Huffman and Maxine Dexter
The two representatives, citing reports by Public Domain, the New York Times and other sources, said Budd-Falen never disclosed that her family’s ranch in Nevada had inked a deal with the Nevada Lithium Corporation. Federal law and ethic rules require strict financial disclosures and reporting by political appointees like Budd-Falen.
“Recently uncovered evidence … raises … serious questions, including whether Ms. Budd-Falen’s financial interests and official activities may have implicated federal ethics and conflict-of-interest restrictions, and possibly violations of federal criminal law,” the letter states.
Huffman is the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee and represents California’s second district along the coast north of San Francisco. Dexter represents most of Portland, Oregon, and is the top Democrat on the committee’s oversight and investigations subcommittee.
Budd-Falen, a longtime Western conservative legal activist, served in the Interior Department during Trump’s first administration and was appointed in March as the agency’s associate deputy secretary. Between those periods of government service she worked at the Budd-Falen law office in Cheyenne.
Serious questions
The 12-page letter from the representatives documents a meeting between Budd-Falen and the Nevada Lithium Corporation at the Department of Interior during Trump’s first term. The letter also catalogs a series of actions between and among the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management and high-ranking Interior Department officials regarding mine approval.
The letter outlines how worries about environmental and wildlife protections — protections that could have stalled or blocked mine approval — were overridden by department officials.
“The record unequivocally reflects an official meeting between Ms. Budd-Falen and the Nevada Lithium Corporation scheduled during the pending federal review for the Thacker Pass lithium mine, combined with a continuing, multi-million-dollar financial interest tied to the project’s success,” the committee members wrote.
“These facts raise serious questions regarding Ms. Budd-Falen’s compliance with federal ethics and conflict-of-interest laws and warrant the immediate attention of your office….”
Huffman and Dexter acknowledge a shifting legal landscape in government, but draw a line.
“While the Supreme Court has given President Trump a virtual free pass to abuse the public’s trust to enrich himself, public corruption by those he installs in federal agencies is still unlawful,” their letter reads. Consequently, they asked the acting DOI inspector for several answers.
Among those are whether Budd-Falen’s ranching interests have been appropriately identified as she works on grazing issues for the administration and whether she was required to disclose the $3.5 million deal between her family ranch in Nevada and the mining company.
They want to know whether family business structures obscured the relationships between and among Budd-Falen, the family ranch and the mining company and whether she used her official position to influence federal policy and action regarding mine approval.
The letter seeks an answer to whether officials sidelined objections of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the mine and whether any actions by officials “were intended to delay, frustrate, or limit congressional oversight or public disclosure.”
The White House on Tuesday referred questions to the Department of the Interior. The Interior Department did not respond to an email seeking comment.
U.S. Sen. John Barrasso’s office did not respond to a Tuesday email seeking comment. WyoFile did not receive a response to an email on the topic sent to U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis’s office. Rep. Harriet Hageman’s office also did not respond to an email Tuesday.
A conservation group, however, called for Budd-Falen’s suspension.
“At the very least, Secretary Burgum must suspend Karen Budd-Falen pending the outcome of any investigation,” Aaron Weiss, deputy director at the Center for Western Priorities said in a statement. “Her lack of candor to ethics officials casts a shadow on anything that crosses her desk today, and on everything that she worked on during the first Trump administration. Because Budd-Falen’s portfolio is so large, the litigation risks posed by her position alone could paralyze the Interior department for years to come.”

Tax Increment Financing can leave towns holding the bag if growth falls short.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  John Bossange: Using TIFs to fund growth is a big risk.","This commentary is by John Bossange, the president of the board of directors of Better (not Bigger) Vermont.



For taxpayers in Vermont, the success of designating Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts to promote commercial and residential development must be understood as a program with inherent risks. 
In many cities and towns across America, TIF has been a tool used by municipalities to finance public infrastructure, including streets, sidewalks, public water, public sewage treatment and stormwater management systems in a specific area designated as a TIF district.

To fund it, voters authorize a municipal bond to finance the construction of infrastructure to support the building of homes and commercial property by private developers.  
The plan is that this public investment will attract new private investment, business and visitors, incrementally increasing the value of the grand list, and generate more revenue for the city to finance and then repay the infrastructure bonded debt.  
Towns can keep 70% of this property tax revenue to pay off the bond, while 30% must be sent to the Vermont Education Fund. On paper, this reads like good news.
But there is more to TIF funding than meets the eye.
After the developers have made their money, financial shortfalls such as declining revenue projections and property values, higher assessments, administrative errors, underperforming projects and the negative impact on the Education Fund can place a city’s finances in arrears. 
Over time, if a city, town or village is not vigilant, it may not be able to grow its way out of the bond debt when the anticipated revenue stream does not materialize. The only solution then to repay any lingering debt is to increase taxes or to rely on unpredictable impact fees.
Concerns have arisen in other cities, such as St. Albans and Killington, where the TIF program’s overall economic impact is now in question. Audits frequently show delays in cost recovery and overestimated economic benefits, leaving taxpayers footing the bill for developments that did not deliver their promised benefits.  
A recent study in Kansas showed several districts falling behind in their debt repayment, forcing the city to cover shortfalls with non-TIF funds and placing additional strain on the city’s budget. 
Managing TIF funding is a complicated process. Poor bookkeeping, accounting errors, misallocation of funds, miscalculating land values, and underpaying the state’s Education Fund—as happened in Burlington—have been common and costly mistakes made by too many municipalities, especially in smaller towns and villages that lack the required expertise and staff.  
The biggest concern is the negative impact of TIF financing on the Vermont Education Fund. The use of TIF means our property tax revenue, normally sent to the fund, will be diverted to repaying the TIF bond during the repayment period. The Joint Fiscal Office reports estimate this loss to be between $3 million and $7 million annually.  
This is a major concern for those who manage the financial health of this important fund and should be a cause for alarm in all Vermont towns and cities. 
Finally, in addition to the financial risk that arises when a municipality relies increasingly on growth and development, I believe towns could become caught in a vicious cycle, spinning faster and faster, growing into one large overdeveloped TIF district as they attempt to generate enough growth, ultimately leading to unsustainable sprawl.  
Maybe some welcome that vision for Vermont. I do not, and I would like residents across our state to understand all the inherent risks of using Tax Increment Financing.  
I believe the potential environmental impacts of sprawling TIF districts and the economic impacts on a town’s need for municipal services could disrupt the quality of life for everyone. That would be a disincentive to build, which is the last thing Vermont needs, given our acute housing shortage.
I also believe there could be a taxpayer revolt if towns using TIF to promote growth for commerce and housing do not keep their eye on the ball.  
Yes, we need more affordable housing of all types built in appropriate locations. But no town wants to be on that hamster wheel of debt repayment, trying to fund unsustainable economic growth and development, all the while creating a nightmare of congestion, the need for more resources, a loss of village, town or city character, and eventual environmental degradation.

The costs that American households pay for all purchases and expenses has increased by $1,625 nationally, according to an analysis released by Democrats on the congressional Joint Economic Committee (JEC)Tuesday. 
The report was based on an analysis of Consumer Price Index (CPI) data through December 2025. In Nevada, housing and transportation costs have increased on average by $185 and $250 respectively. 
The analysis is the same method that the Republicans on the JEC used under the Biden administration.
During a speech at the Detroit Economic Club last week, Trump falsely claimed that “inflation has stopped” and that “prices are down.” The morning of Trump’s speech, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the CPI increased 2.7% in December compared to December 2024.
 “The data is clear: Donald Trump’s reckless policies and tariffs have done nothing to lower costs for families in the last year,” Nevada Democratic U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen said in a statement Tuesday.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A leading North Dakota oil producer is pausing new drilling amid low oil prices, but state regulators emphasized Tuesday the company is not exiting the Bakken.
Continental Resources Founder Harold Hamm said in a recent interview it will be the first time in 30 years the company will not operate a drilling rig in the state. But the company, the No. 2 oil producer in North Dakota, will continue to operate existing wells and likely reevaluate the economics of drilling in a few months.
“Continental is not pulling up stakes and leaving the state,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said during Tuesday’s meeting of the North Dakota Industrial Commission. 
Continental Resources had been operating three drilling rigs in North Dakota, but one has ceased operations, said Nathan Anderson, director of the Department of Mineral Resources. The two other rigs are expected to go offline by early March, Anderson said. 
Hamm told Bloomberg News that oil and gas companies are reassessing their drilling activity in all oil fields, not just North Dakota’s Bakken, due to thin profit margins.
“There’s no need to drill it when margins are basically gone,” Hamm said in the article.
A public relations representative from Continental Resources did not return a phone call seeking comment Tuesday.
North Dakota oil production resilient even as prices have declined

The breakeven price for companies operating in North Dakota ranges from $50 per barrel to $65 per barrel in West Texas Intermediate prices, depending on the geographic location, Anderson said. The price of WTI oil was $60 per barrel as of Tuesday morning. 
Low oil prices are likely to continue unless the supply of crude oil on the international market drops significantly or if demand grows quickly. 
“It’s a world problem. It’s not just a North Dakota issue,” Anderson said. “We’re oversupplied by 2 (million) to 3 million barrels right now.”
There are 30 active drilling rigs in North Dakota, three fewer than a year ago at this time, Department of Mineral Resources data shows. By comparison, the state had 27 drilling rigs operating during a downturn in 2016 and 11 rigs operating amid the COVID-19 downturn in the summer of 2020.
“To be clear, this isn’t the first time an oil company has laid down rigs,” Armstrong said. “It’s happened a lot.”
Anderson said he has heard from two other companies that have indicated they plan to halt drilling in the Bakken. 
Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said a divide has been developing between privately-owned companies and public companies traded on the stock market.
“The private companies have taken similar actions, or are in the process of taking similar actions,” Ness said. “The public companies have maybe gone from three rigs back to two rigs, tapping the brakes a little bit.”
North Dakota produced an average of 1.1 million barrels of oil per day in October, the most recent figures available. Only Texas and New Mexico produce more. 
While companies will sometimes shut in production due to low prices, Ness said he has not heard of that happening at this time. 
“You’re still producing the wells that you have,” Ness said. “We’re still going to make 1.1 million barrels a day for a while, but it will decline the longer this goes on.”
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, said if other operators stop drilling, that impacts state oil tax revenue as well as sales tax revenue. 
Many drilling and hydraulic fracturing crews are based in Williston, Bekkedahl said, which means downturns in activity have a significant impact on the local community.
“As they start to downsize their operations, we take significant reductions in population to the city of Williston,” he said.

What Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla saw there",Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2026/01/california-city-ice-detention-senators/,"California Democratic Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff visited the newest and largest ICE detention center in the state, a former prison in Kern County. CoreCivic operates this site.","In summary
California Democratic Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff visited the newest and largest ICE detention center in the state, a former prison in Kern County. CoreCivic operates this site.


This is a developing story that will be updated.
Democratic U.S. Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff today conducted an oversight visit at the state’s newest and largest immigrant detention center, located in California City, about 100 miles north of Los Angeles. 
In remarks to reporters, both highlighted what they described as inadequate medical care at the site. 
“The most frequent feedback we got was the inadequacy of the medical care they are receiving,” said Schiff. He described meeting a diabetic detainee who he said has not received treatment for her condition in two months. “That’s frightening,” he said.
More than 1,400 people are currently held at the California City Detention Facility, run by the private for-profit prison company CoreCivic in the middle of the Mojave Desert. It opened in late August under a contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with a capacity to hold 2,560 detainees.
Previously, CoreCivic operated the site as a state prison. The Newsom administration ended the contract in 2024 as it closed several state prisons because of California’s declining incarcerated population.
“They’re going to have to do something very different if they’re going to meet the medical needs of the people here, let alone adding another 1,000 people,” Padilla said.
Before entering the facility, Schiff and Padilla said they were conducting the inspection to “respond to complaints and questions from constituents about the conditions that detainees are in” and to “see firsthand what this facility is like.” 
“On this anniversary of the second Trump administration, one year in, there are a couple things we already know his term is defined by: the cruelty and over-aggressiveness of the mass deportation agenda,” said Padilla. 
“This is a necessary part of our oversight,” said Schiff. “We’ve all been working with constituents who have been detained here or are detained here and have described the falling conditions.” 
By law, members of Congress have a right to conduct unannounced inspections of immigration detention centers. But Padilla’s spokesman said the senators arranged the visit in advance. 
In July, House Democrats sued the administration over a policy requiring seven days advance notice for visits, which they argued violated federal law. In December 2025, federal Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked the seven-day notice policy while the case plays out in court.
Following a deadly shooting incident involving an immigration officer in Minneapolis, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued a new memorandum on Jan. 8 re-imposing the seven-day notice requirement. On Jan. 19, Cobb did not immediately block this new, reinstated policy, concluding that the Jan. 8 directive was a “new agency action” that required a different legal challenge than the one previously decided. 
When President Donald Trump took office a year ago, roughly 40,000 people were being held in immigration detention across the nation. By the start of December, that number had risen by almost 75%, with nearly 66,000 people held in immigration detention across the United States and the system reportedly capable of holding 70,000 people on any given day — the highest level in U.S. history, according to government data.
Last month, the California Attorney General’s office warned of “dangerous conditions” at the California City facility. In a Dec. 19 letter to Noem, attorney Michael Newman wrote the California Department of Justice “has grave concerns about the conditions at the facility and the lack of adequate medical care,” after inspecting the facility.   
Attorney General Rob Bonta said the facility had “opened prematurely and was not prepared to handle the needs of the incoming population.”
Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, previously told Calmatters that the site has robust medical and mental health care on site, including around-the-clock access to those services. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”
“There are no delays in individuals getting their prescription medications,” Gustin said.
In November, detainees at the facility sued, alleging the facility is polluted by sewage leaks and insect infestations, and that detainees can’t get proper medical attention for life-threatening conditions.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012026-Padilla-Schiff-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-20 19:56:54.748793

Senate District 26 GOP primary. (Image: NC Newsline)The most powerful Republican in the North Carolina Senate is trailing his 2026 primary opponent by 5 points in a poll released Tuesday, less than two months away from the March 3 contest.
Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) trails Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page in the poll by Republican-aligned firm National Research Inc., due to a crushing deficit in his home county, where Page leads him by 30 points. He remains ahead in more populous Guilford County, with 40% support against Page’s 29%.
The poll, which surveyed 250 Republican primary voters in the district from Jan. 15 to Jan. 18, was commissioned by longtime GOP political consultant Marc Rotterman. Neither Rotterman nor National Research Inc. are affiliated with the Berger or Page campaigns.
“This race is a jump ball with a slight edge to Sam Page’s campaign,” Rotterman said in a statement. “The question is, can Sam Page compete financially with Senator Berger’s massive war chest, or is this a race where the base has already made up their mind on the incumbent?”
The Berger campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the results.

Chris Cooper, a political scientist at Western Carolina University, said he remains skeptical that Page has the lead in the race. He noted that the National Research poll has a fairly limited sample size, and that its result is within the margin of error of 6.2%, meaning either candidate could be on top.
“If you apply that, you’d say this is a tied race,” he said. “It’s getting a clear and consistent signal that this is a very close race.”
Berger, who has led Senate Republicans for 21 years and the state Senate as a whole for 15, is deeply unpopular in Rockingham County, according to the poll. About 33% of residents surveyed have a favorable opinion of Berger, while 54% view him unfavorably, closely mirroring the margin in the race in Rockingham County
A key issue in the race, the National Research poll indicated, is casino gambling. Just 13% of those surveyed said they would be more likely to support a candidate who supports casino gambling in North Carolina, while 46% said they would be less likely to do so. In 2023, Berger led a high-profile push for a bill that would have brought casinos to a few rural North Carolina counties, including Rockingham.
That effort failed in part because it proved deeply unpopular among those counties’ residents — and the poll appears to indicate many voters have not forgotten Berger’s role. The National Research poll found that 43% of voters surveyed said Berger “represents special interests in Raleigh” against 24% who said Berger “represents us.”
By contrast, Page, who has been Rockingham County’s sheriff for 28 years, holds a high favorability rating in the views of surveyed voters. He was among the loudest voices opposing the casino proposal, calling it part of a “slippery slope” that would exacerbate social issues in the community.
“This is a very evangelical Christian district, and they’re just against gambling on principle,” Rotterman said in an interview. “For Page, he has an enormous amount of goodwill as you can see in his favorables, and I think that’s carried him so far.”

A key question remains how unaffiliated voters, which number more than 24,000 in the district, will behave. Unaffiliated voters are less likely than affiliated voters to cast a ballot in primary elections. But if significantly more unaffiliated voters than usual vote in the Republican primary — especially Democratic-leaning constituents in Guilford Co. who may seek to oust Berger — the results of the race could be difficult for any poll to predict, Cooper said.
“I think this is the most important state Senate primary, maybe in North Carolina history,” Cooper said. “If we see an interruption of those patterns, then it’s anybody’s guess what happens.”
The National Research survey  is the second recent poll to show Berger trailing in his primary, despite the endorsement of President Donald Trump and more than $2 million in ad buys by groups supporting his candidacy. A December poll by Opinion Diagnostics, affiliated with the Page campaign, showed the sheriff leading by 10 points in the race.
However, a January poll by Neighborhood Research and Media, led by Republican consultant and pollster Rick Shaftan, showed the reverse of the National Research poll, with Berger on top by 4 points among 325 Republican primary voters. That poll found only a 2o-point deficit for Berger in Rockingham and a larger lead in Guilford, where he led Page 46% to 18%.
In an exchange on social media site X with a pro-Berger account, Shaftan said negative ads against Page — which have slammed Page  over investigations by the State Bureau of Investigation — were the top reason voters gave for an unfavorable view of Berger.
“If the anti-Page barrage continues for another 7+ weeks, it will drive a total FU vote against Berger and this race won’t be close,” Shaftan said on social media. “Your consultants are ripping you off. I love negative ads more than anyone, but all your ads now should be positive. The negative stuff just isn’t working.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/berger-page.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota doctors say immigration crackdown is forcing patients to hide, endangering lives 
Diabetics rationing insulin. Jaundiced babies missing appointments. Appendicitis festering untreated for days. Expectant mothers laboring in hiding.
These were just some of the anecdotes shared by five Minnesota physicians Tuesday at a hastily scheduled Capitol press conference on the health care impacts of the federal law enforcement surge across the state. 
They were flanked by Democratic-Farmer-Labor Sens. Alice Mann and Matt Klein, both physicians. The group evoked a climate of fear keeping patients and their loved ones out of Minnesota clinics and hospitals.
“The only other time in history I can remember having a group of physicians standing in front of you (like this) was during COVID…this is a moment of crisis in our state,” Mann said to an audience of several dozen press, legislative staff and medical workers. 
The gathering came after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security recently subpoenaed Hennepin Healthcare for the I-9 forms it uses to confirm its workers’ identities and employment eligibility. Those forms include workers’ home addresses, Social Security numbers and other sensitive personal information.
Hennepin Healthcare operates Hennepin County Medical Center, a major safety net hospital in downtown Minneapolis that serves a relatively high proportion of uninsured and underinsured patients. Earlier this month, elected officials and HCMC staff called on hospital administrators to do more to protect patients after reports emerged that federal agents stood watch by a shackled detainee’s bedside and prevented family members from visiting him for more than a day over the New Year holiday.
Another detainee, Alberto Castaneda Mondragon, reportedly remains hospitalized at HCMC under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision after sustaining a “catastrophic” and “life-threatening” head injury in the hours after his Jan. 8 arrest, according to a lawsuit reviewed by Sahan Journal. It’s unclear exactly how the injury occurred, but the lawsuit alleges Castaneda Mondragon told hospital staff that he was roughed up by federal agents. 
In a statement about the New Year detention, HCMC said “any federal agents arriving with a patient presented appropriate identification, adhered to our established processes, and left after (hospital security) asked for documentation to support their continued presence.”
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to an email seeking comment.
The doctors assembled at the Capitol on Tuesday made clear that those assurances don’t go far enough.
Klein, a former Hennepin Healthcare physician running for U.S. Congress in Minnesota’s 2nd District, said he’d cared for “numerous patients” at HCMC in the midst of “formal interactions with the law…but I’ve never heard a concern over 35 years of practice that patients’ rights were violated.”
Klein tied what he said were federal agents’ disregard for patient privacy and well-being with the killing earlier this month of Renee Nicole Good, a U.S. citizen and mother of three. According to media and witness reports, agents rebuffed a physician who arrived at the scene shortly after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot Good at least three times. 
Klein said Good still had a pulse “eight minutes” after the shooting.
“I can’t say how much that stirs the blood of those behind me…and I believe it stirs the blood of every patriotic Minnesotan,” he said.
One by one, working physicians stepped up to the mic to describe the toll of a federal immigration and “anti-fraud” operation that has mushroomed into something more. Gov. Tim Walz last week described the roughly 3,000-agent force as an “occupation.”
Erin Stevens, chair of the legislative committee for the Minnesota chapter of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said ICE agents have waited in vehicles outside hospitals, routinely entered medical buildings and even followed patients into emergency rooms. 
Fewer patients are presenting at metro-area labor and delivery triage units amid a spike in requests for home births among patients who had previously intended to deliver in hospital and for whom home birth “is not a safe option,” Stevens added.
Janna Gewirtz O’Brien, a member of the executive board of the Minnesota chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said trauma stemming from “violence and the threat of family separation” could affect her young patients for many years to come. 
In the here and now, new mothers are laying low and deferring checkups for their babies as they weigh the benefits of health care against the risk of indefinite detention, Gewirtz O’Brien said. 
Families that feel safe enough to venture outdoors face health risks through no fault of their own, Gewirtz O’Brien added, noting the apparently incidental tear-gassing of a family vehicle in north Minneapolis during a chaotic ICE operation last week. A six-month-old riding in the vehicle was admitted to a nearby hospital with breathing problems.
“Chemical weapons have no place in our neighborhoods or schools. They can have life-threatening effects on children,” she said. “It’s only a matter of time before a child dies.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260119_0862-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)A state lawmaker proposed slight changes to an Idaho law approved last year that limited highway districts’ abilities to make bicycle or pedestrian improvements. 
Rep. Brooke Green, D-Boise, introduced a bill Tuesday that would specify that the limitations on those projects wouldn’t apply if the highway district received a federal or other grant specifically for standalone bike and pedestrian infrastructure. The bill would also narrow the criminal penalties for violating the law so they only apply to the elected officials, rather than “any person” who violated it. 
“The two proposed changes are few, not necessarily all the changes I’d love to see, but I think this is a good start,” Green told the House Transportation and Defense Committee on Tuesday. 
Last year, the Idaho Legislature approved Senate Bill 1140 and SB 1144, which narrows the definition of what constitutes the “for primary benefit of motor vehicles,” and prohibits highway districts from building standalone bike and pedestal projects except in specific locations, such as near parks or schools. It also prohibits highway districts from narrowing roads if they aren’t residential. 
The bills made it a misdemeanor crime to violate the law. 
Opponents of the bills argued they would hamper efforts to address bicycle and pedestrian safety after accidents or to slow traffic in cities, BoiseDev reported. 
The bill applies statewide, but largely impacts the Ada County Highway District, which covers the state’s most urban area in the Treasure Valley, BoiseDev reported. 
The committee unanimously voted to introduce the bill, which allows it to come return to the committee for a public hearing.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — After an attempt at a raise backfired last year, a panel of senators advanced a bill Tuesday that would give legislators back their longstanding $1,000 monthly expense allowances.
The 21-member Senate Finance Committee voted unanimously to advance the proposal. The bill includes backpay starting in July 2025, the first month legislators didn’t get their money, and would give them a lump sum of whatever amount legislators would have received by the time the governor signs it.
The state Supreme Court declared unconstitutional that portion of legislators’ paychecks, meant to cover expenses that come up outside the legislative session, as part of a decision striking down a budget clause that would have increased the amount from $1,000 to $2,500 monthly. Since legislators simply changed the amount in the budget, the 30-year-old monthly payments got caught in the crossfire, effectively cutting legislators’ pay by $12,000 per year.
The allowance stopped before the court’s November decision. In June, just before the financial year began, the court put the payments on pause pending a final decision, meaning legislators haven’t received their monthly pay for nearly six months.
Legislators continue to receive their annual salaries of $10,400 annually, and after the legislative session started again last week, they began receiving their $240 allowance intended to cover their costs for dining and staying in Columbia each day of session. They also get mileage for one round-trip weekly.
A raise is still possible, but the first step is restoring the pay legislators have come to expect since 1995, Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey told reporters ahead of the legislative session’s start.
Although many legislators have jobs that allow them to cover costs out of their own pockets, others, including retirees on fixed incomes, need to know how much they can expect to receive each year, the Edgefield Republican said. They may struggle to afford the extra expenses without the help, he added.
“Those folks, those who cannot have other employment, those people who are retired, they make plans based on what you’ve told them the income is going to be,” Massey said. “And when you tell them that they’re going to get $1,000 a month, they plan for that.”
One ex-legislator, who’s been in jail since last summer, is excluded from the back pay: former Rep. RJ May.
Senators put in an exception for any legislator who’s convicted of or who pleaded guilty to a felony during the pay pause. That only applies to the West Columbia Republican. The founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus pleaded guilty in September to sending videos of children being sexually abused. He was sentenced earlier this month to 17 years and six months in federal prison.
May resigned from the House in August, one month after the pause began. His resignation coincided with those of Sen. Roger Nutt, a Spartanburg Republican who resigned following an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, and Rep. Bobby Cox, a Greer Republican who initially planned to run for Nutt’s seat before later changing his mind and withdrawing. Rep. Chris Murphy, a Dorchester County Republican, turned in his resignation a week later, which took effect Jan. 5.
Those three would receive backpay until their effective resignation date. The legislators elected to replace them would get backpay starting after their swearing-in ceremonies.
No legislators have yet proposed a standalone bill that would put the pay raise back on the table. The idea is worth discussing, Massey said, but a pay increase would likely face an uphill battle this year, as members of the House campaign to keep their seats.
Yet, if legislators want a raise, this could be their only chance to get one for another three years.
The state Supreme Court decided pay raises can only take effect after an election, when a new General Assembly is chosen. If legislators miss the January 2027 window, they will have to wait until January 2029, following the 2028 elections, to get an increase.
Some opponents of the pay raise, including Massey, wouldn’t be against increasing the amount legislators receive. The bigger problem for Massey was the late-night addition of the raise to the state budget, which received little debate and no input from the public.
Senators made a point to reinstate their pay through a stand-alone bill voted on in a public hearing, not through the budget process as it was in the past.
“Whatever we do, my hope is that it’s going to be much more transparent and open than the process that we had before,” Massey said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_6059-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

Michelle Lujan Grisham delivered her final State of the State address on Jan. 20, 2026, and called on lawmakers to embrace bipartisanship in the 30-day legislative session. (Kate Russell for Source NM)In her final State of the State address, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham laid out an ambitious blueprint for lawmakers over the next month, with priorities ranging from her relatively new universal child care platform to longstanding public safety objectives.
She opened, however, with a video that showed her at a table in Tia Sophia’s with several of her predecessors: Republican Governors Gov. Susana Martinez, Gary Johnson and Garrey E. Carruthers (former Democratic Gov. Toney Anaya appears via phone call, as well).
The restaurant, she said, is where she’d meet the late Sen. John Arthur Smith, who died in 2024, to hash out budget items, and where many elected officials meet to talk about the future of New Mexico and its capital city.
The governor, who has not always gotten along with members of her own Democratic party, let alone Republicans, used her final speech to underscore a message of finding common ground, a theme she has spoken of more frequently in the past year, including at a public event in Utah last fall with Republican Gov. Spencer Cox.
“Let’s teach America, because I think they need to learn again, that bipartisanship is not something to give up or to leave behind,” she said during her address. “It’s the New Mexico model.”
Lujan Grisham also used the speech to make her pitch for universal child care, and to underscore her accomplishments over the last seven years.
“What we’ve built over the last seven years isn’t just a list of accomplishments,” she said. “It’s a blueprint. The story of the past seven years starts with the children who represent the future of our state.”
Paying for universal child care
Lujan Grisham first unveiled the state’s plan for universal child care last September. While questions have emerged since then about capacity, perhaps the greatest hurdle lies in the Legislature, where lawmakers appear reluctant to pay for the governor’s plan, which calls for a $160 million spending increase.
“I’m asking for a $160 million recurring increase for universal childcare to cement our legacy as a state of generational opportunity instead of a state with generational poverty,” she said in her address. 
However, when lawmakers in early January presented their budget proposal, they only called for increasing the Early Childhood Education and Care Department’s spending by $13.7 million. Legislative Finance Committee analysts at the time wrote that universal free childcare will “create additional demand for childcare assistance without the necessary revenues to implement this policy decision should more people apply and qualify for subsidies.”
In Tuesday’s speech, Lujan Grisham said 10,000 additional kids are enrolled in child care because of the changes the state has made, and highlighted one specific family: Kenny and Crystal Martinez, a firefighter paramedic and emergency room nurse, respectively. 
“They’ve had to rely on alternating overtime shifts to make ends meet,” the governor said, and had two children who didn’t qualify for assistance because their combined income was too high.   “That meant one parent staying home while the other one was at work. That meant, as I said, 12-hour shifts at work followed by long stretches caring for the baby alone. It was lonely, it was stressful — and it’s just too damn hard.”
The governor also gave a shout-out to the other side of the equation: the child care providers, spotlighting Angela Garcia, who runs a child care center in Las Cruces.
“With the enhanced rate in universal childcare, which you all did, she‘s given everyone on her staff a raise — helping great caregivers to keep doing what they love,” Lujan Grisham said. “And now, she’s expanding her childcare centers. She’s serving an additional 80 infants and toddlers to meet the new demand for care.”
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said during her State of the State address on Jan. 20, 2026, that she did not consider her final regular session “a victory lap.” (Kate Russell for Source New Mexico)
Education
Education in New Mexico is “not where it needs to be,” Lujan Grisham said in Tuesday’s address. However, she touted meaningful ground the state has gained in recent years.
In 2024, for example, nearly 80% of high school students across the state graduated on time, the highest such rate in 15 years, she said. She said she hopes to hit the national benchmark of 87% this year.
The governor also included funding and legislation to boost literacy and math rates as part of her agenda, as well as a cell phone ban.
“Our approach isn’t about troubleshooting around the edges,” she said. “It’s about rebuilding our education system from top to bottom so fewer kids fall behind, more stay engaged and more gain the skills they need.”
Last year, Lujan Grisham signed into law Senate Bill 11, which required local school districts and charter schools to adopt a wireless communication device policy. She called the policy a good “first step,” but also said she was “profoundly disappointed” lawmakers chose to amend the bill to make compliance optional for local districts. 
She also called on lawmakers to permanently establish the Office of Special Education, which she established within the Public Education Department in 2023 by executive order, “so families don’t have to fight the system.”
Economic development
The governor included $150 million in tax credits “to solidify New Mexico’s position as a national leader in investment for future-forward technologies like quantum and fusion energy.” 
Lujan Grisham last fall announced a $120 million dollar partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, called the Quantum Frontier Initiative, saying she wanted New Mexico to be known as the “home of quantum computing.”
New Mexico Governor announces new federal quantum computing partnership

This year, the company Quantinuum opened a research and development facility in New Mexico. It joins other private sector and government quantum startup efforts in the state, including the state-funded Roadrunner Quantum Venture Studio and the federally funded Quantum Tech Hub. In September, Pacific Fusion, a California-based fusion energy company, announced plans to build a $1 billion research and manufacturing campus in Albuquerque.
The state Economic Development Department in early December released a 158-page report that calls for further growth in science and technology fields including quantum systems, advanced energy and aerospace.
“When these students graduate from college or earn their certificates from trade or technical schools, we’ve got the strongest economy in history waiting for them,” Lujan Grisham said Tuesday. “Over the last seven years, we’ve added 150,000 jobs, including in rural communities.”
A December Legislative Finance Committee report found that, unlike much of the nation, New Mexico’s economy is not in or near a recession, despite President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” having an outsized effect on New Mexico’s traditional revenue sources, including corporate income taxes.
She touted how the national firm Moody’s Ratings earlier in January upgraded New Mexico’s bond rating to one of the highest national rankings.
“The people who measure risk for a living see our state as one of the smartest bets in the country,” she said. “It means lower borrowing costs — so we can build roads, schools and housing while saving taxpayers money. It means more investor activity, bringing funding and jobs to our state. It means that after years of being underestimated, New Mexico hasn’t just arrived — ladies and gentlemen, we’re leading the way.”
Infrastructure
The recent economic growth means the state’s infrastructure needs upgrading, Lujan Grisham said. 
She also called for an interest-rate buydown program to make owning a home more attainable in New Mexico.
Lujan Grisham specified in her speech money for roads and housing, specifically:

a $1.5 billion transportation bonding package to fund major state-managed road projects and free up funds for local improvements. 
$110 million for new housing units and homelessness initiatives.
zoning reform to expedite and increase housing production.

Climate
Lujan Grisham painted New Mexico as a national leader in renewable energy. In 2019, she signed into law the Energy Transition Act, which set benchmarks for New Mexico utilities to transition to 100% renewable energy sources.
In December, the New Mexico Environment Department unveiled a Climate Action Plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The crowd gave Lujan Grisham the loudest applause of her remarks when she called on lawmakers to codify the plan into state law.
Legislation to codify the governor’s Climate Action Plan to cut pollution 45% by 2030 and meet net-zero emissions goals by 2050 will once again be heard at the Legislature. Last year, the Clear Horizons Act, sponsored by Senate President Pro Tem Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque), failed to advance beyond Senate Finance. This year’s legislation had not been introduced as of publication, but Stewart has described it as “shorter and leaner.”
Lujan Grisham also said she wants to see a commission to “leverage and utilize private and public investments, grow our economy and protect consumers and businesses, while meeting exploding energy demands with more clean power.”
Public Safety
Public safety has emerged as an area of frustration for the governor over her two terms. She called a special session in 2024 to focus on public safety, but her agenda was thwarted by Democratic lawmakers. She then embarked on a statewide tour to gin up support for her public safety agenda. Last year, she excoriated lawmakers at the end of the session for not adequately addressing juvenile crime in the aftermath of a March 21 mass shooting in Las Cruces.

Since then, legislative Republicans also have held town halls focused on public safety, including juvenile justice. Republican lawmakers on Tuesday cast themselves as “unlikely allies” with Lujan Grisham on public safety matters. During their own public safety town halls across New Mexico, several elected Republicans made reference to that unlikely alliance in their requests to include public safety matters on this year’s legislative agenda. Democrats, likewise, announced plans to tighten regulations on firearm dealers.
Lujan Grisham on Tuesday referenced her own frustration over the lack of progress with her public safety priorities. In the last seven years, she said she has pushed for more engagement on public safety and “more backbone.”
Colfax County residents weigh in on crime

“If anyone tells you we’ve done enough to rein in violent crime, ask them if they would say that to a family made smaller by violence,” she said. “Would they say it to the parents trying to protect their kids? Would they say it to the children who have lost someone they love because we refused to keep dangerous criminals behind bars? I don’t think they would.”
During her State of the State, Lujan Grisham specified legislation geared at:

juvenile justice reform to address severe teen crimes. 
assault weapons ban and gun dealer accountability to fight gun violence
strengthening penalties on felons in possession of firearms. 
stricter pre-trial detention measures for suspects charged with violent crimes.

Senate Republicans, in a news conference immediately following the governor’s speech, said they felt vindicated by the governor’s emphasis on public safety, though Sen. Bill Sharer (R-Farmington), the minority floor leader, sharply criticized her proposals for an assault weapons ban and more accountability for sellers. 
He also credited the state oil and gas industry for the accomplishments the governor touted in her speech.
“The governor took credit for a lot of stuff today, and granted, a lot of stuff happened, some of it even good,” Sharer said. “But it was because we had a thriving oil and gas industry.”

Health care
Health care also has emerged as an area of overlap between the governor and legislative Republicans.
“We’re seeing this fight play out at the national level — arguments over who deserves care, and what kind of care you deserve,” she said Tuesday. “Here’s my take: Healthcare shouldn’t depend on who you are, where you live, or how much money you make. It’s not a luxury. It should be a fundamental right  in America.”
Lujan Grisham backs legislation that will address:

medical malpractice reform to lower the cost of care and keep health care professionals in New Mexico. 
health care licensing compacts to ease staffing shortages, build a workforce pipeline and improve access for patients. 
eliminating the gross receipts tax on medical services to keep care affordable.
building the University of New Mexico’s medical school to double enrollment and educate the next generation of health care workers. 

In closing her speech, the governor returned to the theme of bipartisan agreement, asking lawmakers to “talk to each other” and spend time together at a list of local restaurants within walking distance of the Roundhouse, including Tia Sophia’s, Tomasita’s, The Pantry, The Shed, La Choza, Market Steer, Palace Prime, Pink Adobe and Plaza Cafe. “Communicate. Listen. Disagree. And keep trying.”
She also specified she did not consider her final regular session “a victory lap.”
“We’re not slowing down. We’re just going to push forward,” she said. “Let’s double down and do it all.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Govfeaturekaterussell-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

Rent stabilization? Rent control? 
Whatever name you choose for the Providence City Council’s much-anticipated measure to regulate apartment prices, the ordinance has finally entered into public view, two days ahead of its formal introduction at Thursday’s upcoming council meeting.
The ordinance, should it survive the council’s policymaking process intact, promises a 4% annual cap on rent increases, plus a bevy of exemptions meant to soothe property owners’ concerns about the potentially deleterious effects the measure could have on their business. 
Last January, the Providence metro area’s notably pricey housing market was rated by RedFin as the least affordable in the nation, a dubious distinction which City Council President and ordinance primary sponsor Rachel Miller embraced at a Tuesday afternoon press event in Providence’s Elmwood neighborhood. The city has seen rents increase by 40% since 2020, she said.
“Has our income increased by 40% in the last five years?” Miller asked the crowd, which roared a collective no.
With the city’s rent increases averaging about 16% in recent years, Miller said, “It means that far too often, a rent increase — even within 60 days’ notice mandated by state law — is an eviction notice by another name. It has to stop.”
Miller was joined Tuesday by several of her fellow City Councilors and ordinance cosponsors, plus a few dozen advocates, tenants and even a landlord, to extoll the proposal’s specific design, with many of the features installed to prevent the mistakes and unintended consequences made in other cities with similar policies. 
Miller argued that rent stabilization “does not decrease housing production,” and offered Portland, Maine, as an example, where she said the construction of new homes has not ceased or even slowed since the city introduced “the strongest rent stabilization in the country at the time in 2020.” 
“No shade on Portland,” Miller said. “Our housing market is hotter than Portland, Maine.”
To appease landlords, the proposed ordinance would exempt newly built apartments for 15 years. Smaller landlords who live in their properties — provided they have three or fewer units — would also be exempt; these owners would have the option to exempt a second property. 
Gabe Long, a Providence resident, is one of these small landlords. He told the crowd he owns and lives in a building where he rents out the other unit, and he owns a second property as well. 
Long said he was concerned when the house next door to him went up for sale. He wondered if some anonymous real estate giant from Boston or New York would come in and “squeeze every single possible dollar out of it.”
Instead, a local couple purchased the building, Long said. They don’t live there, but they rake the leaves and salt the sidewalk when snow falls.
“It’s their one investment property, and they care about it, and same as me, they want long-term tenants because they want stable income,” Long said. “They don’t want to jack up the rent every chance they get in order to give a theoretically improved return on investment presentation to a room full of shareholders.” 
Once introduced on Thursday, the measure will go to the council’s Committee on Health, Opportunity, Prosperity, and Education. The council’s double-pass process means the ordinance will have to pass committee and full-council votes more than once, giving plenty of opportunities for substantial revisions to emerge.
The process has only just begun, Miller acknowledged.
“In the coming weeks — and really it’s already been going on for months — a narrative of fear will be unleashed on our city,” Miller said. “We will hear a long list of ‘the sky is falling’ worst case scenarios. But the reality is this ordinance will make Providence stronger, not weaker.”

Opponents: ‘Be very wary of the narrative’
Depending on whom you ask, the ordinance is a long-awaited measure of relief or certain chaos for the capital city’s housing market.
In his turn at the podium Tuesday, Eric Hirsch, a professor of sociology at Providence College, said that Providence is a city full of “middle-class housing that has gotten old.” With little profit incentive to make affordable housing — a business model whose origin he located in the Ronald Reagan era — Hirsch argued that the city’s many multifamily homes were built for a now defunct version of the middle class. 
Now these buildings are populated by those who make less, but can’t find affordable housing either. Hirsch went so far as to say the council was being too kind with its exemptions.
“Given all the exemptions that were put in — I might not have put all those in — but given those exemptions, they aren’t going to have any problem in terms of doing what they need to do if they’re going to maintain their building,” Hirsch said.
The council’s ordinance makes several concessions meant to help property owners make changes to their buildings without relying on squeezing tenants. If an owner’s property taxes increase more than 5% in a single year, they can recoup up to 50% of the increase above 5% by raising the price of a rent-stabilized unit, although a unit’s price could not be raised more than a 10% in a year without board approval.  
A new Residential Rent Regulation Board would also handle tenant complaints and accept petitions from landlords who want an above-cap increase for significant capital improvements. The board would consist of five volunteers and an executive director. 
Shannon Elizabeth Weinstein, director of the Rhode Island Coalition of Housing Providers and an associate broker with RentProv Realty, disagrees. While she was still reviewing the ordinance’s fine print Tuesday, Weinstein said that “regardless of how they structured the tax pass through,” the council’s proposal will wreak downstream havoc on the housing market, especially on single-family homeowners. She argued they’ll be forced to compensate for the revenue lost from multifamily homeowners, no matter what “Rubik’s cube of exemptions” the council decided upon.
“I would say to just be very wary of the narrative that they’ve crafted something special,” Weinstein said. “There’s nothing special or unique about it. This has happened time and time again with every single rent control policy that’s out there.”
In something of a preemptive strike on the ordinance before it was even made public, the Providence Foundation commissioned the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (RIPEC) to look into the issue and determine: Does it work?
“This really hasn’t worked anywhere,” said RIPEC’s Jeffrey Hamill, who was the primary author and researcher for the report released on Jan. 8. “The idea that somehow we’re going to find the right policy mix to make this work, I’m skeptical.”
RIPEC maintained editorial control over the document, Hamill said, and he added that he consulted with proponents in his broad overview of the existing research on rent control. He noted that “the value of a rental building is inextricably tied to the income it can bring in.” 
“If you limit that income through rent control, you necessarily make that building worth less money,” Hamill said, noting that
Providence’s ordinance was not available when Hamill authored the report, but St. Paul, Minnesota, gave enough evidence against the general idea. In St. Paul, building permits dropped once rent control was introduced in 2021, leading nearby Minneapolis to pick up a share of its business. The St. Paul law capped increases at 3% and did not include an exemption for new construction, which led to “an aggregate loss of $1.6 billion in the city’s taxable base,” according to the report.
Rent control policies can further exert a paradoxical effect in that the price control mechanism is attached to a specific unit, and is “not based on the renter’s ability to pay,” Hamill said. That means “the largest subsidies go to people who are renting the highest cost units.”
The report contends that rent control never lowers rents; it only caps them. That can incentivize landlords to raise rent to the maximum legal limit every year, the report suggests.

Hamill offered that “the best way to lower rents in the city of Providence” would be to build more units, encourage market competition and, “while we wait for those units to come online, to give people a subsidy.”
Councilor Sue AnderBois — a candidate for lieutenant governor and ordinance cosponsor — said in a Tuesday morning phone call that the council wants to create predictability for the city’s tenants going forward.
AnderBois said she has seen the RIPEC report, “and a lot of other reports” — all evidence of what not to do when drafting policy, she said.
“We really tried to learn from what worked well, what hasn’t worked well,” AnderBois said. “The goal is to actually help solve this problem, to actually stabilize the rent. It’s not to just do this policy so we can say we did it.”
The ordinance would not be a panacea, AnderBois said, for the city’s housing crisis, and rent stabilization would only be one kind of medicine — one, perhaps, for peace of mind. 
“For many residents, this is 30% or more of their usual budget,” AnderBois said of rent prices. “That is huge. So for them to not know year to year, what the change to that very enormous piece of their budget could be, is incredibly stressful and could cause people to leave the city. It has caused people to leave the city. So we want to give them that predictability, that ability to stay here in the city.”
Contrasting points of view in the mayoral race
State Rep. David Morales — a Providence Democrat challenging Providence Mayor Brett Smiley for control of Providence in this September’s Democratic primary— attended Tuesday’s press event and stood with supporters beneath trees shaking snow from their boughs.
Speaking to reporters afterward, he called the current version of the ordinance an effort at “making sure that our neighbors are able to stay safely housed.”
Morales said he “firmly” supports rent stabilization, and that his administration “would fully enforce the ordinance by collaborating with the council.”
At a separate and unrelated press conference of his own Tuesday, Smiley reaffirmed to reporters what he called his “deep skepticism” about the proposal.
“I suppose it’s possible that there is some version in the world that might help with tenants at risk of displacement, without all of the other bad effects that come from it,” Smiley said. “But the reality is that this will lower no one’s rent.”
Like RIPEC, Smiley identified the rental pricing scheme as a pure price cap rather than a deflationary lever, and offered that landlords could very well raise the rent to its maximum allotted each year. 
The mayor promised to veto the ordinance if it passes “as written.”
Back in Elmwood, when asked by reporters what the council would do if Smiley vetoed the ordinance should it pass, Miller began by calling it “a very strong proposal” crafted with meticulous attention.
“I haven’t yet talked to the mayor about this particular proposal,” Miller said. “I’m looking forward to that conversation, and I’m forever optimistic and open to a positive discussion.” 
She then promised a tête-à-tête if necessary, and suggested the Council may work to veto Smiley’s veto.
Said Miller: “If we have to, we’ll move forward on a veto as well.”

Board of Elections overruled local officials in deciding Republican Bobby Knight was eligible to run for Wilson County Sheriff. Knight briefly changed his party affiliation to Democrat before reversing it. (Photo: Knight Facebook page)The North Carolina State Board of Elections voted 3-2 Tuesday to overrule the Wilson County Board of Elections in favor of a Republican candidate seeking to run for sheriff.
Bobby Knight, a senior deputy in the Nash County Sheriff’s Office, maintained he has been a registered Republican since 2012. But in December, when he says he tried to update his address through the state Division of Motor Vehicles website, he claims he accidentally changed his party affiliation.
State law prohibits a person from filing as a candidate in a party primary unless that person has been affiliated with that party for at least 90 days.
Wilson County sheriff candidates Brandon Barbrey, a Democrat, and Kevin Raper, a Republican, each filed candidate challenges arguing that the change made Knight ineligible to run for the office as either a Democrat or Republican.
But Knight maintained he never really intended to run as a Democrat. He called the switch ‘a technological mistake.’ Knight said he changed his affiliation back to being Republican within a matter of hours of making the initial update in the online portal.
After a three-hour hearing, the Wilson Co. Board of Elections voted 4-1 in early January that Knight was not qualified to be a candidate in the race.
On Tuesday, Knight’s attorney Rhyan Breen told the state board that procedural errors in that local hearing deserved another look, and that his client should not be disqualified in seeking elected office.
“Probably one of the more egregious violations is that during the deliberation, the panel allowed one of its own panel members to testify, and this is important because it didn’t happen during the presentation,” offered Breen.

State board member Jeff Carmon questioned how Knight could have got through the entire process of updating his address online while overlooking the guardrails put in place to make sure the information he was entering was correct.
“How are you getting over all of these safety steps to say it was a mistake?” asked Carmon.
“He very eloquently calls it a ‘fat finger’,” said Breen in describing Knight’s rush to get to work that day. “Essentially, what he did was just click through the remainder of the boxes as soon as possible until he got to the end.”
“So, for the first time when he clicked it by mistake, fat finger, he meant to hit ‘Republican’ and he hit ‘Democrat’,” Carmon responded. “But then when it listed it all out for him to read and confirm? That’s not a fat finger. He either meant to do it, or are you saying he didn’t read it?”
“He didn’t read it,” said Knight’s attorney.
But attorney Andrew Simpson, representing Barbrey, said Knight knew what he was doing.
In its ruling disqualifying Knight, the Wilson Co. Board of Elections seemed to call the timing of the change into question.
State board member Stacy “Four” Eggers IV reasoned that Knight should be allowed to correct the mistake and take part in the race. (Photo: ncsbe.gov)
According to the January 8 ruling, the evening before Knight changed his party affiliation , incumbent Wilson County Sheriff Calvin L. Woodard, a Democrat, sent an email to his staff informing them he would not be running for reelection.
The next morning, Knight logged onto the DMV website to purportedly update his address. At that time, Knight changed his party affiliation from Republican to Democrat.
A few hours later, after learning from Barbrey that Barbrey would also be running for the office as a Democrat, Knight logged back onto the DMV website and changed his party affiliation back to Republican. Woodard has endorsed Barbrey to succeed him.
State board member Stacy “Four” Eggers IV said he viewed Knight’s change as an error that the candidate should be entitled to correct, just as any voter would be allowed to cure a mistake on the ballot.
Board member Bob Rucho agreed with Eggers that Knight should not be disqualified.
“What we’re going to be doing is preventing voters from having a chance to choose candidates of their own,” said Rucho. “And if I make an error, it’s always going to be on the side of giving the voter an opportunity to choose the people that they would like to pick.”

Siobhan O’Duffy Millen, one of two Democrats on the state board, urged her colleagues not to overrule the local board of elections, which voted against Knight.
“We’re opening ourselves up in the future to a lot of shenanigans,” said Millen. “I think that’s just a Pandora’s box that we shouldn’t get into.”
Board chair Francis De Luca sided with his Republican colleagues in rejecting the Wilson County Board of Elections’ decision to disqualify Knight from this year’s election.
De Luca said the board will discuss in the future whether the DMV website was meant to be more than a vehicle registration portal.
“I don’t think it was meant to handle more than that, but it’s doing a lot more than that now,” De Luca said.
Knight praised the decision late Tuesday.
“Due process prevailed, and the decision now returns where it belongs … the people of Wilson county will finally get to decide who they want to be Sheriff.” said Knight in a statement on social media.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/knight-1024x664.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

He is shown speaking during the 2024 legislative session to the House Budget Committee (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Missouri’s budget picture brightened slightly this week with the discovery of a $250 million error in state projections, though lawmakers were warned Tuesday the change isn’t enough to take tight controls off state spending.
State Budget Director Dan Haug told the House Budget Committee that more than $100 million in disaster relief appropriations were mistakenly counted in next year’s spending and in the current year.
As a result, instead of the $4.7 million ending balance in the coming fiscal year, Missouri’s general revenue fund will hold $261 million. That new projection, if accurate, would still be the lowest general revenue balance to end a fiscal year since 2018.
“While that does make our bottom line better, it does not change the fundamental issue that our ongoing expenditures are more than our ongoing revenues,” Haug said. “It doesn’t change either of those two numbers.”
The state treasury held $4.3 billion of general revenue on June 30, the final day of fiscal 2025. That is down from a historic high of $5.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2023 as lawmakers have spent more than taxes for general revenue have generated over the past two years.
The current budget continues that trend. With supplemental items requested by Gov. Mike Kehoe, the state will budget $16.2 billion of general revenue in the current year, about $3.1 billion more than is expected in revenue. 
As a result, $2 billion will remain on June 30, the governor’s budget projects.
Kehoe’s budget for the next fiscal year, delivered to lawmakers Jan. 13, anticipates general revenue appropriations to total $16.3 billion, with revenues expected to be $13.6 billion.
The extra money revealed by correcting the calculation error will make it easier for the state to keep up with current bills in future years but isn’t enough to add any spending beyond Kehoe’s budget proposal, said House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel.
“It didn’t change anything, because really, $4 million wasn’t a good place to be,” Deaton said.
The variables in the forecast, which will determine the actual fund balance, are how fast the state will complete $1.3 billion of multi-year construction projects and how close the state is on estimating operating budgets.
More than $900 million set aside for state operations in fiscal 2025 was unspent, but the budget anticipates that figure will be only $350 million in the coming fiscal year and uses that money to balance spending and revenues.
The updated forecast can be debated but it is not far off, Deaton said.
“I could come up with one a little different, and reasonable people could probably argue about it,” Deaton said. “I can’t point to anything and say this is ridiculous.”
The updated forecast gives Democrats ammunition to push for their spending priorities, said state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
There should be more money available, Fogle said. She noted that the state Board of Education requested a $190 million boost to the foundation formula, the state’s main source of public school funding, that Kehoe did not recommend.
“What that changes is the governor signaled that he was comfortable spending down to $4.7 million, and I find it somewhat ironic that now he’s saying he needs to keep this additional $260 million on the bottom line as well, when there are things that I would argue we could be doing,” she said.
Republicans who hold all the state offices and a legislative supermajority have said for years the state should sock away money for lean times, Fogle said. But now that a budget crunch is here, she said, there’s no money to defer cuts.
Kehoe’s budget anticipates he will have to limit spending on almost $300 million in spending included his budget to produce the $261 million fund balance. The message from Kehoe and Haug is that there is no room for increases, Fogle said.
“It has been made clear by both the State of the State (address) and director Haug’s comments today,” Fogle said, “that there’s absolutely no appetite to add any spending from the governor’s original recommendations.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Haug-Budget-20240129-1-1024x674.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)On a party-line vote, a bill changing Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance laws, which Gov. Tony Evers’ office said he will veto, passed the Assembly  Tuesday.
The bill would allow people collecting federal disability payments to remain eligible for unemployment insurance if they lose a job. But it would cut their jobless pay by half the value of their disability pay.
The bill was sent to the Legislature from the joint labor-management Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council, which negotiates on a proposed “agreed-upon bill” every two years.
Historically the council’s bills have enjoyed broad support and easy passage, but the current measure, AB 652, includes changes that prompted opposition from Democrats. Evers’ spokesperson told the Wisconsin Examiner on Jan. 7 that the governor will veto the bill if it reaches his desk.
The bill is the first jobless pay measure in more than a decade to raise the maximum benefit, increasing it by $25 a week to $395. Critics argue that is inadequate.
The critics also object to reducing jobless pay for people who receive Social Security Disability Income, and to the measure’s proposed new strictures on the unemployment insurance system that Evers has previously vetoed.
A federal judge in July 2025 ordered the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development to stop enforcing a ban on unemployment compensation for SSDI recipients that was enacted in 2013. The judge ruled a year earlier that the ban violated federal laws protecting people with disabilities.
Before voting on the advisory council’s unemployment insurance bill Tuesday, Assembly Republicans voted 53-44 to block Democrats from passing a substitute amendment removing provisions they opposed and increasing the value of jobless pay. They went on to pass the unamended bill by the same 53-44 margin.
The Democratic amendment would have repealed the state’s ban on unemployment compensation for SSDI recipients, but without the financial penalty. The amendment also included a $127 increase in the maximum benefit through Jan. 2, 2027, followed by annual increases in line with the consumer price index. In addition, it increased the cap on how much income a laid-off person could make in a week while continuing to qualify for jobless pay.
“Wisconsinites deserve adequate unemployment benefits. This amendment is a step towards being able to do just that,” said Rep. Maureen McCarville (D-DeForest).
At a state Senate hearing Jan. 7, Scott Manley, a lobbyist for Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce and chair of the advisory council’s management caucus, defended the council bill’s jobless pay penalty for SSDI recipients, arguing that it would treat disability pay like other sources of income people get while they collect unemployment insurance.
“If you have additional income … that income is going to offset your unemployment benefits,” Manley said. “Unemployment is supposed to provide a temporary safety net of additional income for people who lose their job through no fault of their own.”
On the Assembly floor Tuesday, Rep. Chris Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) — who in the past has supported advisory council bills but came out against the council’s legislation in this session — reiterated her opposition. She said a constituent on the autism spectrum qualifies for SSDI and works part-time at a local library, allowing her to live independently.
“Without that part-time job, she could not afford to be independent,” Sinicki said. “I sure as heck do not want to be one to vote to take away benefits from the people who need them the most.”

Christian McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, asks a question during the July meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government, July 29, 2025. (LRC Public Information)The Kentucky Senate once again approved a GOP-backed constitutional amendment that would limit pardon powers of Kentucky governors around election time.
If it makes it through the General Assembly, Senate Bill 10 would ask Kentucky voters in November to block governors from issuing pardons and sentence commutations 60 days before their election through their successor’s inauguration in December.
The Kentucky Senate voted 36-0 in favor of the measure Tuesday afternoon. One lawmaker, Senate Minority Caucus Chair Reggie Thomas, D-Lexington, passed on the vote.
Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, has filed the legislation several times before and it has cleared the Senate, but it has never gained passage in the House. The Senate State and Local Government Committee approved SB 10 last week. 
The bill is a response by lawmakers to controversial pardons former Republican Gov. Matt Bevin issued after losing the 2019 election to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. Bevin pardoned people convicted of crimes including rape, murder and child abuse. 
McDaniel said the bill would ask “the voters of the commonwealth if in the exercise of an unchecked override of justice, the person who exerts that power is responsible to then stand in front of the voters again, or force his party to stand in front of the voters again,” McDaniel said while presenting the bill. 
Republican House Speaker David Osborne previously told reporters that McDaniel had “worked really hard in the interim” to get House members to back the bill this year. 
“This reform has passed the Senate in multiple sessions, and I’m optimistic this is the year it reaches the ballot,” McDaniel said in a statement following the Senate’s approval. “I appreciate the encouraging words I’ve heard from House colleagues and the positive comments from Speaker Osborne.

Senators are considering how to write a law that could bar federal officers from hiding their identities in Vermont. But they’ll need to make it bulletproof against legal challenges.

Senators in the Judiciary Committee are trying to thread a needle, hashing out a bill that could stop law enforcement officers — including federal agents operating in Vermont — from masking while also weathering a potential lawsuit from the feds. 
They’re considering how to do things differently than California, which was sued by the federal government after it passed a law that specifically banned federal law enforcement officers from covering their faces. 
Vermont’s version, S. 208, could prevent all law enforcement officers from wearing a mask or disguise for the purpose of concealing their identity, rather than solely banning federal agents from doing so. 
That difference is an important legal distinction, according to Jessica Bulman-Pozen, a professor of constitutional law at Columbia Law School.
A clause in the U.S. Constitution prevents states from discriminating against the federal government or attempting to regulate it directly, Bulman-Pozen told the committee last week. That clause gives the federal government a case against the California law, she explained. 
But Vermont’s version would be stronger if it were challenged in court, Bulman-Pozen said, because it treats all law enforcement officers equally. 
And she thinks Vermont’s bill could be enforced against federal agents, she said. In past rulings, courts have upheld state laws that incidentally affect how federal officers carry out their work, Bulman-Pozen said. Those rulings give Vermont’s bill something to stand on, she said. 
On Tuesday, committee members continued to debate if the proposed crime should be a civil or criminal offense.
If it became a civil penalty for officers to conceal their identities, it could create a tricky situation for local law enforcement, said Jennifer Morrison, the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Safety. State or local police officers would be tasked with citing federal officers for violating the law. 
The bill could task local or state police officers with citing their peers for the violation, she said. And it would be up to the officer whether to give someone like an ICE agent a warning rather than a citation. 
The state could also adopt rules about officer conduct without passing a new law, Morrison said, though those rules alone couldn’t be enforced against federal immigration agents. 
If the law doesn’t apply to federal officers, it’s really just a “feel good” statute, Morrison said. 
Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central, said Tuesday that she wants the bill to go into effect immediately upon passage, rather than a delayed launch: “The terror that’s happening can’t wait until July to be solved.” 

In the know
Gov. Phil Scott proposed a $9.4 billion budget to state lawmakers on Tuesday that he called a “disciplined” spending plan in the face of waning support — and more cuts likely to come — from the federal government. 
Scott’s proposal, which lays out spending for the fiscal year starting in July, is about 3% larger than the budget he and the Legislature enacted last year. But he said his latest plan calls for fewer new initiatives, largely because the state no longer has Covid-19 pandemic-era federal relief funding available for new uses.
He also pointed to how the state’s top economists lowered previous estimates, in a report last week, for the amount of revenue the state will bring in through June. That decrease, which is only about $8 million, nevertheless indicates that legislators need to be frugal, Scott told the joint address of the House and Senate.
“It’s more important than ever to focus on the issues we can control, stay disciplined and set clear priorities so we make sure Vermonters get the most out of the resources we do have,” Scott said.

On the move
The House Human Services Committee moved its immunization bill out of committee today, along a 10-1 vote, with Rep. Todd Nielsen, R-Brandon, casting the lone dissent. 
The bill, H.545, broadens the state’s power to purchase vaccines from sources beyond the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and issue state-level immunization recommendations. Earlier this session, Health Commissioner Rick Hildebrant and others in his department testified to the committee in support of the bill.  
“I just want to be clear, this does not impose any mandates. Vaccines are still at the discretion of the individual,” said. Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, who chairs the committee. Several members noted having received concerns from constituents about whether the bill would require immunization. 
If the bill moves along the expected path, Wood said it should go to the floor for second reading this Thursday and final reading by Friday.

The award for Most Raucous Applause at Gov. Scott’s budget address goes to Communications Director Dustin Degree. Communication received. 
It seems Degree’s enthusiasm for supporting his boss has earned him a bit of a reputation. Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, who emceed the joint assembly for Scott’s budget address, issued this warning as he opened the proceedings:
“Before we begin, I want to remind you that the Senate rules apply to joint assemblies. So, although applause is permitted, in joint assemblies, whistling, hooting and yelling are not appropriate,” the LG said, before turning his gaze up toward the House gallery.

Lamont relents to pressure from CT farmers to stave off tax hike,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/ned-lamont-relents-to-pressure-from-farmers-to-stave-off-tax-hike/,The decision will keep in place recommended land values last adjusted in 2020. The governor also convened a working group to propose reforms.,"Gov. Ned Lamont ordered his administration to hold off on issuing new valuations for agricultural land Monday, bowing to pressure from farmers who argued that the changes would lead to huge tax hikes and force some families to sell their land. 
Lamont said that the canceled assessments — which in some cases would have caused the taxable value of farmland to double — were the result of an “unforeseen lack of data” the state had attempted to collect in an effort to determine the going rate for Connecticut’s dwindling amount of available farmland.
The decision will keep in place, for now, recommended land values that were last adjusted in 2020.
In addition to halting the proposed reassessments, the governor also convened a working group of farmers, municipal leaders, assessors and officials with the state’s Department of Agriculture to propose reforms to the process by which the state collects data and assesses the value of farmland, in an effort to avoid large price spikes in the future.
“Family farms are vital to Connecticut’s economy and are an essential part of our heritage,” Lamont said in a statement announcing his decision Monday. 
“Our work to address concerns around rising land use values demonstrates our understanding of the challenges farmers face,” he continued. “Preserving these lands is about more than economics, it’s about sustaining a way of life that defines Connecticut, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with the farming community to keep Connecticut agriculture strong.”
Lamont’s announcement met with an immediate sense of relief among farmers, dozens of whom gathered in Hartford’s Legislative Office Building on Tuesday for a forum on the issue hosted by Senate Republicans. While the event was announced prior to the shift in policy, lawmakers went ahead with a round table discussion to hear from farmers about their concerns over taxes and other economic issues.
“That is a huge step forward, and it takes a lot of the the anxiety out of the room, I’m sure, for the short term,” said Paul Larson, the president of the Connecticut Farm Bureau.
“But that’s just it,” Larson added. “It’s for the short term.”

Efforts to draw attention to the proposed assessment levels and their likely impact on taxes had ratcheted up in recent weeks ahead of the Jan. 31 deadline for municipal assessors to finalize their grand lists. An online petition calling on the state to stop the new assessments on farms from taking effect had gathered more than 20,000 signatures as of Monday, according to organizers.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, praised the decision not to move forward with the new assessments, which he said would have driven many smaller family farms out of business. 
“I think the governor realized that in an election year, that he couldn’t have that,” Harding said. “I think it was the result of farmers putting pressure on their government to do the right thing.” 
The controversy was the result of recent assessments undertaken as part of a decades-old state law known as Public Act 490, which was intended to help preserve farmland and open spaces by taxing the value of the land under its agricultural use — rather than its fair market value for development.
The law requires state officials to create a list of recommended land values that’s updated every five years, which local assessors can use to determine property taxes. The values are set by the state Office of Policy and Management, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture. As part of a regular revaluation period last year, the agencies partnered with the University of Connecticut to conduct a survey of farmers who either leased or rented out their land.
The survey was plagued by low response rates and incomplete data from farms used in prior surveys, according to findings from the survey’s researchers. When the updated assessments were released in October, some farmers were shocked to see the value of their land had increased dramatically.
For example, the taxable value of an acre of Tillable A farmland — which includes the most productive soils for growing crops — increased from $1,880 to $3,250, an increase of 72%. (Some of the values were even higher in the Connecticut River Valley region, where farmland is generally more expensive.)
Kim Grijalva, who operates a 100-acre cattle farm with her family in North Stonington, said the value of the pastures on which she grazes her herd of 38 Texas Longhorn cattle had grown four-fold under the state’s initial assessments. Even worse, she said, was the sudden spike in value for bits of land composed of rocky outcroppings and creek — known as “ledge” and previously valued at just $40 an acre — to $970 an acre.
After Grijalva and other farmers protested the initial increases, OPM announced a series of revisions in January that eased some of the most dramatic price hikes. Still, Grijalva said her farm had faced a potential property tax increase of several thousand dollars before the revisions were put on hold Monday.
“We would quit cattle ranching, it would make no financial sense,” she said. 
Among the methods used by UConn was mailing more than 1,000 postcards to farmers with a QR code that would allow them to fill out a survey online. The postcards yielded only 42 responses. The university’s researchers also emailed farmers who had participated in previous surveys, and sent copies of the surveys directly to local assessors, who shared them with farmers, which yielded better results.
The researchers received information about just 145 rental or lease agreements, out of an estimated 5,000 farms in Connecticut. Even among those who did respond to the survey, nearly half reported bartering or relying on other forms of no-cash agreements in exchange for land.
Shannon Chatfield, who owns the Stead Farm in Barkhamsted, said she was among those who never received notice of the survey. She was critical of the methods officials used to reach farmers.
“A lot of [farmers] are older, they’re not going to use QR codes, they’re not going to go online,” Chatfield said. “We don’t even read our emails half the time, so unless it comes in paper form, directly in the mail, we’re not going to see it.”
At Tuesday’s forum, Grijalva — the cattle farmer — was one of several speakers who said the controversy had shaken trust among farmers in the Department of Agriculture and its leader, Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt.
“Farms should not have to hire a lobbying agency like the Farm Bureau to protect them from the agency created to support them,” she said. 
Hurlburt, who did not attend the forum Tuesday, later acknowledged flaws in the survey despite what he said were extra efforts by the agency to boost response rates. When asked about the criticism of his leadership, he said the agency had worked hard to build a rapport with farmers and expand the amount of grant funding available to develop agriculture.
“I think the reality is that we were listening and we heard, and we took the only corrective action that we could,” Hurlburt said, referring to the decision to rescind the proposed assessments. 
A spokesman for Lamont’s office said Tuesday that the governor remains supportive of Hurlburt and has no plans to make a change in leadership at the agency. 
Larson, the Farm Bureau president, also expressed support for Hurlburt and said the agency and OPM had engaged in lengthy discussions with the Farm Bureau that resulted in both the January revisions and, ultimately, the decision to forgo any changes this year. 
Looking forward, he said the state would have to reexamine its methodology for reaching out to farmers and using self-reported information to calculate assessments under PA-490.
“Can we actually rely on the old system of farmers actually having the time to sit down and fill out a fairly extensive survey? Probably not,” Larson said. “So we have to probably come up with other mechanisms for getting that data.”
Hurlburt said it would likely take up to two years for the working group to come up with its recommendations for improving the assessment process. Depending on what they propose, he said that lawmakers may need to codify those changes through legislation. 
Harding, the Republican leader, said he would like to see the working group move more quickly, something he said could be achieved by leaning more heavily on the input from working farmers. 
“I think if we listened to [farmers] more we would have a good result for everybody, a fair result for everybody and, frankly, a quicker result,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0114_SR_FarmerAssessment_285-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

Gov. Phil Scott, long a proponent of nuclear energy, threw his weight behind a bill Tuesday that could usher in a comeback for nuclear in 2026.
“There’s a better way to lower energy prices and reduce emissions much faster if you’re willing to work with us to change course,” Scott told lawmakers in his budget address on Tuesday.
The governor voiced support for ideas included in H. 601, a bill introduced by House Minority Leader Rep. Pattie McCoy, R-Poultney, earlier this month. That bill would alter an existing state law — the Renewable Energy Standard – that requires all Vermont utilities to reach 100% renewable energy like solar and wind by 2035. Under the bill, the law would be renamed the Clean Energy Standard and would include zero-emission sources of energy like nuclear power.

The standard in place today is inflexible, Scott told lawmakers Tuesday. He urged them to adopt his administration’s proposal that could get utilities to “100% clean energy by 2030 at a substantially lower cost,” he said.
“It’s time we join other northeastern states who have already recognized that proven renewable and clean sources like solar, hydro and yes, even nuclear, must be part of the solution,” Scott said. 
The changes could lower Vermont’s renewable energy requirement from 100% for most utilities by 2030 to 75% by 2032, according to the bill. Rep. Kathleen James, D-Manchester, chair of the House Energy and Digital Infrastructure Committee heard testimony on the proposed Clean Energy Standard last spring. Estimates provided by the Department of Public Service indicated that rolling back the requirements and allowing utilities to get credit for buying nuclear power would save about $4 million a year, out of the roughly $1 billion Vermont spends on electricity every year, according to James. 
That would save between 20 to 38 cents off a monthly electric bill of $95, James said, or up to $4.50 per year for the average Vermonter, assuming all the savings go directly to ratepayers.
Low-income Vermonters have struggled with their electric bills. Vermonters face some of the highest energy burdens in the nation, some paying 10% of their income on their energy, Scott said in his address. Utility disconnections because people can’t pay their bills have increased 31% between 2022 and 2025, according to the Public Service Department. When Scott’s office was asked whether $4.50 in annual savings justified nuclear initiatives, VTDigger was referred to the Public Service Department for an explanation on the numbers. 
“Some have said that higher electricity and heating costs are the price we must pay to fight climate change,” Scott said in his speech. “I just don’t believe that’s true.” 
The bill would open the door to nuclear in other ways, James said. “Importantly, H. 601 would repeal current law that gives the legislature the ability to approve or deny the construction of any new nuclear power plant in our state,” James said, which could “make room for more nuclear power plants like Seabrook in New Hampshire and Millstone in Connecticut.”
In addition, the bill could undo a 2006 law requiring public engagement around new nuclear plants in Vermont. It could also make changes to nuclear waste storage at the state’s former nuclear site, potentially allowing in waste from other states. 
Back in 2010, Scott was one of only four state senators who were in favor of relicensing the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station. At the time, he told VTDigger that nuclear power should be part of a mix of energy sources that included renewables like wind, hydropower and solar energy. 
For decades, Vermont has pushed energy efficiency and weatherization efforts to lower the bills of homeowners and renters. But while Scott linked the high bills to the state’s efforts to lower carbon emissions, others blame the high costs on the state’s continued reliance on heating oil and propane. 
“We’ve got among the highest percentage of our residents using oil and propane for heating in the nation, which are two of the most expensive heating sources you can use,” said Ben Walsh, climate and energy program director at Vermont Public Interest Research Group, an environmental advocacy organization. “That’s why we’ve been pushing so hard for so long to invest more in helping Vermontes reduce their usage of and spending on fossil fuels.”
The administration’s current proposal relies on zero-carbon sources like nuclear to replace fossil fuels, including introducing the possibility of new nuclear plants more than a decade after the last one closed. 
The state’s only nuclear plant, the 650-megawatt Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, once produced more than a third of the state’s electricity before closing in 2014, outcompeted by cheap natural gas and opposed by decades of anti-nuclear activism. The plant is expected to be completely decommissioned by the end of the year, four years ahead of schedule, according to a September report. 
Energy production left about 1,000 tons of nuclear waste behind that will remain at the site indefinitely. Right now, the Trump administration’s Energy Department is looking for a temporary place to store the nation’s stranded nuclear waste, including beginning conversations with communities like Vernon.

That was the chant of the hundreds who gathered at the 195 District Park near downtown Providence Tuesday as part of a nationwide protest on the one-year anniversary of President Donald Trump’s second term.
Organizers estimated upward of 400 demonstrators came out for Providence’s portion of the “Day of Action” against Trump’s policies, even amid frigid temperatures that saw a high of 18 degrees. Wind conditions made it feel like 10 degrees.
“This administration has shown us exactly who they are,” Maya Lehrer, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, told the crowd. “Trump is attacking us on every front — his administration is ripping families apart, they’re cutting vital aid for heating and food, letting health care costs rise, accelerating environmental destruction, and threatening the world.”
Protestors’ primary focus was on ending U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Rhode Island — repeatedly shouting the agency is “not welcome here.”
Newport resident Stefanie Gallo told Rhode Island Current the nation is at a turning point. She said she has been concerned about immigration officers’ constant presence outside of courthouses.
“In Newport, almost every Thursday and Friday, they circle our courthouse,” she told Rhode Island Current. “And in Providence it’s every single day.”
Gallo said she was especially taken aback when she learned about ICE officers entering the state-owned Garrahy Judicial Complex on Dorrance Street on Jan. 15, bypassing security.
“That was crazy,” she said.
Cindy Capra of Barrington came with a green sign that called ICE “Trump’s Gestapo.”
“ICE is wreaking havoc in cities all over the country and I want to protest that in my community,” she said in an interview.
Following speeches from local religious and community leaders, advocates marched across the pedestrian bridge over the Providence River chanting, “ICE is not welcome here.”

Wanda Brownlee Paige, D-Kansas City, left, and Rep. Dale Helwig, R-Columbus, gather insights Tuesday during a House committee discussion about an audit of student enrollment in the free-lunch program at public schools and implications for how much the state allocates to districts to serve needs of at-risk students. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Members of the Kansas House Welfare Reform Committee debated Tuesday implications of a jarring state audit that estimated 54% to 72% of Kansas students enrolled in the statewide free-lunch school program were ineligible during the 2023-2024 academic year.
If that assessment was accurate, the Legislature’s auditors said, the U.S. Department of Agriculture overpaid Kansas school districts $10 million to $14 million during that year for meals that shouldn’t have been subsidized. The report held implications beyond the cost of school meals, because enrollment in Kansas’ free-lunch program determined how much the state paid school districts to deliver services to at-risk students. Auditors said $38 million to $53 million in extra at-risk funding was apparently distributed to school districts due to enrollment problems with the free-lunch program.
Rep. Francis Awerkamp, a St. Marys Republican and chairman of the committee, said the audit would be useful to the committee as it sorted out questions about oversight and fraud in state or federal programs.
“One of the discussions we often have is, you know, should there be more oversight on welfare programs or less oversight? If there is fraud or is there not fraud?” he said.
The state auditors issued one recommendation for the Legislature: Consider an alternate method of calculating how much at-risk student aid should be paid annually to K-12 districts. Auditors concluded that figures of the children taking part in the free-lunch program “may no longer be an accurate measure for determining the number of students at risk of academic failure in a district.”
Rep. Charlotte Esau, R-Olathe, said that as a child her family probably would have qualified for a school lunch program, but her father refused to apply. She said she wasn’t an at-risk student, despite being part of a lower-income family. She told House colleagues it made sense to find a new method of calculating state appropriations for students struggling academically.
“I’m seeing your conclusion makes logical sense to me,” Esau told auditors.
Under existing Kansas law, no mechanism exists to claw back from school districts any overpayment of at-risk dollars. In most cases, individual school districts didn’t have access to information that would confirmed which students qualified for the free-lunch program. The state’s ability to evaluate applicants was constrained by accuracy of information gathered by several state agencies and rules enforced by the USDA limiting annual auditing to 3% of a district’s student applications or a maximum of 3,000 students in a district.
Rep. Alexis Simmons, D-Topeka, warned House colleagues eager to reform the at-risk funding formula for schools by relying on a different metric of poverty and need. She said there was a strong connection between feeding students during the school day and the ability to learn in the classroom.
Simmons said it would be a mistake to assume fraud when state auditors said it was challenging to verify whether students were eligible for free lunches at school.
State auditor Heidi Zimmerman said the report published in July outlined federal overpayments to school districts for the free lunch program. The audit also linked that idea to state overpayments to school districts for at-risk education, she said.
“We cannot claim there was fraud,” Zimmerman said. “We can tell you there are students who are ineligible. Ineligibility is not the same as fraud. Fraud requires a specific intent. You might have just made a mistake. That’s not fraud. So, this report does not claim that we found fraud anywhere.”
“Very much appreciate that clarification,” Simmons said.
Rep. Wanda Brownlee Paige, D-Kansas City, said the audit didn’t take into account the lower literacy rate among some parents expected to fill out school lunch program applications. She said the Kansas minimum wage of $7.25 per hour — less than half the $15 per hour minimum wage in Missouri — exacerbated financial hardships faced by families desperate for government assistance in providing nutritional meals to their school-age children.
“I can see a whole lot of people struggling,” she said. “The kids are hungry.”
Rep. Brian Bergkamp, R-Wichita, asked Frank Harwood, deputy commissioner of the Kansas Department of Education, to provide the committee with statistics on the quantity of food thrown away in Kansas public school cafeterias. He said the amount was more than most people might realize.
Harwood said USDA reimbursed school districts only for meals served to an eligible student. Under federal law, he said, children automatically qualified for free meals if they were in a household receiving benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid or food distribution programs on an Indian reservation.
In addition, he said, a child was eligible for free meals at public schools if determined to be homeless, a runaway or migrant child, in foster care or enrolled in Head Start.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Paige-and-Helwig-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — The Medical University of South Carolina’s hospital system will need take on more debt and privately fundraise to achieve its ambitions of opening a top-tier cancer center in downtown Charleston.
MUSC Health plans to raise $200 million in charitable donations to help pay for the planned new cancer hospital, medical college president David Cole told a House budget panel. It also will need to finance another chunk of funding — how much is yet to be determined — adding to the state-owned hospital system’s growing mound of debt.
All of that is on top of the $350 million in taxpayer dollars the hospital system is asking legislators to provide in the state budget for the fiscal year starting July 1. Gov. Henry McMaster, in his budget proposal, recommends the state chip in just $150 million.
The hospital’s governing board in April approved the plan to chase a Comprehensive Cancer Center designation from the National Cancer Institute but did not say at the time how much the effort would cost. MUSC Health expects to finalize estimates for the project’s total price tag in the coming weeks, CEO Patrick Cawley told the SC Dailey Gazette.
The MUSC hospital system already had about $828 million in long-term debt on the books, according to the agency’s latest annual financial report.
In April, a state fiscal oversight board gave the system permission to borrow $860 million more: $400 million to build a hospital and cancer center in Summerville’s mega Nexton community, $330 million to build a hospital in Indian Land (the unincorporated panhandle of Lancaster County), and $130 million to finance the equipment for both.
So far, MUSC appears only to have cashed in on the Indian Land project, issuing that bond in December, according to a national database.
And in October, MUSC finalized a deal with Tidelands Health to take a controlling interest in the Grand Strand area hospitals. The deal involved no cash exchange, but MUSC takes on the financial risk at Tidelands, which has been operating at a $50 million deficit.
The cancer hospital, which Cole called MUSC’s “number one priority,” could further inflate those debt numbers.
If approved, the center would be the first of its kind in South Carolina. Patients seeking this top level of care currently must travel out of state to centers in North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee.
“There’s no reason in the future for a South Carolinian, if you have a cancer diagnosis, to leave the state for best-in-class care,” Cole said. “We should be able to build and deliver the best care possible for our citizens. And we’ve had a lot of partners that are lining up to help us make this a reality.”
MUSC’s current cancer hospital holds a tier-two designation as a Clinical Cancer Center. The bump in rankings could mean a bump in National Cancer Institute research grant support.
The existing center already boasts more than 230 researchers with a more than $50 million portfolio and more than 200 clinical trials, according to the hospital system’s budget request.
To reach the next level, the cancer center must increase the depth and breadth of its research and broaden its community reach.
MUSC would apply for its designation in 2028 and the center would open in 2030.
The hospital system has said it anticipates a “strong” return on the investment but has yet to provide further financial details.
South Carolina is below the national rate in terms of number of cancer cases, according to National Cancer Institute data, but the state has a higher mortality rate from the deadly disease.
Cole, citing U.S. Centers for Disease Control data, said MUSC expects the number of cancer cases to rise by 20% over the next five years.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lung-cancer-concept-1024x666.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

A mother whose toddler died in a rear-end collision applauded a bill that cleared the Kentucky Senate Tuesday as “planting a seed” for “better behavior on our roads.” 

 SB 28 progress


The measure would expand the state’s no texting while driving laws as a means to reduce distracted driving. 
Alyssa Burns, whose daughter Camberleigh died days before her second birthday in a 2022 crash, told the Lantern, “I just hope that this gives Kentuckians the wake up call that there are people who are tired of you infringing on our right to a safe passage from point A to point B. My daughter’s right to life was stolen from her.” 
Burns said Kentuckians who are driving with distractions, like cell phones and games, should think about potentially endangering others on the road. “I am imploring people: Why are we waiting for it to be someone you love for us to care?” 
A Ford F-350 slammed into the back of the vehicle in which Burns and her daughter were traveling on Interstate 71 in Louisville. Burns’ daughter was buckled into a child seat in the back. Burns and her fiancé who was driving suffered serious injuries. Louisville police determined the pickup driver was  “not properly watching the roadway ahead” and listed driver “inattention” as the only contributing factor, reports WHAS. The driver of the pickup was not charged.
Senate Bill 28, or “the Phone-Down Kentucky Act,” says drivers cannot hold a cell phone while driving to send electronic messages, like texts and emails, or watch moving images, like videos and games. 
Drivers who violate the legislation could face $100 fines starting in late October. Fines assessed under the legislation will be divided among a traumatic brain injury trust fund, the Kentucky trauma care system fund and a veterans’ program fund.
The Senate approved the bill Tuesday afternoon, with 31 votes in favor and seven Republicans voting against it. The House must now weigh in on the legislation before it can become law. 
The Senate Transportation Committee gave unanimous approval to the bill last week. 
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, has said the bill is a priority for him to pass in his final legislative session, as he won’t be seeking reelection this year. 
“This is about saving lives, plain and simple,” Higdon said in a press release after the Senate passed the legislation. “This bill won’t bring Camberleigh back, and it won’t bring justice to the person responsible for her death, but it is an opportunity for us to honor her, and finally do the right thing by putting the Phone Down Kentucky Act into law.”
Burns testified in favor of the bill before an interim legislative committee last year.
Some lawmakers did have questions on the Senate floor about the bill. Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, said constituents asked him whether drivers would face an additional fine if police officers pull them over for one infraction, like speeding, and then see a cell phone in the car. Higdon replied that an officer cannot stop a person for violating the bill without having “visually observed” them using their phone behind the wheel. Smith later voted in favor of the bill, but added that he would like to see the bill made clearer later in the legislative process. 
Senate Majority Whip Mike Wilson, R-Bowling Green, recalled coming across an accident on his way home where a motorcyclist had been run over by a car. He said the driver of the car had been looking at their phone. Wilson himself has long ridden motorcycles and has heard that most accidents involving motorcycles are not caused by the motorcyclist, but drivers who do not see them. 
“I think it’s a matter of safety, and especially looking at my motorcycle clubs, my friends, I agree with them, and they’ve asked for this for a long time, so I’m happy to vote aye,” Wilson said. 
One of the senators who voted against the bill, Sen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, explained  that he was “sympathetic” to Wilson’s comments and said  he sees collision avoidance technology in autonomous vehicles or cars with driver assistance improving in the future. He noted that distracted driving can include moments when a driver isn’t using a phone, but is eating, drinking or talking to another passenger in the car. 
Williams said he thinks technology has  “the potential to save as many lives as seat belts have saved in the future, because … the collision avoidance braking system — it never rests,” Williams said. “It never is distracted. It’s looking on the road.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1HL0280-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

(Photo illustration by Iowa Capital Dispatch with main image by Getty Images; advertisement from U.S. District Court records)A 23-year-old Iowa man who has lived in the United States since he was a year old was detained by federal immigration agents and jailed in Muscatine County while being unlawfully denied a bond hearing, a federal judge has ruled.
The ruling comes in a civil case where the federal government’s efforts to hire “deportation judges” — normally referred to as immigration judges — is alleged by the plaintiff to be part of an effort to hire judges whose views align with President Donald Trump’s political goals.
The case involves Giovanni Uribe-Gonzalez, 23, of Hawkeye, who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in November 2025 after a drunken driving arrest and then placed in the Muscatine County Jail pending possible deportation.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to court filings by Uribe-Gonzalez’s attorney, Amy Cummings, he was brought to the United States by his mother when he was 1 year old.
“As toddler, he took his first steps on Iowa soil, and he learned to read and write in Iowa classrooms where he was always liked by his peers and teachers. He recited the Pledge of Allegiance each morning and cheered the fireworks every Fourth of July,” Cummings told a federal judge last month. “His every recollection and dream starts and ends in the Hawkeye state, and his identity, values and culture were forged here shaping him into a quintessential American Midwesterner.”
Cummings told the court that in 2021 Uribe-Gonzalez’s family had saved enough money to pay his $495 filing fee for citizenship under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act (DACA). While the government accepted the fee, Cummings alleged, it never fully processed his application and that matter is still pending with no final action taken.
After graduating from West Central High School in Maynard, Uribe-Gonzalez enrolled in a training program for railroad welders, earned his certification, applied for jobs and was then rejected due to his citizenship status. In 2025, he was twice arrested for drunken driving, with both arrests resulting in a conviction on a charge of first-offense drunken driving.
Court records show that after his second arrest in November, he was detained Chickasaw County, where ICE placed a hold on him, preventing his release although an Iowa judge had allowed him to post bond.
According to the court records, David Bindert, an Iowa-based deportation officer with ICE, noted in his written report of the detention that Uribe-Gonzalez had a DACA application pending, but added that Uribe-Gonzalez had “no legal presence in the United States” and was subject to being detained by ICE.
Uribe-Gonzalez was then taken to the Muscatine County Jail for holding, and ICE initiated deportation proceedings.
Attorney cites ad for ‘deportation judges’ 
As with thousands of other ICE detainees across the country in 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice took the position that the federal law providing for the mandatory detention of detainees applies not just to people who apprehended at the border — which is how the law has been interpreted and applied for decades — but also to people who may have entered the country illegally months or years earlier.
The DOJ’s new mandatory-detention stance has resulted in immigration judges across the country denying detainees the opportunity to argue for release on bond while their case is pending.
Since July 2025, more than 300 U.S. District Court judges in 1,600 cases have rejected that argument, finding the new interpretation of the law is contrary to ICE’s own regulations, its published enforcement guidelines, previous court rulings, and “the overall logic” of the nation’s immigration system.
Despite those rulings, ICE and county jails in Iowa and the rest of the country have continued to hold individuals for indefinite periods without affording them the opportunity to argue for their release on bond. The cases where those practices have been rejected are those in which the detainees have taken their case to U.S. District Court and argued their due process rights are being violated.
On Dec. 16, 2025, Cummings filed such a lawsuit on behalf of Uribe-Gonzalez in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, naming President Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and others as the respondents.
As part of her petition seeking a bond hearing for her client, Cummings noted that the federal government has fired dozens of immigration judges and then advertised for “deportation judges” that Cummings argues are intended to “better align” with Trump’s political goals.
As an exhibit in her case, she submitted a copy of the federal government’s written solicitation for applicants for the position of “deportation judge.”
The solicitation says: “YOU BE THE JUDGE. Help write the next chapter of America. Apply today to become a deportation judge and you may be entitled to these benefits: $159,951 to $207,500 per year… DEFINE AMERICA FOR GENERATIONS… Preside over cases in federal Immigration Court and determine whether an alien has to leave the United States or gets to stay. Make decisions with generational consequences… Restore integrity and honor to our Nation’s Immigration Court system.” 
Recently, U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher ruled in Uribe-Gonzalez’s favor on the bond-hearing issue, noting that district courts across the nation have ruled that such detainees are entitled to a hearing at which they can argue for their release.
The available court records don’t indicate whether such a hearing has been held.

Spencer Cox held a press conference to present his budget proposal at the Salt Lake County Library in Kearns on Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)There is a tragedy unfolding right before our eyes, every single day. It may not make the headlines, but it affects thousands of Utah residents. For many, it will define the course of the rest of their lives. What is this tragedy? It is the fact that thousands of impoverished children are growing up without the benefits of an education. Intergenerational poverty trends show that, unfortunately, many of these will go on to raise their own families in poverty.
These children deserve better, and their future children deserve better. Education is among the most important influences in the development of a child. Receiving an education is the most effective way to escape intergenerational poverty, and a quality education provides children with support and resources that have a huge impact on not only their economic trajectory, but their moral character as well.
Now, I don’t think anyone will argue against the fact that an education is important. In fact, I think most people would agree that it is one of the most crucial elements of childhood. But if that’s true, then why do we, as a society, make it such a low priority? Why does Utah consistently score in the bottom of the nation for per-pupil education spending?
Maybe the problem is that we just aren’t aware of why increased funding for schools is important. Maybe we tend to think that schools already receive enough funding. I mean, it’s not like kids are being turned away at the doors because the school just can’t afford to take them in, right?
The problem isn’t that children don’t have access to education, the problem is whether they are really benefitting from that education. For kids who come from affluent households, this isn’t much of an issue. When they go home, they have the full support of their parents.
For children raised in poverty, it is far less likely that they are receiving the support they need. They may only have the support of one single parent, who has to work long hours or multiple jobs and, by no fault of their own, barely has the time and resources to provide the necessities.
For these kids, it may not matter that they are going to school, they simply aren’t receiving the benefits. When a child grows up in poverty or other adverse situations, their cognitive development is slowed, and they fall behind in school early on. Research shows that a student who is not a proficient reader by the third grade is four times as likely to drop out of high school.
This is where school funding comes in. Increased funding can support a host of areas — these may not be so crucial for affluent families, but they have the potential to make a huge difference for impoverished families.
More funding could allow for greater intervention for underprivileged students, picking up the slack for hard-working parents and resolving the issue of delayed brain development. More funding could go toward improving the quality of overall education, or it could mean increasing the pay of teachers, bringing more teachers to Utah.
More funding would also allow for greater amount and quality of extracurricular activities. This would address another issue that stems from living in poverty: lack of social capital. Social capital refers to connections that improve financial, social, and emotional aspects of life.
Participation in extracurricular activities provides the opportunity for mentors and positive role models, as well as lasting connections with peers. Social capital is very useful for escaping intergenerational poverty, and a boost to extracurriculars could have a huge positive impact on impoverished children.
These are only a few examples of what an increase to school funding could mean. Hopefully you can see why this is such a big deal. So, what should be done? You may have heard that Gov. Spencer Cox’s budget proposal for 2027 includes $654.2 million for public education. This is a step in the right direction. Still, more positive change is needed. The Utah Education Association (UEA) asks that funding be increased to at least 2% above inflation in order to meet the needs of students and public educators.
Change requires the action of thousands of people just like you and me. Perhaps the most important step we can take, and one of the most overlooked, is to simply be an active participant in local government. I urge you to consider how you can do your part to support education, the children desperately need you.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120325_Gov.-Budget_14-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

Approximately 100 demonstrators, mostly students, shouted chants like “keep the Capitol out of the classroom” and “our school won’t be sold” as they marched past popular campus landmarks like Old Main Lawn and the Greek Theatre in support of Emily Suski.
UPDATED: University of Arkansas withdraws incoming law dean’s offer in wake of Republican complaints

The university received national attention last week when officials withdrew an offer to Suski following complaints from key Arkansas Republicans about her background and legal positions on transgender athletes. Suski is a University of South Carolina law professor and Title IX expert.
The decision to rescind the offer less than a week after announcing Suski’s selection sparked concerns about violating academic freedom and chilling faculty speech, complaints echoed during Tuesday’s student-led protest. 
During the dean search, third-year law student Addison Brooks said students and faculty met with candidates and provided feedback. 
The “overwhelming attitude” of faculty and staff was that Suski was “the best fit.” However, the decision to rescind her offer shows their opinions didn’t matter, Brooks said.
“There were people whose voices were more important to them than ours, and that’s really upsetting, and I think that that should upset anyone in the state who values public discourse, a strong education system and an unafraid legal profession,” she said. “If they can do it to us, they can do it to anyone.”
There were 376 students enrolled in the law school as of the fall semester. A university official did not immediately return a request for comment on the protest. 
The Arkansas Student Bar Association expressed concerns about the message the decision sends to students in a statement issued Tuesday. 
“To suggest that a prospective dean’s prior legal positions would ‘indoctrinate’ students is to both fundamentally misunderstand legal education and insult the intellectual capacity of the student body,” the statement reads.

Brooks and her classmates, collectively known as Arkansas Law Students for Academic Freedom, organized Tuesday’s event, which included a roughly one-mile march around the campus. 
At the end of the march, protestors gathered outside the student union where demonstrators said they’ve felt sad, angry, fearful and overwhelmed over the situation. 
Participants argued it doesn’t matter whether people agreed with Suski’s legal opinion. The issue is protecting free speech, which they said is being eroded if lawyers have to be concerned about retaliation for expressing a legal opinion or defending a client with viewpoints that lawmakers disagree with.
People are afraid to discuss the job revocation itself, according to third-year law student Steven Jacobs, who said the university’s decision devalues their law degrees and undermines the integrity of the legal profession in Arkansas. 
“This is an assault on academic independence from an increasingly paternalist government, and it’s an insult to our school, our profession and us as students for the state to say that it knows what’s best for us,” Jacobs said. 
Arkansas Law Students for Academic Freedom called for an independent review of the hiring process and the adoption of a policy protecting university personnel decisions from “undisclosed government pressure.”
The law students’ demands have been written in a formal letter that will be delivered to the university’s administration, Brooks said. 
The concern reverberates beyond the law school. Ted Swedenburg, a professor emeritus in anthropology and Middle East Studies, said he was “gobsmacked” to learn about the university’s decision, which “potentially destroys the integrity and independence of the university,” and instills fear. 
Freedom of speech increasingly has been challenged at higher education institutions across the country, Swedenburg said, including at the University of Arkansas, which removed its Middle East center director in December following statements about Israel. Her attorney raised concerns about political pressure after state senators issued a statement about her discipline, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
“When I come back and talk to my faculty friends, they’re demoralized by all these things,” Swedenburg said.
The decision to withdraw Suski’s offer will severely hinder the university’s ability to recruit students, faculty and administrators, Brooks said.
“What dean wants to come here now?” she said. “If professors around the nation see what our legislature is capable of when they don’t get their way, who wants to come here and be in charge of the next generation of attorneys?”

The bill would transfer ownership of the Homestake Mine Hydro Electric Plant No. 2 building from the South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks to the Spearfish Canyon Foundation at no cost. The building is near the entrance to the popular Devil’s Bathtub hiking trail.

“It’s like they greased everything in 1916 and they just walked away,” Odenbach told fellow representatives in the House. 
Of the bill’s “no” votes, two came from Rep. Phil Jensen, R-Rapid City, and Rep. Tina Mulally, R-Rapid City. The two argued the state was giving away taxpayer assets without compensation.
Odenbach said the building and the land it sits on are of little value, and they cost the state money to maintain.

Scott Simpson, deputy secretary for the Department of Game, Fish, and Parks, told the House Agriculture and Natural Resource Committee last week that the property became the department’s as part of a larger 2014 acquisition from Homestake Mining Co., which also included Roughlock Falls and Spearfish Falls. The hydro plant formerly generated electricity for the Homestake Mine in Lead. The mine has been closed since 2001.
Simpson said the hydro plant site does not fit the department’s core mission of managing natural resources and recreation, and the foundation is better positioned to preserve and interpret the building’s Homestake-era history.
Simpson said the foundation would assume ownership and liability under the transfer, while a reversion clause would apply if the property is not used for a public purpose. The proposed transfer is 3.5 acres. 
Foundation supporters informed the committee that the building remains largely intact on the inside, but requires repairs, including roof work, to prevent further deterioration. Asked whether the foundation would return to the Legislature seeking state funding for renovations, foundation member Bob Ewing said no, explaining the group could pursue grants and local support.

Ralph Norman held a news conference Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026, to talk about fixing South Carolina's roads. (Photo by Alexander Thompson/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman returned to the Statehouse on Tuesday to talk roads and bridges as he seeks to pull his gubernatorial campaign into the fast lane.
Norman, who represented Rock Hill in the state House for a decade, made the pitch for his proposal to audit the state Department of Transportation, put the lieutenant governor in charge of the $2.8 billion department, and transfer smaller roads to counties to maintain. All of his ideas would require the Legislature’s approval.
And legislators are busy at work on their own proposal. A House study committee has been meeting since last summer.
The 5th District congressman has made roads and bridges a centerpiece of his campaign in hopes an issue that South Carolinians universally complain about will help him stand out from his four GOP competitors.
The proposals Norman touted Tuesday have largely been part of his platform since he launched his campaign six months ago. But the ultra-conservative congressman took the Statehouse stop — his second in two weeks — as an opportunity to bash the powers that be in Columbia and angle for the outsider status that’s much coveted in a GOP primary.
“Sadly, many who serve in these chambers don’t seem to care about what their constituents are telling them. That’s going to change under a Norman administration,” he said, as five state
representatives from the breakaway House Freedom Caucus stood behind him.

Norman, a member of the Freedom Caucus in the U.S. House, helped launch the state House affiliate in 2022 that has publicly feuded with the GOP majority.
South Carolina’s roads, which Norman said are in “crisis,” have long been among voters’ chief complaints and a political punchline.
The federal Bureau of Transportation Statistics grades 80% of the state’s roads as being in acceptable condition, putting South Carolina 31st in the nation, while the state vies with other southern states for the highest rate of traffic deaths per vehicle mile, according to the National Safety Council.
Thousands of the state’s bridges are in need of repair, to which incumbent Gov. Henry McMaster has repeatedly called legislators’ attention. The Republican governor’s budget recommendations for the upcoming fiscal year include putting $1.1 billion toward roadwork to cover inflationary costs that threaten to delay projects, as has happened in other states.
Norman’s central pitch to pothole-weary voters is that he can improve roads faster without raising revenue.
“We’ve got all the money we need, but it’s putting money in the right places. It’s getting government out of the way, and it’s getting accountability back to an area that can’t wait any longer,” Norman told reporters at the Statehouse.
Norman declined to weigh in on McMaster’s $1.1 billion request, saying he’d need to see more details. And he didn’t mention the gas tax that, as a state legislator, he fiercely opposed raising.
To find more cash, Norman hopes to pay for an independent audit of the department, in addition to the internal audits required yearly. He also believes the lieutenant governor should lead the department, as he contends a political figure would be more accountable to voters than a secretary who answers to an appointed governing board.
Making the lieutenant governor “road czar,” in Norman’s terms, would give the part-time position a defined job and once again rejigger the department’s management — if the Legislature approves the idea.
Changing the agency’s governing structure has been a popular thing for lawmakers to focus on while insisting roads can be fixed for no additional money.
In 2007, a restructuring law made the DOT a Cabinet agency and gave the governor the power to appoint its director. Advocates for reform complained that legislators had too much influence over which projects got done, since they determined who sat on the agency’s governing board. The law made the secretary answer to two bosses: the governor and the legislatively appointed commission. A 2010 outside audit found the law actually increased inefficiencies.
In 2016, then-Gov. Nikki Haley reluctantly signed a law that, along with letting the state borrow money for road improvements, removed the agency from the Cabinet and returned control to the commission. However, it let the governor pick the commissioners — if legislators approve.
It wasn’t until Haley, who had repeatedly promised to veto any increase to gas taxes, left to join the Trump administration that the Legislature managed to agree on a road-funding plan that raised the gas tax by 12 cents over six years, to 28 cents a gallon, where it remains. Legislators knew at the time that the compromise raised far less than the DOT said it needed to bring existing roads to good condition.
While Norman was a Haley ally who consistently voted to uphold her vetoes, he didn’t vote on that law. He resigned from the state House in order to concentrate on his successful bid for Congress two weeks before the first vote on the House floor.
In his budget recommendations, McMaster noted that almost $7 billion worth of roadway projects are underway in South Carolina, compared to $2.7 billion in 2017 when the law passed.
“The department is hitting the marks that we set out to do back in 2017,” Secretary Justin Powell said at a Statehouse hearing in August, adding that the extra revenue has led to a significant
improvement in road quality.
But a decade later, the DOT is also dealing with faster growth than expected and the resulting traffic headaches that drive up complaints.
Norman proposes handing off smaller state roads to county management — an idea that’s been around for decades without much success. He didn’t say whether he’s willing to offer financial aid for the transfers.
South Carolina has the nation’s fourth-largest state-maintained highway system, at more than 41,000 centerline miles. The state is responsible for nearly 70% of public roads, including what’s called farm-to-market roads and many neighborhood streets. Some are essentially glorified driveways.
But historically, local governments have balked at the idea of taking on more roads and the expenses that come with that additional responsibility. The agency is seeking $25 million in the upcoming budget for a road-buyback program that offers local governments money in exchange for taking a road. It’s seeking permission from the Legislature to negotiate those deals.
Norman’s not the only gubernatorial candidate claiming he’ll do a better job fixing roads.
While Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette has touted the state’s progress under the McMaster administration, the other candidates have struck a critical tone similar to Norman’s.
Congresswoman Nancy Mace of Charleston County is also proposing an audit in her platform, while state Attorney General Alan Wilson pointed to cutting “massive” waste at the department in an August interview.
The details of the candidates’ plans remain vague, and Norman didn’t change that on Tuesday.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ralph-Norman-DOT-newser-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

(Photo courtesy of the SC State Ports Authority)MOUNT PLEASANT — The Port of Charleston is largely bucking national trends with cargo levels that are roughly flat year over year, despite tariffs and global trade uncertainties, port officials said Tuesday.
A total of 689,350 cargo containers of all sizes moved through the port’s terminals during the first six months of the 2026 fiscal year, which started July 1. That compares to 692,770 containers during the same July-through-December period a year earlier.
Byron Miller, chief commercial officer for the S.C. State Ports Authority, said the average cargo decline at all U.S. ports is projected at 4%. The National Retail Federation has a better outlook, predicting the nation’s ports will see only a slight, less than 1 percent, decline for 2025.
“So, in sum, 2025 was a year of great uncertainty,” Miller told the authority’s board of directors. “Many shippers deferred decisions on new facilities and new investments. However, we are very encouraged by the latter part of the year.”
Within the past 90 days, for example, a pair of major port customers — First Solar and the Cosco retail chain — announced plans for a combined $570.3 million in new or expanded South Carolina facilities.
And four industrial buildings were leased in the Charleston market during the fourth quarter, taking 2 million square feet of space off the market with customers that will add 25,000 containers a year to the port’s total.
“December was not only an active month but a very productive month commercially for the port,” Miller said. “While the outcome may remain a little bit muted for 2026 for trade volumes, this gives us great reason to be encouraged about what lies ahead in our market.”
Micah Mallace, the authority’s president and CEO, said in a news release that the agency is “preparing to see weaker volumes continue into 2026 but remain hopeful that the industry will stabilize some time next year.”
Southeast ports, like Charleston’s, were largely able to blunt tariff and other impacts due to a growing population that has fueled the region’s economy. The Port of Savannah, which hasn’t yet reported December totals, was on target to notch a slight increase in cargo for 2025.
Other ports saw their cargo levels fall.
The Port of Virginia, for example, recorded an 8 % drop. All told, the retail group said national cargo levels are expected to trail year-over-year numbers at least through this spring.
The first few months of the year are typically slow for ports nationwide, and there is uncertainty over how the rest of 2026 will play out.
“As 2026 begins, we see a world increasingly focused on protecting domestic industries and addressing perceived trade imbalances,” Ben Hackett, founder of maritime industry consultant Hackett Associates, said in a written statement. “This approach has raised questions about the future of free trade and international economic cooperation.”
Jonathan Gold, the retail federation’s vice president for supply chain and customs policy, said retailers are hoping for more stability.
“Especially regarding tariffs and trade policy … to help ensure better supply chain operations to meet consumer needs,” Gold said in a statement.
In addition to the updated cargo outlook, the authority is winding down its cruise ship business at Union Pier Terminal in downtown Charleston ahead of selling the property to Lowcountry developer and businessman Ben Navarro.
The authority’s cruise calendar shows eight vessels will make 26 port-of-call visits to Union Pier through July 4, with no further cruise ships scheduled beyond Independence Day. That will bring an end to regular cruise ship visits that began in 2010 with Carnival Cruise Line offering year-round journeys. Carnival left the Charleston market at the end of 2024.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A House panel advanced legislation Tuesday that would require land restoration efforts following the initial construction of electric transmission lines in Iowa. 
Under House Study Bill 526, transmission line owners would be responsible for repairing tile drainage, tilling impacted soil and reseeding cover crops or other ground cover in the easement area following construction.
Kevin Kuhle, speaking on behalf of the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, said land restoration following electric transmission projects is a “really important issue” for Iowa farmers. 
The bill language states that electric transmission owners must “restore the land to its original condition to the extent practicable.”
The Iowa Utilities Commission would implement the rules and impose civil penalties if electric transmission owners do not comply with the restoration requirements. 
Similar language was included in Gov. Kim Reynolds’ proposed energy bill from 2025, which did not make it to the floor for debate. 
Several other farm groups, and environmental groups registered in favor of the bill, while utility companies remained undecided on the bill. 
Onnalee Gettler, a lobbyist on behalf of MidAmerican Energy, suggested an amendment to the bill so that it only applied to projects from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, long-range transmission plan, “Tranche 2.1” and beyond. Gettler said these are transmission projects that were approved in July 2024, but have not yet been built. 
While HSB 526 applies only to electric transmission lines, Kuhle with Iowa Farm Bureau Federation said “it’d be great” if lawmakers extended the restoration requirements to other projects, including natural gas and liquid hazardous pipelines. 
“All of these energy projects are going to be built out, and we want to make sure landowners are respected in the process,” Kuhle said. 
The bill passed unanimously from the subcommittee, led by Rep. Shannon Latham, R-Sheffield.

House Bill 2559 would allow cities and counties, starting in April 2027, to impose a tax up to 4% on short-term rentals to raise money for affordable housing. Uses of the revenue include building new housing, maintaining existing units and providing rental assistance. 
If the bill moves forward, the fight over the proposal could be fierce.
Over the past year, Airbnb has pumped nearly $4 million into a political action committee opposing the idea in Washington. The company gave $1 million to the committee in late November. The PAC’s ads appear often on TVW, the state’s public affairs network.
State law defines short-term rentals as those provided for fewer than 30 consecutive nights, but doesn’t cover units in the same home where the owner lives, so long as fewer than three rooms are rented at a time. These rentals have exploded as an option for travelers in recent years. 
Similar legislation passed the state Senate last year without Republican support before dying in the House. Initially, that bill called for a statewide tax, but was amended to instead give local governments the option to enact the tax. A fiscal analysis of last year’s bill estimated the new tax would raise about $21 million per year for local governments.
Cities in other states, including New York City, have banned whole-home short-term rentals entirely. 
Research on the issue has been mixed.
In Irvine, California, rents decreased 3% after the city effectively banned short-term rentals, researchers found. A 2019 Harvard Business Review study concluded a 1% increase in Airbnb listings resulted in a 0.018% growth in rental rates and 0.026% uptick in home prices.
A Congressional Research Service report last year noted the economic effects of short-term rentals can be overshadowed by other forces, like zoning laws and other regulations.
In a committee hearing Tuesday, numerous Airbnb operators urged lawmakers to oppose the legislation. 
Some were older Washingtonians who said they need the income to support themselves in their retirement. And they say most of their guests who would pay the tax are Washington residents vacationing, traveling for work or families of college students. 
Thousands come for medical treatment, said Allison Moser, president of the Washington Hosts Collaborative Alliance. Moser, who owns a duplex with her husband as a short-term rental, said the collaborative represents 16,000 short-term rental operators in the state.
“They paid 30% less than for a hotel, but had the comfort and quiet of a home-like atmosphere,” she told the House Finance Committee. “Rentals invest in our community’s healthy economic environment, and we want to continue to do so.”
Counties love the idea, said Brian Enslow, policy consultant at the Washington Association of Counties. With limited options to raise affordable housing funding, they would be open to an even higher rate tax above 4%.
City leaders in tourist towns say short-term rentals are pushing up housing costs for residents, including those who work in the tourism economy. 
“Leavenworth is losing its community,” Leavenworth Mayor Carl Florea said. “Every one of these short-term rentals could be, and many of them have been, permanent housing. And now, because of the popularity, they’re used as second homes, and it takes away stock.”
“And if we don’t get a significant tool to begin to address it, we’re going to lose the community completely,” he continued.
Sean Lynn, the secretary of the hosts collaborative, manages short-term rentals in Leavenworth. He suggested a smaller across-the-board tax on all lodging types.
“A broad-based approach would avoid singling out one segment and reduce incentives to shift demand between lodging options,” Lynn said.
Local governments can currently levy a tax up to 2% on lodging, including in hotels, motels and short-term rentals. The revenue is mostly used for promoting tourism. Except in Seattle, various lodging taxes currently cannot exceed a total of 12%. Seattle can’t go over 15.2%.
The committee hasn’t scheduled a vote to move the measure forward.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1734836683-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

One is outward facing, grounded in strong institutions and using innovation to project its ideas and  successfully compete with the nation and world. That is the Massachusetts of the China Trade, the Industrial Revolution, Route 128 and the rise of computing, and, more recently, biotechnology and the life sciences. It is the Massachusetts of growing prosperity. 
The other soul is inward looking and parochial. It focuses on protecting existing interests, tolerates rising costs, and treats competition as a threat rather than a catalyst for innovation. This is the Massachusetts of machine politics and complacency— rooted in the patronage systems of early 20th century Boston and reflected today in the outsized influence of public-sector unions. 
The state has long oscillated between these two identities. Periods of outward engagement have brought leadership; periods of retrenchment have produced stagnation and population loss. 
Today, Massachusetts is firmly in a parochial phase, reflected in policy choices over the past decade that have led to job losses, rising living costs, and outmigration of talent and investment. Since 2010, state spending has grown at two times the rate of median household income; state employee compensation costs have risen even faster. 
As a result, the state has increased fees and taxes while failing to address punitive housing, health care, and energy costs. It is unsurprising that families are leaving Massachusetts at every age and income level. Younger residents are departing at a particularly alarming rate.  
It is not just a cost-of-living issue. As Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary recently noted, Massachusetts has become uninvestible, which we see as more employers move out and stop investing in new jobs here.  Since 2020, Massachusetts has lost more than 25,000 private-sector jobs, while North Carolina—with a broadly similar industry mix and size—has added more than 250,000. Florida, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Texas all dramatically outperform us on job growth and affordability. We lose jobs while some competitor states have grown their job base by more than 10 percent. 
Their success is no accident. Their leaders are choosing to compete—by lowering taxes, restraining health care and housing costs, and making it easier to hire, invest, and grow businesses. 
In our forthcoming book, Agenda for Leadership 2026: Choosing to Compete, we present a comprehensive 64-policy platform to restore Massachusetts to its rightful place as a national leader in education, patient care, and economic opportunity. Fiscal discipline is not a comprehensive policy vision, but the state government’s runaway spending remains a foundational obstacle to Massachusetts realizing its potential. When government expands faster than the private economy, the consequences are predictable: higher taxes, rising costs, and weaker job creation. 
Our slate of fiscal reforms is practical and measured, non-ideological, and will save the Commonwealth between $1.1 and $1.8 billion annually, while protecting essential services and strengthening long-term competitiveness.  
In just the last few years, the state workforce has grown by 5,000 FTEs and compensation has jumped far more than median household income. To address this gap, we suggest strategic attrition, leaving a small share of lower-priority positions unfilled as employees retire or move on. This approach avoids layoffs and expensive buyouts while saving taxpayers hundreds of millions.  
We suggest greater oversight of the Commonwealth’s sprawling network of quasi-public entities. That will also have the benefit of bringing transparency and accountability to organizations spending $9 billion in public funds with limited oversight.  
Other states competitively bid public services. but because of the state’s anti-competitive Pacheco Law, we do not. In the area of public construction projects, we too often use project labor agreements that exclude the majority of firms and adversely impact minority-owned businesses. Reforms in both areas would improve quality and significantly reduce costs.  
We suggest means-testing two universal benefits programs—free community college and school meals—focusing benefits on lower-income households (up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level) and eliminating subsidies for wealthier families. 
Finally, AI-enabled tools offer the potential to save a minimum of 1–2 percent of the overall budget of major benefits programs like unemployment insurance, MassHealth, and public procurement by reducing “leakage”— payment errors, administrative inefficiencies, and fraud. When resources reach the right recipients more reliably and quickly, families benefit. Leakage benefits no one. 
Like household income, local aid has grown at only a fraction of the state’s overall spending growth, so some of the savings should be directed at boosting frontline services through non-education local aid. It would also ease local pressure to raise property taxes and fees.  
The savings can also stave off additional state tax hikes or allow tax relief for families and businesses.  
Restoring Massachusetts’s leadership in education, patient care, and economic opportunity—and making Massachusetts more affordable for families and businesses alike—will require focus, discipline, and a willingness to compete.  
It is a choice Massachusetts has made before. We must make that choice again.

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)Protesters marched outside the Roundhouse late Tuesday morning decrying federal immigration policy, inaction on climate change and genocide in Gaza, saying they wanted to send a message to New Mexico’s lawmakers that “enough is enough.”
Advocates said they want bold action from lawmakers to end immigration detention, address climate change, economic inequality and more.
“We are making it clear that we won’t stand by while our communities and futures are sacrificed for profits,” said Vittoria Judy, the program coordinator for climate organization Youth United for Climate Crisis Action. “Today it isn’t just a march or rally, it’s a warning about the cost of inaction; it’s an invitation to meet this moment with the bold action that it actually demands, and it’s a commitment to defend each other, to show up for each other, care for each other.”

Advocates across a series of causes marched together from the Santa Fe Plaza culminating in a “We Got Us” rally outside the Roundhouse’s eastern doors on the opening day of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s final regular session. Organizers said more than 1,500 showed up for the event.
“We’re out here to unite with everybody, the strength comes from our togetherness and our unity,” said Deborah Jiron (Isleta Pueblo) with American Indian Movement Albuquerque.
Signs included calls for the impeachment of the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and some attendees wore shirts with the portrait of Renee Good, the 37-year old woman shot in Minneapolis by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official earlier this month.
Mekia Cozart, of Peñasco, said she joined the protest to stand up for her Hispanic immigrant family saying she wants New Mexico lawmakers to get “ICE out, period.”
She said her paternal grandfather was deported several years ago, and she is “terrified” of potential harassment for her friends and family by immigration officials.
“I’m constantly scared for them, and I just want this to stop,” Cozart told Source NM. “I’m 18 and I’m cleaning up adult’s messes, and that’s not my job. The world is ours, but we have no say in it, it seems like.”
Speakers called for support of legislation banning immigrant detention in the state.
“In the next few weeks, New Mexico has a choice to stand up to the violence and kidnapping of our people and pass the Immigrant Safety Act,” said Fernanda Banda, a co-director of the New Mexico Dream Team.

A comparable bill introduced in 2025 passed the House, but died without a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee. But even if the Legislature passes the bill and the governor signs it into law, two of the state’s three immigrant detention facilities operated by a private prison contractor could potentially still be able to remain open in New Mexico.
Judy, in an interview with Source NM, said that some of the organizations participating in the protest would be hosting virtual meetings every Monday to continue the momentum from the rally, to track legislation and get people involved.
“When we are looking at the small little watered-down bills that are coming out, we say that’s not going to do anything, and we need to push harder,” Judy said.

Introduced at a Jan. 13 selectboard meeting, Mackenzie said he learned about the vacancy from the Vermont League of Cities and Towns and decided to apply.

“Long story short, I thought that I could provide a service to the town,” he said at the meeting. 
Although public service “can be challenging at times,” Mackenzie said he enjoyed it.
“I feel very comfortable dealing with the public. I can’t solve everybody’s problems but I guarantee you that I basically have an open door policy,” he said.
Jeff Schulz, former longtime town manager, was set to retire in March but was removed from the position in December while he was on leave. Details of the severance agreement signed by the selectboard on Dec. 17 have not been released.
Selectboard Chair Charlie Morse called him “a welcome asset” at a meeting earlier this month and selectboard member Lydia Petty called for residents to support him.
Mackenzie did not immediately respond to a request for comment and his salary information was not available Tuesday.
One of his first tasks is to find a replacement for Laurie Baroffio, the town’s former financial director who resigned last year but is working part-time as a consultant until the position is filled. 
Baroffio is helping the selectboard draft the fiscal year 2026-27 municipal budget that will be presented to voters for approval on Town Meeting Day on March 3.
The town has also contracted with Kevin Moulton, the deputy police chief in Montpelier, as the interim police chief, effective Jan. 14, for an hourly rate of $73.54 plus expenses, according to the agreement. He will remain a Montpelier employee, will use a Montpelier police car and wear the city police uniform.
“He is a respected leader with extensive experience, and his role will help ensure continuity, stability, and professional oversight during this transition period,” Eric Nordenson, the police chief in Montpelier, wrote in an email Tuesday.
The four-month intermunicipal police agreement signed on Jan. 14 runs until May 1 but “can be extended by mutual consent to allow for a smooth transition to a full-time appointed Chief of Police” in Northfield.
During this time, Montpelier, Berlin and the Washington County Sheriff’s Department will assist with policing needs in town on a contract basis, “to ensure continuity of operations and adequate coverage,” according to the letter and agreement shared by Nordenson.
The Montpelier Police Department “fully supports the intermunicipal police agreement” with Northfield, Nordenson said in an email. “This partnership reflects a shared commitment to regional collaboration, efficient use of resources, and maintaining high-quality public safety services for our communities.”
Moulton’s appointment comes after former Police Chief Pierre Gomez resigned in October. One of three police chiefs of color in Vermont, Gomez reported facing racial harassment since he moved to town two years ago.
Mackenzie announced the new police contract on the town website on Monday.
“In addition to providing leadership to the existing department staff and responding to calls for service in a timely and effective manner, Chief Moulton, working with Montpelier Chief Nordenson, will collaborate with the Vermont State Police and other central Vermont police departments to provide full-time police coverage,” the post reads.
The selectboard may discuss “legal/personnel/contracts” in executive session at a special meeting scheduled Tuesday night, according to the posted agenda. 
Another special meeting scheduled for Wednesday may discuss the town manager search, possibly in executive session.

St. Bernards Medical Center launched the Maternal Life360 HOME program in Jonesboro in November 2024, allowing pregnant and postpartum Arkansans in Craighead County to receive at-home visits during and after high-risk pregnancies. The health system brought the program to Greene County in December, and it started accepting patients in Lawrence County on Tuesday, according to a St. Bernards news release.
Emily McGee, St. Bernards vice president for Nursing and Women’s and Children’s Services, said last month that the health system planned “to continue to grow by serving additional counties in the near future.”
“Ultimately, our vision is to have a program wherever we have a pregnancy or women’s health clinic,” McGee said in Tuesday’s news release.
In November 2022, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a request from the Arkansas Department of Human Services to allow an additional 5,000 pregnant and postpartum Arkansans to receive Life360 HOME services.
Life360 started as part of Arkansas Health and Opportunity for Me, the state’s version of Medicaid expansion. Initially, only Medicaid expansion enrollees were eligible to participate in Life360 HOME, but the program now includes any Arkansan on Medicaid with a high-risk pregnancy living in a Life360 service area.
Arkansans must not be currently receiving other state or federally funded home-visiting services to be eligible for the Life360 HOME program.

Arkansas has the nation’s fourth-highest rate of maternal mortality, with 38 maternal deaths per 1,000 live births between 2018 and 2022, according to the independent health research center KFF. Arkansas also had the nation’s third-highest infant mortality rate in 2022, with nearly eight infant deaths per 1,000 live births, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. St. Bernards noted these statistics in Tuesday’s news release and said expanding Life360 HOME into Lawrence County is “a direct effort to address” these issues.
Arkansas remains the only state that has taken no action to adopt the federal option of extending postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to 12 months after birth, according to KFF.
Legislation that would have expanded postpartum Medicaid coverage to 12 months did not pass the Legislature in 2023 or 2025. State Medicaid officials Janet Mann and Elizabeth Pitman told lawmakers last year that the Department of Human Services opposed the effort due to its cost.
Pitman called Life360 HOME “a cornerstone of our strategy to improve maternal health outcomes throughout the state” in Tuesday’s announcement.
“By addressing health and social needs together, these programs can save the lives of pregnant women and their infants,” Pitman said.
DHS funds Life360 HOME services in Little Rock, North Little Rock and Batesville and is working on launching the program in Hot Springs and Rogers, department officials said last month.
The program in Jonesboro has served roughly 60 families so far, McGee said in the news release.

(Photo via Google Earth)A Senate subcommittee advanced a measure Tuesday to remove the state requirement to maintain a State Historical Society of Iowa research center in Iowa City — a point of litigation as the state has already moved to close the facility.
Senate Study Bill 3033 strikes the state requirement for the Iowa Department of Administrative Services to maintain a historical resource research center in Iowa City. It would specify that the facility must be maintained in Des Moines.
The change was proposed months after the announced closure of the Iowa City center. Beginning June 30, 2026, the State Historical Society of Iowa (SHSI) Research Center is set to close, with changes in operations and hours beginning July 9. This change was announced by the State Historical Society of Iowa in June 2025 and sparked a lawsuit from a group of historians, donors and professors.

However, the location closed to the public earlier than expected — beginning Jan. 1 this year — after the state reached an agreement with the University of Iowa that keeps some records accessible through the university library, in response to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit, filed in Johnson County District Court in September, argues the move to close the Iowa City library and archives violated state law. The language cited in the lawsuit is what legislators are proposing to remove in the bill discussed at the Tuesday subcommittee meeting.
There is a second lawsuit filed by the nonprofit corporation State Historical Society Inc., which Jim Carney with the organization said is currently going through the administrative law process.  As these lawsuits proceed, he urged lawmakers to continue requiring DAS maintain the Iowa City location, saying many Iowans are “very concerned about capacity to merge everything” into Des Moines, both in terms of staffing and facility capabilities.
Public officials have said closing the Iowa City facility and moving materials to Des Moines is needed as the SHSI faces a $800,000 budget shortfall. But donors, historians and other advocates say the State Historical Building in Des Moines will not be able to properly maintain the Iowa City resources, as it “lacks sufficient climate-controlled space to house the Iowa City collections” alongside $72 million in deferred maintenance projects.
Additionally, more than half of the Iowa City historical collection is not expected to make the move to Des Moines. Iowa State Archivist Tony Jahn said at a June board meeting that 40% of the Iowa City collections will be transferred to the State Historical Building while the other 60% will be sold, dispersed or discarded.
Carney, as well as several other speakers, said a major concern coming out of the DAS-announced closure and moving of historical materials was a lack of “transparency” on what is happening with documents and other items.
“We don’t have an inventory of what was taken, nor do we have any understanding of how those materials — which are very valuable, irreplaceable — are being preserved and taken care of,” Carney said.
Several people opposing the bill criticized DAS for not sharing enough information on what was happening to the materials formerly housed at the Iowa City SHSI Research Center, but Nathan Reckman, DAS deputy director, said there are answers to the concerns brought up. He said the department’s decision to close the Iowa City facility was made because “we can’t support with our budget a center in Iowa City and a center here in Des Moines.”
He said there is a DAS website that details the items that have been moved from Iowa City to Des Moines, and that the department is committed to going through the required processes for any removal of access to the current collection. He also said the move will make Iowa historical materials more accessible to the wider public, as the cataloging system used at the Iowa City center does not make the items accessible online.
“The plan is to bring all the items in Iowa City that we can to Des Moines, and catalog them, make them available online, make them more accessible,” Reckman said. “… Our plan is to get these items more accessible and available to everyone.”
Sen. Carrie Koelker, R-Dyersville, who led the subcommittee meeting, said there have been “inaccurate” reports of the state destroying historical materials. She also said groups that donate historical materials to the State Historical Society of Iowa, including labor and religious organizations, were not paying rental or storage fees for the maintenance of these facilities.
“I don’t think we’re short-falling history by any means … but things are updated in time too,” Koelker said. “And budget shortfalls — counties not contributing, and there’s no rental fees for everyone that’s storing information there — I don’t know that that’s due diligence, that that should fall on Iowa taxpayers.”
The legislation moved forward in a 2-1 vote, with Democratic Sen. Art Staed of Cedar Rapids opposing the bill’s advancement. In the Iowa House, a bipartisan group of lawmakers — Reps. Adam Zabner, Bobby Kaufmann, Charley Thomson and Dave Jacoby — have introduced House File 2025, a separate proposal requiring DAS to maintain Iowa City and Des Moines facilities that are “adequately staffed” and “open to the public.”
Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner said she plans to introduce a companion bill to the House proposal in the Senate.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT — Low pay and limited advancement opportunities are creating a “crisis” of turnover among Kentucky’s public defenders who are leaving for higher pay elsewhere, lawmakers were told Tuesday. 
Kentucky’s Public Advocate Damon Preston and Deputy Public Advocate Melanie Lowe told a legislative committee the significant turnover risks “constitutional failures” with Kentuckians not receiving adequate representation in court, creates instability in court proceedings, and can waste taxpayer funds by training staff attorneys who leave for work elsewhere.
“Kentucky really needs to raise the salary so that attorneys don’t have to look outside the borders of Kentucky in order to live a reasonable life,” Lowe told lawmakers. 
Ninety-four attorneys left the Department of Public Advocacy in 2025, accounting for a 24% turnover rate that year, according to a presentation by Preston and Lowe. The turnover rate has increased over several years from 17% in 2022. 
The department brought on a new class of public defenders consisting of 42 attorneys coming from law school in August 2025, though the department has lost 53 attorneys since that new class. Lowe said the median timespan of a departing attorney is 21 months, long enough for a new recruit to finish the department’s “excellent” training program and then leave. 
Preston and Lowe cite low pay as the major reason for the turnover. Their presentation states the starting salary for public defenders in Kentucky is $58,200, while the salary floor in other states with statewide public defender systems can be tens of thousands of dollars higher such as in Minnesota, which raised starting pay to $88,380. Their presentation stated that starting salaries are higher across the state border in cities including Cincinnati and Evansville. 
Public defenders in Kentucky have also switched sides in the courtroom, Preston and Lowe said, receiving raises to become prosecutors. Preston shared documents with the Lantern highlighting appropriations in the last two-year state budget for additional personnel for prosecutors and recruitment efforts by the Kentucky attorney general’s office. He said his department did not receive requested increased funding for additional attorneys and recruiting support during the last biennium. 
“They’re doing the same work. They’re in the same courtroom. They’re simply at that other table on the other side of the courtroom, and they’re making $20,000 or more,” Preston said. 
Preston and Lowe are asking state lawmakers for $10,581,857 in the upcoming two-year state budget to raise the salary floor of attorneys to $70,000 and raise other attorney positions within the department by a similar percentage. They’re also asking for funding to better recruit new attorneys and pay for private attorneys who are contracted to work for the department. 
“We definitely have had clients with serious charges who have gone through two and three and four attorneys,” Lowe said, as attorneys leave in the middle of court proceedings. “It’s very frustrating for the clients who are incarcerated and clients who are stuck in the system and really want to get a resolution to their case.” 
Department leaders are also advocating for changes in Kentucky law to narrow the scope of cases requiring public defenders, thereby freeing up the time and resources of those attorneys. 
They are proposing that public defenders no longer be part of cases involving Tim’s Law, in which law enforcement, family or friends can petition a court to have someone go through court-mandated mental health treatment. Preston said the person who is the subject of such a petition needs legal counsel. 
“Those cases sometimes can be pretty time-intensive,” Preston said. “That person needs counsel, but that could be met by a local attorney who’s paid on a per-case basis.” 
The department is also advocating for creating a “circuit advocate,” or public defenders that serve a specific judicial circuit that can encompass cases in more than one county.

Rep. Stephanie Dietz, R-Edgewood, the chair of the House Budget Review Subcommittee on Justice, Public Safety, & Judiciary, who heard Preston’s and Lowe’s testimony, plans to file a bill after collaborating with the department. She said the bill “shrinks the role” of the department over specific types of cases such as those involving Casey’s Law. That law allows friends, relatives or parents to petition a court to require someone go through substance abuse treatment, another situation where a person subject to a petition would need representation. 
“There’s some judges that have been appointing DPA to all Casey’s Law cases. They’re not equipped to handle all that,” Dietz said. 
As for the department’s request to raise the salary floor for public defenders, Dietz said she understands the situation but is not sure “where we’re going to land on that.” Dietz questioned how much it costs to train a new public defender who ultimately leaves after less than two years. 
“It doesn’t feel that that’s very cost-efficient either if you train them and you lose them. So what can we do to help them keep these attorneys there?” Dietz said. “I want to do everything I can to work with them and see them keep these young lawyers and keep them in Kentucky.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2783-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 17:56:50.038531

Supporters of the resolution argued that Washington has proven unwilling to address rising national debt; Opponents raised concerns about the uncertainty of a convention process that has never been used.
DOVER, Del. — A proposal urging Delaware to join a national effort to call a Convention of States under Article V of the U.S. Constitution failed Tuesday after a tense and closely divided vote in the Delaware Senate, underscoring sharp disagreements over federal power, fiscal restraint and the role of states in forcing constitutional change.
Senate Concurrent Resolution 114, sponsored by Sen. Bryant Richardson, R-Seaford, fell short on a split vote of 7 in favor, 7 opposed and 7 not voting. Under Senate rules, the evenly divided result meant the resolution failed.
The measure would have formally asked Congress to convene a convention limited to three subjects: imposing fiscal restraints on the federal government, limiting federal power and jurisdiction, and establishing term limits for members of Congress and other federal officials.
The vote followed a heated floor exchange between Sen. Dave Sokola, D-Newark, and Sen. Eric Buckson, R-Camden, that escalated enough to prompt Lt. Gov. Kyle Evans Gay, presiding over the chamber, to intervene and restore decorum.
Supporters of the resolution argued that Washington has proven unwilling to address rising national debt or restrain its own authority, leaving states with few remaining constitutional tools to force reform. They framed the Article V process as a lawful mechanism envisioned by the nation’s founders for moments when Congress fails to act.
Opponents raised concerns about the uncertainty of a convention process that has never been used, warning that once convened it could exceed its intended scope. Others expressed reluctance to commit Delaware to a national process they said lacks clear guardrails.
All seven votes in favor came from Republican senators, while all seven votes against came from Democrats. Seven additional Democrats abstained or did not vote, an unusually high number that signaled internal division within the caucus.
Despite the defeat, supporters indicated the effort is not over. Similar resolutions have been introduced in prior sessions, and advocates of the Convention of States movement continue to press lawmakers nationwide. Nineteen states have already passed comparable resolutions, with 34 required to trigger a convention.
The convention vote capped a busy opening day for the General Assembly.
Earlier, the House unanimously passed Senate Bill 106, requiring every Delaware school district and charter school to adopt clear policies limiting student cellphone use during the school day. Because the bill was amended in the House, it now returns to the Senate for concurrence.
The Senate session opened on a somber note, with lawmakers honoring fallen State Trooper Matthew “Ty” Snook. Later in the day, senators approved measures recognizing law enforcement service, firearm permit issues and employee compensation, and both chambers passed a bipartisan resolution calling for greater civility and respectful discourse in the General Assembly.
While SCR 114 failed, the close vote and intensity of the debate highlighted a broader national argument now playing out in Dover: whether structural change to the federal government should come from within Congress, or be driven by states using constitutional authority that has never before been tested.

Passed during the 2025 Legislative session, House Joint Resolution 61 requires a study of property insurance during the interim, and it was the highest ranked — or most important — study bill passed last session.
The legislature’s Economic Affairs Interim committee, helmed by House Speaker Rep. Brandon Ler, has picked up the study. And on Tuesday, they heard from a panel that included insurance lobbyists, consumer advocates and research organizations including Headwaters Economics.
Insurance lobbyists said extreme weather, “legal system abuse,” a rise in building costs and regulatory overreach are all problems. 
Insurance companies said they’re also paying out more than what they bring in and there’s concern about driving away providers.
Ler brought up cost shifting, a term also brought up repeatedly in the property tax discussions that dominated the final weeks of the last legislative session.
“If it gets cheaper for one party, it’s probably going to get more expensive for another and so, you know, the full solution is not just to pick a select group of insured and do something to make their policies cheaper,” Ler told the committee. “We’ve got a much bigger problem than that, and absolutely agree with that. Another thing, it’s already been stated that there is, you know, fewer and fewer insurance companies actually coming into the marketplace. We do not want to drive any of these last remaining insurance companies out.”
Consumer advocates, meanwhile, have expressed concern with the lack of data around rises in rates, nonrenewals of insurance policies and higher costs associated with lower credit scores.
“We need more data, and we need more accurate data, and it’s not just an issue in Montana, but across the country,” said Michael DeLong, who represented the Consumer Federation on the panel. “We’ve heard, there are a lot of anecdotes and stories, you’ve probably heard from people about rising insurance premiums, companies refusing to renew their policies, people cutting back and trying to hollow out policies, stronger, more frequent natural disasters, but there’s a lack of like, concrete information on what, exactly how bad the problem is, how much prices are going up.”
According to the Consumer Federation of America, average insurance premiums for a typical homeowner in Montana increased by about 10% from 2021 to 2024. Nationwide, the typical homeowner saw their property insurance premium increase by nearly $650 in that time period.
There has been one recent, major federal study into the issue, consolidated into a report that looked at rises in insurance rates between 2018-2022, using data obtained from the states. Some states, including Montana, did not submit data to this report.
DeLong went on to say there was a brief skirmish between the Treasury Department and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, though the NAIC — which is made up of the elected and appointed insurance commissioners across the country — eventually came on board.
The state is also planning to participate in the next NAIC data call, but data from that likely won’t be usable until June, said Trevor Graff, the director of government relations with the Securities and Insurance office.
“I’m hoping we can focus on the fact that we are participating in the data call, and we will mitigate the prior administration’s non-participation in that action,” Graff said.
Wildfires are also a continual concern and according to the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, the number of billion-dollar disasters is expected to increase by about 50% by the end of the decade. Montana has been impacted by at least one billion-dollar disaster annually.
“By the end of this decade, it is likely Montana will have experienced 16 or more billion-dollar disasters in just 10 years,” a presentation during Tuesday’s committee meeting stated.
Fires and what to do about them have been a long-running discussion and late last year one of the panelists, Kimi Barrett, a lead wildfire research and policy analyst at Headwaters Economics, helped author a report on the issue.
“If the homes are part of this problem, they must fundamentally be part of the solution, and in the most simplest form, by reducing risk proactively, before the wildfire becomes the disaster is our best chance at long term insurance retainment,” Barrett said Tuesday.
Ler, who spent time working fires with the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation and then more than a decade as a volunteer firefighter, said it’s a concern – and will take federal fire mitigation action. Exactly what type of (and how much) mitigation is needed is a point of contention among some environmentalists, with some researchers saying the forests are not as overgrown as many think.
Even so, there has been a push to do more mitigation work, which can be expensive.
“For us to see real reduction and real risk reduction in the state of Montana, we have to charge the federal government with actually taking care of the lands that they, in a sense, own or have control over, because without that, we’re never going to see a real reduction,” Ler said. “We can have all the mitigation plans in place on your private property, but when you have a fire coming down at you at 60 mph, there’s absolutely nothing you can do, and the houses are going to burn just the same.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1410759881-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 17:56:50.038531

(By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Community members continue to take precautions amid sightings of federal immigration agents in Maine, though an increase in operations is unclear as the Trump administration remains mum.
Multiple sightings throughout Southern Maine on Tuesday, beginning during the morning commute with five armed agents in three unmarked vehicles in Portland, have been confirmed by volunteer verifying teams working with a community watch hotline. 
Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager for the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition, said the hotline has received increased calls in recent days, from roughly one per day to now one to three calls per minute. 
“The calls are a mix of people having questions about safety and what’s going on, people needing to be connected to resources, a big number of bad faith callers and the potential sightings,” Torres told Maine Morning Star. 
These sightings come after the mayors of Portland and Lewiston announced last week that they were expecting an increase in federal immigration enforcement in their communities. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not confirmed nor denied a forthcoming escalation in Maine and did not respond to requests for comment on the recent sightings.  
Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline said Tuesday there was an “increased presence” of ICE agents but did not respond to questions about how he made his determination. It’s unclear at this time whether recent sightings amount to an uptick. Immigration arrests have been occurring across Maine, with an acceleration beginning in June as President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda got underway. 
The hotline, organized by MIRC and the People’s Coalition for Safety, is built for the purpose of identifying federal activity — with more than 300 people trained as verifiers. Organizers are now working to gather details about people who have been detained. They’ve also raised alarm about AI-generated images and the importance of thoroughly investigating each tip before sharing it publicly. 
Portland, Lewiston prep for potential uptick in federal immigration operations

As this work ramps up, communities are taking precautions. Immigrants are staying home. More school absences are being reported. 
Shortly after 9 a.m. Tuesday, Deering High School and Lincoln Middle School in Portland were in a brief lock out, meaning external doors were closed to people entering or leaving, because of potential immigration enforcement activity on Brighton Avenue, district communications coordinator Tess Nacelewicz said. 
Chief of the Penobscot Nation Kirk Francis told tribal citizens to carry their identification when traveling, especially near border regions or transportation hubs. Francis had encouraged this at the start of Trump’s second term, too. Citizens of other tribes have been picked up by ICE elsewhere in the country.
Undercover license plates
The Trump administration has begun relying on unmarked vehicles in immigration enforcement, raising concern about people being able to keep track of those taken by authorities and file legal actions without knowing the agency involved. 
After receiving a request last week from U.S. Customs and Border patrol for undercover license plates, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows paused the issuance of such plates. 
State law permits the use of unmarked vehicles for law enforcement when authorized by the secretary of state. The law also makes it so records for all unmarked vehicle registrations are confidential, therefore Bellows declined to share how many plates were requested. This is the first time Bellows, a Democrat, has paused these plates for federal authorities during her tenure. 
Federal agencies can still request general government plates — which in their case would read “U.S. government.” Those plates are generally identifiable as government vehicles, and in the public registration database, they link back to the place of business for that agency. 
DHS and ICE declined to say how many undercover plates they requested in Maine. 
“DHS is not going to confirm our vehicles and put an even larger target on our officers’ backs,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs like Tren de Aragua and MS-13, criminal rings, murderers, and rapists.”

There have been numerous instances captured on video showing agents in plain clothes not immediately identifying themselves, while arresting people who have no gang association nor criminal history. As of the latest data from November, about 73% of people held in ICE detention have no criminal conviction. And, many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, such as traffic violations.
There have also been cases where federal immigration agents detained U.S. citizens. On Sunday in Minnesota, for example, a U.S. citizen said agents raided his home at gunpoint without a warrant, forcing him outside wearing only shorts in below freezing conditions before detaining him and returning him home later that day without explanation. Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced that they aim to strip more foreign-born Americans of their citizenship. 
McLaughlin claimed their officers are facing a “1300% increase in assaults and 3,200% increase in vehicle attacks against them including domestic terrorists following our officers and ramming them with vehicles.” 
DHS didn’t provide evidence to support those figures, or for similar claims it has made in the past. The number of assaults on ICE agents have increased, but there is no public evidence that the spike is as dramatic as the federal government has claimed.
“There are legitimate reasons for unmarked plates. Law enforcement in Maine use them routinely for undercover, confidential operations,” Bellows said. “Given what’s happening in Minnesota, and what had taken place in Illinois, we paused issuance of those plates until we can get some assurances that Maine plates won’t be used for lawless purposes.” 
In Minnesota, observers have reported ICE and DHS agents switching out and removing license plates on the vehicles they’re using for immigration operations, which is generally against state law. The state has since sued ICE and DHS over that practice, among others. 
Illinois and the city of Chicago also sued federal authorities over this practice, after the state launched a plate watch hotline to give residents a way to report suspected license plate tampering. 
When asked what type of assurance would satisfy lifting the pause in Maine, Bellows said her department would need more information from the federal agencies about why they are needed and what they’d be used for.

Bellows, who is currently running for governor, said on Monday she was doxxed for her decision. She said she received more than two dozen threatening phone calls after her cell phone and home address were posted online. 
Emphasis on nonviolence comes from all corners 
Since local officials announced the suspected uptick in immigration operations, Mainers have peacefully gathered to protest around the state. But, the district’s chief federal prosecutor is still calling for protestors to heed to his warning about violence. At the same time, a so-called militia group with a rallying cry to stop “left-wing violence” is trying to build its ranks.
In Portland, hundreds denounced ICE during a protest on Sunday in Monument Square. In Wells, about 130 people stood out near Route 1 demanding the federal agency leave Maine, an action that corresponded with Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
Local organizers have long been preparing for ICE to arrive, emphasizing that their efforts to verify activity and provide mutual aid are rooted in non-violence and focused on de-escalation tactics. 
“I think there’s a narrative right now that there’s a desire to agitate, but our work really is rooted in non-violence and showing up for community and keeping loving and steady and calming presence,” said Crystal Cron, executive director of Presente! Maine. 
Despite that, on Sunday a group called the “Pine Guard” announced it would be forming to counteract “far-left socialist” ICE critics, including by sending people undercover to anti-ICE actions.
“It is not the role of the Pine Guard to physically confront the far-left Socialists, but instead to expose them,” the group wrote on social media. 
Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Andrew Benson warned Maine protestors on Monday not to interfere with federal immigration enforcement.
Benson, who was nominated by Trump in September and formerly served as a Maine District Court Judge and homicide prosecutor, wrote, “Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property, or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat who is also running for U.S. Senate, has also called for protests to be peaceful — “to meet any hostility with reserve and resolve.”  
Without pointing to specifics, the Maine Law Enforcement Coalition issued a statement Saturday in response to what the group categorized “inﬂammatory political rhetoric and misleading public narratives.”
“Recent portrayals suggesting sudden or extraordinary activity are inaccurate and contribute to unnecessary alarm,” the coalition wrote about federal law enforcement actions. “Political spin and sensational media coverage distract from facts and place officers and community members at greater risk.” 
Increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters by federal agents have been documented under the Trump administration: smashing in car windows, shoving people to the ground, and spraying chemical agents. In some cases, immigration agents are using banned chokeholds that cut off breathing.
On Friday, a federal judge gave a significant victory to Minnesota protesters, granting a preliminary injunction preventing federal officers from retaliating against demonstrators.

(Getty Images)A nursing home owner pardoned by President Donald Trump has been released from an Arkansas prison days after a state board pardoned him.
Joseph Schwartz, who had been serving a state sentence on tax evasion and Medicaid fraud charges, was released on Tuesday morning. 
Schwartz had been ordered last month to prison to serve out his sentence on state Medicaid fraud and tax evasion charges. The Arkansas Post Prison Transfer Board last week granted him parole.
Schwartz, of New York, was three months into a three-year federal sentence for tax fraud when Trump pardoned him in November. 
Schwartz pleaded guilty in 2024 in federal court for his role in a $38 million tax fraud scheme involving nursing homes he owned across the country.
Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin filed a petition last month seeking that Schwartz serve out the rest of his state sentence.
“Joseph Schwartz returned to Arkansas on December 29 to serve the remainder of time he owed the state per his plea agreements, and he followed state procedures in seeking parole, which was granted by the Arkansas Post Prison Transfer Board,” Jeff LeMaster, a spokesperson for Griffin’s office, said in a statement. “While he has been released, he will still be required to pay the restitution he owes as part of his plea agreements, and we will continue working to ensure he does.” 
Schwartz had also been ordered to pay the state in restitution and fees. Kevin Marino, an attorney for Schwartz, said Schwartz has been making regular payments and has paid $400,000 toward that amount and the attorney general’s office said he still owes about $1.4 million.
Schwartz, who is also a rabbi, provided spiritual counseling to some inmates during his brief time in Arkansas prison and had received letters from them thanking him, Marino said.
“If there was some good that came from this, that’s what it was: that was that Rabbi Schwartz was able to be of service and assistance to those in need,” Marino said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Judge-with-gavel-1024x758.jpg,,,2026-01-20 17:56:50.038531

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A bill requiring teachers to take an oath to the Florida and U.S. constitutions, and to non-partisanship, was temporarily postponed in advance of its first committee hearing Tuesday.
Teachers would have to take constitutional oath under newly proposed bill

SB 430, sponsored by Jacksonville Republican Sen. Clay Yarborough requiring Florida College System and State University System instructors and K-12 school personnel to swear the oath, has an uncertain fate.
Yarborough told the Florida Phoenix after the Education Pre-K-12 meeting that he lacked the votes to pass the bill through the committee.
The panel comprises five Republicans, including Yarborough, and three Democrats. All senators were present.
The bill is similar to Rep. Tom Fabricio’s bill, HB 147, but goes further by requiring the oath for higher education instructors whereas Fabricio’s is limited to K-12.
Chapter 876 of Florida Statutes already requires state employees, including those serving on school boards and working for the state and county school districts and institutions of higher education, to swear that they are citizens of Florida and will support the U.S. and Florida constitutions.
Other states require oaths to federal and state constitutions, including California, Georgia, and New York. According to Encyclopedia.com, almost two-thirds of states since 1863 have adopted teacher loyalty oaths.
The House version of the bill is in the Student Academic Success Subcommittee, but not on the panel’s next meeting agenda.
This is the second week of the Legislature’s 60-day session.



The proposed oath:
“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support, protect, and defend the Constitution and Government of the United States and the Constitution and Government of the State of Florida; that I am duly qualified for employment as a member of the school personnel in this state; that I will well and faithfully perform the duties of a member of the school in a professional, independent, objective, and nonpartisan manner; that I will uphold the highest standards of academic integrity, and professional ethics; that I will foster a respectful learning environment for all students which promotes critical thinking, civic responsibility, and lifelong learning; and that I will serve as a positive role model in both conduct and character, so help me God.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7919-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 17:56:50.038531

The brunt of the storm is expected to hit Friday and continue through the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. Some will see low temperatures in the single digits. 
As of Tuesday afternoon, the National Weather Service was predicting over 6 inches of snow in central parts of the state, and a glaze of ice south of Interstate 40.
OG&E has both coal and natural gas fuel in storage for the upcoming cold snap, the company said Tuesday.
“Exreme cold can result in higher demand for electricity,” the company said. “All available units at OG&E’s power plants will be in operation during the event and ready to support the grid. The Southwest Power Pool will dispatch power generation as needed to meet electricity demand.”
PSO has winterized critical assets, upgraded equipment and strengthened fuel supply for power plants since Winter Storm Uri, the company said.
The company said its generating operating reserve margins, which are set by the Southwest Power Pool, have increased since 2021 to ensure reliable service. The Southwest Power Pool manages the electric grid for states across the central United States.
“These ongoing efforts reflect PSO’s commitment to maintaining a resilient system and keeping customers safe, supported, and connected during Oklahoma’s toughest winter weather.”
In February 2021, Winter Storm Uri caused power outages, infrastructure problems and created an unusually high demand for natural gas.
Public utilities reported that natural gas prices jumped nearly 40,000%, which left Oklahoma consumers with over $4.5 billion in unexpected energy costs.
In an effort to mitigate the financial impact on consumers, OG&E, PSO and Oklahoma Natural Gas, received permission from the Corporation Commission to pass the costs onto consumers through a monthly surcharge that is expected to last nearly 30 years.
Consumers would have had to pay much more immediately to cover the cost without the securitization process.
Carson Cunningham, Oklahoma Natural Gas public relations manager, said Tuesday that the company prepares year-round for winter weather.
“As cooler temperatures move into Oklahoma, ONG is prepared to deliver natural gas safely and reliably,” he said.
Utility companies are encouraging residents to have an emergency kit including flashlights, non-perishable food, water and first-aid supplies.
Residents are asked to stay away from downed power lines and ensure smoke, carbon monoxide and methane detectors are installed and working properly. 
Meanwhile, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation will start putting down brine in some locations Tuesday night, said Emily Long, a spokesperson.
“Brine is used for pre-treating roadways just before a storm when conditions permit to assist in melting the ice from underneath,” Long said. “Once the storm hits, we use a salt and sand mixture. However, these are less effective when temps fall below 15 degrees. Our crews will switch to using 100% sand applications.”
The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority will be pre-treating all turnpike bridges and elevated surfaces between Tuesday night and Thursday afternoon, said Lisa Shearer-Salim, a spokesperson.
“Crews are closely watching forecasts for their areas across the state and will be ready to deploy with salt and sand trucks well in advance of significant precipitation,” she said.
Motorists are encouraged to prepare their vehicles ahead of travel in inclement weather, she said.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)The Trump administration has sued another state — Virginia — in its quest to obtain sensitive voter data, despite two recent legal setbacks in suits against other states.
The Justice Department on Friday sued Susan Beals, the elections commissioner in Virginia, after months of seeking a copy of the state’s voter registration lists, including individual names, addresses, dates of birth and Social Security numbers.
“Virginia becomes the next state sued for ignoring federal law!” U.S. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon wrote on the social media platform X.
The Trump administration has sued more than 20 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, in what the administration frames as a quest to ensure that states are properly maintaining voter rolls, that ineligible people are kept off rolls and that only citizens are voting.
Federal courts deny Trump request for private voter data in 2 states

The U.S. Department of Justice is sharing state voter roll information with the Department of Homeland Security in a search for noncitizens, the Trump administration confirmed in September.
While election officials stress that well-maintained voter rolls are important, President Donald Trump and some of his Republican allies have long promoted baseless claims of widespread voter fraud.
In the Virginia case, the Justice Department claims it was reassured by the administration of former Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin that it would hand over voter rolls. But that did not occur and Youngkin was term-limited. On Saturday, Democrat Abigail Spanberger was sworn in as Virginia’s 75th governor.
Beals, the elections commissioner, was appointed by Youngkin in 2022. The state election department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last week, similar federal lawsuits hit roadblocks in California and Oregon.
U.S. District Court Judge David Carter dismissed a lawsuit by the Department of Justice against California seeking voter information, calling the request “unprecedented and illegal.” Just a day earlier, a separate federal judge said from the bench he planned to dismiss a similar lawsuit against Oregon.
Democratic secretaries of state have criticized the federal government’s data requests, calling them an unwarranted attempt by the Trump administration to exercise federal power over elections. Under the U.S. Constitution, states administer elections, though Congress can regulate them.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)A committee of state Senate Democrats on Tuesday discussed a proposal to require Pennsylvania employers to provide 24 hours of paid leave for “small necessities” each year. The goal is to ensure employees who take care of family members like children or elderly parents are able to attend medical appointments, school activities, or respond to unexpected emergencies.
“This is legislation that gets at the key question: ‘What is work life balance?’” Sen. Art Haywood (D-Montgomery), the bill’s sponsor, said. “Employees are not just workers. They are also family members.”
The bill is based on a law that passed in Massachusetts, though it does not go as far as family leave policies implemented in states including New Jersey and California, according to panelists who testified on Tuesday. 
The proposal has yet to be introduced and exact language has not been released publicly, but a memo seeking co-sponsors was issued last December.
Lonnie Golden, a professor of economics and labor-human resources at Penn State and one of the panelists, said it will benefit both workers and bosses.
“There’s some evidence that it improves workers’ job satisfaction, so as a result of that [employers] are more likely to retain senior, experienced staff,” Golden said. 
However, Golden noted that there can be downsides for employers, especially when one member of a small team needs time off.

Blake Emmanuel, the director of advocacy and policy at the Fund for Women and Girls, said the policy could be especially beneficial for women in the workforce, who are more likely to be primary caretakers for their families as well.
“From a women’s issue perspective, we know that women fulfill the majority of caretaking roles,” Emmanuel said. “Data supplied by the U.S. Department of Labor found that women need to take more leave for family or medical reasons — 24% — versus men, who need to take 17%, and they still have even more unmet needs.”
Emmanuel, who is a mother of children with disabilities, said such a policy would have benefitted her greatly when her children were in school, and she often attended multiple meetings there each month.
Wallace Weaver, a spokesperson for Haywood, said the bill’s language is still being fine tuned, which includes answering questions such as which employers will be required to provide leave and exactly what circumstances will qualify as “small necessities.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_6093-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-20 17:56:50.038531

Senate File 2033 would, if passed, require the Iowa Board of Regents to establish rules stating universities must require three-credit-hour, general education courses in American history and government for graduation, and provide credits for students transferring with similar courses already under their belt.
The board of regents would also need to review all general education requirements and core curricula for a report due to the General Assembly by the end of 2026.
The bill advanced from a three-member Senate Education subcommittee Tuesday.

The Center for Intellectual Freedom at the University of Iowa, Center for Cyclone Civics at Iowa State University and Center for Civic Education at the University of Northern Iowa would be required to create courses satisfying the new general education requirements, as well as establish ongoing lecture and debate series. They would also have to submit annual reports of their achievements and the opportunities, challenges and obstacles they’ve faced to the board of regents, General Assembly and governor.
Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Jason Chapman, echoing comments he made during the subcommittee on the legislation’s House companion bill, House Study Bill 543, said the board is registered undecided on the bill but has concerns about transfer credits and how they’ll work with high school, community college and international students.
Connie Ryan, Interfaith Alliance of Iowa executive director and lobbyist for the organization’s action fund, also reiterated her concerns on the House bill, that it is an overreach of the Legislature that will negatively impact students as higher education costs continue to rise. She also said there should be allocations provided by the state to the centers of civic education if the Legislature expects them to develop and put on ongoing lecture and debate series.
Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, said no one questions the fact that American history and government are “clearly very important” topics, but requiring them as part of general education would be a huge lift for colleges, in terms of both finances and manpower.
“We don’t know how we’re going to pay for this, and we don’t know how we’re going to staff this,” Quirmbach said, “I think that there’s a real problem there.”
Looking at just ISU, where Quirmbach taught for nearly 30 years, he said the two courses would need to accommodate as many as 13,200 students every year. With large courses of 200 students, there would need to be 66 sections of the two courses, which would lead to the need to hire at least 17 new faculty members to teach them.
Factoring in their pay and benefits, and those of the teaching assistants who would work with them, Quirmbach said it would cost ISU more than $3 million to implement these courses. For all three universities, Quirmbach said the total cost would come in at around $6.6 million.
That’s assuming the faculty and teaching assistants needed to take on these new courses could be recruited to do the job, he said.
Quirmbach also raised questions about language in the bill prohibiting courses focused on the study of “subgroups of Americans or other nationalities,” he said, and the fact that this mandate would be at the college level and only for universities governed by the Iowa Board of Regents.
Subcommittee chair, and filer of the legislation, Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott, did not answer a question by Quirmbach to define what a subgroup is, saying the discussion could be saved for the Senate floor or after the subcommittee meeting.
As males are a minority population in the U.S., Quirmbach said under the rules of this legislation, an American history course “that is primarily dominated by white males would not satisfy the requirement here.”
“It seems that in order to satisfy this requirement, you have to involve, God forbid, the word diversity,” Quirmbach said. “And if that’s your intent, that’s fine with me, but I think we need a definition of subgroups before we can really pass judgment on this proposition.”
Gruenhagen and Sen. Mike Pike, R-Des Moines, had no comment on the legislation, but Gruenhagen said he would be moving the bill to the full Senate Education Committee to consider.

Friday is “ICE Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth & Freedom” — a statewide pause of daily activity to “stand together against the actions of the federal government against the state of Minnesota,” according to the website.
Demonstrators will march and rally in downtown Minneapolis Friday starting at 2 p.m.
Citing the killing of Renee Good by federal agent Johnathan Ross, the “ICE Out” day organizers say the general strike is intended to be a day of nonviolent reflection.
“It is time to suspend the normal order of business to demand immediate cessation of ICE actions in MN, accountability for federal agents who have caused loss of life and abuse to Minnesota residents and call for Congress to immediately intervene,” the website states.
Dozens of businesses, restaurants and co-ops in the Twin Cities are planning to close Friday, according to Bring Me the News, which is keeping a running list.
The strike is endorsed by ISAIAH, the nonprofit coalition of Minnesota faith and community groups, and numerous unions including the local teachers unions of Minneapolis and St. Paul public schools.
Minneapolis Public Schools will have no school Friday for a teacher record-keeping day, according to the district. St. Paul Public Schools has not yet canceled school, but the St. Paul Federation of Educators is supporting “ICE Out” day.
The Minnesota Nurses Association, which represents over 22,000 nurses and other health care professionals, said it supports the general strike Friday, but it’s encouraging nurses to keep working since their union contract has “no-strike” provisions.
Service Employees International Union, which represents nearly 2 million workers across the country, said many of its members across the country will protest in solidarity with Minnesota. 
“When we look at Minneapolis — the violence, the cruelty that’s being brought by this federal government against working people — it is now more than ever that we have to stand together, regardless of our differences,” said David Huerta, president of SEIU-United Service Workers West and SEIU California, in a statement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_2597-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 17:56:50.038531

(Photo by Alex Baumhardt/Oregon Capital Chronicle)A sitting county controller and U.S. House candidate maintains that a federal agency hasn’t paid its rent to Lehigh County since 2022, despite occupying office space owned by the government body. 
Mark Pinsley, the Lehigh County controller, announced Tuesday that Homeland Security Investigations — which falls within the broader Immigration and Customs Enforcement framework at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — owes the county $115,426, not including late fees of $7,600.
“I don’t think as a county government we should be supporting anything like that,” said Pinsley. “We should deport ICE out of our building so that we’re not associated … We should be supporting our residents in every way that we can.” 
Following Pinsley’s findings, newly elected county executive Josh Siegel said he would move to “evict” federal agents, according to the Morning Call.

Pinsley’s held his position since 2020 and ran unsuccessfully for state auditor general in 2024. He’s now in a crowded Democratic primary to challenge first-term U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, a Republican aligned with President Donald Trump. The Lehigh Valley’s 7th District is a perennial toss-up and closely watched by politicos nationwide.
He spoke to the Capital-Star Tuesday ahead of the announcement, tying a recommendation to issue an eviction notice with a repudiation of the federal agency’s recent actions in Minnesota and beyond. 
The outsized presence of federal officials in Minneapolis has increased city tensions, prompting protests, mass arrests and networks of private citizens countering agency actions. A recent CBS News/YouGov poll found the majority believe ICE was being “too tough,” while 54% of those interviewed believed that immigration officer Jonathan Ross was “not justified” in the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.
Neither Homeland Security nor ICE immediately responded to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon.
 Lehigh County isn’t among the agencies in the commonwealth that has a formal agreement to help ICE with immigration enforcement. The county’s policy is to cooperate with the agency “to the fullest extent legally possible.”
 What happened?

In late 2022, Homeland Security Investigations signaled an intent to lease the fourth floor of Allentown’s Hamilton Financial Center, a 10-story building owned by Lehigh County. First, the two government agencies would sign a Memorandum of Agreement for ten months, followed by a three-year lease from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 31, 2026. 
The former would net the county $29,250 while the latter would bring in another $111,745, according to an agreement attached to a Board of Commissioners meeting agenda from November 2022. 
bill 2022-43
Commissioners didn’t spend more than five minutes discussing the agreement during its first reading on Nov. 9, 2022 or its final vote on Nov. 22, 2022. 
“I think this would be a great opportunity with the county and Homeland Security and give us the opportunity to welcome them into our county,” said sponsoring commissioner Zakiya Smalls at the latter meeting. 
But only the first document ever got the required signature from HSI, while the lease remained unsigned. 
“Normally, once a contract gets signed, it goes into our computer system and then we know to expect revenue,” said Pinsley. “In this case, that never happened because it was never signed.”
Pinsley reported that the federal government told him that Special Agent in Charge William S. Walker “lacked proper authority” to sign the memorandum. At the time, media described Walker as a deputy special agent for Homeland in Philadelphia who oversaw investigations into sex and drug trafficking. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to his LinkedIn, Walker was working as an acting assistant director when he left the agency in September 2025 to become a senior vice president at an anti-trafficking nonprofit.
Lehigh County’s Pinsley said that a tip to his office following a recent administration change at the county level brought the lack of payment to the forefront as the federal agency explores a new lease past the expiration of the original proposal — which he said could be signed with ICE, not HSI. 
“I don’t think we should be housing HSI at all. It’s being run by (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security) Kristi Noem, who I have no respect for,” Pinsley said. “I don’t care if they call it HSI or ICE. It doesn’t matter what the name is.”
Two of Pennsylvania’s 19 U.S. House members signed onto an effort to impeach Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, last week. Noem has repeatedly defended her agency’s actions, backtracking after initially claiming officers weren’t using chemical weapons like pepper spray against protesters. The effort would need Republican support, since the party holds the majority in both the House and Senate. 
 Next steps

Pinsley said he is “hopeful that we will be able to collect the money that is owed.”
“Ultimately, they did reside in our county and it was never meant to be free, and so they should have to pay,” said Pinsley. “I believe they should have to pay market rate, which is definitely above” the rate included under the unsigned lease.
Pinsley said he would also recommend that the county launch a database allowing locals to report alleged ICE misdeeds, such as the physical altercations or damage to personal property reported in Minneapolis.
He additionally called for “stability” in the nation’s immigration system that didn’t change from administration to administration, as well as a “path to citizenship” for “someone who’s been working here ten years and is paying taxes and is a good neighbor.”
“When (President Donald Trump) was talking about this, he was talking about violent felons. But we’re not going after violent felons — they’re going after grandma now,” said Pinsley. “And when they’re doing that, they’re causing a lot of fear. They’re tear gassing people; they’re using pepper balls; they’re putting on masks in American cities. I have no tolerance for that.”
According to December data analyzed by the New York Times, one-third of immigrants arrested by ICE have no history of criminal charges, compared to 7% with violent convictions.
In contrast, Mackenzie offered his support to ICE agents during a public appearance last week, telling the Lehigh Valley News that in the Good shooting, “When situations are in the heat of the moment, law enforcement has to take proper actions to keep themselves safe. That’s what this individual did.”
Democrats are targeting Mackenzie’s swing district seat in their effort to flip control of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Along with Pinsley, six other Democrats are running for a chance to challenge Mackenzie:

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., will once again seek reelection to keep her seat in the U.S. Senate, according to campaign filings with the West Virginia Secretary of State’s office.
Capito filed her reelection paperwork with the office on Tuesday. So far, state Sen. Tom Willis, R-Berkeley, and Janet McNulty, a children’s author from Martinsburg, West Virginia, have also filed to run as Republicans and challenge Capito for her seat.
Capito was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2014. Before that, she held several terms in the U.S. House of Representatives — 2000 to 2015 — where she served the state’s 2nd congressional district.
The daughter of former West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore, Capito began her political career representing Kanawha County in the state House of Delegates for two terms, from 1996 to 2000.
Her election in 2014 was the first time in 56 years that a Republican was elected to represent West Virginia in the U.S. Senate. She is the first woman from any party to hold the position in the state.
Capito shared on social media this week that more than 50 members of the state House of Delegates have endorsed her bid for reelection. In the Senate — where her primary opponent Willis holds office — at least 14 current members have done the same.
Willis, an attorney and businessman by trade, has yet to complete his first term in the statehouse. A Hedgesville native, he describes himself as a “Christian Constitutional Conservative.” Last month, Senate President Randy Smith named Willis to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Willis was elected to the state Senate in November 2024 to represent the fifth district, which includes portions of Berkeley, Morgan and Hampshire counties. Ahead of the general election, Willis unseated longtime Republican Senate President Craig Blair in the 2024 primary. Blair had held his seat for 12 years.
To date, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, Capito has nearly $4 million on hand for her reelection campaign. Willis so far has raised a little more than $200,000. McNulty reports about $300, per the FEC. 
On the Democratic side, Zach Shrewsbury — who lost his previous senatorial bid after being defeated by former Wheeling Mayor Glenn Elliott in the 2024 Democratic primary — reports having nearly $150,000 on hand. Rio Phillips, a community organizer also running as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate, has nearly $7,000, per the FEC.

Sold for $56 million, Lincoln County’s Pawnee Springs Ranch on Tuesday became the latest investment for Mark and Robyn Jones of Westlake, Texas. The high school sweethearts with a growing family of six kids and 20 grandchildren said they were seeking to diversify their business ventures.
Among other key holdings is part ownership of Goosehead Insurance, a public company the Joneses founded and grew, and a sprawling forested timberland ranch the pair bought a few years ago in Montana. 
“What we wanted to do is have a sizable operation that focuses on actual agricultural production,” Mark Jones said in an interview days ago on his 64th birthday. “The Sandhills quickly jumped to the top of the list.”
 

Ranch features
Mark Johnson of Hall and Hall, which handles ag real estate in nine states, said Pawnee Springs Ranch “exemplifies the top qualities of a Nebraska Sandhills river ranch.” Among its features:

Nearly six miles of North Platte River frontage and nine center pivots covering about 1,700 irrigated acres.
Calf backgrounding lots with concrete bunks, an indoor/outdoor arena.
Balanced ecosystem with fertile river bottoms and native Sandhills rangeland providing habitat for deer, turkey and waterfowl.




Drawn by the property’s 2,500 mother cows, wildlife habitat, native range, river corridors and other ag benefits of the Ogallala Aquifer, Jones said the search led them to the Nebraska ranchland east of North Platte, whose name harkens to the area’s original Native American inhabitants.
 Famed ownership roots

Hall and Hall, an ag focused multi-state real estate company based in Valentine, represented both the buyer and seller in the private listing deal, with local agent Mark Johnson serving as listing broker. 
When Hall and Hall represented owners of the Nebraska Metzger ranch last year, the asking price for that 55,136-acre property was $50 million, an amount brokers described then as possible state record for a ranch sale. Johnson said the Metzger family ultimately decided to keep the Cherry County multigenerational ranch and work through the family dynamics. 
Publicly available documents show that the Gottsch Feeding Corp. sold Pawnee Springs Land and Cattle LLC Tuesday for $56 million.
“It’s the largest total dollar ranch sale we’ve been able to determine from any records we could find,” Johnson said. 
Among past owners of the Pawnee Springs property, which dates back to 1918, are names that ring familiar to Nebraska business and social circles. A former Nebraska governor, Keith Neville, was a previous owner. Construction titan Peter Kiewit bought the operation in 1949. He once told the North Platte Telegraph that the ranch derived its name from the natural springs that flowed.

The family behind Gottsch Feeding Corp. started leasing in 1985 and eventually purchased the ranch. In a statement regarding Tuesday’s sale, the Gottsches said “with a heavy heart” it agreed to sell a ranch that has been part of their family for 41 years.
“With three generations being a part of the spring brandings, summer grass and fall/winter backgroundings, Pawnee has shaped many lives,” the Gottsches said, offering special thanks to the Boeshart family caretakers and to neighbors who pitched in to help during branding season. “Those memories will always be cherished.”
The Gottsch statement said its family business footprint spans Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and Texas, and its commitment stretches seven decades of “bridging the gap between ranching, high-tech feedlot management and sustainable farming.”
 ‘Long-term commitment’ 

Under the new ownership, Pawnee Springs for the most part will maintain current operations, said Ryan Langston, son-in-law to Jones and new CEO of the ranch. That includes raising calves from birth to weaning and returning them to grass as yearlings, as well as running ag pivots.

Three cowboys who now live and work on the ranch will stay, Langston said, and a new manager is to be hired to replace the current one who he said is moving on with the Gottsches.
“We are making a long-term commitment to the area,” Langston said. “We intend to hire local talent where possible, partner with our neighbors and make meaningful contributions to the local community.”
Known also for philanthropy, the Joneses in 2021 donated $101 million to the Montana State University nursing program — the home state of the scenic Flathead Ridge Ranch they bought that year. The couple told the university news service their intention was to help address one of the most defining challenges of the time: access to health care, particularly for residents of rural and remote areas.
The university at the time called it the largest ever donation to a college of nursing and the largest private gift in the state’s history.

Regarding the Nebraska purchase, Jones told the Examiner he and his wife hope it is the first of more acquisitions in the region. He said they were eager to invest in and build a “large-scale, truly world-class beef production operation … that in its most fundamental form is converting grass to protein.” 
He sees the family’s focus being in Nebraska, Kansas, Wyoming and Montana. The Pawnee Springs operation, he said, “will be a platform we can build onto.”
As a commercial enterprise, the Nebraska tract differs from the Jones’ 125,000-acre alpine ranch in Montana, which they refer to as a “family legacy investment.” Jones said he and his wife have tried to continue that property’s historical use by keeping the vast majority open to public recreation.
There, he said, “our objective is really to conserve the land. It’s been fairly heavily logged … So we’re very focused on nursing the forest back to optimal health.” 
 ‘Jones has lost his mind’ 

The Joneses are not planning to live in Nebraska, but hope to be “active participants” in the local community.
Said Jones: “You should expect us to have a very real and ongoing presence and engagement with the community.”

The couple’s fortune is built upon a relationship that started as teens in Alberta, Canada. Married young and with their first few kids, Jones said he enrolled in college in the mid-1980s. In 1989, the family moved to Boston so he could attend Harvard Business School.
“Robyn was pregnant at that time with our fifth daughter. I believe that we still hold the record for the greatest number of kids for any Harvard Business School student,” Jones said with a chuckle.
He worked several years at Bain global management consulting firm. Robyn went from stay-at-home mom to work that led her to establish the insurance company the couple continued to grow together, after her husband made a job switch.
“When I told my partners (at Bain) I was leaving, they all laughed,” Jones recalled. “They thought, ‘This Jones has lost his mind.’ But you know, we’re very comfortable with people laughing at us.”
The Joneses remain chair and vice chair of Goosehead, a large national insurance broker that connects people with various home, auto, flood and other insurance carriers. Forbes estimates the couple’s combined net worth at $2 billion, and included Robyn on a 2025 list of America’s richest “self-made” women entrepreneurs, noting a net worth for her of $1.2 billion.

An appealing part of the Nebraska ranch purchase, said Jones, whose early jobs included laying pipe and driving a truck, was the opportunity to have their grandkids work there. 
“We want our grandkids to learn and see the value of hard work,” he said.
He said his dealings with the sellers reflected an integrity he equates to the ranching operation.
“These are the kind of people we love to do business with,” he said.

Photographs by John Partipilo/ Tennessee LookoutA second-term Metro Councilmember announced on Tuesday she will run for Nashville mayor in 2027, challenging incumbent Freddie O’Connell. 
Joy Styles, who represents South Nashville’s District 32, said the city is suffering from a lack of leadership.  
“I’m here today to tell you that the needs of all Nashvillians are not being met,” said Styles. 
She made her announcement from Global Mall — the former Hickory Hollow Mall that was repurposed to include a community center and library — and said the O’Connell administration has failed to make sufficient investment in the facility, which sat vacant for years. 
Styles worked with the administration of prior Mayor John Cooper to begin redeveloping it.
“This mayor has made massive investments into (Nashville’s) East Bank, which I like to call the ‘invisible city,’ because no one lives there yet,” Styles said. “We could be investing in this site.” 
Metro Council approved the $44 million purchase of the mall in 2022, when Cooper’s original idea included renting a portion of the property to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, though Cooper did not secure a legally binding agreement with VUMC before the vote. A formal agreement with Vanderbilt never came to pass. Demolition of the mall’s interior began in 2024, and a public comment period for the city’s plans for the building began that summer.
The city is expected to conduct a transportation infrastructure study of the area this year to inform plans for a WeGo transit center.
The East Bank development plan was also created under the Cooper administration. 
Styles has taken issue with O’Connell’s leadership and decisions his administration has made on several issues since he was elected as mayor in 2023. 
She advocated for an investigation of Metro’s Office of Emergency Management amid claims of harassment by Director Steve Martini, who was recently placed on leave after a report substantiated the claims. 
During her first term, she pushed for the creation of the Nashville Music, Film and Entertainment Commission.
Styles has also been the subject of two ethics complaints, and a Metro Human Resources report finding she behaved inappropriately towards employees of the Metro Arts Commission during a 2024 period of upheaval. 
O’Connell is expected to run for reelection but with the election more than 18 months away, has not formally announced. 
West Nashville activist Lou Wilbanks has also said she will run to be Nashville’s chief executive.
Styles has a bachelor’s degree from Wellesley College and a master’s degree from Purdue University. She has worked in the entertainment industry since moving to Nashville in 2006.

WILMINGTON, Del. — Avelo Airlines is extending its flight schedule at Wilmington Airport through the peak summer travel season in 2026, giving Delaware Valley travelers more time to plan vacations with low-cost, nonstop options from a newly upgraded regional airport.
The airline announced Tuesday that flights from Wilmington Airport (ILG) are now available for booking through Aug. 18, 2026, with one-way fares starting at $52, available at AveloAir.com.
“It’s time to start planning summer travel, and we are excited to extend Avelo’s ILG flight schedule through August 2026,” said Trevor Yealy, Avelo’s head of commercial operations, in a statement. “With Avelo’s affordable fares and industry-leading reliability, it’s the perfect time for travelers to get a start on booking their summer vacations or weekend getaways.”
From its Wilmington base, Avelo will continue summer service to eight leisure-focused destinations popular with families, retirees, and regional travelers:


Fort Lauderdale, Florida (FLL)


Fort Myers, Florida (RSW)


Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (MYR)


Orlando, Florida (MCO)


Lakeland, Florida (LAL)


San Juan, Puerto Rico (SJU)


Tampa, Florida (TPA)


Wilmington, North Carolina (ILM)


The extended flight schedule comes as major renovations at Wilmington Airport near completion, marking a significant milestone in the airport’s transformation into a modern, passenger-friendly regional hub. The upgrades include expanded terminal space, improved amenities, and enhanced passenger flow, designed to support increased service while maintaining the airport’s reputation for convenience and ease of travel.
Local and regional leaders have increasingly pointed to the airport’s growth as a quality-of-life benefit for New Castle County, offering residents easier access to nonstop leisure destinations, reduced travel stress, and a practical alternative to larger, more congested airports. The combination of expanded air service and modernized facilities is expected to strengthen the county’s appeal to families, businesses, and visitors alike.
Avelo has positioned Wilmington Airport as a convenient alternative to larger regional airports, emphasizing nonstop routes, shorter security lines, and lower parking costs. The ILG location serves travelers from Delaware, southeastern Pennsylvania, and southern New Jersey.
Founded in 2021, Avelo Airlines operates a fleet of Boeing Next Generation 737 aircraft and serves more than 30 destinations nationwide. The company plans to become the first U.S. airline to operate Embraer 195-E2 aircraft beginning in 2028, with an order of up to 100 planes.
In addition to Wilmington, Avelo operates base locations at Tweed-New Haven Airport in Connecticut, Lakeland International Airport in Florida, and Concord-Padgett Regional Airport near Charlotte, North Carolina.

Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, of Madison, pleaded not guilty to an arson charge Tuesday during his first in-person appearance in court.
The Beth Israel Congregation synagogue in northeast Jackson was heavily damaged in the Jan. 10 predawn fire. Pittman was indicted five days later on the federal charge of using fire to maliciously damage or destroy a building involved in interstate commerce.
Pittman – who usually goes by his middle name – made his first appearance in federal court on Jan. 12 after authorities filed a sworn statement about charges he could face. He appeared then by video conference from a hospital where he was being treated for burns.
Attorneys went back and forth Tuesday over whether Pittman committed a “crime of violence,” a legal standard permitting the government to detain a defendant pre-trial, when he allegedly burned the synagogue 
U.S. Magistrate Court Judge LaKeysha Greer Isaac did not rule on that argument, but she found the prosecution had shown that Pittman posed a threat to prospective witnesses, particularly his parents. The judge did not deem Pittman a flight risk, due to his third-degree burns and lack of discernable income. 
Though his name does not appear on the docket, the U.S. Marshals Service is holding Pittman at the Madison County detention center, a spokesperson told Mississippi Today. He appeared in court Tuesday wearing an orange jumpsuit, with both hands heavily bandaged except for his right thumb. 
Pittman was indicted on state and federal arson charges last week after he allegedly broke into the synagogue, doused the lobby in gasoline and set it on fire.

Gov. Jim Pillen named Larsen the permanent Department of Economic Development director in November. She had served as interim director since July following former director K.C. Belitz’ resignation. Prior to her appointment, Larsen served as Pillen’s general counsel and deputy director of his Policy Research Office.

Larsen, speaking before the Nebraska Legislature’s Banking, Commerce and Insurance Committee, spoke on the possibility of a merger when she was asked about the state’s lagging tourism revenues. According to Tourism Commission data, state and county lodging taxes dipped by about $1 million in 2025, compared to 2024 collections.
Larsen argued that consolidating the agencies would mean tourism initiatives would have a larger budget and more marketing resources to pull from, and DED has the capacity to utilize grant funding for tourism efforts. She noted that prior to 2012, the two agencies were one in the same.
“If you’re trying to recruit businesses, if you’re trying to recruit that talent to keep people in Nebraska, tourism is a giant component of that,” Larsen said.
Committee Chair State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte, who introduced an interim study Tuesday to examine the potential impacts of merging the agencies, asked Larsen if she knew why the agencies split in 2012. Larsen, though she wasn’t in state government at the time, said it was her understanding that lawmakers didn’t believe DED was doing an effective job of handling tourism.
Larsen also was asked about downsizing at DED during Larsen’s leadership. Between September and November, at least 22 workers exited the department, and more high-ranking officials have left since then.
DED’s housing director resigned in December, and its deputy director Joe Fox plans to resign within the next two weeks, as confirmed by multiple sources.
When first asked by the Examiner in November, department spokesman Justin Pinkerman said in an email that “DED has had 0 layoffs/reductions in force.” He did note that the department “has had voluntary departures in that time” but did not specify how many.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Former DED deputy director of operations Joe Lauber, who was laid off over the summer, said there were signs of budget cuts impacting DED prior to his termination, like hiring freezes and directives to stop travel. He said during a management meeting he attended, then-interim director Larsen shared that it was the governor’s goal to reduce the size of DED through attrition.
Agencies often do this by not filling positions people vacate through retirements and having or encouraging people to leave on their own. Lauber said the state implemented strategies such as Pillen’s return-to-work order and enforcing a strict 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. work schedule in hopes of getting people to consider whether they wanted to keep working for the department. Lauber said employees were not allowed to end their days earlier than 4:30 p.m.
Larsen addressed the return-to-work policy at Tuesday’s hearing, saying that after she entered DED she realized that many employees were still working from home, and she enforced the policy to hold the staff accountable to the governor’s order so “everybody was on the same playing field.”
“I would never ask anyone else to work more than I do, or work in a place that I wouldn’t,” Larsen said.
Larsen said the downsizing can largely be attributed to high turnover, which she said is normal for DED, and an intentional winding down of pandemic-era programs. She said DED received an influx of cash during the COVID-19 pandemic — to the tune of about $900 million — which created several new programs that are now concluding.
Pinkerman shared data showing that between 2020 to 2023, the department’s full-time staff grew by about 10-15 people per year. It reached a peak of about 114 filled full-time positions on June 30, 2025, which dropped down to around 90 by the end of November.
“As DED winds down pandemic-era economic recovery programs and identifies greater operational efficiencies, not all positions that come open are being filled,” Pinkerman said in an email.

Montana plaintiffs and their attorneys pose outside the courtroom for photos halfway through the trial. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)After the Montana Supreme Court rejected a request by 16 young plaintiffs to hear a challenge to several 2025 laws that allegedly violate the youths’ constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment, the lawsuit has been refiled in district court.
Held v. State of Montana II, filed last week in Montana’s First Judicial District Court under Judge Kathy Seeley, is challenging the constitutionality of a series of bills passed by the 2025 Republican-led Legislature as a direct response to the ruling.
Held II involves 13 youth from the historic constitutional climate lawsuit Held v. State, in which Seeley and the state Supreme Court found there is a state right to a clean and healthful environmental, including a stable climate system. Three additional Montana youth have joined the sequel case.
Rikki Held, the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuits, said the young people are essentially “forced” back to court because the state continues to ignore the constitution and the supreme court’s ruling recognizing the right to a stable climate.
“In the 2025 legislative session, our state passed new laws limiting review of climate impacts and preventing state agencies from using environmental review information to deny or limit new permits for fossil fuel development,” Held said in a press release. “Since these laws have been in place, 44 new fossil fuel projects have moved forward unchecked, exacerbating the harms we are already living with including wildfire smoke, precipitation variability, drought, and polluted rivers and lands.”
During a signing ceremony a signing ceremony for five bills that altered the Montana Environmental Policy Act and Montana Clean Air Act in response to the Held decision, Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, R-Savage, said the lawsuit had tried to “twist MEPA into something it was never meant to be — a tool to deny permits and block development.”
The new petition against the state, Gov. Greg Gianforte, and the Department of Environmental Quality, seeks to overturn three laws passed last year — House Bills 285 and 291, as well as Senate Bill 221.
In a statement provided to the Daily Montanan when the petition was originally filed with the Supreme Court in December, Ler said the “activists are using the courts to achieve outcomes they cannot win through the legislative process,” undermining the separation of powers in Montana.
Ler sponsored House Bill 285, which passed along party lines. He said it was designed to provide clarity and efficiency to MEPA.
While the law adds a mechanism for agencies to conduct greenhouse gas analysis of proposed actions, it emphasizes MEPA is a tool for assessing environmental impacts without regulatory teeth.
It specifically states that “An agency may not withhold, deny, or impose conditions on any permit or other authority to act,” based on MEPA, but the Held litigants argue the change effectively “blinded” state agencies by prohibiting the use of information gathered during MEPA reviews to alter a permit, even if the environmental impacts could be a violation of the state constitution.
“The laws unconstitutionally eliminate a means to prevent harms from happening before they occur,” the petition states.
Senate Bill 221, brought by Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, also changed MEPA by narrowing the scope of review to “proximate” environmental impacts and defining a “proposed action” as excluding “upstream, downstream, or other indirect action that occurs independently or is caused in part or exclusively by the proposed action.”
“Such restrictions on the scope of environmental reviews under MEPA require agencies to turn a blind eye to known environmental harms caused by fossil fuel projects and (greenhouse gas) emissions,” the petition states, preventing agencies from making “informed decisions.”
A third challenged law, HB 291, brought by Rep. Greg Oblander, R-Billings, prohibits the state from adopting more stringent standards for air pollutants than the federal government.
The lawsuit argues the provision turns the floor of the federal Clean Air Act regulations “into a ceiling,” and creates a barrier to DEQ’s ability to “prevent, abate and control Montana’s (greenhouse gas) emissions,” which, in turn, would alleviate the injuries suffered by the youth.
“This case is about enforcing a binding constitutional duty, restoring the state’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas pollution, and protecting the rights of Montana children before more irreversible harm occurs,” Nate Bellinger, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “Every day these laws remain in effect, the harms to Montana’s climate, communities, and youth grow worse. We are ready to hold the state accountable and ensure that Montana upholds the constitutional rights of its youngest residents.”

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-20 21:35:46+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Fewer Mississippians enroll in Marketplace health insurance plans, early data shows",Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/20/fewer-mississippi-health-insurance/,"Pages from the U.S. Affordable Care Act health insurance website healthcare.gov are seen on a computer screen in New York on Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2025.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Affordable Care Act Marketplace enrollments in Mississippi are down about 8% compared to the same time last year following the expiration of enhanced subsidies that made health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans, according to initial data from the federal government published last week.
As of Jan. 3, over 307,000 Mississippi had made selections for Marketplace health plans, which primarily insure small business owners, employees, farmers or people who are self-employed, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data. That figure trends down from 330,000 people enrolled at about the same time last year — a year that marked an all-time high for enrollments in Mississippi. Open enrollment closed Jan. 15. 
“This dip is alarming, but we don’t have all the data needed to give us the real picture of the impact of the enhanced premium tax credits going away,” said Kimberly Hughes, government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network in Mississippi, in a statement. 
Experts told Mississippi Today they expect enrollments to fall further, because people may disenroll from coverage when they receive their first bill reflecting a higher monthly premium.
The enhanced subsidies, which made coverage more affordable for over 22 million Americans, were an added boost authorized by Congress in 2021 to raise the income ceiling for eligibility and allow low-income households to access insurance without paying premiums during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
During that time, the number of Mississippians enrolled in Marketplace health insurance tripled. That increase amounted to over 200,000 people between 2021 and 2025, according to enrollment data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. During the same period, the rate of people without insurance – one of the highest rates in the country – dropped by over 65,000 people.
But without the enhanced subsidies, the cost of premiums for Marketplace plans will more than double on average this year, according to KFF, though the rate changes will vary based on age, income and location.
Republicans and Democrats in Congress have tussled for months over whether or not to extend the subsidies, but have not yet reached a deal. The House of Representatives passed a three-year extension of the subsidies on Jan. 13 after over a dozen Republicans broke with their party to support their renewal. The Senate rejected a similar proposal in December, with Sens. Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith voting against extending the subsidies. 
Because Mississippi has opted not to expand Medicaid coverage, more low-income people depend on the Marketplace for health coverage, said Khaylah Scott, program manager for the Mississippi Health Access Program. 
“For a lot of Mississippians, this is their only option,” she said. 
The drop in plan selections in Mississippi is twice as high as the country as a whole. Nationwide, Americans saw a 4% decrease based on initial numbers. U.S. enrollment declined by about 800,000 people compared to the same time period last year and about 1.5 million people from last year’s total enrollment. 
Scott said her organization has clearly seen the effects of the expiring subsidies in a surge of calls to its free helpline, Health Help Mississippi.
The nonprofit logged about 1,000 intakes last year, up from 400 the year before. Just two weeks into the new year, the program had already performed over 100 intakes. 
Among the callers, Scott said, was a woman calling on behalf of her brother, who has congestive heart failure. His premium for Marketplace insurance last year was $25, but this year, he was quoted at over $300 a month. He doesn’t have the option to let his coverage lapse, and plans to be more frugal and cut back on unnecessary spending in order to save up for the higher premium. 
A 63-year-old woman who called the help line saw her premiums increase from $70 to $540 a month. She will go without health insurance for a year and a half, when she becomes eligible for Medicare. Her 25-year-old son, whose premiums rose $395 a month, will also go without coverage. 
Scott said it’s been difficult for her organization to listen to Mississippians share their struggles accessing affordable health insurance coverage, knowing there is little they can do to help lower costs. 
“It’s been really tough telling people there’s nothing we can do…. It’s really in Congress’ hands right now.” 
The Urban Institute, a policy think tank, predicted in September that about 150,000 people in Mississippi would drop their Marketplace coverage if the increased subsidies were not extended — one of the steepest dropoffs in the country. The organization also estimated that uninsurance rates in Mississippi would rise by 65%.
Initial data shows a less steep drop off in coverage, but there is no evidence to suggest that the estimates should be adjusted at this point, said Matthew Buettgens, one of the authors of the study. 
Buettgens said he expects to see a more clear picture of how the expired subsidies have influenced enrollment when data showing the number of people who have paid their initial premium payments is released. This data is typically released in the summer. 
CMS data shows that more than half of Mississippians insured through the Marketplace were automatically re-enrolled last year, suggesting many people may not have reviewed their premiums or actively updated their coverage this year. 
Though open enrollment has now ended, Congress could opt to create an additional enrollment period, he said. But even so, many people will still experience a gap in coverage or pay higher premiums in order to maintain their insurance. 
Several states, including Connecticut and Pennsylvania, have extended their open enrollment period through the end of the month to give people more time to sign up. 
The expiration of Marketplace subsidies is also not the only factor expected to affect health insurance coverage rates, Buettgens said, pointing to changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald J. Trump this summer. 
The law requires more frequent eligibility determinations for Medicaid beginning at the end of this year, which is expected to result in fewer people with health insurance. Fewer lawfully present immigrants, including refugees, people granted political asylum and victims of domestic violence and trafficking will be eligible for Medicaid or Marketplace financial assistance beginning in 2026. 
“The declines that we see this year, that’s not the end of it,” Buettgens said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/14092325/AP25301624742312.jpg,,,2026-01-20 16:56:41.979751

NV Energy balks at call to fully repay overcharged customers 

The utility, which owed customers a total of $65.4 million, according to state regulators, initially offered to reimburse a portion of affected customers just $2.5 million, claiming regulations limited their obligation to repay customers for just six months of overcharges. 
Just weeks ago, the company upped its offer to reimburse customers for overcharges back to 2017, adding the offer “substantially exceeds the Companies’ legal obligations and ensures prompt compensation for impacted customers.”
Court action on the part of state regulators, NV Energy asserted, would delay reimbursement.
On Tuesday, NV Energy called its latest proposal “the right thing to do” and thanked the Public Utility Commission for its help “in developing a resolution that makes current customers whole again.” 
The offer “ensures that compensation is provided expeditiously” following PUC approval, NV Energy said.
The utility initially acknowledged overcharging some 60,000 customers by roughly $17 million, the Current reported in May, but the company later found through an audit it had overcharged another 20,000  “previously unidentified ‘multi-family accounts’ for an undisclosed amount.” 
An investigation by PUC staff discovered more than 100,000 customers were affected by the overcharging, which was caused by the misclassification of multi-family units as single-family homes, which pay a higher rate. 
Additional details will be available on the company’s website in the coming days, the news release said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nvenergyclarkstn-1024x627.jpg,,,2026-01-20 16:56:41.979751

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A Senate Republican leader introduced two pieces of legislation Tuesday to address ongoing issues with property rights and eminent domain. 

One bill would allow hazardous liquid pipeline operators to choose alternative routes to avoid the use of eminent domain and another would place a severance tax on sequestered carbon dioxide.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, said Tuesday to members of the media that he believes the bills will provide “abundant and affordable energy” while allowing Iowans to “exercise their private property rights,” allow private investments to help the state grow and “accelerate Iowa’s path to zero income tax.”
“I believe the proposals we are introducing today in the Senate will get us to the point where we all but eliminate the need for utilizing eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines or any other (hazardous liquid) pipelines, while still recognizing the fact that Iowa needs to have investment in linear infrastructure, but also recognizing the importance of landowner rights,” Klimesh said.

The Senate bills differ from a bill filed and advanced by House Republicans that would ban carbon sequestration pipelines from using eminent domain. Lobbyists for Summit Carbon Solutions, an Iowa-based company seeking to build a carbon capture and sequestration pipeline through the state, said the House bill would kill the Summit pipeline project. 
Landowners and lawmakers in support of the House bill have said it is the best way to protect private property rights from a project they argue is not a public use. 
Corn farmers and ethanol producers in favor of carbon sequestration pipelines said the Senate bill would help the project secure as many voluntary easements as possible to get the project done. 
Kelly Nieuwenhuis, an O’Brien County farmer, said he and his brothers have signed contracts for more than three miles of easements with Summit and he hopes other landowners can do the same if the Senate’s bill is successful.
“We’ve had great negotiations with (Summit), great communications and no issues at all, so I’m hoping more people find that same situation, and so we can find people are willing to have the project go across their property, “Nieuwenhuis said while at the Iowa State Capitol Tuesday to speak with lawmakers about the Summit project. 
Widening the corridors
Klimesh said under Senate File 2067, eminent domain – or the taking of private property with just compensation for public use – would be a “last resort” for hazardous liquid pipelines. 
Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh discusses two bills he introduced to address eminent domain and property rights in Iowa Jan. 20, 2026. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)
Rather than stick directly with their Iowa Utilities Commission approved routes, hazardous liquid pipeline operators, not just carbon sequestration pipeline operators, would be able to “actively pursue alternative routes” with landowners within a voluntary easement corridor. Klimesh explained this corridor included land anywhere within the county or within five miles of the initially proposed route.
“The Senate Republican caucus doesn’t want eminent domain to be utilized,” Klimesh said. “I mean, we want to try to minimize the impact of eminent domain of building any infrastructure projects.” 
Under the bill, a pipeline operator must demonstrate to the Iowa Utilities Commission that it “diligently sought to devise a route of voluntary easements” and was unable to do so, before it can request eminent domain power. 
Jess Mazour, the conservation program associate with Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, said the proposal from Klimesh “does not address property rights.” The House bill, which is on the schedule for debate Wednesday, she said does protect property rights by blocking the use of eminent domain. 
Mazour alleged that Summit has been unwilling to reroute within its existing corridors and wondered what difference a larger corridor, as proposed by Klimesh’s bill, would make. 
“A lot of the stuff that he’s saying is simply just a misdirection and a distraction away from the issue at hand, which is property rights, and the ability for someone to say no,” Mazour said. “And that’s not addressed in his bill whatsoever.” 
Klimesh argued the bill allows property owners to say no by giving pipeline operators a different option. 
“This is a relationship would allow the property owner that does not wish to enter a voluntary easement to say no,” Klimesh said. “Currently under Iowa law, that pipeline company has no other option to go around that landowner – this allows that option to take place.” 
The bill also has a provision that would allow landowners to opt out of communications, other than mail, from pipeline operators. Klimesh explained the bill allows a one-year time frame for easement acquisitions, to keep the process from being “open ended.” 
According to Klimesh, the bill would affect the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which was granted a permit by the IUC in 2024, but he said it also applies to other hazardous liquid pipelines that want to cross through Iowa in the future. 
Summit, in a statement, said it “remain(s) committed” to working with landowners and lawmakers on solutions that “protect property rights and support rural economies.” 
“As proposals like this are considered, it’s important to maintain clarity, respect landowner interests, and avoid limiting economic opportunity for agriculture and rural communities,” the statement said. 
Mike Henning, a landowner in Greene County affected by and opposed to the pipeline, said the House bill would protect property rights and allow for the development of carbon pipelines.
“We’ve heard what’s in Sen. Klimesh’s bill and it’s not what landowners have spent five years asking for. Nor is it what Governor Reynolds asked for after vetoing our last piece of legislation,” Henning said in a news release.
The Legislature passed a bill to limit the use of eminent domain on carbon sequestration projects in 2025, but Gov. Kim Reynolds vetoed the bill, in part because of its complexity.
Severance tax on CO2 
The second bill would apply a severance tax – or a tax applied on the removal of natural resources – on the carbon dioxide transported through the pipeline. 
Klimesh said this tax revenue would go to Iowa’s Taxpayer Relief Fund to “continue Iowa’s path to zero income tax.” 
The tax would be applied at a flat fee per metric ton. 
States like Wyoming, North Dakota and Texas have severance taxes on oil and gas that is extracted in the state. 
Good for corn, ‘energy dominance’ 
Klimesh said his legislative proposals will be good for Iowa farmers as carbon capture pipelines are slated to increase demand in the ethanol industry by allowing refineries to more easily participate in the ultra-low carbon ethanol markets. 
He noted that farmers logged a record high year for corn production. According to USDA figures, Iowa farmers produce 2.77 billion bushels of corn in 2025. Nearly 60% of Iowa-grown corn goes to the ethanol industry. 
“It’s of the utmost importance that we gain access to new low carbon ethanol markets to ensure Iowa farmers and Iowa can not only survive but thrive,” Klimesh said. 
Nieuwenhuis said there are additional ways for ethanol plants to reduce their carbon intensity score, a figure which represents the greenhouse gas emissions of a product, but none that do so as intensely as access to a carbon sequestration pipeline.
Klimesh additionally stressed the importance of his legislation as it relates to the Trump administration’s goal for energy dominance. 
Language in the federal “one big beautiful” law made it so carbon sequestration pipelines can get enhanced tax credits when the CO2 is injected into the ground near existing oil fields in a process called enhanced oil recovery. 
The pressure from the CO2 can make oil recovery processes more effective. 
While Summit lobbyists also mentioned the prospect of enhanced oil recovery during a subcommittee meeting on the House-proposed bill, the company has not said if it intends to change its route from its current ending destination in North Dakota, to an area with greater potential for enhanced oil recovery. 
Klimesh, when asked if he had the necessary votes to pass the bill, said he would not discuss “internal caucus matters.” The issue of eminent domain has caused a level of division within Iowa Republicans, notably from a group of Republican senators who refused to debate budget bills last session until the chamber held debate on the House’s eminent domain bill.

The 93-0 vote Tuesday advances House Bill 1035 to the Senate for its consideration.
Bill author Rep. Jake Teshka, R-North Liberty, said he believed state law needed to explicitly state that a child wasn’t endangered simply by being unsupervised.
“We’ve got kids who are unleashed in the digital world and yet restrained in the physical world,” Teshka said. “Evidence has consistently shown that age appropriate independence actually strengthens decision making, risk assessment, self control, improves social skills and academic performance.”

He leaves behind a mixed record.(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Phil Murphy left office Tuesday at noon after eight years as New Jersey’s governor, two terms highlighted by tumult.
His first years in office were marked by political scandal and Democratic infighting. He was among the first governors forced to deal with COVID-19, which began spreading while he was hospitalized for cancer surgery. In 2021, he became the first Democratic governor in nearly 50 years to win reelection. He helped lead a bungled attempt to get his wife elected to the U.S. Senate, a move that not only killed her political ambitions but also destroyed the county line. And he landed in the crosshairs of the second Trump administration when he appeared to say he’d hide an undocumented immigrant in his Middletown mansion.
We sat down with Murphy recently to ask him about the highlights and lowlights of the last eight years. His left office at noon, with Gov. Mikie Sherrill (D) succeeding him.
 Good: Pensions
Even Republicans who hate most of Murphy’s budgetary ideas give him kudos for his commitment to boosting the health of our state’s pension fund. Murphy’s predecessors of both parties either ignored the fund or contributed little so that they could spend elsewhere, but Murphy boosted annual pension payments to record highs.
Under Murphy these payments amounted to about $47 billion over eight years, more than twice the $22.7 billion paid by other governors since the 1997 fiscal year. The health of our pension funding is still bad compared to other states, but it’s far healthier than it was when Murphy took over.
“I am very proud we are who we said we would be, and I know that sounds corny, but that doesn’t happen that often in this line of business. We campaigned a certain way, and we have governed largely, if not overwhelmingly, in that way,” Murphy said.
 Bad: Transparency
Murphy caved to legislators who made it their mission in recent years to make sure the public knows less about what their elected officials and political candidates are up to, by signing a rewrite of the Open Public Records Act that makes it harder to gain access to government documents.
Murphy waived away his responsibility for the OPRA rewrite, loathed by journalists and citizen watchdogs as a transparent attempt to put roadblocks in front of anyone trying to uncover malfeasance in government, by saying it wasn’t his idea.
“I didn’t run to reform OPRA. Others had a higher passion for that than I did, and you sort of make tradeoffs,” Murphy said.
I have no doubt lawmakers desperate to keep their records away from our prying eyes tried to hold the rest of Murphy’s agenda hostage in exchange for his signature on this bill. He should have resisted.

 In-between: COVID-19
Murphy won a lot of praise from Democrats during the early months of the COVID-19 crisis as he sought to limit the spread of the virus by closing businesses and schools, restricting the size of public gatherings, cutting the prison population, and more.
There were naysayers then, as there are now. Some of them, I think, forget the sheer magnitude of this unprecedented crisis, with bodies piling up in hospitals and medical professionals stretched to their limit.
But surely, I thought, in hindsight Murphy could name one or two things he would have done differently?
Nope. Murphy could not cite a single thing. When I asked whether he thought his administration’s strategy on nursing homes deserved a second look, he called the premise of my question faulty.
As a reminder, on March 31, 2020, the Murphy administration ordered nursing homes to readmit patients who tested positive for COVID-19, as long as the homes could separate them from the general population. This doomed many of our seniors. More than 10,000 nursing home residents died in the first four months of the pandemic.
Murphy insists that nursing home operators are at fault for not obeying the administration’s directive to separate sick patients from well ones.
“We said, you’ve got to do three things. It’s either: minimum, a different floor; better, a different wing; even better, a different building. And by the way, you can’t take care of, as a health care professional, one group over here and one group over there. We were crystal, crystal, crystal clear,” he said.
The independent review Murphy ordered of his administration’s response to the pandemic says too few nursing homes “could readmit such patients while following infection control guidance and maintaining safety protocols.” In the weeks following the Murphy administration’s readmission directive, the virus ran rampant in nursing homes, and the directive was retracted on April 13, 2020, the report says. COVID-positive nursing home patients were moved to separate facilities.
At least one lawsuit filed against the Murphy administration by the families of three people who died in nursing homes in the first wave of COVID was dismissed because, the judge said, the administration acted “at a time that it was not sufficiently clear to a reasonable official that what he or she was doing violated” anyone’s rights. That may be true, and to look back on it all now and deny you could have done anything differently may be legally sound. But it is not morally sound.
 Good: pardons
It took Murphy seven years to issue a pardon, but once he did, he couldn’t stop, pardoning or commuting sentences for more than 450 people in the last 13 months. Plus, unlike with pardons issued by presidents like Joe Biden or Donald Trump, most of Murphy’s orders don’t reek of favor-trading. He created a clemency board to review pardon and commutation requests to make sure that the people receiving them had reformed or had been punished too severely for their actions and deserved a break.
Murphy said he takes a number of things into consideration when deciding whether to grant clemency to someone.
“How good a citizen have you been in the system? Or if you’re looking for a pardon or a commute from lifetime parole, how’s your life been once you’re out of the system? Are you offense-free? So there’s a lot of things you have to consider,” he said. “We talk about when you pardon someone or commute their sentence or commute their parole, you put a family back together again, because the family has been challenged in their — and I always add, by the way, we take the victims’ side of that as seriously, in terms of what their family looks like, and the impact on their families.”
 Bad: NJ Transit
NJ Transit is no doubt in a better place than it was when Murphy was elected governor after campaigning to fix it.
But its service is still so unreliable that I don’t use it because I don’t know if it’ll take me to my destination or, say, drop me off eight stops from where I started and then tell me the train has been canceled so I’ll have to figure out a way to New York City on my own (that happened recently to one of my colleagues, and she still hasn’t gotten a refund). Yet Murphy acts like he’s fixed the agency.
“On-time performance, customer satisfaction, safety are all dramatically different and better than they were when we first got here,” he said, later adding, “Someone independently studied the time it took to move people into Taylor Swift and out of Taylor Swift in every North American concert she did, and we were far and away the winner.”
It’s great for Taylor Swift fans that NJ Transit aced it on three days in May 2023. But we need that kind of performance every day. I hope Sherrill takes NJ Transit more than Murphy does — that may be the only way the agency becomes as good as we need it to be.

 In-between: Trenton’s political culture
It feels a bit unfair to lay the blame for Trenton’s often noxious political culture on Murphy, since only a miracle worker could make that kind of change in eight years.
But he certainly didn’t make it better, rolling over for legislative leaders who wanted to avoid paying steep fines for political misbehavior and also kneecap watchdogs seeking their emails.
Murphy said he does not agree with progressive Democrats who view the New Jersey Statehouse as a haven for corruption. What they see as corruption, Murphy said, he sees as normal politics.
“If you are a purist and you cannot countenance compromise, this is not your state. I suspect politics should not be your chosen line of business either, because it’s a little bit like, you know, Bogart/Claude Rains in ‘Casablanca,’ where there’s gambling going around the back room. You have to compromise. You have to get around a table, and sometimes you have to accept stuff,” he said.
So, using Murphy’s own analogy, one side of Trenton’s Democratic power structure is cinema’s most famous saloon owner, and the other is … cinema’s most famous Nazi collaborator. Let us pray.

Joseph J. Solomon Jr., a Warwick Democrat, announced his intention to run for Rhode Island Attorney general on Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The race to be Rhode Island’s next attorney general became more crowded Tuesday after State Rep. Joseph J. Solomon Jr. announced his long-awaited primary bid.
Solomon, a Warwick Democrat, is the fourth candidate to announce his intention to replace the term-limited Peter Neronha in a race that includes Kimberly Ahern, Keith Hoffmann and fellow state Rep. Jason Knight — all of whom have touted their prior experience working at the AG’s office at some point in their legal careers.
The 42-year-old offers a different resume, instead leaning on his own 15-year legal career that includes over a decade of work as a bail commissioner and prosecution experience in the Warwick solicitor’s office.
“I’m not running to learn on the job,” Solomon said in a statement. “I’ve spent my career in the courtroom, making the tough calls as a bail commissioner, and writing laws that protect Rhode Island families. I’ve already been doing this work, and Rhode Island deserves an Attorney General who shows up ready on day one.”
Solomon has served in the Rhode Island House of Representatives since 2015. For the past five years, he has chaired the chamber’s Committee on Corporations — which is responsible for laws on the state’s financial institutions, business regulation, property, casualty and health insurance, technology, telecommunications and consumer protection.
Solomon joins the race with more cash on hand than any of his opponents as of the state’s most recent reporting deadline of Sept. 30.
Solomon reported $251,816 in his campaign account, while Hoffmann had $205,680, and Knight had $94,786. 
Ahern — who joined after the reporting deadline — announced on Jan. 14 her campaign raised $273,000 in the last quarter of 2025. She welcomed Solomon’s entry into the Democratic primary Tuesday afternoon.
“I look forward to a spirited campaign and a substantive conversation about how best to keep Rhode Islanders safe,” Ahern said in a statement. “The Attorney General is the state’s top law enforcement officer, and we need a prosecutor — not a politician — with a proven track record of putting dangerous criminals behind bars, defending our fundamental rights, and fighting for working families.”
Hoffman and Knight’s campaigns did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The state’s primary is scheduled for Sept. 8. The general election will be held Nov. 3.

Photo by Jon King.Tamela Peterson, the CEO of Oxford Center, who is already facing second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter charges in the death of a boy in one of its hyperbaric chambers, is now facing a new set of charges for health care fraud.
The Department of Attorney General on Tuesday announced that Peterson was arraigned by a Howell district court judge on nine counts of health care fraud, false claims, each a felony punishable by a four-year maximum prison sentence and or a $50,000 fine.
Peterson and three other former employees are currently facing charges in the death of a 5-year-old boy in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber explosion at the Oxford Center in Troy, Michigan.
Michigan attorney general charges 4 in death of 5-year-old boy killed in hyperbaric chamber fire

The new charges focus on the Oxford Recovery Center location in Brighton. Both locations treated patients for a wide range of mental health issues, including addiction related care, and included a large population of children diagnosed with autism in the center’s behavioral analysis program.
Attorney General Dana Nessel’s department alleges that Peterson had knowledge of and was the beneficiary of fraudulent health care claim practices, including billing for services not rendered to patients.
“Filing false claims impacts not only patients and providers, but also contributes to increased costs of healthcare and medical insurance for everybody,” Nessel said in a statement. “Health care fraud undermines the trust between patients and providers and patients’ notions of confidentiality and care. My office will continue to hold accountable those who take advantage of their practice for their own financial benefit.”
Peterson was granted a $10,000 personal recognizance bond, and will next appear in court on Jan. 27 for a probable cause conference. A preliminary examination, which will determine if she will be bound over to the circuit court for trial, is scheduled for Feb. 3.
Meanwhile, a hearing was scheduled Tuesday in Oakland County district court on whether Peterson and the other defendants should be bound over to circuit court for trial on the charges in the incident involving the boy’s death.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-20 21:00:36+00:00,CT Mirror,"ABLE CT program expanded to disabled veterans, others",Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/able-ct-program-expanded-to-disabled-veterans-others/,The ABLE CT program will allow more people with disabilities in CT to save money without jeopardizing their access to benefits.,"U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Treasurer Erick Russell announced on Tuesday the expansion of a program that will allow people with disabilities to save money without jeopardizing their access to benefits. 
The ABLE CT savings accounts previously served people who had experienced the onset of a disability before age 26; now the eligibility ceiling has been changed to before age 46, making around 6 million people newly eligible across with country, including thousands in Connecticut.
“Making more people aware is critical because the expansion is benefitting people only if they take advantage of it,” Blumenthal said at a press conference at Easterseals, a nonprofit that serves people with disabilities including veterans. “That 20 years of eligibility is hugely important to people who may be disabled. People may be disabled on the job.”
The program allows people to save money in a special tax-free account dubbed an ABLE CT account, named for the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act. Advocates say that the accounts represent a critical step to break the cycle of poverty that people can fall into when they become disabled: unable to save funds to supplement medical costs without jeopardizing their eligibility for benefits, bills for any number of expenses can plunge them into debt and even homelessness.
In Connecticut, the legislation also allows for deductions on state income taxes up to $10,000 for people filing jointly and up to $5,000 for single filers.
Advocates say that disabled veterans will be major beneficiaries of the change in age eligibility, since they often experience an onset of disability during their service and after the previous age 26 cut-off. 
“For people who aren’t able to gain employment and earn sustained gainful employment, this definitely assists with enriching their lives going forward,” said Ryan Landry, associate director of military services for the Capital region and Eastern Connecticut Easterseals, and a veteran U.S. Army sergeant.
Blumenthal, the ranking member on the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, said that veterans often have “invisible wounds” that leave them disabled.
“More and more invisible wounds that we’re learning can have disastrous effects on veterans — the burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq, the contamination of water at Camp Lejeune,” Blumenthal said. “Veterans may be disabled for a vast variety of reasons, they get care and benefits from the VA, but in addition they can take advantage of these ABLE accounts. And that can be life saving.”
The expansion of the law was passed in 2022 and goes into effect this month. Similar to a 529, the money saved in the account can be invested and later withdrawn tax free, as long as it’s used for broad categories of disability-related expenses like housing, medical needs, job training and caregiving. In Connecticut, the federal law was adopted and also allows for a tax deduction for contributions to the ABLE accounts.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25126646848616-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 16:56:41.979751

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)With its skunky smell, marijuana may be one of the most odoriferous substances around.
In an attempt to get the smell of medical marijuana off Florida streets, parking lots, and beaches, and into private spaces instead, a state Senate committee unanimously approved Tuesday imposing a ban on public use of both pot and tobacco.
Sponsored by Sen. Joe Gruters, SB 986 would revise the state’s laws that prohibit smoking and vaping of tobacco in public spaces to also prohibit smoking or vaping of a marijuana. The companion measure, HB 389, is sponsored by Pensacola Republican Rep. Alex Andrade.
The bill defines the term “public place” to mean “a place to which the public has access, including, but not limited to, streets; sidewalks; highways; public parks; public beaches; and the common areas, both inside and outside, of schools, hospitals, government buildings, apartment buildings, office buildings, lodging establishments, restaurants, transportation facilities, and retail shops.”
Florida first banned smoking in public places in statutes in 1985. In 2002, Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment to ban smoking in places like restaurants, government buildings, and health facilities. At the time, the amendment was pitched as a workplace safety issue. Opponents, meanwhile, argued it was a property rights issue and that government was overstepping its authority by banning smoking.
The Legislature responded the following year with “implementing” legislation that prohibits smoking in workplaces that previously allowed smoking. With the advent of electronic smoking devices, Florida voters in 2018 approved a second constitutional amendment that banned vaping and e-cigarettes in enclosed indoor workplaces.
Voters also approved in 2016 a constitutional amendment to make medical marijuana available to qualified patients. The Department of Health Office of Medical Marijuana Use reports that 931,959 patients qualified for medical marijuana in Florida as of Jan. 16. Although the marijuana is for medical reasons, only smoking is a legal route of administration.
A proposed constitutional amendment to allow adults to use marijuana recreationally was supported by 56% of the voters in 2024, but fell short of the 60% threshold needed to pass.
Gruters, now chair of the National Republican Party, supported the 2024 amendment to legalize marijuana, which put him at odds with Gov. Ron DeSantis, who opposed the idea. If recreational marijuana were legal, DeSantis said, Florida would “start to smell like marijuana in our cities and towns. The stench, he said, would “reduce the quality of life.”
In a hearing before the Senate Committee on Regulated Industries, Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association lobbyist Samantha Padgett didn’t take a position for or against the bill Tuesday. Instead, she “shared information” with the committee, telling members that the association supports adding vaping and smoking marijuana to the law, officially called the Florida Indoor Clean Air Act.
“This gives all employers the freedom to ensure a smoke-free environment in their places of employment,” she said.
But she said the association has heard from members worried the definition of public places is too broad and may impede restaurants from allowing smoking on patios or ban hotels from offering smoking rooms on certain floors.
Padgett said the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association worked closely with the Legislature on the implementing legislation for 2002 constitutional amendment to ensure that designated smoking areas would still be allowed.
“As a result, many of our members made significant investments to make sure those spaces that were on their properties are compliant with that statutory language,” she said adding, “We’d like to make sure that that ability continues.”

“This becomes a real property rights issue.
Florida Cannabis Action Network board president Jodi James argued the bill was overly broad and because of that has “some true unintended consequences.”
For instance, she said, some apartment complexes have policies that ban renters from smoking indoors, forcing people to go outdoors to smoke medical marijuana. “This is the place where a patient would take advantage of their ability to access state medicine,” she said.
She added that there are hotels across the state where smoking medical marijuana is approved by management. There also are hotels with designated smoking floors. None of that would be allowed under the bill, she said.
“This becomes a real property rights issue. The new definition of public places might very well include my front door, which would mean I couldn’t even step outside my home and smoke cannabis, which is my legally protected right. I think the most outrageous, though, is that my friend who owns property in Franklin County and who no longer uses the vapes that have tobacco in them but does use a vape with e-juice would be fined for sitting on her property near the beach using a vaporizer that contains no tobacco.”
Bill co-sponsor Sen. Ana Maria Rodriguez, a Republican from Doral, acknowledged that James’ points had merit. But she added: “Clearly there is a difference between someone’s front door and a public place where the general public can gather, whether it’s a restaurant, whether it’s in a park or a beach. Your house is a dwelling and the front door of your house isn’t the same as being in a public place.” Rodriguez said.
The bill also would prohibits smoking or vaping marijuana in a designated smoking room at any time, something not now prohibited by statute.
While the whiff of medical marijuana in public spaces is becoming more common, Rodriguez pitched the bill as necessary amid efforts to legalize adult recreational use of marijuana continue.
“Every state in the United States that allows adult use of marijuana has either a complete public smoking ban or tight restrictions to where marijuana smoking is allowed,” she said.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)City property — including parking lots, public schools, parks and municipal buildings — is off limits to federal immigration officers conducting enforcement operations, under an executive order signed by Providence Mayor Brett Smiley Tuesday.
Smiley told reporters gathered at City Hall that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in other blue cities made the order necessary to protect the community. He said he was unaware of any ICE actions on city property since the second Trump administration took over one year ago. However, immigration officers entered the state-owned Garrahy Judicial Complex on Dorrance Street on Jan. 15, bypassing security and prompting outrage from state leaders
“We’re taking clear action to affirm Providence’s values,” Smiley said before signing his first executive order of the year with a black pen. “We do not want — and will not allow — Providence’s public property to be used to execute what we see as unlawful immigration enforcement.”
Smiley held up a copy of a red sign city employees will post noting the use of city property as a federal immigration enforcement staging site is now prohibited. In the event ICE officers are seen on any city-owned property without a judicial warrant, Smiley said Providence police will be required to vacate the federal agents from it. 
“If Immigration and Customs Enforcement presents a valid judicial warrant, we will honor it,” the mayor said. “We honor it today, but the reality is that’s not what’s happening in most instances.”

Private property owners are welcome to go to the city’s website and download and print out the signs to identify “non-public areas of their property” where ICE activity is prohibited, according to Smiley’s executive order. Property owners can use signs “at their own discretion and assume any legal risk associated therewith.”
Smiley said he has been encouraging the state’s judicial branch to enact a similar policy and also expand the use of virtual court hearings in Providence to discourage additional ICE visits.
The Jan. 15 incident at the Garrahy Courthouse was the second time in three months that ICE officers entered a state courthouse. ICE officers briefly detained a teenage judicial intern outside of the Licht Judicial Complex in Providence on Nov. 20, sparking condemnation from state and local officials, including Gov. Dan McKee and Chief Justice Paul Suttell.
ICE did not immediately respond to request for comment on the Jan. 15 incident.
The Providence Journal reported “several” masked immigration officers ran through the first floor of the Garrahy Courthouse in pursuit of two young men though apparently did not take anyone into custody.
 “Allowing these barely-trained and reckless federal agents to blunder through our state, disrupting the justice system and harassing children and judges, diminishes the safety of our citizens and undermines the efforts of real law enforcement officers,” Lt. Gov Sabina Matos said in a Jan. 16 statement. “I am glad that this incident appears to have ended without harm to anyone, but we have all seen how this behavior leads to tragedy. ICE needs to be reined in and subject to the same laws that govern us all.”
The Judiciary enacted rules for virtual court hearings in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic and recently posted its revised policy for requesting such a hearing using an online form. A judicial officer makes the final determination on whether the hearing must be held in person or not.
“As has been the case since the Judiciary developed remote hearing access capabilities, members of the public may request that a pending hearing be conducted remotely,” Judiciary spokesperson Lexi Kriss said in a recent email to Rhode Island Current. “These requests are to be submitted to and considered by the judicial officer presiding over the matter.”
Smiley’s order follows a move by city officials in November to amend Providence’s Community-Police Relations Act to deter local police from interacting with federal immigration officers.
Smiley acknowledged his order may put Providence further in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. The president on Jan. 14 threatened to halt federal funding to so-called “sanctuary” cities and states starting Feb. 1 if they don’t honor his mass deportation policies.
But Smiley said the fear of federal retribution is outweighed by the need to let Providence residents know the city has their backs.
“There are families in Providence who are afraid,” he said. “My responsibility is to them, not anyone in Washington D.C.”

Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, chaired the subcommittee and was joined by Rep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, and Rep. Heather Hora, R-Washington.

Professional Educators of Iowa, the Iowa Judicial Branch, Iowa State Education Association and Iowa Society of Certified Public Accountants are all registered as “undecided” on the bill, lobbyists from the organizations said during the subcommittee meeting, with some seeking further clarification on which continuing education courses would count as “not directly related to” their work.
“We certainly appreciate the goal of making sure that continued education and PD credits are topical and helpful and relevant, but we also support the idea of a little bit of discretion,” said Nathan Arnold, lobbyist for Professional Educators of Iowa.
One example Arnold gave of continuing education that could be construed as not connecting directly to the education profession was a course on identifying and preventing human trafficking offered by Professional Educators of Iowa. Melissa Peterson with the Iowa State Education Association said she’s unsure if training on seizure and concussion response would fall under continuing education, but they are popular programs and she wants more understanding of how they would be impacted.
Arnold told the subcommittee the organization doesn’t want to see programs like these “get unintentionally axed.”
Brad Epperly, representing the Iowa Society of Certified Public Accountants, said those in his profession and others have governing boards that prescribe required continuing education, and as those serving on the board were appointed to the position and are part of the profession, he believes these decisions should be left to them.
Iowa attorneys are currently required to complete “continuing legal education” courses in either the “wellness” or “diversity” categories, Iowa Judicial Branch lobbyist Caitlin Jarzen said, both of which are likely to be seen as not “directly related to the practice of law.”
However, she said Iowa Supreme Court Chief Justice Susan Christensen made wellness issues a focus in her Condition of the Judiciary address Jan. 14 and the branch sees benefits of continuing education requirements that might not align completely with practicing law.
When asked by Wilburn where continuing education focused on communication with people with disabilities such as hearing or visual impairment would be categorized, she said she believes it would fall under diversity.
Wilburn was the single no vote in moving the legislation to the Iowa House Higher Education Committee, citing concerns about the bill “being vague and a little too subjective.”
The legislation should provide more information on what counts as continuing education for different professions, he said, and ensure that licensed professionals can receive all the necessary training to meet state, regional or national accreditation requirements for their job.
“I think it’s important, when the Legislature puts something forward, that there’s clarity into what’s covered,” Wilburn said.
The legislation received approval from both Hora and Holt, though Holt said he would be interested in hearing more from the judicial branch about their discussions on the bill.
“I’m going to sign this off to move to the full committee, but I think there’s a lot of questions,” Holt said.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)A Phase III clinical trial including patients at the University of Oklahoma found that proton therapy improved survival and resulted in fewer side effects among people with head and neck cancer.


The trial was led by the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, enrolling 440 patients across 21 institutions.
It included oropharyngeal cancer patients, which includes the tonsils and the back part of the tongue. The incidence and mortality of oropharyngeal cancer have grown over the past three decades, particularly because of increases in HPV.
Researchers directly compared the impacts of proton and photon therapy on these patients.
Photon therapy is the most common type of radiation therapy, using high-energy X-rays to damage DNA inside cancer cells. Photons are wave particles: they don’t have physical mass, meaning they can pass in and out of the body.
But this also means radiation spreads beyond targeted areas, said Dr. Christina Henson, an associate professor of radiation oncology at the OU College of Medicine. In treating cancer in the neck, patients can experience side effects like dry mouth, sore throat and taste changes, making it difficult to eat. Some end up needing a feeding tube, she said.
Henson said photon therapy is a good treatment option. Now, she said, there’s an effort to help patients get through treatment with fewer side effects.
“There’s constantly a search for ways to decrease the dose of radiation to the normal tissues that are surrounding the tumor,” Henson said. “And so proton therapy has been one avenue that’s been explored for trying to do that.”
Protons have a physical mass and can be stopped at a certain depth inside tissue.
The therapy was first used in the 50s to treat limited areas in patients. Henson said its initial iterations weren’t precise. But, over the last decade, newer versions of proton machines have advanced to more effectively shape dosages.
In the trial, 221 patients were randomized to the proton group and 219 to the photon group. Five of them were patients at OU. Some patients in the proton section faced challenges with insurance declining to cover the therapy, Henson said, meaning they had to switch to the photon group.
Researchers found that, at five years, survival rates among patients who received proton therapy were 10% higher.
Henson said this seemed to be related to differences in the effects of radiation on the immune system.
“It seems that, potentially, the benefit of protons is that (they’re) just less toxic,” Henson said.
The trial’s findings may apply to other types of head and neck cancer, Henson said. She hopes the results will prompt insurers to cover proton therapy and additional trials on different cancers.
“Clinical trials often don’t go the way we expect them to, right? We’ll be really excited about a new therapy, and then the clinical trial shows that it didn’t make any difference or sometimes even that it made things worse,” Henson said. “So when we do get a trial that’s positive – especially when it’s strongly positive like this – it is very, very exciting.”

La Sasso’s decision takes him out of the 2026 Masters. He had earned an invitation to Augusta National based on the NCAA championship, but only if he had retained his amateur status through the Masters, April 9-12.
La Sasso will join World Golf Hall of Famer Phil Mickelson’s Hy Flyers GC on the LIV tour.
“It’s a rare opportunity to learn from one of the greatest players in the history of the game, and I don’t take that lightly,” La Sasso said in a statement. “LIV Golf allows me to compete at the highest level on a global stage, and I thrive in a team environment, especially one with the camaraderie and support that defines HyFlyers GC. My focus is on learning, continuing to improve, and doing everything I can to help our team succeed.”
Ole Miss begins its spring golf season Jan. 31 in the Thomas Sharkey Individual Collegiate at Statesboro, Georgia, a two-day event. The first full-team event will be the Water Sound Invitational Feb. 16-18 at Shark’s Tooth Golf Course in Inlet Beach, Florida.
“Clearly, it’s not ideal timing from a team standpoint,” Ole Miss golf coach Chris Malloy said in a phone interview. “But I am happy for Michael. Financially, this was a no-brainer for him. Still, he struggled with the decision because he is such a team guy.”
Michael La Sasso takes a selfie after winning the NCAA Division 1 Men’s Golf Championship at The Omni La Costa Golf Course in Carlsbad, California, on May 26, 2025. 
Financial terms of La Sasso’s LIV deal were not made available, but Malloy called it “certainly life-changing money.”
La Sasso, 21, is a Raleigh, North Carolina, native who transferred to Ole Miss from North Carolina State after his freshman season. Last year, he set the Ole Miss season scoring record, averaging 69.46 strokes per round. He was a consensus All-American.
Mickelson called La Sasso “one of the most exciting young players in the game today, bringing a competitive fire that’s evident every time he tee it up.
“He combines tremendous power and speed with an exceptional feel for the game,” Mickelson said in a statement. “Beyond his talent, his personality, work ethic, and commitment to being a great teammate make him a terrific addition to HyFlyers GC. We’re excited to support his development, accelerate his learning curve, and help him achieve his goals—while he, in turn, makes our team even stronger.”
Ole Miss was to enter the spring golf season as one of the favorites to win the NCAA team championship. Losing La Sasso clearly hurts the Rebels’ chances.
“It’s a blow and we’d be kidding ourselves if we said it wasn’t,” Malloy said. “I mean, we’re losing an NCAA champion and a first team All-American, but we’ve got three other All-Americans sitting in that locker room. We’ve still got firepower. We’ve still got a damned good team, and we’ve got some other guys in that locker room will have a chance to step up and make a difference.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/09150838/Malloy-congratulantes-La-Sasso.-.jpg,,,2026-01-20 15:57:24.571904

(Photo by Diyosa Carter/Getty Images)I joined a virtual book club during the COVID-19 lockdown, and it was a lifeline. It was also the first time I’d ever joined a book club. Odd thing for a book lover/word nerd/writer/librarian to say, but there it is.
Before that, there were kids to raise and a host of other demands or challenges with time. Plus, when time was at a premium, I wanted to read what I wanted to read, and it usually wasn’t what everyone else was reading.
The virtual book club still meets, but the “book” part of the club has all but ceased to be. Now a more accurate description would be: an occasional check-in for the geographically dispersed. Apparently, this happens to some other book clubs, too.
A few months ago, I finally joined an in-person book club. Some members read a lot — I mean, a LOT, and are up on all the latest and hottest authors and titles. I fall asleep while reading, so I am a slacker. They let me join anyway.
Getting hold of the latest and greatest titles, though, has proved to be challenging. Not everyone wants to buy a new book each month or has an Audible subscription. Also, some people prefer to read rather than listen, so an audio book isn’t an attractive option.
No problem, just use interlibrary loan, right? Well, thanks to the dumbness of DOGE (the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency), the Institute for Museum and Library Services’ budget was slashed, and the federal cuts affect state libraries.
State libraries provide funding for interlibrary loan reimbursements and related services, so now, you’ll wait longer for your requests to arrive if you live in Iowa. If you live in South Dakota, well, their state library’s cuts were so severe that they suspended ILL funding entirely.
In an age, when we are deluged by more information than we can possibly read, digest, or critically examine, it’s ironic that obtaining books through libraries is becoming more challenging.
I’m not even talking about the folks who are trying to remove materials from both school and public libraries. You can read the latest from Nicole Baart on the ongoing challenges at the Sioux Center Public Library.
What I’m talking about is access at its most basic level, how books get into people’s hands or in the case of ebooks and audio books, into their devices.
Let’s start with physical books. When a book is published, the copies are typically sent to a wholesale book distributor where bookstores and libraries order copies of new releases.
The largest book distributor in America, Baker & Taylor, recently announced that they are going out of business. Baker & Taylor has been the leader in book distribution for decades and was especially popular with libraries. On the other hand, this news seems like it would be a huge win for its competitor, Ingram.
While Ingram might be happy about increased business, it also requires infrastructure and staffing changes. Stepping into the bigger shoes vacated by B&T is not going to happen overnight. So, there may be a temporary slowdown in book distribution, and libraries and bookstores and their patrons will be inconvenienced.
At this news, some people will certainly say, “Why do we even have libraries anymore? Everything is on the internet.”
“Nobody buys (or needs) physical books anymore.”
“I get all the books I want on my Kindle/phone/iPad.”
But here’s the thing: Not everything is on the internet and not necessarily freely. When it comes to ebooks, you can buy them from the Kindle store and there’s subscription-based Audible for audiobooks. Lucky the person who can buy an electronic book in either form whenever they want.
Barring that, the State Library of Iowa offers electronic books to all Iowa libraries who participate in their Bridges program. Bridges is the name of the program, and Libby is the name of the app that delivers electronic book formats, either as ebooks or audio books.
So, there’s the library, yes. What a lot of people don’t understand is that electronic versions cost a library more than purchasing a physical book, and the library rarely owns said titles. Electronic versions of books are usually leased by contract for specific lengths of time.
If you read the next great American detective mystery on Libby and tell your best friend about it, they may have to wait awhile for their turn. Licensing limits the number of checkouts allowed per title and sometimes the wait list is months long.
I have been on a waiting list behind more than 400 people for an electronic title, telling me I may have to wait 37 weeks. Of course, I gave up and tried interlibrary loan. Most of the time the book will arrive, but not always. I have had requests canceled because too few libraries owned the book or because it was too new to lend to other libraries.
Recently, I requested an ILL for a title that my book club planned to read. I placed the request as soon as we decided on the title, and on the day of our meeting, the book finally arrived. Another member placed an ILL request through another library and still didn’t have the book by the night of the meeting.
And yes, there are libraries that purchase multiple copies of books — book sets — and they will lend these to book clubs, but you have to pick the right book and plan far in advance. A further complication for us, barring the use of book sets, is that our book club members live in different communities and use different libraries. So, not a workable option for us.
Joni Mitchell sang, “You don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone.” But I know what I had when I had it. Easy access. Efficient service. It’s not gone, but it’s fading fast.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-20 20:45:48+00:00,CT Mirror,ICE arrests man inside CT Superior Court building in New Haven,Thomas Breen | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/ice-arrests-new-haven-court/,Connecticut law requires judicial marshals to be notified before courthouse arrests by federal agents. The Judicial Branch was not notified.,"At least one masked, armed federal immigration agent ran into the Elm Street courthouse in New Haven on Tuesday morning to arrest a man, potentially in violation of a state law limiting ICE activity on courthouse grounds.
That arrest took place just before 8:55 a.m.
Someone who was in the courthouse at the time and witnessed part of the encounter said that, first, a man ran through the front doors of the 121 Elm St. state court building.
A few seconds later, another man — wearing a mask and a vest and armed with a gun — sprinted after him, running past the court entryway’s metal detector.
A video recording of part of that incident shows that the masked, armed man’s vest bore the words “Police” and “Homeland Security Investigations,” which is a division of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. The video also later shows two agents — including the one in the “Homeland Security Investigations” vest — taking a man into custody outside of the court’s front door.
“We can confirm that ICE arrested an individual in the New Haven GA Courthouse this morning,” said Rhonda Hebert, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Judicial Branch. “The Judicial Branch did not receive any prior notification from ICE regarding the arrest.”
Police spokesperson Officer Christian Bruckhart confirmed that an ICE arrest occurred near the courthouse Tuesday morning. He wasn’t able to say whether the arrest occurred inside or outside the building.
An ICE spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about who was arrested on Tuesday and why.
ICE agents have popped up downtown with increasing frequency in recent months, usually to make arrests of undocumented immigrants who have shown up for criminal court hearings — a method of immigration enforcement that advocates warn will discourage migrants from showing up to court or reporting crimes to the police.
Those previous local ICE arrests have typically taken place outside of the courthouse — on the sidewalk on Elm Street, or even on the Green.
Tuesday’s arrest, meanwhile, appears to have taken place inside the courthouse itself.
That could be a violation of a law passed by the state legislature in November with the goal of limiting ICE enforcement in or near courthouses. One part of that bill prohibits law enforcement officers from wearing masks “while on courthouse grounds,” unless they’ve received prior authorization from a judicial authority and it’s medically necessary.
“Ensuring that all residents feel safe coming into courthouses and participating in our judicial system is essential to keeping all Connecticut families safe. That’s why the state passed restrictions on ICE activity [and] masked agents in courthouses,” New Haven State Rep. Steve Winter told the Independent in an interview Tuesday.
He said that one of the top concerns he hears from constituents is about “the idea of masked federal agents terrorizing community members.”
“We need to keep ICE out of our courthouses,” Winter said. “That’s what will keep our communities safe, and not these aggressive tactics” that ICE is using in the name of public safety.

House Majority Leader Rep. Jason Monks, R-Meridian, introduced the bill in the House Revenue and Taxation Committee. The proposed legislation would increase the limits on the State Taxation Anticipated Revenue, or STARS, program.

The program allows for developers to receive a rebate of sales taxes collected by the retailers within the complex to reimburse 60% of expenses related to certain transportation projects, such as highway improvements or the installation of an interchange. 
The minimum cost of a project to enter the program is currently $6 million, and the proposed bill would increase this to $10 million. The maximum total reimbursement per project is currently $35 million, the bill would increase it to $100 million. 
Monks said the change was to keep up with the rising costs to do these projects. He said it acts like an “interest-free loan” for the state, as the developer fronts the cost for the highway projects that benefit the state. 
He emphasized that the program doesn’t use existing sales tax revenue, only the future revenue from the retailers.  
“We would never receive (that revenue) had the project not moved forward, or had to put the money in for that infrastructure ahead of time anyway,” he said.
House Assistant Minority Leader Rep. Steve Berch, D-Boise, said he’d vote to introduce the bill, but had concerns about potentially limiting the state’s future revenue. 
The committee unanimously voted to introduce the legislation, which will allow it to come back for a full public hearing.

The wolf collar was located in wolf management unit 313, which closed to hunting and trapping on Nov. 16 after hunters killed three wolves and met the localized quota.
Game wardens believe the collared wolf was killed around 10 p.m. on Christmas Day.

Newly filed political finance records show that all $1.55 million raised by the controversial ballot question campaign in its first few months came from SAM Action Inc., a national dark-money group that opposes legal drug use but is not required to disclose the source of its own funding. 
It’s the same organization that bankrolled opposition to a 2024 Massachusetts ballot question that sought to open up access to some psychedelic substances, which voters rejected. 
Massachusetts is not alone as a battleground, either. SAM Action is also the only donor behind a ballot question in Maine this cycle that would similarly prohibit recreational pot use there, as the Portland Press Herald reported. 
Both campaigns have generated scrutiny over their efforts to gather signatures from voters. 
In Massachusetts, opponents filed an objection alleging the campaign “obtained signatures fraudulently” by telling voters the measure would provide affordable housing or fund public parks, not that it would ban recreational marijuana. 
The State Ballot Law Commission heard arguments last week and is expected to rule by Friday. State law empowers the panel to determine whether signatures were placed on a ballot question petition “by fraud,” and its interpretation could set off a lengthier court battle over whether the question can go before voters. 
Similarly, Mainers have been alleging in recent weeks that they were misled about what the anti-marijuana petition would do when they signed it. Maine’s secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, said she’s received complaints about the topic, adding that she has no enforcement power because, as she put it to lawmakers, “You have a right to lie under the First Amendment.” 
Wendy Wakeman, a veteran Republican operative who is working as spokesperson for the repeal campaign, said the Massachusetts and Maine questions are “not a coordinated effort” despite funding coming from the same national group.  
SAM Action is a 501(c)(4) organization, so its donors are private, leaving unclear exactly who is putting major dollars toward shutting down an industry both Massachusetts and Maine voted nearly a decade ago to legalize. 
On its website, SAM Action claims affiliation with the nonprofit Smart Approaches to Marijuana group co-founded by former US Rep. Patrick Kennedy — a Democrat who represented Rhode Island, and the son of longtime US Sen. Ted Kennedy — along with former White House Office of National Drug Control Policy advisor Kevin Sabet and David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush who is now a senior editor at The Atlantic. 
Wakeman declined to comment on SAM Action’s primary donors. 
“Massachusetts is in the minority of states in the United States in which marijuana is available recreationally,” she told CommonWealth Beacon. “It should be unsurprising that national groups with health concerns are interested in helping Massachusetts craft better, safer marijuana laws.” 
While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, 24 states, two territories, and Washington, DC, allow recreational marijuana use by adults, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Several others decriminalized the drug without fully legalizing personal, non-medical use.  
President Trump last year also signed an executive order reclassifying marijuana as a drug with less potential for harm and dependence, signaling a softer position. SAM opposed that move. 
Voters in the Bay State approved recreational marijuana use in 2016 by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent. Since then, the industry has generated more than $8 billion in sales. 
The proposed ballot question would undo legalization of recreational pot use. It would leave the medical marijuana industry in place, but expand civil penalties for public possession above one ounce. 
The campaign committee working on the anti-recreational marijuana question in Massachusetts spent about $1.4 million in 2025, the vast majority of which went toward paid signature-gathering in an attempt to secure a spot on the 2026 ballot.  
Each campaign needed to collect at least 74,574 signatures from registered Massachusetts voters to clear an early hurdle en route to the 2026 ballot. Organizers will need another, smaller round of signatures later this year to lock in their spots. 
All ballot question campaigns must file 2025 year-end financial reports by the end of the day Tuesday. Several others have already disclosed significant fundraising and spending, with most of the money similarly going toward the arduous effort of gathering enough voter signatures. 
Under state law, the campaigns do not need to submit their next financial disclosures until September, keeping most of the fundraising and spending obscured from public view until close to the election. 
The Senate last week approved legislation that would require ballot question campaign committees to file financial reports at least monthly in election years. It’s not clear if or when the House will take up the measure.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_0419.jpg?fit=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-20 15:57:24.571904

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Darren Boykins has been in prison for 45 years despite being eligible for parole for nearly half that time — and despite his steadfast claim that he did not commit the 1981 murder that landed him behind bars.
Tuesday, he learned he’ll finally be free, after outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy commuted his sentence six weeks before his next parole eligibility date.
Boykins was one of 148 people Murphy granted clemency to on Tuesday morning in his final hours in office before the inauguration of New Jersey’s new governor, Mikie Sherrill.

His lawyer, John Crayton, has fought since 2024 to exonerate him and applauded the commutation while also vowing to continue his fight to prove Boykins was wrongfully convicted.
“This is not a happy ending. It’s just the next step. And it’s probably, hopefully, a much better place for Darren,” Crayton said. “I am determined to get the state of New Jersey to admit to their injustice 45 years ago. This should never have happened to him.”
Boykins was 19 when he was arrested in the May 22, 1981, slaying of carpet salesman Milton Laufer. He always insisted he was innocent and had an alibi the day of the murder. Investigators never found a murder weapon, and two witnesses repeatedly could not identify him as the killer. But jurors convicted him largely on the word of a jailhouse informant who later recanted.
Crayton found that authorities failed to divulge exculpatory evidence that could have cleared Boykins of suspicion and organized a photo lineup 39 days after the homicide that Crayton contends was improper. They also covered up or dismissed evidence that could have freed Boykins from jail in his post-conviction appeals and parole bids, Crayton said in a November court petition.
Boykins is now 64 and under psychiatric care at the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton. He’s expected to be released in the coming days to a program for parolees run by Volunteers of America Delaware Valley.
“I’m worried that he’s going to be in a place that he’s unfamiliar with, and he’ll be afraid,” Crayton said. “In any event, he’s going to be out of prison, and that’s a good thing. He’ll get to see his mother and brother and sisters, and that’s a good thing. He will be moving in a better direction for himself and for his family.”
With Tuesday’s clemencies, Murphy has pardoned or shortened the prison or parole sentences of 455 people in seven rounds of clemency actions since December 2024 — the most of all New Jersey governors combined over the past three decades.
Murphy said, though, that his clemency initiative “was never about numbers — it was about people.”

“Each pardon and commutation represents a story of accountability, growth, and redemption,” he said in a statement. “From the outset, we have been guided by a fundamental belief that mercy and fairness are essential to a system that truly serves everyone. By offering second chances to individuals who have demonstrated rehabilitation and a commitment to their communities, we have strengthened not only individual lives, but our entire state.”
More than 4,500 people have applied for clemency consideration since Murphy created a clemency advisory board in June 2024 to review their cases and recommend candidates for commutations and pardons.
Murphy and the board expedited applications from people convicted of non-violent offenses, domestic violence survivors whose offenses were connected to their victimization, and cases involving excessive trial penalties (where people got lengthier sentences at trial than what they were offered to plead guilty pre-trial). The approach was meant to make “fairness and not favor” the barometer for who gets clemency, they have said.
Still, several of the 97 pardons and 51 commutations announced Tuesday raised eyebrows, given the political connections of those awarded pardons or commutations.
They included Harris Jacobs, 28, an Atlantic City man accused of a fatal 2022 hit-and-run that left a pedestrian dead. Jacobs’ attorney told BreakingAC that he learned of his pardon even before jurors convicted him on Tuesday. Jacobs’ father, Joe Jacobs, is an attorney active in Democratic politics in Atlantic City.
Also pardoned was former Assemblyman Al Coutinho, an Essex County Democrat who was sentenced to three years of probation in 2013 after admitting he took money intended for his family’s charitable foundation.
Another clemency recipient was Mordechai Berkowitz, 24, of Lakewood, who prosecutors said had been speeding with a blood-alcohol content nearly twice the legal limit when he crashed into another car in 2022, killing a woman and seriously injuring another. A judge sentenced Berkowitz in December to six years in prison under the state No Early Release Act, but Murphy on Tuesday commuted his sentence so that he’ll be freed early in 2028 and on parole for three years afterward. His attorney is Lee Vartan, a former federal prosecutor whom Murphy in 2022 considered to become attorney general. Vartan also was second in command of New Jersey’s attorney general’s office during the Christie administration.
Others granted clemency are sure to stir controversy.

Joseph Grieco, a former Tenafly cop, had been sentenced last year to 11 years behind bars for fatally shooting his husband, John Kelly, a former New York City cop, in 2023 after a night of drinking. Murphy commuted his sentence, so that Grieco will be freed in 2029 and serve three years on parole after.
Michael Sica was president of a police union when he was sentenced to seven years for official misconduct, conspiracy, and related charges stemming from a cover-up prosecutors said he coordinated after Union County Jail guards beat immigrants detained there in 1995.
Other clemency recipients had convictions for offenses ranging from shoplifting and drug crimes that have since been decriminalized to murder and other felonies. Many had served lengthy prison and parole sentences.
Edwin “Chino” Ortiz and his brother Carmelo Ortiz were among those pardoned. The siblings were released from prison in 2016 after serving 30 years for a fatal robbery. In 2021, they founded the Newark-based Returning Citizens Support Group to help other people better reintegrate after leaving prison.
Since then, Chino Ortiz has become an advocate for better reentry policies, testifying for prison reforms at the Statehouse and calling for voting and jury service rights to be restored for people with criminal convictions.
Clemency removes reentry hurdles, such as employers and landlords denying people jobs and housing because of their past mistakes, he said.
“Many men and women that are coming home from incarceration are still facing discrimination because of their criminal background,” Chino Ortiz said. “It’s not fair for me and other people who have convictions not to be seen as every other citizen, especially after paying my debt to society and living productively. I can’t find the words to express how it feels to be given a second chance. It’s just really a great feeling.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach will pay a symbolic $1 sanction because he “should have known” better than to file a motion in a court that did not have jurisdiction.
Kobach, along with his solicitor general, Anthony Powell, was admonished and fined by District Judge Thomas Luedke in a long-running case regarding gender marker changes on driver’s licenses. 
Kobach filed the case in Shawnee County District Court in 2023 against David Harper, director of the Kansas Division of Vehicles, demanding that his division stop allowing gender changes on driver’s licenses. Harper has since retired from the position, and the current director is Deann Williams.
The case reached the Kansas Court of Appeals, which ruled against Kobach in finding there was no harm to allowing people to change their gender markers. In October, Kobach and Powell filed a motion once more in the district court, asking the division of vehicles to maintain a list of gender changes made on driver’s licenses. 
The state noted the division already maintains such a list – rendering the request “completely unnecessary.”
“Respondents seek sanctions against Petitioners contending that the motion was presented for an improper purpose, needlessly increased the cost of litigation, was contrary to the law, and essentially requested the Court disregard the mandate” of the Kansas Court of Appeals, the Division of Vehicles court filing said. 
The state asked the court to dismiss the motion, which violated three different legal principles. The court dismissed the motion and sanctioned Kobach and Powell for “filing a motion that they knew, or should have known, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider.”
Rep. John Carmichael, D-Wichita, said the handling of this lawsuit was another example of Kobach’s ineptitude. 
“I am getting tired of reading orders, opinions, rulings, etc., that continue to point out that our attorney general is wrong on the facts, wrong on the law and doesn’t seem to recognize it,” he said. “I don’t know what it’s going to take. Judge (Julie) Robinson ordered the attorney general to take remedial, basic legal classes because he didn’t understand the rules of evidence in her court.”
Carmichael was referring to a high-profile federal court case in 2018, when Robinson found Kobach in contempt and struck down his signature law that required new voters to prove their citizenship.
Kobach consistently engages in “bad lawyering,” as shown by judges who have sanctioned him, Carmichael said. He also noted Kobach in the House Judiciary Committee last week “flat out misrepresents the holding of the Court of Appeals.”
“He impugns then-Chief Judge (Karen) Arnold-Burger’s opinion in the case, suggesting that the court ignored his evidence, when in fact, that is simply not true,” Carmichael said. “In the case in the court of appeals, the court went through witness by witness, describing why the attorney general had once again engaged in bad lawyering and failed to prove his case.”
In a news conference on the first day of the legislative session, House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, D-Lenexa, also questioned Kobach’s approach on the gender markers court case. 
“The Republicans can’t even define what ‘diversity, equity and inclusion’ is across the state, so a legal, statutory definition is probably where they should start when it comes to the gender markers,” he said. “Once again, Kris Kobach has lost in court and is asking the Legislature to clean up his mess.”
Danedri Herbert, Kobach’s spokeswoman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the judge’s sanction.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA010120-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-20 15:57:24.571904

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Days after news leaked of a criminal investigation of Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey over their handling of immigration enforcement in Minnesota, the U.S. Department of Justice has delivered subpoenas to the offices of Walz and Frey, as well as St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty.
The New York Times first reported the delivery of the subpoenas, and other national outlets also confirmed that reporting.
The subpoenas are an extraordinary escalation of the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and Minnesota, where heavily-armed, masked federal agents now outnumber all the metro police departments combined, frequently using tactics a federal judge has called unconstitutional.
When the investigation became public last week, Walz replied in a statement: “Two days ago it was Elissa Slotkin. Last week it was Jerome Powell. Before that, Mark Kelly,” he said, referring to the U.S. senators who made a video telling U.S. servicemembers that they can and must refuse illegal orders, as well as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who has refused to lower interest rates as quickly as Trump desires. “Weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic,” Walz said.
Ellison, who’s sued the Trump administration more than 30 times in the past year, said the investigation is being used to distract: “Instead of seriously investigating the killing of Renee Good, Trump is weaponizing the justice system against any leader who dares stand up to him,” referring to the Minneapolis woman shot by federal officer Jonathan Ross earlier this month. “Donald Trump is coming after the people of Minnesota and I’m standing in his way. I will not be intimidated and I will not stop working to protect Minnesotans from Trump’s campaign of retaliation and revenge,” Ellison said.
Frey called the investigation “an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement and our residents against the chaos and danger this administration has brought to our streets.”
He added: “I will not be intimidated.”
Her, whose tenure as St. Paul mayor began earlier this month, said in a statement that Trump “promised retribution, and consistent with that promise, we received a subpoena today from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. I am unfazed by these tactics, and I stand firm in my commitment to protect our residents, neighbors and community.”
The Washington Post reported that “the subpoenas suggest that the Justice Department is examining whether Walz’s and Frey’s public statements disparaging the surge of officers and federal actions have amounted to criminal interference in law enforcement work.”
Walz, who announced earlier this month he won’t seek a third term, also used his statement last week to criticize the federal government for not properly investigating the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross. “The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her,” he said.
Six prosecutors in the Minnesota Office of U.S. Attorney quit last week, The New York Times reported, because they objected to their bosses’ push to investigate the widow of Good and their ties to anti-ICE groups.
The ICE surge, which has put as many as 3,000 federal agents in the state — or nearly five times the number of sworn officers with the Minneapolis Police Department — is just the latest round of an ongoing conflict between Minnesota and the federal government. Fraud in Minnesota’s social programs — often funded in whole or part by the federal government — has caught the attention of right-wing media and activists, and the Trump administration has followed with a wide array of investigations of Minnesota programs across a range of agencies.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is auditing Hennepin Healthcare — Minnesota’s largest safety net hospital — for compliance with immigrant employment eligibility laws.
The Trump administration has frozen child care payments and halted small business grants. The administration also says it’s investigating possible housing assistance fraud and looking into Minnesota’s unemployment insurance program. The federal government has also attempted to withhold funds to Minnesota for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, but a federal court issued a preliminary injunction.
Earlier this week, Trump said he would cut all federal funding to Minnesota and other states that have sanctuary cities beginning Feb. 1, but it’s unclear what that means and few details have been released.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MG_8042-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 15:57:24.571904

Democrats plan to prioritize affordability, voting access and reducing gun violence. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Alabama House Democrats said on Tuesday that they will prioritize affordability issues for the coming session in response to the tariffs and cuts to federal food and health care programs.
Democratic leadership also said they will focus on making it easier for farmers to sell their commodities directly to consumers; making it easier to vote addressing gun violence that continues to plague the state, particularly in the larger urban areas.
“We have always talked about affordability, it is just this year we are squarely focusing on affordability because the timing is right,” said House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville. “Every time we build an agenda, we do a needs assessment of the state, and we develop the agenda based upon that.”

Democrats only hold 29 seats in the 105-member House and have limited ability to influence overall legislative priorities. But House Democrats are hoping to respond to the affordability issues through different economic mechanisms. Among them is to introduce legislation to make it easier for farmers to sell their goods to consumers.
“Our approach now is going to be focusing primarily on how we increase the production from our local farmers throughout the state, what do those investments need to look like, how do we get our grocery stores and other vendors to be able to buy from local farmers,” Daniels said.
Daniels also criticized cuts made in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump last summer, to health insurance and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
“People are hurting because of the cuts at the federal level as a result of the ‘Not So Beautiful Bill,’” Daniels said at the news conference. “Looking at the funding from a health care standpoint, we are getting $203 million, whereas during the Cares Act, we had significantly more money to distribute across the state of Alabama.”
Daniels acknowledged the Legislature’s past efforts to reduce the state grocery tax by half, going from 4 cents to 2 cents, but said that difference is miniscule compared to the impact that inflation has had in recent years.
House Democrats extended the affordability theme to voter access.
“When we talk about voting rights and fair district maps, can we afford to make it harder for eligible citizens to vote?” said Rep. Adline Clarke, D-Mobile. “Can we afford politically gerrymandered district maps in which politicians pick their voters instead of voters having the right to pick the candidates of their choice?”
Alabama has already had to redraw its congressional districts in the wake of the Milligan case. In a separate case, a judge ordered a redrawing of the state Senate map.
HB 45, sponsored by Clarke, allows a person who wants to vote by absentee ballot to designate another individual to deliver the absentee ballot application and the ballot to the election manager.
Clarke, along with Rep. Thomas Jackson, D-Thomasville, filed HB 270, to allow early voting in Alabama to boost voter participation rate in the state. Voter participation in the 2024 presidential election in Alabama was  58.5%, the lowest since 1988.
Finally, House leadership said it wants to reduce gun violence that has plagued Alabama and tied it to allowing permitless carry in the state.
“What is it going to take before we address this crisis?” said Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile. “We can’t afford to lose more children due to the overwhelming amount of guns that are on our street.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260120_110734-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-20 15:57:24.571904

(Photo by Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty Images)Florida doctors, school counselors, or psychologists could face third-degree felony charges and $100,000 in fines if they advise minors to undergo transgender therapies under a bill that cleared its first committee Tuesday.
Passing with just one “no” vote, SB 1010 would punish providers who “aid and abet” minors in receiving transitioning procedures and empower the attorney general to investigate alleged violations. The bill would expand a 2023 law that outlawed any surgeries, medications, or other procedures allowing children to transition their genders.
“The intent of this bill is to continue to protect the children of Florida and hold bad actors accountable,” bill sponsor Sen. Clay Yarborough, a Jacksonville Republican, said before the Committee on Children, Families, and Elder Affairs. Yarborough had carried the 2023 law.
The political discussion surrounding medical care for transgender Americans has dominated culture issues nationwide. Arkansas was the first state to ban minors from accessing gender therapies in 2021, precipitating a trend that spread to other red states like Alabama and Florida.
And while Florida wasn’t first on that legislation, Gov. Ron DeSantis, in advance of his 2024 presidential bid, led the nation in carving out “anti-woke” policies and culture war crusades. This included a ban on transwoman athletes competing in women’s sports, elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in higher education, and outlawing discussions of sexual identity in K-8 classrooms.
These cultural issues largely tapered off after the governor dropped out of the presidential race and amid an increasingly rebellious Republican Legislature, which somewhat slipped out of DeSantis’ grasp during the 2025 legislative session.
But that doesn’t mean all social issues are gone from the Legislature.
‘Great deal of concern’
Under the bill, a health care practitioner who “aids or abets” another in prescribing or assisting a minor in sex-reassignment procedures commits a third-degree felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison. Additionally, the attorney general could investigate and seek up to $100,000 per violation from offenders. That money would go to the child who received treatment.
The bill provides for a private cause of action against a state or local government employee who violates Florida’s “Parents’ Bill of Rights,” which guarantees parents the right to direct the upbringing, education, health care, and mental health care of their children. Similarly, the AG could seek civil penalties up to $100,000 per violation to be paid to the minor.
Although Yarborough emphasized that his measure attempts to create greater enforcement actions and to close loopholes in the 2023 law, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers raised concerns that the bill may be too broad, and could result in punishing teachers for simply having a discussion with a child considering confirming his or her gender identity.
“I hope we can clarify that … a simple conversation, coming to someone with a problem asking for help, does not move to the level that you wind up liable for advising a student,” said Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell of Stuart. She ultimately voted for the bill, but cautioned that doesn’t mean she’ll continue to do so.
“I will work with you, but I have a great deal of concern with it,” she added.
SB 1010 would expand upon the 2023 law, which allows for third-degree felony charges against a doctor who prescribes gender transitioning medications or performs transitioning surgeries on a minor.
Florida was one of a handful of states that faced constitutional challenges to laws like this, and initially had its enforcement paused because of federal trial court rulings.
However, a federal appeals court stayed the lower courts’ injunctions. In a similar vein, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s ban on prescribing puberty blockers and hormone therapy for treatment of gender dysphoria to minors.
The House version of the bill also passed its first committee Tuesday in a party-line vote. Both bills have two more committee stops before a floor vote.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1323919275-scaled-1-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2026-01-20 15:57:24.571904

Michelle Lujan Grisham's last chance to codify her climate goals.,"A pumpjack operates north of Carlsbad, NM. (Photo by Jerry Redfern/Capital & Main)
New Mexico’s 2026 legislative session marks the last chance for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s policy initiatives to become law while she’s still in office: Her term-limited tenure winds up at the end of the year. Meanwhile, the session begins, as ever, with concerns over revenue from the state’s biggest private-sector funder, the oil and gas industry.
Booming oil production in New Mexico’s portion of the Permian Basin has driven state budgets to record highs in recent years. But in 2025, the state’s oil production rose only slightly while crude oil prices dropped dramatically — down roughly 25% since President Donald Trump returned to office last January.
In its December revenue report, state economists with the Legislative Finance Committee said, The state’s “current price softness now outweighs production growth as the dominant downward influence on revenue projections.” Put plainly, slower production increases coupled with much lower oil prices will lead to a shallower growth curve in future revenues for the state.

Even if it’s slowing, that production still creates a lot of pollution. Lujan Grisham’s third executive order upon taking office in 2019 was to set the state on a path to a 45% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Despite repeated attempts in the Legislature, that goal has not yet been codified in law.
Meanwhile, the state’s Climate Action Plan released last month upped the challenge, angling for an 82% reduction by 2050, with carbon offsets covering the remainder to achieve net zero emissions.
Carbon offsets — in which a company reduces or removes carbon from the environment in one place to offset emissions elsewhere — may be the controversial change that finally gets the governor’s 2019 policy over the line and signed into law.
“This is the session to pass comprehensive climate legislation,” said Camilla Feibelman, director of the Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter.
Last year’s Clear Horizons & Greenhouse Gas Emissions Act was the latest attempt to codify Lujan Grisham’s executive order. All attempts have died, with last year’s effort being voted down when two Democrats — Sens. Benny Shendo (D-Jemez Pueblo) and George Muñoz (D-Gallup) — joined all Republicans in a Senate committee hearing to kill it.
Like earlier versions, it called for direct reduction and removal of greenhouse gases at their sources. That requirement met stiff opposition from the oil and gas industry, which would have to dramatically reduce leaks, venting and flaring across the board. The act died following an ad campaign by the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association decrying the bill and the bill’s main sponsor, Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Bernalillo), who is also president pro tempore of the Senate.
Stewart again is the main sponsor of a new version of the Clear Horizons & Greenhouse Gas Emissions Act, this year’s attempt to cement the governor’s executive order into law. But the senator’s bill has changed over the past 12 months. She described its main points in a phone call, since it had not been filed as of publication.
“Overall, the bill is shorter and leaner,” she said. In addition, it specifically exempts people or businesses emitting less than 10,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases annually. Earlier versions of the bill “never attempted to scoop in those small emitters,” Stewart said, and the explicit carve-out should make it more palatable to more legislators.
The biggest change comes in how reductions can be counted. The new bill would allow certified reductions through carbon offsets as opposed to direct reductions at the point of pollution. Stewart said offsets could include soil and agriculture improvements or carbon capture projects. She stipulated that the offsets “have to be in New Mexico, and they have to be real, permanent, quantifiable, verifiable and enforceable.”
Stewart added: “The certification process will be in-house, will be in state” and will be conducted by the New Mexico Environment Department.
“We’re not going to farm this out to a bogus certification company,” she said.
She said the change adding offsets emerged after meetings with small and large oil and gas producers, including EOG Resources Inc., Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips Co. Stewart said the Chevron representative was Patrick Killen, a registered lobbyist who for the past few election cycles has been the largest single contributor to New Mexico politicians — more than $2.3 million between 2021 and 2025 — on behalf of his employer, according to state campaign finance records. He did not respond to requests for comment.
Stewart said she did not meet with the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association. “That was not very helpful last year,” she said. “It’s much better to actually meet with the oil and gas industry themselves.”
Asked about the return of the bill, Missi Currier, president and CEO of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said only, “If [it is] filed, NMOGA will request feedback from membership to determine a position on the bill.”
Michael Coleman, director of communications for Lujan Grisham, said, “The governor is interested in all technologies that can help reduce our carbon footprint, and she appreciates [Stewart’s] work to provide options for companies doing business and technology development in the state.”
For years now globally, carbon offsets have been a controversial form of greenhouse emission reduction that often don’t meet stated goals and have been tainted by allegations of fraud. Industrial-scale carbon capture and sequestration projects also have a checkered history of not meeting either budgetary or sequestration goals.
Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the nonprofit Western Environmental Law Center, said that his group will not take a position on the bill until it is publicly filed. But, he said, “Offsets are fraught with peril and deeply problematic.” He pointed to the history of verification problems associated with them and added, “We also don’t like them because the fossil fuel industry uses them to greenwash their operations.”
However, the offsets may be “a necessary concession to secure buy-in from certain industry-friendly legislators,” he said.
“I do understand the political logic,” Schlenker-Goodrich said. “The question is whether the logic works.”
If the bill passes this session, it would require implementation rules to be drawn up and approved by the Environment Department’s Environmental Improvement Board.
Schlenker-Goodrich said the new rules wouldn’t be “a guarantee of success by any means, but it does provide some assurance that the bill would be implemented in a pragmatic and effective manner.” There will be “lots of angels and devils in the details,” he said.
“Offsets can mean a lot of different things, and with strong, technical rulemaking I think we can avoid the worst,” Feibelman said.
The new Clear Horizons Act isn’t the only climate- and oil-and-gas-related bill that will be debated this session. Stewart said she will propose a big bump in tax credits for new solar installations, increasing the current 10% state tax credit to 30% to make up for the loss of a federal 30% credit that was killed by the Trump administration.
The New Mexico Oil and Gas Association is also looking forward to some legislation. Last session, regular public comments called for the industry to clean up abandoned well sites and other infrastructure. Republican legislators pushed back, arguing that money from the state Reclamation Fund — the purpose of which is, in part, to pay those costs — was siphoned off to pay for items in the state’s general budget.
Reporting last year by Capital & Main highlighted how oil and gas producers can fail, leaving behind unplugged wells and leaking equipment to degrade in New Mexico’s high desert climate. Depending on the size of the failure, a cleanup can cost state and federal agencies millions. A report published last summer by the Legislative Finance Committee warned that the state could be responsible for $700 million to $1.6 billion in cleanup costs in coming years. In April last year, the Reclamation Fund had $66.7 million, its highest balance ever, according to the report.
Currier and others want to update the fund to make sure more of that money goes toward oil and gas field cleanup.
“The Reclamation Fund, funded exclusively by the oil and gas industry, is the state’s best and most underutilized resource to ensure our lands are returned to their native state safely and efficiently,” she said.
*   *   *
Last year’s legislative session ended in March with four huge numbers:

$10.8 billion.
$10 billion.
$400 million.
$300 million.

The first figure is the total state budget passed by the Legislature in 2025 — a record.
The second is the amount Rep. Derrick J. Lente (D-Sandia Pueblo) claimed oil and gas companies made in profits in New Mexico in 2024. He brought this up during a committee hearing as an argument in favor of an increase in oil taxes so they would match the tax paid on natural gas extracted in the state.
The third is the amount that the proposed oil tax increase could have added to state coffers this year had it passed in its original form, according to the Legislative Finance Committee. That proposal, following several debates, shrinkage and its addition to another tax bill, eventually died.
And the last number is the amount that the Rio Grande Chapter of the Sierra Club tallied as money spent on climate change mitigation and economic programs in the state’s final budget last year.
It’s unclear if the oil tax change will reappear at this session. Its sponsors, Reps. Nathan Small (D-Doña Ana) and Meredith Dixon (D-Bernalillo), did not respond to requests for comment.
It is clear that New Mexico faces another warm and dry winter. “This winter has just been the epitome of what a climate change winter is,” said Feibelman, the Sierra Club director. “There is no explanation for what’s going on except for climate change”
December 2025 was the warmest December on record for many towns and cities in New Mexico. The year was the fourth-warmest on record for the country and the third-warmest for the planet.
“It’s just no longer possible to ignore what climate change looks like or the people who power climate change,” Feibelman said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC1659_01-1024x681.jpg,,,2026-01-20 14:57:20.060499

Michelle Lujan Grisham’s last in office. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)A New Mexico House Republican leader said at a news conference at the beginning of the 30-day legislative session that Republicans have become “unlikely allies” with Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on issues like crime and health care as she heads into her final year in office.
State Rep. Rebecca Dow (R-Truth or Consequences) reflected at a Roundhouse news conference Tuesday on how the relationship between House Republicans and the governor has changed since Lujan Grisham took office in 2019. She said the GOP and Lujan Grisham have found themselves aligning more lately due to what she described as a progressive shift in the majority Democratic Legislature.
“The governor’s door is open, and especially for Republicans, around the issues that the progressive majority refused to move on,” Dow said. “And that has been around reforms with crime and the health care crisis that we’re facing in New Mexico.”
In addition to passing a budget during the 30-day session, Lujan Grisham is expected to put other items on the agenda for lawmakers that Republicans said Tuesday they’ve spent years advocating for, including juvenile criminal justice reform and health care changes. 
New Mexico 2026 legislative session kicks off Tuesday

“We’ve become unlikely allies,” Dow said. “And I think it’s an indication of how misaligned this legislative body is with the people they’re supposed to represent.”
Dow’s comments came ahead of Lujan Grisham’s final State of the State address as governor on the opening day of a packed legislative session. The governor is urging the Legislature to change the state’s criminal code regarding juvenile offenders, as well as address a state doctor shortage through interstate medical compacts and medical malpractice reforms. 
When it comes to criminal justice reform, the governor relied on Republicans to introduce a host of bills legislation during a special legislative session in July 2024 that ended in just five hours after Democrats in the majority refused to take up the bills. The governor has continued calling on Democrats to do more regarding criminal justice since then, including at the end of the legislative session last year. 
The governor also agreed to put medical reforms on the agenda for the session, which House Republicans said Tuesday was a result of pressure from them and the public at large. Senate Democrats, who previously stymied efforts to enter the medical compacts, announced recently that they expect to enter two such compacts for doctors and social workers this session.
However, House Democrats and House Republicans are urging the Legislature to enter more of them this session. Rep. Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena) said at the news conference that she expects the governor to join the House in pressuring the Senate to pass more compacts than just the two. 
“So the pressure’s there. New Mexico wants these compacts. Is the legislature willing to do it?” she said. “We in the House of Representatives — Republicans — we’re ready to do it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_3920-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 14:57:20.060499

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)A measure (SB 484) revising state law regarding regulation of large-scale data centers and certain other large electricity users received its first hearing in a legislative committee in Tallahassee on Tuesday.
The proposal, introduced by Sen. Bryan Avila, R-Miami Springs, is the first bill in the Florida Legislature to address concerns about the intense energy demand by Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centers.
Data centers’ projected electricity demand in 2030 has been set at to up to 130 gigawatts, which would represent close to 12% of total U.S. annual demand, according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute.
Avila’s bill would require the Public Service Commission (PSC) to develop minimum large load tariff requirements for public electric utilities to reasonably ensure that big customers (such as large data centers) pay for their own cost of service and that the general body of ratepayers do not bear the risk of non-payment of such costs.
It specifies that agencies may not enter into non-disclosure agreements or other contract language restricting disclosure of information about a potential data center development to the public.
And it continues to maintains authority of local governments to exercise their powers of comprehensive planning and land development regulations granted by law with respect to large-load customers.
The proposal was greeted favorably by representatives of consumer advocacy groups.
“We have nearly 150,000 members across the state, and we’re very concerned about undue burdens on them as ratepayers,” said Heaven Campbell, Florida director of Solar United Neighbors (SUN) Action. “I believe that we have to figure this out before the damage is done.”
However, some organizations believe the measure goes too far in regulating the emerging industry.
“Florida can either welcome billions in capital investment into high-wage jobs and substantial tax revenue, or we can erect barriers that send these projects to Texas, Georgia, and North Carolina,” warned Turner Loesel, a policy analyst with the James Madison Institute. 
His organization believes ratepayer protections “matter,” he said, but contended that several provisions in the bill go “beyond consumer protections” and threaten to place Florida behind other states in competition for such projects.
“Other states are rolling out the red carpet, while we roll out the red tape,” he said.
FOMO
Sen. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, said he appreciated parts of the bill that would protect local governments when it comes to water use, but argued the Legislature must encourage data centers to be located in Florida.
“It’s not like we can say, ‘We don’t like this.’ This will go to Georgia, and we will never recover,” he warned — adding that with the state’s military bases and university system, “there are umpteen uses for having these centers located in Florida.”
The measure ultimately passed unanimously in the Senate Regulated Industries Committee.
A related measure (SB 1118), which would provide an exemption from public records disclosure for information relating to the plans, intentions, or interest of a person to locate a data center for 12 months, also was approved, though Sen. Jason Pizzo, independent from Sunny Isles Beach, voted no.
“This really, really puts local officials in a tough spot about what they are and are not allowed to say and talk about,” he said.
Committee Chair Jennifer Bradley, R-Fleming Island, said she agreed with Sen. Pizzo’s remarks but opted to support the bill at its first committee stop. “I do think these provisions are a little broad in terms of for local governments,” she said.
Avila vowed to work on tightening the language as the bill advances through committees. It would become law on the same day that SB 484 would take effect, which would be July 1, 2026.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/data-centers-VA.jpg,,,2026-01-20 14:57:20.060499
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-20 19:45:27+00:00,CT Mirror,CT correction ombuds details ‘institutional failure’ in prison conditions report,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/conditions-of-confinement-report-correction-ombuds-ct/,"The 2025 Conditions of Confinement report examined several aspects of prison life, from food service to technology to medical care.","A report released Tuesday by the Correction Ombuds DeVaughn Ward on the conditions of Connecticut’s state correctional facilities concluded that the system is “operating in a state of sustained institutional failure.” 
The 2025 Conditions of Confinement report examined several aspects of prison life, from food service to technology to medical care. The report described unsanitary conditions — like rodents, black mold and sewage backups — as well as delays in necessary medical care and staffing shortages that regularly confined incarcerated people to their cells.
Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, said Commissioner Angel Quiros had sent Ward a letter saying the department “‘strongly objects to [the] grossly overstated and unsupported generalization,’ that the correctional system is operating in a state of ‘sustained institutional failure.’”
Banevicius said the ombuds’ report included “a number of allegations which are unsupported in either fact or law and appear to serve only to foster an extremely negative perception of the agency.”
Banevicius said that there is always “room for improvement” within the department. But he said, in certain cases, Ward had incorrectly portrayed singular incidents as problems that affected all the facilities. He also said that DOC had intentionally alerted Ward to many of the concerns in the report.  
“Any implication that the DOC has disregarded any of the concerns raised is simply not true,” Banevicius said. 
Food and living conditions
Findings in the report were based, in part, on complaints the ombuds received from incarcerated people and their family members.
In June, Ward received a complaint that mice were running through New Haven Correctional Center.
At Hartford Correctional Center, rodents became so pervasive that the facility had to shut down the kitchen for three to four weeks over the summer, according to the report.
In July, Ward heard from the relative of an incarcerated person that there were sewage backups at Bridgeport Correctional Center, “feces and urine throughout the facility[,] all over the floor.” 
At York Correctional Institution, Ward heard there were only one or two showers available for 25 women, amid ongoing maintenance. He was also told of shortages in hygiene supplies, including toilet paper. According to one complaint, a memo was sent out telling residents they’d have to purchase their own toilet paper through the commissary. 
Ward also found black mold, a build-up of dust and debris on air vents and on surveillance cameras at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution, and shower vents covered in grey mold at Hartford CC during tours of the facilities he took in 2024 and 2025. 
High levels of heat in the summer have exacerbated these conditions, Ward said.

Incarcerated women at York CI wrote to the ombuds in 2024 complaining about the quality of the food being served. One recounted receiving spoiled milk and moldy food and finding rodent droppings in the food. Another described the food as “barely edible,” often with freezer burn or “as hard as hockey pucks.” 
“They recently stopped providing peanut butter with breakfast on Thursdays, which had been part of the regular menu for decades. Kitchen staff told us that peanut butter is ‘too expensive,’ which is hard to believe,” the person incarcerated at York said in their complaint, which was quoted in the ombuds’ report. “While incarcerated individuals are served whatever is put together, kitchen staff use the same state-provided food to prepare meals for themselves, including burgers and French fries — items that incarcerated individuals do not receive.” 
Several other incarcerated individuals and their family members raised concerns that the diet in correctional facilities makes people more vulnerable to high cholesterol, diabetes and hypertension. 
Ward said that while conducting inspections at the facilities, he saw “visibly unclean kitchen equipment and food preparation areas.” He recommended the department bring in professional contractors to address the mold, rodents and buildup on the vents, rather than relying on incarcerated men and women. Ward also suggested that the department’s food services coordinate with medical staff to make sure that people with medically-necessary diets were getting the food they need. 
Incarcerated people should also have more frequent showers, laundry and bedding changes during extreme heat, the report said.

Medical 
Reports of failures to provide adequate medical care to people housed in state correctional facilities have made headlines, including a recent report from the state inspector general that found “significant medical errors” in the prescription of methadone and other prescribed drugs, which led to the death of two men in Garner Correctional Institution. 
According to Tuesday’s ombuds’ report, Ward’s office has received more than 143 medical-related complaints since September 2024. 
In one case, Ward received a complaint that a man housed at Carl Robinson Correctional Institution was having flu-like symptoms for a significant period of time, and later began experiencing rectal bleeding. Despite repeated requests, he was not seen by a medical professional. 
Another complaint recounted that a family member incarcerated at Osborn Correctional Institution had chest pain for four months and discovered “a palpable lump in the center of his chest.” Rather than send him for further testing, the complaint alleged, correctional staff gave him ibuprofen. 
The family member of a person at York CI wrote that their loved one had tried to get medical attention for a recurring ear condition. By the time the individual was sent to UConn Health, the condition had progressed and required two surgeries. 
Ward also received complaints from York CI about delays in receiving glasses and contact lenses. Osborn CI hasn’t had an optometrist at the facility for two years. 
One person at MacDougall-Walker waited nearly a year for a recommended colonoscopy. And at Corrigan Correctional Center, people with psychotic disorders were allegedly taken off their antipsychotic medications and prescribed new drugs, “resulting in periods of untreated psychosis.” 
Ward did not offer recommendations directly related to medical care, but he noted that the department has no centralized system to keep track of how long incarcerated people have been waiting to see a doctor or a specialist, which he said “constrains both internal quality-improvement efforts and external oversight.”  
Staff
Lockdowns at facilities across Connecticut have been a near-constant source of complaints from incarcerated men and women. In July, frequent lockdowns became one of the top complaints from several men at Cheshire Correctional Institution who held a hunger strike in protest of conditions at the facility. 
According to the ombuds’ report, between 2015 and 2024 the number of correction officers declined by roughly 11% to 3,500. During the same period, the number of incarcerated people in the state declined by 34%. 
Lockdowns can lead to cancelled programming, recreation time, family visits — even showers. An advocate who wrote to Ward, as well as an incarcerated person, both noted that lockdowns often happened on holidays.
Ward suggested that the department explore the possibility of bringing back retired correction officers to staff the prisons, allowing counselors and other non-correctional staff to take on more responsibilities, and creating plans to prioritize things like medical care and visits during lockdowns. 
Ward also flagged reports from DOC staff and a complaint from an incarcerated person’s attorney that incarcerated men and women were being retaliated against for speaking with his office. “Officers have made statements such as ‘you threw us under the bus’ and ‘now you’re in for it,’” the attorney told Ward. 
He also noted the presence of certain political symbols at the facilities, such as the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag, which he recommended removing. He suggested that the department enforce stronger protections against retaliation and restrict the use of lockdowns outside of non-emergency situations. 
Libraries and communications
In October, Ward asked the Department of Correction to suspend its contract with the Inmate Legal Assistance Program, or ILAP, claiming it has done little to help people seeking to file court cases from prison. 
Ward said in Tuesday’s report that he’d received multiple complaints about the lack of law libraries and legal help at different facilities. York CI, the state’s only women’s facility, has no law library. A complaint from a family member whose loved one was incarcerated in the Walker portion of MacDougall-Walker, said their family member was unable to access the library in MacDougall. 
Ward recommended that York, along with the four county facilities that do not have libraries, should install law libraries for the people being held there, and that the department allow incarcerated men and women to access more records on electronic tablets. He also noted that at Osborn CI, incarcerated men were not allowed to make copies of legal records, meaning they had to wait for staff to make the copies, which had led to delays. 
Requiring staff to copy or approve documents, Ward said, could “chill the filing of grievances or legal actions related to conditions of confinement.” 
Ward said he’d also received complaints about incarcerated men and women having to wait long periods to access tablet devices, which “effectively deprive[s] incarcerated individuals of communication, information, and programming services.” 
Even when tablets are available, they don’t always work. An incarcerated person at MacDougall-Walker told Ward in a complaint that Wi-Fi at the facility regularly went out for days at a time. 
One family member complained that the communications app frequently crashes, making it difficult for them to communicate with the incarcerated person. And they said the app’s customer service representatives were unhelpful.
Incarcerated men and women also complained about cancelled video visits, sometimes at the last minute because of facility lockdowns.
In addition to recommending suspension of the ILAP contract, Ward said the department should seek to partner with the state Division of Public Defender Services  and other legal aid organizations to offer assistance to incarcerated individuals.

Rogers, a former Congressman who represented a mid-Michigan district from 2001 to 2015, sat on the company’s cybersecurity and technical innovations board for more than five years, earning nearly $100,000 in compensation as a result, according to public financial disclosures filed during his 2024 run for the U.S. Senate and his most recent bid.
When asked, Rogers’ campaign claimed that it was the first the former representative knew of the connection between Telefonica and the Maduro regime, despite the incident being widely reported by both a Spanish news outlet and The Washington Post.
Rogers’ campaign also said that his work with the board largely focused on advising Telefonica’s cybersecurity division on technical items and threats from China.
The campaign further blamed Democrats working against him for drawing a connection to him and Maduro that it claims did not exist, and chalked it up to “fake news about a former House Intelligence Chair and national security expert having ties to the very regime he has outspokenly condemned, and celebrated the downfall of.”
“Mike merely served on a technology advisory board, where he advised on how to stop the Chinese Communist Party from infecting the company’s networks,” said Rogers spokesperson Alyssa Brouliet. “This is nothing more than a flailing attempt to distract from the fact that the Michigan Democrat candidates are out-of-touch with working people and consistently trailing Mike Rogers by every barometer.”
The campaign was asked to provide Michigan Advance with a job description outlining Rogers’ role with the company showing that his work was focused solely on China.
An offer letter from Telefonica outlining Rogers’ role states that he would provide the board with “input, ideas and expert advice about Telefonica’s security decisions as requested by the company from time to time” according to the board’s specific charter.
The offer letter does not, however, specifically note that Rogers’ input and expertise was solely focused on Chinese security and network threats.










For years, there have been suspicions about the pervasiveness of tapped calls and the excessive and unjustified monitoring of other forms of communication, but this report has shed a light for the first time on the real scope of this threat to civil and digital rights across the country. 


– Watchdog group Ve Sin Filtro on the handing over of data by Telefonica to the Venezuelan government.


Whether Rogers knew the extent of the company’s collaboration with the Venezuelan government while he worked for Telefonica between April 2018 and October 2024 remains an open question, but what is certain is that Rogers has not publicly denounced the collaboration between Telefonica and the former Maduro regime.
The Advance asked Rogers’ campaign if it would do so now. The campaign responded only with the comment published in this story and a copy of his job description.
Rogers has, in the inverse, publicly praised President Donald Trump taking military action to depose Maduro, extradite him to the U.S. and put the former dictator up on drug trafficking charges in New York.
Rogers has a history of positioning himself as a major critic of Maduro 
Maduro came into power following Hugo Chavez’s death in 2013 and remained the head of state until the U.S. government, under the Trump regime, took action against Maduro earlier this month.
On the day Maduro was captured, Rogers made a public statement praising Trump’s action.
“President Trump sent a loud and clear message: don’t mess with the US. Any foreign adversary who tries to kill Americans will pay the price. Bin Laden learned that lesson when I served as House Intel Chair,” Rogers said in a statement. “Today, Maduro was held accountable for endangering our nation with deadly poison. More Americans have died from drug overdose since 2018 than in World War I, World War II, & the Vietnam War combined. The crisis has to stop. Thankfully, President Trump is taking bold action to keep our communities safe. Our borders are secure, murders in US cities are down with drug interdiction and deportation of criminal illegal aliens, and waterborne drugs running into the US are down over 90%. Now, we’re bringing narcoterrorists to justice.”
A search of Rogers’ social media pages shows that he was quick to criticize both Maduro, in 2019, and former President Joe Biden, in 2024, over crime and immigration issues.
Rogers, as a featured guest on WOOD 106.9 FM, stated his belief that the world was better off without Maduro in power.
In 2019, Rogers posted to X, then Twitter, an article from insightcrime.org detailing criminal connections between Maduro and drug traffickers — an early pretext for charging Maduro with the crimes he now faces in the U.S. The article exposes what a former head of Venezuelan military intelligence witnessed in his time working for the regime, which included top figures in Maduro’s political orbit allowing drug traffickers to move freely in and out of Venezuela.
“This is the real Venezuela,” Rogers wrote in that post.
In 2024, Rogers criticized former President Joe Biden in a series of posts on X, saying the former president should declare the Tren de Aragua criminal gang a terrorist organization. Rogers brings up Maduro again in one post, as well.

It’s past time Joe Biden declares Tren da Aragua for what it is: An international criminal organization, terrorizing Americans.
Maduro is emptying his prisons and flooding America with dangerous criminals through our wide open border. Enough is enough.

An interview with Rogers conducted by former congressman Dave Camp for the University of Michigan’s Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy notes that the podcast was a vehicle to share his insider knowledge of foreign policy, federal police work and security insights.
Much of his work with the boards he served on in his post-congressional life centered around the same insider knowledge. Still, Rogers’ campaign said that it had first heard about Telefonica’s connection to Maduro, through its business in Venezuela, when the Advance had asked for a comment in the course of reporting this story.
The Telefonica-Maduro connection was widely reported in 2021
Telefonica’s security and cybersecurity advisory council was created in 2018, which the company said would reinforce its digital and comprehensive security strategy, as well as play a role in protecting its own assets and the data of its customers.
The council included Rogers, and highlighted his work with the FBI but also as a member of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee.
Public records show Rogers served on Telefonica’s Ingenieria Y Seguridad committee for six years. It was one of several boards he sat on after leaving the U.S. House of Representatives in 2015, each focused on cybersecurity and data intelligence, which falls in line with Rogers’ experience as chair of the House Intelligence Committee and as a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Multiple financial disclosure reports filed for his Senate campaigns, the first of which he narrowly lost to now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin, are accessible to the public on the Senate’s online database. They show Rogers received $94,241 as board compensation from Telefonica Ingenieria Y Seguridad. 
Compensation that he received from the board between 2018 and 2022 is not publicly available.

Telefonica, based in Madrid, Spain, has business throughout Latin America, working with different subsidiaries to provide region-specific cell phone services.
One of those regions is Venezuela, operating as Telefonica Movistar. In 2022, Telefonica released a transparency report that revealed a wide swath of data interceptions into the private communications of Venezuelan Telefonica Movistar customers at the behest of Maduro’s security agencies, according to the watchdog group Ve Sin Filtro.
The report said that the company, in 2021, worked at the behest of the Maduro regime to intercept those communications against 1.5 million customers in Venezuela, more than 20% of both telephone and internet lines offered by Telefonica Movistar. Calls were tapped, text messages were monitored and the locations of customer phones were handed over to Venezuelan authorities, Ve Sin Filtro reported. The interceptions also included the capturing of customer internet traffic.
Other nations within the region that were included in the report also had data interception within their home countries, but at a much lower rate than what Venezuela had acquired.
In some cases, specific internet pages were blocked and accounts hacked, which rang true in the case of a Venezuelan human rights organization. Some of these requests came from the National Telecommunications Commission, or CONATEL, which is the Venezuelan government’s regulatory body over telecommunications within its borders.
The watchdog group noted that data interceptions performed by telecoms on orders from their regulating governments can be key ways for law enforcement to investigate serious crimes, but the wide array of interceptions performed by Maduro’s regime pointed more toward systemic abuse of human rights standards and judicial due process.
Ve Sin Filtro reported that agencies that were able to access who a user was calling, how long the calls lasted, what the subscriber’s data showed, included the military, Venezuela’s public ministry, its main criminal investigation agency, police forces, and its National Experimental Security University.
“Nowhere does it mention that the orders come from courts or come with the approval of judges, as they do in other countries, which means there isn’t evidence of the validation of courts for these interventions as it is required by Venezuelan law, with particular exceptions such as the case of emergencies and flagrant crimes, in which the CICPC can make a direct request,” the group said, referring to Telefonica’s transparency report. “But even in these cases the prosecutor must be notified and it must be included in the file.”
Spanish newspaper El Pais reported on the document, noting that the admission fell in line with what human rights organizations have called massive surveillance of the Venezuelan people over the course of the last decade. It also noted that human rights defenders in Venezuela believed the espionage targeted opposition politicians and activists.
The Washington Post also reported on the company’s report and findings, writing that the incursions included wire taps but also the censoring of content like news websites, political commentary portals, and even streaming media websites like SoundCloud. Three human rights organizations were blocked by Telefonica and the Maduro regime and two websites providing VPN, or virtual private network, services. People in restrictive nations often use private networks to access internet service or webpages that are censored in their regions, and have played a key role in pushing out social media content during times of protest or revolution.
The Post also interviewed Miguel Henrique Otero, president of El Nacional, one of Venezuela’s last remaining independent newspapers, when it wrote about the issue in 2022. 
He said it was clear to him and other like-minded Venezuelans that Telefonica was complicit in following orders from the Maduro regime to violate human rights, without justification or due process.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Facetune_03-10-2024-14-16-28-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 14:57:20.060499

At a Boston hearing, US Sen. Ed Markey and Reps. Ayanna Pressley and Seth Moulton sharply criticized the administration’s plan to let Temporary Protected Status expire for Haitian immigrants, a decision that would put roughly 350,000 people nationwide — including about 4,700 in Massachusetts — at risk of deportation.
Pressley underscored the scale of the issue in Massachusetts, home to one of the largest Haitian communities in the country. “My district represents the third largest Haitian diaspora in the country. More than 77,000 Haitians call the commonwealth their home,” she said.
TPS is granted to people from countries facing conflict, natural disaster or other extraordinary conditions. 
“TPS has received bipartisan support for over 30 years as a program,” Pressley said, noting that Haitians have relied on the status since the 2010 earthquake and, more recently, after the assassination of Haiti’s president and a surge in gang violence.
While the lawmakers focused their criticism on the Trump administration’s decision to let the designation expire, both Pressley and Markey stressed that their advocacy has spanned administrations of both parties.
Pressley said she has “urged Democratic and Republican Presidents alike… to support Haiti, to support Haiti in its efforts to build the nation, to support a democratic transition.” Markey echoed that point, saying, “I have called on every recent American president to designate, extend and re-designate TPS for Haiti.”
Still, the tone toward the current administration was clear. Markey said that despite evidence of worsening conditions, “it’s clear to all, including the Trump administration, that Haitian TPS holders cannot return home safely. That’s what we give that protection for, because they cannot go home.”
Markey described a country paralyzed by violence and disaster. Since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, he said, gangs have seized control of much of Port-au-Prince, with kidnappings and armed attacks blocking access to medical care, education and commerce. Natural disasters have further battered Haiti’s already fragile infrastructure.
The hearing came against the backdrop of an ongoing federal court case in Washington, DC, where lawyers are seeking to block the expiration of TPS while a lawsuit challenging the administration’s decision proceeds. A federal judge is expected to rule by February 2, the day before the protections are scheduled to end.
The potential reversal marks a turn from 18 months ago, when the Biden administration extended Haiti’s TPS designation through February 3, 2026, citing ongoing violence, political instability and environmental disasters. That extension was welcomed by Massachusetts officials, who noted that Haitians made up the vast majority of new arrivals to the state at the time. Many of these immigrants took low-paying jobs filling gaps in the health care sector.
Advocates of the administration’s decision say the move is part of a broader push to enforce immigration laws and return TPS to its original temporary intent, with the Department of Homeland Security arguing that permitting Haitian nationals to remain temporarily in the United States “is contrary to the national interest.”
“This decision restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that Temporary Protective Status is actually temporary,” a DHS spokesperson said in an announcement from June about the termination of the status.
The spokesperson said, “The environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home.”
At Tuesday’s hearing, lawmakers emphasized the economic and social ties Haitian TPS holders have built in Massachusetts. Markey offered a personal reflection from his hometown. 
“I live in Malden… My neighbors are now Haitians in ward two in Malden, and they work hard. They work two jobs,” he said.
Moulton framed the issue through his experience responding to the 2010 earthquake as a veteran accompanying Boston medical teams. 
“What I witnessed in Haiti was the best of Boston, the best of Massachusetts, the best of America showing up to help those in need,” he said. He said that Haitians who later settled in Massachusetts have repaid that compassion, “strengthening the American quilt as their fabric has become interwoven with our own.” Allowing TPS to expire now, Moulton said, would “tear all that apart.”
Advocates and TPS holders on the panel described the personal toll of the uncertainty. Franklin Soults of 32BJ SEIU said one of the misunderstandings about TPS is that it does not provide a direct pathway to citizenship or permanent residency, such as through a green card.
“There is no path for them to normalize their status, to turn it into something permanent,” he said, adding that he’s advocated for years in Washington unsuccessfully to reform this.
Soults read testimony from Jerome, a Haitian TPS holder living on the North Shore with his wife and 10-year-old daughter, a US citizen. Jerome’s wife, a caretaker, expects to lose her job when TPS expires next month. 
Jerome said his daughter tries hard in school, but he’s beginning to see the anxiety wear on her. 
“I can see the stress of her thinking all the time, what will my life be like if my parents can’t be with me?” Soults said, reading from Jerome’s testimony.
Another panelist, Bruno, who fled Haiti after the 2010 earthquake destroyed the grocery store he owned and operated there, spoke about how grateful he’s been to raise his three children in the United States. He is a driver for the MBTA who is also working on getting his commercial driver’s license.
“We are profoundly grateful to the United States for welcoming us down in that time of crisis,” he said. “My children have been brought up, been educated here, and become part of the fabric of Massachusetts. This is their home today.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/696fb93d5aa3d.webp?fit=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-20 14:57:20.060499

(Photo courtesy of the  Lacore campaign)The former chief of Navy Reserve is joining at least 14 other candidates running for South Carolina’s coastal 1st Congressional District.
Retired-Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, who spent 35 years in the Navy, announced Tuesday that she’s running as a Democrat for the seat held since 2020 by U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, who is running for governor.
Lacore told the SC Daily Gazette that she was removed from her leadership role last August by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. She said she was given no reason why she was fired and declined to speculate.
The Associated Press reported at the time that the firing was among a series of moves targeting perceived critics of President Donald Trump.
14 candidates are running to replace Rep. Nancy Mace in Congress

Lacore said she and her husband, also a Navy helicopter pilot, moved to Mount Pleasant in October after buying a house there last spring.
A native of Albany, New York, she moved frequently while in the Navy. She spent the first 10 years of her Navy career on active duty. As a reservist, she was deployed twice: in 2011 to Afghanistan and 2017 to Djibouti, a small country on Africa’s northeast coast.
The mother of six said she decided to make her first run for elected office Dec. 1, the same day she officially retired from the Navy, because she worried about the country’s direction.
The 10 Republicans and four Democrats who have already announced runs to replace Mace include five other military veterans.
“I think our military is being politicized,” Lacore told the Gazette. “I think our democracy’s at risk, to be honest, and I want to be a part of the solution.”
While a fairly new South Carolina resident, Lacore said her ties to the Palmetto State include a daughter and her husband graduating from the University of South Carolina. They live in the Lowcountry, and she’s been vacationing in the Lowcountry for a decade, she said.
Lacore led about 59,000 sailors as chief of the Navy Reserve, a job she held for a year. She relieved Vice Adm. John Mustin in August 2024. Her successes included working with Congress to secure new airplanes for the reserve, she said.
The job is an appointed position, filled by a president’s nomination and the Senate’s confirmation.

(Stock photo by Doug Wilson via Getty Images)Townhouse complexes with six or fewer units would not be required to have sprinklers for fire protection under a bill given initial approval Tuesday by an Iowa Senate subcommittee.
Senate File 310 proposes eliminating from the state building code required installation of fire protection sprinkler systems in “a series of attached single-family residences consisting of fewer than seven units” — meaning townhouses with six units or less in the property. The measure would also prohibit local building regulations from requiring sprinkler systems for these townhouse properties.
Sen. Scott Webster, R-Bettendorf, said this proposal is an amended version of legislation discussed in 2025, which had language saying six or less residential “units” would not have to have sprinklers installed. The previous language would have removed sprinkler requirements for multi-level apartment and condominium buildings. The changed language specifies that only townhouse properties — residences with multiple attached units that share one or more wall — will not have to install sprinklers.
While several firefighter and public safety advocates said they appreciated the changed language, many of these groups still registered in opposition to the measure.
David Schipper, fire rescue chief of Le Mars and past president of the Iowa Fire Chiefs Association, said removing this requirement also means new townhomes being constructed in rural Iowa would not be subject to building inspections for fire safety standards that currently come with sprinkler installation. In Le Mars, he said, fire marshals conduct inspections of new construction for sprinklers, which may not occur if this requirement is removed.
“Who is going to be inspecting then in rural Iowa … I don’t think the Legislature plans on adding a bunch of inspectors to (the Department of Inspections, Licensing and Appeals) making sure that if we’re not sprinkling them, we’re doing the proper sheet rocking for fire protection?” Schipper said.
He said removing this provision and not having building inspections in place will make fires more dangerous “for volunteer firefighters, especially, that show up maybe 13 to 15 minutes after a fire started in one of these, and instead of having one on fire, one condo on fire, we have all six on fire, making it more risky for people who live there, of course, our firefighters who have to put these fires out.”
Lobbyists with organizations like the Iowa Association of Realtors and Home Builders Association of Iowa said they supported the measure as a means to make housing more affordable in Iowa. However, Chelsea Hoye with the Iowa League of Cities said while she understood concerns about housing affordability, she said “possible higher insurance costs might offset that cost savings” from not installing sprinklers.
Webster said he personally has had experience as a home builder, insurance agent and insurance adjuster, and said the insurance company he worked for issued a surcharge for properties with sprinkler systems because of mold concerns. He said the sprinkler requirements, alongside many other building code requirements, were brought up at at International Residential Code, Federal Building Code or other regulation-setting meetings where private enterprise and business officials and gave lunches and gift cards to public officials as “the way that private enterprise gets their product shoved into the building code and required all in the name of safety.”
He said the sprinkler requirement “went overboard,” and that while many local entities have attempted to remove the provision, they are “getting forced to put it back in” by state regulation. But removing this provision is part of the balance as lawmakers try to “find a way to make more affordable in Iowa while holding on to safety standards.”
“I am telling you, this is a way to make homes more affordable in Iowa, still maintaining safety …” for structures that are too large for firefighters to safely contain a blaze, Webster said. “I’m more than happy to talk to anybody with ideas, that is a way to get through this, but it is very expensive to put in a fire sprinkler in a home — it doesn’t really save on your insurance.”
He and Sen. Mark Lofgren, R-Muscatine, signed to move the measure to the Senate Local Government Committee. Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner did not support the bill advancing, pointing to “serious safety concerns” about fires spreading in these properties as well as perspectives that this provision may not reduce housing costs.

MONTPELIER — Vermont Gov. Phil Scott proposed a $9.4 billion budget to state lawmakers on Tuesday that he called a “disciplined” spending plan for the upcoming fiscal year in the face of wavering support from the federal government.
Scott’s proposal is about 3% larger than the budget he and the Legislature put in place for the current year. But he said the spending plan calls for fewer new initiatives than state budgets in recent years, largely because the state no longer has the ability to use Covid-19 era relief funding from the federal government for new purposes.
He also pointed to how the state’s top economists lowered, by about $8 million, their past estimates for how much revenue the state will bring in over the current fiscal year, which ends in June. That decrease — albeit a modest one — showed the state needs to be frugal, Scott said Tuesday, addressing a joint assembly of the House and Senate.
At the same time, officials from Scott’s administration pointed at a briefing with reporters earlier Tuesday to how Vermont is poised to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid and other human services programs supported by the federal government over the next several years, as state officials have projected.
Scott’s budget would leave available $70 million lawmakers set aside last year to respond to federal cuts this year, the officials said. But they acknowledged that amount would not be enough to fully plug the gaps in some key programs. 
The budget proposal would use $105 million to reduce the average property tax increase across the state this year from an estimated 12% to about 5.5%. That request is up from the $75 million his administration had previously indicated it wanted to use for that purpose.
The additional $30 million would come from a pot of money lawmakers set aside in 2025 to offer tax relief or to respond to cuts from the federal government, Scott administration officials told reporters on Tuesday. 
Meanwhile, compared to the current year’s budget, Scott wants to reduce, by $10 million, the amount of revenue from the state’s purchase-and-use tax that is directed to Vermont’s Education Fund. That tax is levied on the purchase of new vehicles. 
Instead, that money should be directed to the state’s Transportation Fund, he said, which is facing significant funding challenges as revenue from taxes on gasoline has long slowed. Scott said his goal is to eliminate the use of vehicle purchase tax revenue for education costs completely in the future.
Administration officials indicated Tuesday that the Vermont Agency of Transportation could need to lay off additional employees in the coming year as a result of those funding challenges, though they did not provide specifics.
Scott also said his administration would again present a package of changes to Act 250, the state’s signature land use law. He also proposed an expansion of the “accountability court” set up in Burlington last year, which is aimed at slimming a persistent backlog of pending court cases, to other counties. 
Tuesday’s spending plan would cover the 2027 fiscal year, which will start in July 2026 and end in June 2027. 
This story will be updated.

(via Maine Center for Economic Policy)Starting May 1, workers across Maine will be able to access paid family and medical leave. 
The Maine Paid Leave Authority decided the start date at a meeting Tuesday. According to a news release from the Maine Women’s Lobby, the authority considered the solvency of the benefit fund and determined that starting the program in early May met their fiduciary obligation. 
The paid leave program was established by the Maine Legislature in 2023 and will allow eligible public and private sector workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for reasons such as illness, to care for a loved one, or the birth of a new child. 
Maine employers began withholding a portion of wages about a year ago to pay into the fund, so this newly determined start date offers a clear timeline of when workers will be able to tap the new benefit.
Employers with 15 or more workers contribute 1% of wages, but may deduct half of that from employee wages. Employers with fewer employees will contribute 0.5% and may take all of it from employees’ wages. 
“When benefits go live this spring, we will see the culmination of years of work toward a more just, equitable economy that values families, caregivers, and all workers,” said Destie Hohman Sprague, executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby.
Applications for workers to access paid leave are not available yet, but the Maine Department of Labor will release more information on how to access them at a later date. 
The program has faced legal challenges throughout its development, including a lawsuit from the Maine State Chamber of Commerce and Bath Iron Works challenging the department’s rules. However, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court unanimously decided that the rules adopted by the Maine Department of Labor are constitutional and a legal interpretation of the legislation that created the program.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/349070298_272323178516091_3409772876437276289_n-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-20 14:57:20.060499

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)The Commissioner of Securities and Insurance Office helped stop a fraudulent multimillion dollar billing scheme by agents preying on Native Americans on reservations, Commissioner James Brown announced this month.
In cooperation with health insurers, tribal communities and law enforcement, the investigation secured more than $23.3 million of fraudulently incurred claims through the Affordable Care Act, Brown said. An additional $27 million is pending.

“The most reprehensible aspect of this scheme is how the people who were allegedly provided ‘care’ were vulnerable populations that were, in some cases, exploited, coerced, moved across state lines, and not even so much as given a way to get back home to Montana,” Brown said in a statement.
In an interview, Brown said some Montana victims who were taken out of state for treatment that never took place have yet to be found.
Brown said his office met with tribes in Montana throughout 2025 to alert them to the scheme. It also made referrals to federal law enforcement authorities in Montana and the FBI office in Los Angeles where the alleged crimes took place.
In an interview, Brown described the way bad actors used a provision in the Affordable Care Act to victimize Native Americans to try to defraud an insurance company, how the scheme led to as much as $54.7 million in unjustified claims, and discussed the work that remains in the aftermath.
In January 2025, PacificSource reported suspected fraudulent ACA enrollment to the Commissioner of Securities and Insurance, and the office launched an investigation a couple of weeks later, according to a timeline provided by CSI.
Under the Affordable Care Act, Native Americans are able to enroll in the federal marketplace at any time, Brown said; they don’t have to wait for open enrollment.
Fraudsters operating out of Arizona and, for the purposes of the Montana scheme, California, used that provision to entice Native Americans to disenroll from Medicaid and sign up for health insurance through the ACA instead, Brown said.
In particular, he said, the agents would set up information booths on reservations — he believes nearly every reservation in Montana has been a target — and tell people about free drug and alcohol treatment at a beautiful facility in southern California.
The schemers would then transport victims across state lines by buying them a plane ticket to California or driving them in a van; keep them for 90 days while providing “fake services”; and then bill the insurance company $9,000 a day for 90 days, Brown said.
The billing was for services that didn’t take place, were unnecessary, or were provided at “greatly inflated prices,” according to the Commissioner of Securities and Insurance.
Brown said the bad actors abused “Obamacare” and trafficked “vulnerable Native Americans.” He said at least 183 people were victimized.
“We’re still trying to find some of these people, honestly,” Brown said.
The Office of Indian Affairs could not be reached Monday about any efforts to find people. The FBI in Montana also could not be reached in time for this story.
Brown said insurance abuse leads to higher premiums for everyone, but the investigation from his office and work with the Trump administration has meant $23.3 million in payments don’t have to be made to date.
Brown said an additional $27 million is pending a decision by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. He said so far, 80 policy recissions have been granted, and dozens remain under review.
Brown said PacificSource first suspected a problem when it came across half a million dollars in alcohol and substance abuse being billed out of southern California and the southwest part of the country.
“That is what set their alarm bells off, and they approached us for help,” Brown said.
He said his office conducted an investigation that supported the ability of CMS to approve the non-payment of fraudulent claims and rescind the policies. CSI has a team of four investigators, and he said his office spent seven months on the investigation.
The team uncovered falsified records, unlicensed and out-of-state actors, fabricated addresses, and unsupported earnings information used to obtain coverage, according to CSI. It also found “immediate, high-dollar billing patterns designed to extract maximum payouts.”
In a statement provided by CSI, PacificSource spokesperson Erik Wood thanked Brown and his team for helping stop suspected fraudulent activity in the marketplace.
“As a nonprofit health plan, PacificSource exists to keep health care accessible and affordable for our members, and preventing fraud is an important part of that work,” Wood said. “We appreciate the state’s commitment to protecting Montanans and the integrity of our health insurance system.”
PacificSource is a not-for-profit health insurance provider and one of three insurers that offer plans under the Affordable Care Act.
Brown said his office is helping to re-enroll victims into Medicaid so they have coverage. He encouraged Montanans to be wary of any alleged agents advising disenrollment in Medicaid and recommending treatment programs in California through the Affordable Care Act.
Brown said Arizona and Alaska also have dealt with a variation of the scheme. He said any state with a significant Native American population is a target, and he has talked with his counterparts and insurance providers in Washington and Wyoming to alert them to the scheme.
Brown said his office has “zero tolerance for fraud” and it is focused on consumer protection that “works for the people of Montana as opposed to scammers.” He said his office is pursuing additional investigations and will ask for an additional investigator in the future.
“We don’t tolerate corruption, and we don’t apologize for enforcing the law,” Brown said in a statement. “If you exploit vulnerable people or try to game our system, we will come after you.”

(Screenshot/YouTube)Manufacturers that advertise vaccines in Florida that cause injury or harm could be sued under a bill sponsored by Fort Pierce Republican Erin Grall.
Over objections by lobbyists representing organized medicine and business interests, the Senate Committee on Regulated Industries voted, 5-3, Tuesday to pass the proposal, SB 408.
Specifically, the bill would amend Florida law regulating drugs and cosmetics to allow an individual to file a lawsuit within three years following an alleged vaccine-related injury. The bill would provide one-way attorney fees, allowing any claimant who wins to recover “reasonable attorney fees” but not allow winning defendants to do the same.
Traditionally in Florida, one-way fees have been intended to balance the interests of ordinary people against deep-pocketed interests.
The bill defines “advertise” as “a media communication, including, but not limited to, television, radio, print, the Internet, digital or electronic media, product placement, promotion by an influencer in exchange for compensation, or any other manner of paid promotion, that a vaccine manufacturer purchases to promote the manufacturer’s vaccine.”
Discussions between health care providers and their patients or written or promotional materials regarding vaccines, or any promotional materials concerning vaccines displayed in health care facilities, would be specifically exempt from the definition of advertise.
According to a staff analysis of the bill, healthcare and pharmaceutical digital ad spending for 2025 was estimated at $24.8 billion, with traditional ad spending at about $7.9 billion.
Bill sponsor Grall said she thinks the measure would help increase vaccine rates in Florida, which have been plummeting. Statewide, the percentage of fully immunized two-year-olds dropped from about 85% a decade ago to roughly 75%, Grall said.
“Public trust regarding vaccines has diminished. I would argue that increased knowledge of the virtual immunity that manufactures have with regards to vaccine-related injuries has contributed to this declining trust,” Grall told members of the committee Tuesday morning.
“Vaccines have served an important public health service to eradicate disease, and this bill, I believe, is s step in rebuilding public trust of proven vaccines by holding manufacturers accountable.”
Florida Justice Reform Institute President William Large said the bill most likely would run afoul of federal laws that limit vaccine manufacturer liability in certain respects and establish compensation for injuries related to vaccines.
He touched on the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), a no-fault program funded by vaccine manufacturers through an excise tax on each vaccine dose. The VICP covers most vaccines routinely given in the United States. Benefits include rehabilitation costs, pain and suffering, attorney fees, and, in the case of death, $250,000.
Another federal law Large referenced is the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2005 (PREP), which authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services secretary to issue a so-called PREP Act declaration. The declaration allows the government to limit the liability of manufacturers, distributors, health care providers, and others for losses related to the administration or use of vaccines other other countermeasures to blunt any threat.
The PREP law also authorizes HHS to establish the Countermeasure Injury Compensation Program (CICP) to compensate claimants for serious physical injuries and death caused by certain vaccines.
CICP recoveries may include medical expenses, a portion of lost employment income, and a survivor death benefit.
Lastly, there’s the federal Food and Drug Cosmetics Act, which deals with labeling and failure to warn.
Preemption
“Most of this area of law is preempted by three federal acts,” Large said. “I’m also concerned it violates the First Amendment. And it’s also our position it’s bad public policy.”
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the VICP, calling it “biased” and “corrupt.” Kennedy, who owns a financial stake in a lawsuit against Merck over claims the pharmaceutical company failed to properly warn consumers about risks from its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, has said the protections remove incentives for vaccines to be safe.
Grall’s bill provides that an injured individual may bring an action within three years following accrual of the cause of action. Finally, the bill provides that a court can award a claimant who prevails in an action actual damages, court costs, and reasonable attorney fees.
There’s an identical proposal (HB 339) in the House filed by Rep. Monique Miller, a Republican from Palm Bay.
Committee Chair Sen. Jennifer Bradley, a Fleming Island Republican, thanked Grall for the bill, saying that in the aftermath of the COVID pandemic it’s an important conversation for the Legislature to have.
She said the United States is one of two countries that allow vaccine manufacturers to directly advertise to patients. While she stressed she’s no “anti-vaxer” Bradley said today’s environment is vastly differently than 40 years ago when the federal government agreed to pass the vaccine injury compensation fund in order to help ensure an adequate supply of childhood vaccines.
The environment today, Bradley said, is an “atmosphere of distrust.”
“I think this is an important conversation as we see the rise of a lot of diseases and a lot of cases with an uptick. I think we really need to take a hard look at the public trust we have in these big systems,” she said.
“Is this bill perfect? I don’t think so. Can it get better? Can we talk about it? We can put our head in the sand, but public trust in our health system is weak right now. And I think there are things we can do and conversations we can have to remedy that and to build that back. And I think this is a great first conversation.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Vaccines2-e1605720731166.png,,,2026-01-20 13:57:20.681082

Indiana’s championship and No. 1 final ranking followed those of fellow Big Ten teams Ohio State in 2024 and Michigan in 2023.

No. 2 Miami (13-3) moved up eight spots and ended with its highest ranking since the 2002 season, when it was second behind Ohio State. The 2003 Miami team had been the most recent to finish in the top 10.
Mississippi (13-2), which lost to Miami in the CFP semifinals after it beat Tulane in Oxford and Georgia in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans following under new head coach Pete Golding after Lane Kiffin’s departure for LSU, was No. 3, its highest final ranking since 1962.

No. 4 Oregon (13-2) finished in the top 10 for a third straight year and No. 5 Ohio State was in the final top 10 for the 12th straight year. The Big Ten had three teams in the final top five for the second straight year.
Georgia (12-2), Texas Tech (12-2), Texas A&M (11-2), Alabama (11-4) and Notre Dame (10-2) rounded out the top 10.
The Bulldogs were No. 6 in the final poll for the second straight season and have ended in the top 10 every since since 2017. Texas Tech is a season-ending top-10 team for the first time. Texas A&M hadn’t been ranked in a final poll season since Jimbo Fisher’s 2020 team was No. 4. Alabama, which had ended every season between 2008-23 in the top 10, was back after slipping to No. 17 last year.
Notre Dame won 10 straight games following an 0-2 start, was left out of the playoff and opted to not play in a bowl game. The Irish slipped one spot and were ranked in a ninth straight final poll.
The Hoosiers were No. 20 in the preseason poll after going 11-2 in Curt Cignetti’s first season. They earned their then-highest ranking ever at No. 3 after they won at Oregon to go 6-0. They moved up to No. 2 the following week and stayed there for seven straight polls. Their 13-10 win over Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game pushed them to No. 1 heading into the playoff.
Poll points
— No. 17 Iowa was ranked for the first time this season after winning three straight, including a bowl win over Vanderbilt. No. 22 Houston beat Baylor and LSU to end the season and was ranked for the first time in four polls.

NEWARK — Gov. Mikie Sherrill took multiple shots at President Donald Trump on Tuesday after she was sworn in as New Jersey’s 57th governor on a stage at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.
Sherrill, 54, a Democrat who is just the second woman in history to be chief executive of the Garden State, never mentioned the Republican president by name, but she connected the nation’s fight for independence from a king 250 years ago with opposition to the Trump administration’s actions today.
“This election proved that the people of New Jersey recognize the parallels. That we see a president illegally usurping power, unconstitutionally enacting a tariff regime to make billions for himself and his family, while everyone else sees their costs go higher. Here, we demand people in public service actually serve the public instead of buying themselves planes and cars and extorting money,” she said.
Gov. Sherrill orders credits to offset electricity hikes coming in June

The attacks on Trump drew an enthusiastic response from the 2,000-plus people gathered in the Newark theater.
“I want you to know that I will be fighting for you. And I hope, New Jersey, you’ll remember me when you open your electric bill and it hasn’t gone up by 20 percent. I can promise you, it won’t be because I waste your money on a ballroom at Drumthwacket,” Sherrill said.
Sherrill was sworn in by New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner on Founding Father William Paterson’s copy of the state Constitution, the U.S. Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence, held by her husband, Jason Hedberg.
Sherrill defeated Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli in November by 14 points, and the election was largely seen as a referendum on the second Trump administration. She said Tuesday that she wasn’t surprised “in the least” at the results.
“Because I know the people of New Jersey. Yes, we are loud and brash, and sometimes we tan like it’s 1980, our Giants, our Jets, and Eagles don’t even claim our state as home despite our rabid devotion. There are an inordinate number of young men wearing chains here, including my two sons,” she said.
She succeeds former Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who was barred from seeking a third term last year. Murphy joined former governors Chris Christie, Jon Corzine, Jim McGreevey, Christine Todd Whitman, and Thomas Kean Sr. in attendance. Other lawmakers on the stage included most of the state’s congressional delegation, state legislative leadership, and Sherrill’s former D.C. roommate, new Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger.

Lt. Gov. Dale Caldwell was also sworn in Tuesday on his family’s Bible, held by his daughter, Ashley.
“Today is a reminder of what progress looks like. It is a reminder of what resilience, hope, and courage can achieve,” Caldwell said. “And it is a reminder that our work of fulfilling the promise to we the people is never finished.”
Sherrill used her inaugural speech to sign two executive orders, including one that expands a credit program Murphy unveiled last year intended to offset electric rate hikes. Freezing rates was a key plank of Sherrill’s campaign for governor.
A former Navy helicopter pilot, Sherrill most recently represented the 11th Congressional District, which includes parts of Essex, Passaic, and Morris counties. She was also previously a federal prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Amid an increasingly aggressive national deportation campaign by the Trump administration and reports that Merrimack might play a more significant role in that campaign soon, New Hampshire Democrats are trying to prevent state, county, or municipal funding from being used to assist.
House Bill 1609, filed by state Rep. David Meuse, would prohibit New Hampshire and its counties, towns, and cities from spending any money on immigrant detention facilities or other efforts to detain immigrants. It would also block those political subdivisions from selling, donating, or repurposing property it owns for use as an immigrant detention facility. 
The bill makes an exception for police or sheriff’s departments that have entered into a 287(g) agreement with the Department of Homeland Security. A 287(g) agreement is a partnership in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly known as ICE, allows local law enforcement agencies to act as immigration officers, interrogate people suspected of not having legal status to live in the country, and arrest them for allegedly violating immigration laws. In New Hampshire, 13 agencies — the State Police, four sheriff’s departments, and eight local police departments — have signed such agreements. HB 1609 as it is currently written would not impact those agreements, which have expanded greatly nationwide under the Trump administration.
At a legislative hearing last week, Meuse, who represents Portsmouth, said the bill was about both “the future of mass incarceration of immigrants in New Hampshire and fiscal responsibility.”
Meuse, along with fellow Democrats and several citizens testifying at a legislative hearing on the bill last week, decried the Trump administration’s deportation efforts as cruel and, in their estimation, illegal. Meuse pointed to “Alligator Alcatraz,” an ICE detention center built earlier this year in the Florida Everglades that has been plagued by allegations of severe maltreatment, civil rights violations, and poor conditions, as what could go wrong with an immigrant detention facility in New Hampshire.
Meuse pointed out that in July, when Congress passed President Donald Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it set aside billions of taxpayers dollars for immigration enforcement. The new law appropriated roughly $30 billion to ICE over the course of several years, nearly tripling the agency’s annual budget (from roughly $9.9 billion a year to $28 billion in the federal government’s fiscal year 2025) plus an additional $45 billion to build new immigration detention facilities. The bill also opens the door for the Trump administration to direct even more federal funding to immigration enforcement in the future.
“While the reality is that we have very few options when it comes to restricting the government from constructing facilities like this on property that the federal government actually owns or leases, New Hampshire taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize a federal agency that’s basically bathing in blood money right now,” Meuse said. “The bottom line is that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility. It is not a state responsibility, so let’s make sure paying for it remains a federal responsibility.”
Meuse and others also evoked reported plans to build a detention center in Merrimack. In December, The Washington Post, citing a leaked document from the Department of Homeland Security, reported that the federal government plans to build a network of new detention centers across the country by converting warehouses. The federal government plans to build one of those centers in Merrimack, according to the report.
Since that report, protests have erupted and rumors have begun swirling about where the site would be. State Rep. Rosemarie Rung, a Democrat representing Merrimack, shared a document on social media purporting to show a list of addresses where the facilities would be located. That document identified 50 Robert Milligan Parkway, a currently vacant industrial warehouse owned by the Trammel Crow Company, as the future site of a detention center. Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the Trammel Crow Company have responded to the Bulletin’s requests for confirmation or comment as of publication of this article.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte said earlier this month her team has heard nothing from the federal government about a potential detention facility in Merrimack. She said the news was “at this point, a speculative discussion.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/icedems-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-20 13:57:20.681082

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)A day late and $18 million short, the prospective buyer of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital is turning to state leaders to help close its purchase.
Ben Mingle, CEO and president of The Centurion Foundation, asked state officials in an email Friday to set up a taxpayer-funded reserve account to help the buyer clinch the private investment needed to close the deal, as first reported by WPRI-TV 12. The email, sent to Gov. Dan McKee, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, Senate President Valarie Lawson and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, was obtained by Rhode Island Current on Tuesday.
“Each investor has clearly stated that their investment is subject to, and conditioned upon, having a state-funded bond reserve fund in the amount of $18 Million,” Mingle wrote. “Centurion Foundation respectfully requests that legislation be introduced at the earliest possible time to allow for the approval and implementation of this bond reserve fund.”
Preserving the pair of hospitals in Providence and North Providence — with 500 beds, 50,000 annual emergency room visits and nearly 2,500 employees between them — has been a top concern of state officials, but none have put a price tag on what the state is willing to pay to keep the hospitals running. McKee, whose proposed fiscal 2027 spending plan did not include any money for the hospitals, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.
Shekarchi and Lawson remained noncommittal on the funding request.
“We will conduct our due diligence and are committed to a course of action that stabilizes these hospitals in the best interests of patients, hospital workers, and all Rhode Islanders,” they said in a joint statement Tuesday.
Mingle’s email was sent one day after Centurion missed the court-mandated deadline for Centurion to close the sale. Now the two Rhode Island hospitals are slated to be transferred to state ownership on Jan. 30 under a separate court agreement between the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office and the bankruptcy estate for current owner, Prospect Medical Holdings.
Neronha’s office had already started work on the expected transfer of the hospitals, which puts the onus on the state to assume all operating and payroll costs, along with liabilities and taxes by Jan. 30.
But Centurion thinks it can close the transaction by Feb. 28, contingent upon approval for the requested state reserve fund. Neronha said the buyer’s plan was “possible” while noting the uncertainties surrounding it.
“If what Centurion set forth in their letter in terms of taxpayer support is what they need to close by the end of next month, then the Governor and the General Assembly have to decide whether to grant and/or negotiate their request,” Neronha said in a statement Tuesday. “That is not my role or responsibility. That said, the Bankruptcy Court’s deadline for closing the transaction has come and gone and they are going to need the Court’s permission to extend the window for closing, and then someone is going to have to come up with the money to run the hospitals beyond the end of the month until they do close.”
But Neronha hinted at a new surprise in the hospital sale saga, indicating a possibility the story’s ending may be “pivoting in an entirely different direction.”
“I think clarity will come this week,” Neronha said.
Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, did not immediately return requests for more information Tuesday.

The hospitals have been in jeopardy for years, with Prospect seeking to unload the costly assets from its balance sheet even before filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2025. The Centurion Foundation received conditional approval from state regulators to buy the hospitals from Prospect in June 2024, but struggled to lure investors to back the bonds needed to finance the $80 million sale and additional cash injections required by Neronha’s office. 
The Atlanta nonprofit’s lack of hospital experience was a concern among credit rating agencies ahead of its bond issuance. Federal budget cuts under the One Big Beautiful Big Act have worsened outlooks and heightened risks for health care facilities nationwide. 
Centurion executives and attorneys insisted the nonprofit was making “progress” on its financing plan while Neronha’s office eased up on the state’s financial requirements. But the 100,000-plus creditors owed billions of dollars by Prospect signaled their unwillingness to keep bankrolling the Rhode Island hospitals to a federal bankruptcy judge in October and proposed closure.
An interim agreement provided short-term operational funding through Jan. 30, partially provided by a state-controlled escrow account. Centurion — or whoever buys the hospitals —  would be required to reimburse the state for the $12 million it provided to keep the facilities open.
Mingle said in his email to state officials that Centurion has verbal commitments from four investors whose backing will cover the “aggregate amount sufficient to facilitate the closing.” He did not respond to questions Tuesday regarding the total amount committed, the identities of the investors or why they wanted an $18 million backstop specifically.
McKee’s administration said as recently as Thursday that Centurion had yet to come forward with a concrete funding request for the state. But critics of the governor have called on him and legislative leaders to take a more proactive role in saving the hospitals, pointing to Gov. Maura Healey’s suite of state funding and incentives in 2024 to find buyers to take over the hospitals owned by Steward Health Care after it filed for bankruptcy.
Brad Dufault, a spokesperson for the United Nurses and Allies Professionals, which represents more than 1,500 workers across both hospitals, reiterated the call to state leaders Tuesday, asking them to “do whatever it takes to keep these important community hospitals open.”
“We are calling on state leaders to move quickly, pass this legislation, and save these important community hospitals,” Dufault said in a statement. “This is the quickest and possibly only way to get this deal done in the next six weeks.”

Rep. Tim Walburg, R-Madison, introduced both bills, which the Health and Human Services Committee endorsed and sent to the House of Representatives.
The first bill would create legal protections for registered nurses and licensed practical nurses who provide care in the back of an ambulance.

Nurse licenses typically allow them to practice emergency medicine, but this legislation would protect them from civil liability while practicing within their scope of care in an ambulance.
It’s especially necessary in rural areas, where nurses take on many duties, according to Walburg.
“A lot of these nurses that are in the nursing home do transfer their own patients to the hospitals when needed,” Walburg said. “What better way to give a good continuum of care or handoff to that hospital than to hear from that nurse that has been caring for this patient?”
When an ambulance doesn’t have advanced medical personnel, the law would allow for the service to use a registered nurse. It would give services more freedom, said Linda Young, executive director of the South Dakota Board of Nursing.
“Nurses have been providing emergency services throughout many, many, many years, in emergency rooms, on air ambulances,” Young said. “This bill really does allow them greater flexibility to allow for those nurses to provide care on a ground ambulance.”
The second bill that passed through the committee would add firefighters and law enforcement officers to the legal definition of “ambulance operator,” and would put decisions about who can drive ambulances in the hands of local officials.
Maynard Konechne, of the South Dakota EMS Association, said emergency medical technicians too often have to drive ambulances. He said the bill would make it easier for local services to find other drivers, so EMTs can “do more of our job in the back of the ambulance, treating that patient.”
Law enforcement officers and firefighters would be able to drive an ambulance, as long as they complete CPR certification and at least six hours of training.
In his time as a Highway Patrol trooper, Rep. Jim Halverson, R-Winner, said there were many instances when the person operating the ambulance should have been administering care instead of driving.
“This is a necessary move that we make here,” he said.
As a paramedic, Rep. Eric Emery, D-Rosebud, said first responders, especially in rural areas, should work in a collaborative environment.
“Firefighters and law enforcement officers, we work all together, hand in hand,” Emery said. “It’ll put a lot of people within the EMS community here in South Dakota at ease and hopefully bring back a lot of those volunteers that had left.”
Both proposals came from a legislative summer study on emergency medical services, which was motivated in part by staffing concerns. Members of the study committee learned, for example, that the average age of an emergency medical technician in South Dakota is 51.

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/Maine Morning Star)In a change from the chamber’s initial posture, lawmakers in the Maine Senate voted Tuesday to sustain a veto from Gov. Janet Mills to keep the state’s right to repair law as it is.
The Senate voted 24-10 in favor of Mills’ veto of LD 1228, which sought to clarify certain terms, particularly in regards to cybersecurity, in the automotive right to repair law passed by citizen’s initiative in November 2023. There was no discussion on the Senate floor before the vote was taken.
Last week, the Maine House of Representatives voted 96-44 to override the veto, reiterating the chamber’s support of the bill. Overriding a veto requires the support of two-thirds of present members of both chambers. Although the House met that threshold, the Senate did not, so the bill is now dead.
Originally, the vast majority of the House (135-12) and Senate (21-14) backed the bill.
The successful 2023 ballot referendum required certain vehicle manufacturers to standardize their diagnostic systems and make them accessible to both owners and independent repair facilities in Maine. 
In a Jan. 7 veto letter, Mills said she rejected LD 1228 because she believes it harms local auto repair shops and veers too far from the intent of the law passed by voters. Though the bill would implement a series of recommendations to clarify and improve the effectiveness of the right to repair law, Mills took issue with what she described as a “controversial provision” in the proposal that would allow manufacturers to decide how vehicle telemetric data would be accessible to independent repair shops.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/righttorepair-scaled-e1768929514594-1024x689.jpg,,,2026-01-20 12:59:25.875382

Mikie Sherrill’s actions come after she campaigned on freezing utility rates on her first day as governor.,"Gov. Mikie Sherrill’s actions come after she campaigned on freezing utility rates on her first day as governor. (Photo by Reena Rose Sibayan/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Mikie Sherrill, in a bid to offset electricity price increases set to go into effect in June, ordered the Board of Public Utilities on Tuesday to expand bill credits that ratepayers saw last summer and pause proceedings that could approve new rate increases.
Sherrill signed the orders, her first as governor, on stage during her inauguration at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark. The Democrat succeeded former Gov. Phil Murphy (D) at noon on Tuesday after campaigning on a promise to order a utility rate freeze on her first day as New Jersey’s chief executive.
“I promised the people of New Jersey bold action to lower utility costs and, today, I’m delivering. Trenton will no longer accept the status quo and kick the can down the road while New Jersey families pay higher bills — not on my watch,” she said in a statement.
State reserves will ease new governor’s budget decisions

It’s unclear how much the credits will shave off ratepayer bills, though their amount is expected to vary depending on a ratepayer’s electricity usage.
The credits would be at least partially funded through a state fee on electricity suppliers unable to meet New Jersey’s renewables standards and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program that auctions off emission allowances to fossil fuel plants.
Their total cost is unclear. When Murphy unveiled the bill credits to offset energy rate increases last year, they provided ratepayers with $100, plus an additional $150 for low-income utility customers. Murphy administration officials said his program was expected to cost about $430 million. The cost for Sherrill’s credits will likely be far higher.
Her first order directs the Board of Public Utilities to issue its first wave of credits by July 1, 2026.
Other provisions of her order require the board to weigh reducing the societal benefits charge — a 3% surcharge on all New Jersey electricity bills — and retooling the state’s Clean Energy Program to focus on ratepayer relief and energy efficiency programs.
“I’ve heard you, New Jersey: We’re facing an affordability crisis, and you want costs to come down, and you want that to begin today. You don’t want a strongly worded letter, you don’t want a 10- year study, and you don’t want empty words. In short, you are sick of the status quo,” Sherrill said during his inaugural address. “Well, guess what, guys, so am I.”
Other provisions direct regulators to study changes to utilities’ business models.
New Jersey’s regulated utilities — power companies like PSE&G or Jersey Central Power & Light — do not profit off the sale of electricity, which they pass along to customers at cost, but they are permitted to earn a set return on capital investments for transmission and other infrastructure.
In New Jersey, that return on equity is typically about 10%. Regulators could lower those rates in response to Sherrill’s order, which, among other things, asks the Board of Public Utilities to consider multi-year rate plans and additional state review for some transmission projects.
Electricity prices in New Jersey and along the 13-state grid run by PJM Interconnection have soared in recent years as artificial intelligence data centers’ electricity demands squeezed supply after years of low load growth.
The increases include hikes of roughly 20% that went into effect last June as a result of price-setting capacity auctions held by PJM. Another round of increases from more recent capacity auctions is set to take effect in June.
A second order Sherrill signed Tuesday calls on the Board of Public Utilities to speed solicitations for new solar and storage projects and orders a slew of state agencies to identify regulations that could slow the deployment of new power generation for the governor to waive.
“These executive orders will deliver relief to consumers and stop rate hikes, so New Jerseyans aren’t facing ever-increasing electric bills. This will also create the conditions to massively expand New Jersey’s power generation, because more power in-state will help lower costs,” Sherrill said.
It requires the board to develop a policy to identify duplicate interconnection requests filed by large power users, like data centers, filed across states. Some critics have charged that duplicate requests result in phantom demand that bloats load forecasts and increases electricity prices.
It also directs the Department of Environmental Protection to take all steps needed to speed permitting for capacity upgrades, emissions reductions, and efficiency improvements at New Jersey’s gas plants.

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A bill to ban the sale of marijuana-like products to minors could sail through the South Dakota Senate without debate.
Senate Bill 45 would add delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinolic acid to the list of hemp-derived intoxicants illegal to purchase for people younger than 21. The bill, proposed by Attorney General Marty Jackley, would amend a law that already bars the sale of other hemp-derived compounds that create a marijuana-like high, among them Delta-8, Delta-10, THC-O acetate and hexahydrocannabinol.
The sale of such products to minors, under the terms of the bill, would be a class 1 misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine. That’s the same level of criminal offense affixed to the sale of alcohol to minors.
Possession of the hemp-derived products by a minor would be a class 2 misdemeanor, which is the lowest level of criminal offense in South Dakota law with a potential 30-day jail sentence and $500 fine.
Law banning sale of some near-pot products takes effect, but won’t prevent every legal high

Jackley initially proposed felony penalties for retailers who sell to minors, but he told the Senate Judiciary Committee that discussions with defense lawyers and business leaders convinced him to ask for an amendment to put violations on par with alcohol sales.
There were concerns about the implications of felony charges for businesses with beer or liquor licenses, Jackley said.
“I think this is an appropriate response,” he told the committee. “And like always, we hope this has a deterrent value.”
The committee first approved Jackley’s amendment, then approved the bill, with unanimous support from all members present. No one testified in opposition, clearing a path for the bill to appear on the Senate’s consent calendar.
Bills on the consent calendar are passed in bulk with a single vote and no debate in the chamber, unless a lawmaker requests that a bill be pulled out for discussion.
Changing landscape for hemp
Lawmakers in Pierre passed a bill in 2024 that makes it a class 2 misdemeanor for anyone to sell — but not to possess — products containing intoxicating, hemp-derived substances, which have exploded in popularity in recent years thanks in part to a 2018 federal farm bill that legalized hemp.
The hemp plant is related to marijuana, but contains far less THC, a compound whose Delta-9 version is responsible for the high produced by the consumption of marijuana.
Hemp products will be ‘ripped away’ by federal legislation, SD businesses fear

Once hemp became legal to sell at the federal level through the farm bill, companies began distilling CBD, a non-intoxicating substance present in hemp, to produce THC derivatives like Delta-8 and hemp-derived Delta-9, the latter of which is chemically indistinguishable from traditional marijuana’s marquee intoxicant.
Hemp-derived intoxicants are now found in vape pens, gummies and smokable hemp, similar to traditional marijuana. 
Delta-9 THC drinks are among the more visible signs of the products’ popularity, available at bars and some grocery and liquor stores in South Dakota. Backers of the 2024 bill banning the sale of hemp-derived THC products said at the time that the beverages are outside the scope of the ban because their THC isn’t chemically extracted. 
States across the U.S., South Dakota among them, have grappled with regulations for hemp-based products. On the federal level, lawmakers in Washington passed a bill that’s set to redefine hemp to exclude any product with too much THC, and to limit the amount of THC in individual products to 0.4 milligrams per serving by Nov. 13. 
For context, a low-dose Delta-9 drink contains between 2.5 to 5 milligrams per serving, and 10 milligram versions are frequently found alongside them in grocery and liquor stores.
Lawmakers in both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, including Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, have proposed legislation pushing back the implementation of the new federal rules until 2028. 
Industry analysts said last year that the law change would wipe out 95% of the $28.4 billion hemp industry. South Dakota businesses said the new federal rules would rip away access to products that “consumers said loud and clear that they want.”
Back in South Dakota, Piedmont state Sen. John Carley, a Republican, has introduced a bill to ban the sale, production, possession or use of any hemp-derived intoxicant, using the 0.4 milligram intoxicant limit used by Congress, unless the user has a medical marijuana card. A hearing on that bill is scheduled for Wednesday morning in the Senate Health and Human Services Committee.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-20 17:08:10+00:00,CT Mirror,Public defenders are in short supply in CT. Would a raise help?,Josie Reich,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/public-defenders-are-in-short-supply-in-ct-would-a-raise-help/,"As a state commission is poised to appoint CT's next chief public defender Tuesday, the office faces staffing challenges amid low pay rates.","Public defense lawyers in Connecticut are stretched thin. 
For years, the Office of the Chief Public Defender has been lobbying for higher pay for contract attorneys who handle criminal and child welfare cases, known as assigned counsel. The legislature approved incremental raises in 2023 and 2025. But the rates remain below those offered by other New England states and below the Connecticut federal rate.
“You can’t make a living off of it, that’s for sure,” said James Pastore, the lead public defender for Fairfield County.
Lawyers who take on assigned counsel work say they’re overburdened, and OCPD has seen backlogs and case delays due to the lack of attorneys. Recent pay bumps have stirred some interest, OCPD said, but the office is still facing an attorney shortage.
And pay rates are even lower for child protection cases. OCPD failed to meet its own standards for protecting children — including missing home welfare visits — due to the lack of attorneys for children, a December 2024 report released by the Office of the Child Advocate found.
The Connecticut legislature has wrestled with competing priorities in funding the public defender’s office. In an effort to ease the burden on contract attorneys, the division advocated for additional hiring of translators and social workers. The legislature granted that request while denying the agency funding to hire social workers it needs to complete mandated child welfare visits.
And in the 2023 budget bill, the state increased access to public defender services by raising the income threshold for individuals to qualify, from $30,120 annually to $37,650. That drove up the number of clients seeking representation from an already-shrinking number of counsel available. 
State Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, who co-leads the legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said she believes there’s more to be done to strengthen staffing for public defender services. 
“I don’t think we’ve yet addressed that issue at all,” she said, referring specifically to the low pay rates for child welfare cases. She cited spending constraints this past year and said she expects lawmakers will address child protection rates in the next budget discussions.
How we got here
The state’s attorney’s office relies on assigned counsel. They’re necessary in cases with multiple defendants, when a conflict of interest would arise if the same office represented them all.
For example, Fairfield County attorney Pastore explained, “if there are three people who go into a store to rob it, what happens if one guy says ‘don’t look at me, it was the other guy?’ Someone needs to defend those people,” he said, and “it can be difficult sometimes to find people to represent those conflict clients.” 
Assigned counsel often represent especially vulnerable clients, including low-income people, abused and neglected children, and parents losing custody of their kids. They are typically attorneys in private practice who see taking on cases for the public defender as doing a public service. They take on this work knowing it pays far less than other legal work they could be doing.
They’re paid $98 per hour for state criminal cases and $113 hourly if the case goes to trial. This rate is lower than other Connecticut offices and New England states, officials with the public defender’s office wrote in a 2023 memo to a legislative subcommittee. For comparison, hourly pay ranged from $350 to $650 for lawyers employed by Connecticut at the governor’s and attorney general’s offices. It was $158 for assigned counsel in New York, $150 in Maine, and $125 in New Hampshire, according to the memo.
The federal rate for assigned counsel is $177 per hour for non-capital criminal cases and $226 per hour for capital cases. 
“We’ve got people here in this state that are great defense lawyers, and they’d rather do that work at the federal level,” OCPD’s legal counsel director Deborah Del Prete Sullivan testified at an Appropriations Committee hearing last year. “They’re very qualified people, so we’ve lost people because of that.”
How did compensation for state contract attorneys get this bad? Over 15 years, there were no meaningful rate increases while inflation degraded the pay. Attorneys stopped taking cases. 
“As the list of attorneys declined, we had to give more assignments to existing ones,” which made the job even more unattractive, acting chief public defender John Day told the Connecticut Mirror.
The problem came to a head in 2023 when the agency considered legal action if the state didn’t include raises for public defenders in the budget. The legislature partially funded the agency’s request, but rates remained prohibitively low.
In 2025, after further appeals from the office, the legislature passed an additional 11% pay increase for assigned counsel. That brought the rates to their current level. 
The agency’s staffing struggles come on the backdrop of a tumultuous few years for OCPD. Connecticut’s first Black chief public defender, TaShun Bowden-Lewis, was fired in 2024 after an investigation into alleged workplace misconduct.
Day has been running the agency in the interim. The state’s Public Defender Services Commission is slated to appoint a new chief public defender Jan. 20. (Osten said the vacancy at the head of the office did not affect funding discussions.)
The office’s mandate and case volume grew significantly in 2025. At the beginning of last year, the eligibility threshold to qualify for representation by a public defender was raised to 250% of the federal poverty line. Defendants now qualify if they make below $37,650 annually. OCPD hired new staff attorneys to address the influx of new clients. 
Then, during last year’s legislative session, Gov. Ned Lamont’s office proposed lowering the threshold back to 200%, which would have required OCPD to fire the attorneys they just hired. That led to a small skirmish with the governor’s office. 
The public defender’s office pushed back, and ultimately the budget passed without a change to the eligibility threshold. Day said his office has “addressed the need effectively” of the increased mandate and “things are operating smoothly.”
Children’s attorneys particularly underpaid 
The rate OCPD pays assigned counsel who take on child welfare cases is lower still, and the ranks of attorneys who take on this work has thinned. The gig pays a flat fee of $750 per case, even if it stretches out for months or years. A 11% pay hike in 2025 brought the fee to its current level.
These attorneys represent children and guardians in juvenile court cases including abuse and neglect. Some can receive slightly more on top of the flat fee — such as hourly pay for trial or home visits, better pay for termination of parental rights matters, and a higher flat rate for nonprofit firms.
The low pay has led to a decline in the number of attorneys available for child protection matters. Renee Cimino, OCPD’s delinquency defense and child protection director, told the Appropriations Committee that the number fell by 60% over a six-year period.
The list shrank from 275 assigned counsel to 87 at its lowest, as of last February, she said. As of December, there were 98 attorneys on the list, an uptick since the legislature approved raises last year, but still fewer than half the agency’s former ranks.
And the number of attorneys who actually accept cases may be even fewer, said Justine Rakich-Kelly, executive director of the Children’s Law Center of Connecticut. Attorneys don’t usually take their names off the list because it’s easier to remain on it and decline cases as they come, she said. The annual number of cases that assigned counsel decline to take has soared.
Because of the lack of attorneys for children, OCPD fell short of its own child protection standards. The agency failed to make all the child welfare visits it was expected to make, according to a report by the Office of the Child Advocate following the deaths of two children.
OCPD responded last February with an emergency plan to hire 20 social workers, tasked with supporting strained child welfare counsel by conducting in-home visits, collecting records and otherwise assisting attorneys.
But the effort was stymied when it was excluded from the most recent budget, signed into law in June 2025 by Gov. Ned Lamont. Cimino told CT Mirror the agency “did not receive a specific reason from the Legislature for why funding was not provided for the requested 20 social workers.”
OCPD instead hired six social workers, using funds from its general budget, and has amped up recruitment, an effort to respond despite the lack of funding.
What comes next
The agency says the incremental pay increases so far have helped with recruiting and retaining assigned counsel, including for child welfare cases, but more attorneys are needed.
The legislature signaled it would continue to increase pay until Connecticut catches up.
“We’ve been trying to bring those salaries up. We’re not quite there yet,” Osten said. “We want to have people stay and do the work.”
Over the next three years, OCPD has said it will request a total budget increase of $10,711,434 to ultimately settle at an hourly rate of $120 for assigned counsel — still a modest goal compared to peer states.
In the meantime, OCPD is trying to support attorneys in other ways. The agency successfully obtained funding for 13 new translator positions, one for each judicial district. The office hopes that hiring staff interpreters who speak Spanish and Portuguese, the two languages they see most often, will reduce court dates and case delays caused when court translators are unavailable.
“There is a lack of motivation to accept cases,” said Rakich-Kelly. “But the OCPD’s been doing an incredibly great job getting an increase.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0483-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-20 12:59:25.875382

At the end of 2024, lawmakers approved a slate of bills to create tax breaks for data centers on equipment, prompting an influx of data center proposals in communities across Michigan. The flood of data center deals has sparked frustration with government transparency alongside concern from residents that the resource intensive facilities will bring higher energy costs while draining water reserves. 
“Michigan families are literally paying the price for corporate land grabs,” Leonard said in a statement. “Residents should not be forced to subsidize sweetheart deals for massive data centers while their own bills skyrocket. That’s a rigged game that benefits insiders at the expense of everyday citizens. Which is not only wrong; it’s insulting.”
In response, Leonard is calling on the Legislature to repeal any existing and pending state-level subsidies, tax incentives and “preferential utility arrangements” for data centers, while placing a one-year moratorium on approval for new data center sites. During that time, lawmakers would be tasked with developing a legal framework that addresses grid reliability, ratepayer protections, land and water use and local consent.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“A temporary moratorium gives us the time to get this right and provide an open, transparent process that forces state and local governments to listen to the people,” Leonard said. “This is a chance to protect ratepayers, respect local communities, and demand transparency before any more blank checks are written.”
Also seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination are U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, former Michigan Speaker of the House Tom Leonard, AxMITax founder Karla Wagner, Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson and Ralph Rebandt, a retired pastor from Oakland County.
State Rep. Jennifer Wortz (R-Quincy) has shared she will introduce Leonard’s proposed reforms in the House. Reps. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City), Erin Byrnes (D-Dearborn) and Jim DeSana (R-Ash Township) have also introduced legislation to repeal tax breaks for data centers. 
 “For too long, ratepayers have been asked to pay more without seeing better service or accountability,” Wortz said in a statement. “When families will be paying for these decisions for decades, taking a one-year pause to conduct a thorough review is just common sense” 
Alongside his proposals, Leonard launched a website with a petition calling on Gov.

Julia Letlow, R-Start, speaks with reporters after qualifying for reelection in Louisiana's 5th Congressional District at the State Archives in Baton Rouge on Thursday, July 19, 2024. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow declared Monday morning she will enter this year’s U.S. Senate race, following a social media endorsement over the weekend from President Donald Trump.
Letlow, a 44-year-old Republican who has represented Louisiana’s 5th Congressional District since 2021, announced her candidacy against incumbent U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy at a Baton Rouge Business Report breakfast event. Cassidy has been considered a vulnerable Republican since he voted to impeach Trump for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Trump had stayed silent on the U.S. Senate race in Louisiana until Saturday night when he urged Letlow to run in a post to Truth Social.
“I know Julia well, have seen her tested at the highest and most difficult levels, and she is a TOTAL WINNER!” Trump wrote, I part. “A Proud Mother of two children, Julia is a wonderful person, has ALWAYS delivered for Louisiana, and would continue doing so in the United States Senate.”
Before being elected to Congress, Letlow was a high-ranking administrator at the University of Louisiana at Monroe. Her political ascension began when she entered a special election to the fill the 5th District vacancy left when her husband, Luke Letlow, died from complications of COVID-19 just days before he was to be sworn into office. She has since won re-election twice and holds a seat on the powerful U.S. House Appropriations Committee.
When the state legislature redrew its congressional boundaries in 2024, preserving Letlow’s seat was declared a priority among Republican leaders, who sacrificed the 6th District seat of Garret Graves, R-Baton Rouge, to create a second majority-Black district for Louisiana in the U.S. House. Portions of Graves’ old district around LSU were drawn into Letlow’s 5th District boundaries.
Letlow moved her family to Baton Rouge last year and was engaged last month to lawyer and lobbyist Kevin Ainsworth, a former baseball player at LSU.
In a statement Saturday night after the president’s endorsement of Letlow, Cassidy indicated he would remain in the race and held firm Monday morning, according to a statement he made to WVUE-TV Fox 8.
“Congresswoman Letlow called me this morning to say she was running. She said she respected me and that I had done a good job,” Cassidy said. “I will continue to do a good job when I win re-election. I am a conservative who wakes up every morning thinking about how to make Louisiana and the United States a better place to live.”
Despite his impeachment vote five years ago, Cassidy has positioned himself as a Trump loyalist. He cast the deciding vote to make Robert F. Kennedy Jr. secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, despite openly disagreeing with Kennedy’s stances on vaccines and the causes of autism.
Though he was unable to gain Trump’s backing, Cassidy has amassed a substantial campaign war chest approaching $20 million when including political action committees. He has also received endorsements from several Louisiana sheriffs, parish presidents and notable GOP donors.
The timing of Letlow’s announcement gives her a key opportunity to court campaign donors at the 77th Washington Mardi Gras, set for Jan. 28-Feb. 1 in the nation’s capital. The event typically includes several fundraisers for Louisiana candidates at all levels, as well as parties hosted by corporate interests and political organizations.
For the first time since 1975, Louisiana will hold closed party primaries for its elections. Other announced Republican candidates for Cassidy’s seat include state Rep. Julie Emerson, Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming, state Sen. Blake Miguez and PublicService Commissioner Eric Skrmetta. Official qualifying for the May 16 primary election takes place Feb. 11-13.

Free.,"DHS policy to block unannounced lawmaker visits upheld, for now, on technical grounds",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dhs-policy-block-unannounced-lawmaker-visits-upheld-now-technical-grounds,,"WASHINGTON — A Department of Homeland Security policy that barred unannounced visits for lawmakers seeking to conduct oversight at facilities that hold immigrants will remain in place, as ordered by a federal judge Monday.District of Columbia federal judge Jia Cobb issued an order that denied a request from a dozen Democratic lawmakers, on the technical grounds that an amended complaint or a supplemental brief must be made to challenge a 7-day notice policy instituted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this month for oversight visits.“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” according to Cobb’s order.Earlier this month, Democrats brought an emergency request to Cobb after a handful of Minnesota lawmakers were denied an unannounced oversight visit to a federal facility that holds immigrants following the deadly shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer.Under a 2019 appropriations law, any member of Congress can carry out an unannounced visit at a federal facility that holds immigrants, but in June, multiple Democrats were denied visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. Those 12 Democrats sued over the policy that required a week’s notice, and in December, Cobb granted the request to stay Noem’s policy, finding it violated the 2019 law. Noem has now argued that the January incident does not violate Cobb’s stay from December, because the ICE facilities are using funds through the Republican spending and tax cuts law, known as the “One, Big Beautiful Bill” and not the DHS appropriations bill. Noem argued that those facilities are therefore exempt from unannounced oversight visits by members of Congress. House Democrats who sued include Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J. Luis Correa of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Veronica Escobar of Texas, Dan Goldman of New York, Jimmy Gomez of California, Raul Ruiz of California, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Norma Torres of California.",,,,2026-01-20 11:57:57.821183

In votes taken last Wednesday and Friday, 86% of the participants opted to establish the new bargaining unit, which will have 213 members across Sparrow locations in Lansing, Charlotte and Ionia.  
“We are all united in advocating for working conditions that support advanced practice providers and prioritize safe patient care,” Pam Stave, a physician assistant, said in a press release from the Michigan Nurses Association. “Without a union, we would have no power to stop management from freezing our pay or doing whatever else they want. Now, we get to bring our collective power to the bargaining table and really make a difference for ourselves and our patients.”
The press release added that the health care providers in the union were disappointed with the hospital management’s behavior during their attempts to unionize, stating that those involved were threatened with denied pay increases and pulled into one-on-one meetings with the seeming intention to dissuade them from voting for the union’s formation. 
“We respect the rights of our Advanced Practice Providers to bargain collectively and look forward to working with them in the future for the betterment of our patients and community,” John Foren, spokesman for the regional health system, said in a statement. 
This union is not the first at Sparrow under the Michigan Nurses Association. Jeff Breslin, president of the Professional Employee Council of Sparrow Hospital-Michigan Nurses Association, expressed his support for the new bargaining unit in the press release.

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Satanic Grotto delivered a complaint to the Kansas Department of Administration Capitol events coordinator for allowing Abortion is Murder — a Christian group known for protesting with graphic signs — to protest inside the Statehouse, and plans to counterprotest.
Satanic Grotto president Michael Stewart said the grotto plans to be at the Statehouse on Jan. 27, the day of the AIM protest, with or without permit approval. Stewart said the approval of AIM’s permit is unfair because the state, which restricted a planned grotto protest over the summer, is applying different standards about obscenity and violence to the two groups.
The grotto identifies its complaint as a “formal notice of liability” for discrimination.

Stewart invited people to join the grotto in counterprotesting AIM, offering free kazoos as an incentive. Stewart said he submitted a permit for the protest Jan.15, and it has yet to be approved or denied. Stewart said the Department of Administration uses silence as a “disruption tactic.”
Samir Arif, the chief of staff and director of public affairs for the Department of Administration, said the agency wouldn’t comment on ongoing legal issues.
As of Jan. 20, about 50 people were “interested” in or going to the grotto’s counterprotest, according to a Facebook event listing.
Stewart said the Grotto’s permit application is for the south steps outside of the Statehouse. AIM’s permit is for the second floor rotunda inside.
“Our actions at the Capitol will be in direct response to the government’s decisions,” Stewart said. “If the government fulfills their duties, then the grotto will be committed to having a peaceful celebration of bodily autonomy and educating anyone who shows up about their personal constitutional rights outside, right along AIM.
“If we are institutionally oppressed, or if they show a viewpoint discrimination favoring AIM, then we will absolutely escalate our actions to an interior counterprotest. The grotto doesn’t want the conflict. The grotto wants equal treatment in the same space.”
Stewart said grotto artists have made a “poignant gore piece” to bring to the counterprotest. The 9-foot-tall sculpture has been named “zombie Jesus” by members.
He said the rules for permits are unfairly applied. Before the grotto’s own protest in March — a “black mass” that drew thousands of Christian counterprotesters and ended with a handful of arrests — legislators denounced their plans with House Resolution 6016, which called the plan “blasphemous.” Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly banned the satanists from entering the Statehouse, but they ignored her ban.
The black mass turned violent as Christian counterprotesters clashed with Satanic Grotto members. Stewart and a counterprotester were arrested.
After the black mass, Adam Proffitt, the secretary of administration, denied the grotto’s application for another protest over the summer. Proffitt said the grotto could have a permit if someone other than Stewart filed for it, and as long as the protest didn’t go past sundown. The group obliged.

Stewart said the group filed the AIM counterprotest permit under the same parameters.
Denying AIM’s permit would have been “the perfect opportunity, I think, to exercise those rules outside of the grotto so that there’s no discrimination on their part,” Stewart said.
In the grotto’s complaint, Stewart pointed to the Statehouse usage policy restricting activities deemed “indecent or obscene.”
“If the Statehouse interior is designated a ‘Gore-Permissive Zone’ for AIM Kansas, the Grotto Society Inc. will provide its own depictions of visceral occult gore,” Stewart wrote in the complaint.
The complaint also noted the anti-abortion movement’s long history of violence in Kansas, from 2,600 arrests during the 1991 “summer of mercy” to arson and car bombings to the murder of physician George Tiller at his church in 2009.
AIM did not respond to Kansas Reflector’s requests for comment. 
“We will hear from many pastors from around the state, we will set up meetings with our legislators, we will sing hymns, chant chants, and call the world to repent of their apathy for the genocide we all live in,” AIM’s website reads. “And we will go every year, preach every month, demand justice every day until abortion is abolished.”
Despite Kansans’ 2022 landslide vote to protect abortion rights, this summer’s vote on whether to elect Kansas Supreme Court justices could lead to a reversal of that decision.
Following the 2022 vote, and the U.S. Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade, Kansas has recorded a rise in abortions from out-of-state patients. Last year, there were 19,811 total abortions in Kansas, up from 7,849 in 2021.
Last year’s numbers include seven in-state and 28 out-of-state patients between the ages of 10 and 14 who terminated their pregnancy.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Stewart-punch-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-20 11:57:57.821183

It's very important.”Trump said he plans to talk with people living in Greenland when asked about residents not wanting to become part of the United States.“I haven’t spoken to them,” Trump said. “When I speak to them, I’m sure they’ll be thrilled.”Trump posts about Greenland repeatedlyTrump posted on social media numerous times earlier Tuesday and throughout the weekend, pressing other leaders to help him secure Greenland, despite ongoing opposition. “I had a very good telephone call with Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO, concerning Greenland,” Trump posted at 12:26 a.m. “I agreed to a meeting of the various parties in Davos, Switzerland. As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back — On that, everyone agrees!” Trump posted an altered image of him showing a map to European leaders that had a version of the U.S. flag covering Canada, Greenland and Venezuela. He also posted a fabricated image of him planting the U.S. flag in Greenland and declaring it a territory with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio standing behind him.

""Because, you know, Emmanuel is not going to be there very long and, you know, there's no longevity there. He's a friend of mine. He's a nice guy. I like Macron. But he's not going to be there very much longer as you know.

These are International Powers who only recognize STRENGTH, which is why the United States of America, under my leadership, is now, after only one year, respected like never before,” Trump added. “The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.

GOV. MAURA HEALEY announced this month that the state would use $250 million from a state trust fund to assist some Massachusetts residents who have lost enhanced federal subsidies to pay for health care coverage. The Affordable Care Act tax credits were rolled out under the Biden administration during the pandemic through the American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA. They made it easier for people at more moderate income levels to access subsidized care.
But those credits expired at the end of 2025, with Republican resistance to extending them central to the government shutdown last year.  
They may yet return, as there is some bipartisan support for the tax credits in the House, but the Senate still seems cool to the idea. In the meantime, some states have moved to fill the funding gap. In Massachusetts, Healey said the state will cover $250 million that had come from the federal government through ARPA by tapping the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund, a state account that draws on several revenue streams.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Mississippi will soon be able to get a break on their taxes for contributing to private-school scholarships, thanks to a federal program. 
Gov. Tate Reeves announced Monday that he had opted the state into the program. It’s a win for school-choice proponents, as Mississippi lawmakers continue to debate the policy on the state level. 
School choice — policies aimed at giving families more educational options, often funding those choices with public money —  is the top issue of the current legislative session, led by House Speaker Jason White. Both chambers have passed school-choice bills, but Senate leaders have firmly taken a stance against programs that send public dollars to private schools, as the federal tax-credit program does. 
School-choice proponents say the policies give parents more control over their children’s education. Opponents argue that they siphon money away from the public education system, which is required to serve every child.
“Mississippi believes that parents – not government – know what’s best for their children’s education,” Reeves said in his announcement. 
The federal tax-credit program, created by President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” allows Mississippians to contribute up to $1,700 to an organization that awards scholarships to private-school students, starting in federal tax year 2027. Donors will be given a break on their taxes equal to the amount they contribute — that’s called a dollar-for-dollar tax credit, and it’s about three times as much as people receive from donating to a children’s hospital or other causes. 
To qualify for these scholarships, one can earn up to 300% of the area’s median income. That’s six-figures in Mississippi, or about $150,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. 
Research shows a majority of private-school vouchers across the country go to students who could already afford and were attending private schools. 
In the coming months, Reeves’ office will designate eligible scholarship-granting organizations — groups that will disburse these vouchers, whose sole purpose must be doing so — to participate in the program.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30124019/Mississippi-Economic-Council-annual-Hobnob24.jpg,,,2026-01-20 11:57:57.821183

The bills would also establish the crime of “grooming a minor,” defined in the legislation as a pattern of behavior by an adult intended to prime a child to be sexually exploited. That behavior would not have to include a sexual act and could consist entirely of verbal or digital communication.
State Rep. Holly Jones, a Republican from Eureka and chair of the House Children and Families Committee, told The Independent the bills resulted from collaboration between the various sponsors that date back several years.
“Child abuse, familial abuse, trafficking, all of that is bipartisan,” Jones said. 
Lawmakers expressed broad support for the bills during a hearing of the committee Tuesday but signaled they would further discuss how the legislation defines “grooming” and the possibility of adding training to help parents and educators identify predatory behavior toward young people.
The package consists of two pairs of identical bills. Two anti-trafficking bills, sponsored by Republican state Reps. Ed Lewis of Moberly and Jeff Myers ofWarren, are similar to legislation that passed in the House last year and advanced out of committee in the Senate.
Bills that would criminalize predatory behavior toward children that stops short of sex are sponsored by Republican state Reps. Burt Whaley of Clever and Christopher Warwick of Bolivar.
 Human trafficking

Under the bills sponsored by Lewis and Myers, trafficking of a child by their parent or guardian would carry a penalty of life imprisonment. Survivors of child sex trafficking would have up to 20 years after turning 21 to claim damages for their abuse rather than 10.
That legislation would also allow any Missourian convicted of prostitution to apply to a court to clear their records. Currently, only those who were under 18 at the time of the sexual conduct can apply for expungement.
Christine McDonald testified last week to the House committee that she was trafficked in Kansas and Oklahoma before being “bought and sold for 17 years,” from the age of 17, in Missouri. The first person who trafficked her was her mother.
McDonald, who was convicted of felony prostitution, asked lawmakers to confirm that the legislation would allow trafficking survivors to apply for expungement.
“Am I correct that’s part of this piece of legislation?” she asked, initially to silence, each refrain more insistent. “Am I correct? Am I correct?”
McDonald said that after she escaped her trafficker, the felony on her record followed her as she worked to build a new life.
“Do you understand how hard it was to find services, to find any place to give me a job?” she asked. “I had never had a job in my life. Do you know how hard it was for me to find a place to live? Nobody would rent to me. Do you know how hard it was to face anybody in the community and in church because I was a felony prostitute?”
Lawmakers said proposed legislation would move away from blaming people who are coerced into sexual encounters.
All 58 mentions of “child pornography” in current law would change to “child sexual abuse material.”

“Child sexual abuse material’ indicates what it is,” Lewis said. “If a person is under the age of 18, if they’re 17 and under, they cannot provide consent.”
The law would seek to quash demand by making it a felony to pay for sex. The maximum penalty for buying sex with a teen aged 15 to 18 would increase from four to seven years in prison. Buying sex with someone under 15 carries a sentence of five to 15 years.
Myers highlighted the importance of the training his bill would mandate for first responders. He said anti-trafficking training he took as a state trooper made him realize cases he might have missed.
“I realized I had cases like these before,” Myers said. “I just didn’t realize what I was looking at.”
Under the bill, emergency medical technicians, peace officers, social workers, prosecuting attorneys and juvenile officers would have to complete annual training on sex and human trafficking.
 Protecting young people

More than one lawmaker teared up as survivors and family members testified about how adults they had trusted manipulated and abused them or their loved ones.
Jeff Dixon carried a thick binder to the witness table containing “a third of the 17,000 text messages” he said were sent to his two teen daughters by their Taekwondo instructor. The messages included photographs showing the results of a “bruising game” the man used to engage in with the young women, Dixon said.
Evelyn Dixon spoke about how the instructor cultivated her trust, complimenting her martial arts technique and confiding about his personal life before pressuring her to run away with him to Florida.
“I wasn’t able to process anything, and the things that would usually send me running didn’t seem to matter anymore,” she said.
Her father said state law should punish adults whose exploitation of minors doesn’t include sex.
“That’s why this bill is important, is because everything he did, because there was no rape, there’s no dirty pictures, there’s no sex, everything he did was legal,” Dixon said.
Missouri law already includes the crime of “enticement of a child” through words, actions or communication “for the purpose of engaging in sexual conduct.”
Warwick said the intent of the proposed legislation is to more explicitly lay out what constitutes a predatory pattern of behavior. While current law “takes care of once a sexual act is actually committed against a minor,” he said, “what’s not being done is content that is being introduced.”
The proposed legislation would make it a felony to engage in “grooming,” with a minimum sentence of five years in prison.
State Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson, expressed lawmakers’ support for survivors who testified.

Travis Holdman, R-Markle, speaks at the annual Dentons Legislative Conference on Dec. 18, 2025. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A key finance panel on Tuesday inserted a one-year state income tax break on overtime and tips for Hoosier workers.
The amendment would cost the state $251 million in tax revenue and that loss would be covered by the growing state surplus, said Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle.
“This would be for just one year until we see if we can actually afford to go forward. And folks, this would come out of the reserves that we have accumulated at the state level,” Holdman said.
Lawmakers will decide during budget negotiations in 2027 whether to make it permanent.
Holdman, who chairs the Senate Tax and Fiscal Policy Committee, said it applies to 2026 wages on tax returns filed in 2027.
The amendment was inserted into Senate Bill 243, which passed 11-1. It now moves to the Senate floor.
Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis, voted against the bill after noting that Indiana continues to have a tax on period products even though it would cost the state only $5 million.
The amendment would couple Indiana’s tax code to federal tax code with regard to no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and no tax on loan interest for American-made vehicles passed in the One Big Beautiful Bill that President Donald Trump pushed through Congress last summer.
But it also cuts close to opening the current two-year budget, which Gov. Mike Braun and Republican legislative leaders have said they wouldn’t do.
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray applauded the bill.
“These state income tax cuts are a concrete way we can help hardworking Hoosiers keep more of their hard-earned money,” Bray said. “These cuts come on the heels of our strong track record of cutting taxes. Statehouse Republicans have cut taxes more than 20 times in 10 years, the income tax rate dropped yet again on Jan. 1 of this year, and this year two-thirds of Hoosiers are expected to see a property tax bill lower than their 2025 bill following a historic property tax relief package resulting in $1.3 billion in property tax relief over the next three years.”
An analysis from Braun’s administration estimated that total state tax breaks on businesses and individuals from tax conformity could top $900 million over the next two years if the Legislature were to fully conform the state tax code with the federal changes.
The Senate already passed Senate Bill 212 to adopt a few of the federal tax breaks that would apply this tax season. This includes strengthening the state adoption tax credit.
The House is expected to take that legislation up quickly and send it to Braun for his signature.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0626-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 10:59:51.868318

This image of Johnston is of her at a Board of Regents meeting in 2024 in Manhattan. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents ordered state public universities to implement faculty workload and tenure review policies that will bring underperforming professors to remediation, with termination a potential consequence for failure to address deficiencies.
The mandate applied to thousands of faculty employed at Kansas State University, the University of Kansas, Pittsburg State University, Fort Hays State University, Emporia State University and Wichita State University. Expectations for nontenure, tenure-track and tenured faculty wouldn’t be identical from university to university, but all would be assigned annual course instructional loads and undergo yearly reviews in terms of teaching, research and public service.
Faculty at the state’s three research-oriented universities — KU, K-State and WSU — would be expected to teach six to nine credit hours per semester. Annual reviews of these faculty would be based on teaching at 40% to 55% of the workload. Research obligations would range from 35% to 45% of the total. Public service would be 5% to 20% of the job.
Faculty at the three regional universities — PSU, ESU and FHSU — would be assigned 12 credit hours of instructional course work each semester. The faculty evaluation breakdown: teaching, 60% to 75%; research, 15% to 30%; and public service, 5% to 20%.
Tenured university faculty in the Board of Regents system would undergo performance assessments by a campus committee every five years. Those determined to be less than satisfactory would be placed on self-improvement plans. If a faculty member earned a second unsatisfactory annual review, the policy said, the individual would be subject to dismissal, reassignment or other personnel action.
Rusty Monhollon, vice president of academic affairs for the Board of Regents, said the post-tenure and workload policies would help administrators identify faculty falling short of standards and those exceeding those metrics. The goal was to make evaluation of faculty less subjective and to address consternation about the rigor of decisions about faculty appointments, he said.
He expected few university faculty to fail to abide by new productivity standards because the “work they do is good.”
“These are very important policies that are impactful. We want to make sure we get it right,” said Alysia Johnston, a member of the Board of Regents.
Johnston, a former president of Fort Scott Community College, said the final version of policies approved by the Board of Regents left the analysis of tenure review cases to university administrators because the state board didn’t have the expertise to make scholarly judgments. She said the Board of Regents would consider tenure appeals based on claims that due process rights were violated by university administrators.
The Board of Regents voted unanimously at its January meeting to require the six universities to begin documenting and reporting faculty performance data that would be shared with legislators and others to enhance transparency and accountability in higher education.
University reporting would include statistics on student credit hours produced, percentage of credit hours by full-time faculty, bachelor’s degrees awarded, student retention, faculty scholarship and faculty research funding. Information about the number of people granted and denied tenure and the number of faculty who left each university must be documented.
Board of Regents member Matt Crocker, a Manhattan businessman, said he appreciated that the development of a systemwide faculty review policy involved considerable effort by the Board of Regents. He said there was an expectation among members of the Kansas Legislature that faculty workload policies would be rigorous. In the past two years, members of the Legislature raised the possibility of modifying tenure at the state universities.
“The question I seem to get all the time, especially here in Topeka, is making sure I’m a good steward for the state’s funding for higher education,” he said.
Under the Board of Regents policy, each university would craft faculty workload expectations that were “equitable, fair and balanced, and aligned with the unique needs of each department and the whole institution.” While all faculty would be assigned teaching loads, the policy said, exceptions would be permitted for clinical or research faculty, librarians and other personnel in noninstructional roles.
The new systemwide policy was developed by Board of Regents’ staff, university administrators and faculty as well as state politicians. At least four drafts were circulated for review and comment during the past seven months.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alysia-Johnston-board-of-regents-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-20 10:59:51.868318

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)The weekend of Jan. 10, my sister and I went past the Roundhouse in Santa Fe to check out a protest dubbed ICE OUT FOR GOOD. It was a beautiful cold day after our first snow and folks were out on the sidewalk demanding to have their voices heard. There were costumes and American flags and handmade signs that were earnest and forceful and witty and rude. I saw a giant Elmo jubilantly making his way through the crowd. The people in attendance were incensed by the Jan. 7 execution of Renee Good by the hands of ICE agents in Minneapolis. 
Yet the protest left me with one big question: What does the demand ICE OUT FOR GOOD realistically mean in New Mexico? The federal government has broad legal latitude to send ICE agents into states and cities. Sanctuary and Welcoming City designations do not prohibit ICE from being in our communities; they just limit the capacity of our local and statewide agencies to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. As any political leader will tell you, solutions to the question of how to keep ICE out of our cities have never been easy to come by and would inevitably face constitutional scrutiny. 
But political pressure is mounting. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey publicly demanded that ICE leave Minneapolis and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is also standing strong against their presence. The states of Illinois and Minnesota recently sued in federal court to block the government from deploying federal agents to their cities. All three of New Mexico’s representatives to Congress signed impeachment papers for Kristi Noem. Whether any of this will generate sincere power to disrupt the Department of Homeland Security’s plans remains an open question.
I do think there is value in people showing up in numbers to shout and wave signs as a show of public values. But I prefer demonstrations that are a little disobedient or  disrupt something or come with a threat of action. What will we do if our political leaders do not support our demands? Are we prepared to vote out Democrats who don’t stand up to ICE? Are we prepared to plan civil disobedience actions that disrupt life in New Mexico or our economy? These are the questions I ask myself when I think about how to generate power to confront this threat. 
The New Mexico legislative session starts this week. There are going to be several bills aimed at protecting non-citizens and challenging ICE’s ability to operate with impunity in our state. One such bill is known as the Immigrant Safety Act. It would prohibit public entities, like our counties, from contracting with ICE to house immigrant detainees in the state. It would not be an outright ban but it would create new and  significant challenges for the federal government to maintain immigration detention in our state. Advocates have been pushing this legislation for years at the Roundhouse and it has always fallen short. 2026 needs to be the year when it crosses the finish line. 
It’s time to pay attention. I have seen plenty of people raising their voices, so to speak, on social media and I have been in rooms full of people who are begging to know what they can do to help protect our non-citizen neighbors. In the coming weeks, we must show up and demand that our political leaders support every bill that challenges ICE’s presence in our state and seeks to protect our non-citizen neighbors. We need to make them worry about their jobs if they don’t. 
Pay attention to the voice of people at organizations like Somos Un Pueblo Unido, New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, El Centro de Igualdad y Derechos, Contigo Immigrant Justice, Innovation Law lab, the Semilla Project, Semilla Action, CAFé Accion and the ACLU of New Mexico. You may be new to the fight for immigrant justice in New Mexico. They are not. They have powerful ideas rooted in the realities of the communities they work in. 
Getting ICE OUT FOR GOOD is going to take creativity and sacrifice and the political courage of our elected leaders. It will be a long and slow fight, even as the pain of Renee Good’s murder recedes from our collective memories. We must follow the lead of the  brilliant advocates in our state who have been fighting for the safety of our immigrant families. And if we do, as New Mexicans, we have a chance in this legislative session to take powerful and concrete steps to exert our state power. And then we have to keep going.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2992-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 10:59:51.868318
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-20 15:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,NYC is testing guaranteed income for homeless youths,Haidee Chu | THE CITY,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/nyc-is-testing-guaranteed-income-for-homeless-youths/,"An ambitious experiment to give young people money and trust them to spend it well shows promising early signs, participants say.","What can a $1,200 monthly allowance do for young adults experiencing homelessness? 
In The Bronx, a 22-year-old said she is finally able to save up for a rent security deposit for the first time since entering the shelter system a year and a half ago. 
In Harlem, a 19-year-old Lehman College student said her dream of pursuing a cosmetology license finally feels within reach.
New York City is home to more than 6,800 homeless youths who are not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian, and who either live on the streets or are sheltered in temporary settings. Since December, 60 of them — aged 18 through 24 — have been receiving monthly cash payments of $1,200 after they were selected at random to participate in a program called “Cash for Care,” run in partnership with Covenant House New York, a non-profit service and shelter provider for homeless and runaway youths.
The $1.5 million initiative, funded by the City Council under the leadership of former speaker Adrienne Adams, also provides recipients with a one-time lump sum of $5,000 — accessible at any time during the program — in addition to the monthly payments. The program includes services such as help with financial planning, housing searches and career development, and will run through this June. 
The Covenant House youth shelter in Hell’s Kitchen helped connect young people with employers, Jan. 8, 2026.
The program was introduced in collaboration with policy research center Chapin Hall to test whether a guaranteed income can help youths transition out of homelessness. The idea, which has gained some nationwide traction in recent years, is to simply give people cash and let them decide what to do with it.
The new project builds on the research center’s “Trust Youth Initiative”, which was launched during the pandemic in June 2021 and also offered monthly stipends to a few dozen homeless young people in the city. 
More than 90% of participants in the 2021 initiative said the monthly stipends helped them find stable housing. The current iteration, though, is looking to reassess the efficacy of the payments in light of dramatic rent increases and rollbacks in emergency rental assistance in the years that followed, said Chapin Hall policy fellow Sarah Berger Gonzalez.
Researchers will measure outcomes in housing stability and food security through surveys and casework data among program participants, she added, and compare the results against a control group of another 60 Covenant House youths who will not receive the support. (All survey responders can earn up to around $400, depending on participation.)
So far, youth participants who spoke to THE CITY said the cash assistance has opened up new possibilities for them. Those youths spoke under the condition of anonymity to protect their privacy and to avoid conflict with other youths in the shelters who were not selected for the program.
For the 22-year-old, who currently lives in a Bronx shelter, the new stream of income means she’s now able to explore permanent housing options outside the city’s rapid re-housing program, where her application has been pending for months. 
“I’ve been in the shelter for so long, it sometimes is a little depressing, because I’m just like, ‘OK, when are they going to get back to me about this apartment?” said the 22-year-old, who has cycled in and out of youth shelters since her family was evicted from their home a year and a half ago. “Now, with this money, me and my sister are like, ‘OK, it may just be easier to get that apartment ourselves.”
A 22-year-old Covenant House participant said she’s using a cash stipend to save up for a security deposit and to enroll in a trade training program, Jan. 8, 2026.
She also plans to use the money to explore new skills, she said. She had been unable to attend cost-free training in medical billing or sterile cleaning techniques, she noted, because they conflict with her work as a sales associate at Bronx Zoo. But with the monthly stipends, she said, she can now pay out of pocket for ones that fit her schedule.
Soon, she’ll start driving lessons, too.
“The options are unlimited now,” she said.
‘Are We Crazy?’
Covenant House New York CEO Shakeema North-Albert said she wasn’t always convinced that a guaranteed income program would work when Chapin Hall initially approached her with the idea.
“Putting myself in the shoes of someone else, who’s not rich and who had to figure it out, if someone gave me $1,000 a month and said, ‘you could just do whatever you want with it,’ I probably would have blown most of it because I would have went out and got all the things I thought I was lacking,” said North-Albert. “It would have taken me maybe three months to get it figured out and say, like, “girl, you’re running out of money, you need to figure something out.’”’
Covenant House CEO Shakeema North-Albert spoke about their new program to provide cash assistance to homeless youth, Jan. 8, 2026.
But, North-Albert said, she hoped the program could nonetheless pose an opportunity to shift away from the crisis shelter model and towards innovations that could help youths transition out of homelessness entirely, looking to the Trust Youth Initiative as a model. Unlike some other guaranteed income programs, she said, that model incorporated services designed to help people find stable housing.
“The supportive services piece made it more attractive to me,” said North-Albert, who now hopes to secure more funding to scale up the program. “The youths still have the autonomy to make whatever decision they want to make, but at least we’ll help coach them and help them look at this opportunity in light of their current situation to help them get closer to whatever their goals are.”
Lyndell Pittman, the organization’s senior vice president of support services, said he initially shared similar doubts.
“Quite frankly, when [North-Albert] told me what we were doing, I was like, ‘Are we crazy?’” Pittman said. “But I got to see young people with a desire to change their situations, and willing to learn and accept the support to learn.”
Covenant House Senior Vice President of Support Services Lyndell Pittman spoke about their new program to provide cash assistance to homeless youth, Jan. 8, 2026.
Many youths, he said, talked about paying off debts and bills at the onset of the program. One youth in particular, he said, shared how the money would help get her on track to reuniting with her child, who is currently under foster care.
“I’m not at a 180 but I’m at a 160,” Pittman added, describing his change in attitude. “Watching the young people’s lightbulb come on about finances has been a real thing.”
One 19-year-old Covenant House resident told THE CITY her approach to the stipend has already shifted from when she received her first deposit last month.
“I didn’t want to save that first paycheck. I just wanted to have a bit of fun, so I bought a phone and just kind of tried new places outside,” she said. “But I met with my case manager, and she kind of encouraged me. She’s like, ‘Are you saving?’ And then I thought about it, and I also thought I should save.”
She’s currently taking a break from her studies at City College to discover more about herself and what she may want to pursue as a career, she added, and has struggled to find a job due to her mental health. 
“You don’t get money going to school, so it just felt like it wasn’t a priority right now,” she said.
The monthly allowances, meanwhile, have helped ease her financial anxieties.
Another 19-year-old, the Lehman College student, said she had initially increased her spending after the first infusion of cash, but now limits her spending to $100 or less a week and saves at least $500 from each deposit.
A 19-year-old Covenant House participant said she plans to pursue a cosmetology license with the monthly cash stipend, Jan. 8, 2026.
The steady monthly payments, she said, mean she’s no longer looking for financial support from her mother, who she said lives with alcohol dependency and kicked her out in October after an argument. Their relationship has since improved, she added, and she moved home to live with her mother a few weeks ago.
She now plans to set aside part of her monthly stipends for a cosmetology license and to buy makeup so she can begin offering workshops and classes, she said. 
She showed off her vision board for the year, and described the photos and quotes she pasted on a piece of paper: “Savings, 8 A’s, a candle, coffee, the bible, hot girls, driver’s license, and then my cosmetology license is also on there.”
“My birthday is about to come up, I’m going to be turning 20,” she continued. “And I’m trying to convert to better habits. So I’m like, ‘OK, let me lock in.’”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010826_covenant_house-3-1024x683.webp,,,2026-01-20 11:57:57.821183

Phil Murphy said one of the bills would have attracted judicial scrutiny and the other might have conflicted with federal law.,"Gov. Phil Murphy said one of the bills would have attracted judicial scrutiny and the other might have conflicted with federal law. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy, who made protecting immigrants a pillar of his first campaign for governor, used some of his final hours in office Tuesday to veto two sweeping bills designed to expand migrant rights.
The bills left unsigned would have written the attorney general’s 2018 Immigrant Trust Directive into law — the order restricts when local, county, and state police can aid federal immigration agents — and created new safeguards for sensitive personal data provided by New Jerseyans to hospitals, schools, and libraries can be shared.
Murphy, a Democrat who is leaving office at noon Tuesday after two terms as governor, said the codification bill had significant differences from the directive that made him fear it would attract renewed judicial scrutiny. The directive has stood up in court, including at the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, he noted.

“I am extremely concerned that signing this bill, which differs from the Immigrant Trust Directive, would open New Jersey up to a new court challenge and renewed judicial scrutiny from judges who may not render the same decision upholding these critical protections,” Murphy said. “Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop. I cannot in good conscience allow that to happen.”
Murphy added that while he supported the data privacy protection bill — he conditionally vetoed the measure after a voting session last week and sent it back to the Legislature for amendments that lawmakers then hastily agreed to — his team “discovered a drafting oversight that could create significant complications.” Because a new legislative session has started since the bill passed the Legislature, it’s too late to seek new changes to the measure.
“The bill as written could be construed to conflict with federal law and, if signed, could jeopardize billions of dollars in federal funding for critical programs that serve the people of New Jersey,” said Murphy. “I deeply wish there was sufficient time left to correct this issue, but it is not possible due to the expiration of the legislative session. Therefore, the only responsible option is to decline to act on the bill at this time.”
Immigrant advocates blasted Murphy for vetoing bills they said would provide vital protections for migrants amid a time of aggressive enforcement by the Trump administration. They have warned that a future attorney general could withdraw the directive at any moment.
The vetoes are known as pocket vetoes, meaning they aren’t being sent to the Legislature for a potential override because they were passed in the final days of a legislative session.
Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D), who becomes governor at noon, declined to say on the campaign trail whether she would support legislation codifying the policy, but she did express fear, like Murphy did Tuesday, that codifying the 2018 directive would open the state up to new lawsuits.
Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, which supported the bills, said he is “deeply disappointed” with Murphy declining to sign two of them.
“In failing to sign these bills, Governor Murphy has left New Jersey without critical protections at a moment when ICE is brutalizing our communities. These bills were legally sound, politically viable, and commonsense policy. We call on Governor-elect Sherrill, her administration, and the Legislature to establish data privacy protections and ensure state and local resources are not commandeered for federal immigration enforcement – we have no time to waste,” Sinha said in a statement.
In his two terms at the helm of the state, Murphy was lauded as an ally to immigrants in New Jersey and worked closely with immigrant-focused organizations. He signed landmark bills greenlighting driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants, offering pandemic relief dollars to migrants who weren’t eligible for federal aid, and expanding in-state tuition to include undocumented college students.
In New Jersey, 1 in 4 residents is an immigrant, and more than 500,000 residents are estimated to be undocumented.
The two bills Murphy declined to sign were part of a three-bill package introduced earlier this month. Murphy signed the third, which requires the Attorney General’s Office to designate specific locations where immigration enforcement will be barred.
Murphy said he’s hopeful the Legislature will reintroduce the data privacy bill and pass an amended version“so it can be signed into law at the soonest opportunity.”
The three bills were introduced, advanced in committee, and approved by the Legislature in the final weeks of its last legislative session. They faced staunch Republican opposition.
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) told reporters last week that he believed the governor would sign the bills, “and that’ll be the law.”
“Too many people are living in fear” of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, he said.
Coughlin’s office did not comment on Murphy’s veto. Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

MAURA HEALEY announced this month that the state would use $250 million from a state trust fund to assist some Massachusetts residents who have lost enhanced federal subsidies to pay for health care coverage. The Affordable Care Act tax credits were rolled out under the Biden administration during the pandemic through the American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA. They made it easier for people at more moderate income levels to access subsidized care.  
But those credits expired at the end of 2025, with Republican resistance to extending them central to the government shutdown last year.  
They may yet return, as there is some bipartisan support for the tax credits in the House, but the Senate still seems cool to the idea. In the meantime, some states have moved to fill the funding gap. In Massachusetts, Healey said the state will cover $250 million that had come from the federal government through ARPA by tapping the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund, a state account that draws on several revenue streams. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith unravels the health coverage moves with Audrey Morse Gasteier, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, and Alex Sheff, senior director of policy and government affairs at Health Care For All. Here are some of the highlights on how we got here and what the funding change means for Massachusetts residents: 
Where were we in 2025?
To start, the foundation of Massachusetts’s subsidized health care market is MassHealth, the name for the state Medicaid system – a joint state-federal program that provides health care coverage to low-income households, children, the elderly, and disabled residents. Under Gov. Mitt Romney, in 2006, so-called Romneycare was passed, building on the MassHealth structure with additional subsidies that boosted health care access for people who would not be eligible for Medicaid but are still lower income. Those subsidies, offered through the state ConnectorCare program, are run by the Health Connector and funded in part by the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund – also set up during Romney’s tenure – which brings in revenue from the cigarette tax, a state employer payroll tax, and other streams.   
When the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 under President Barack Obama, it ramped up insurance coverage and requirements, though the Bay State was already surpassing many of those standards. So before the pandemic, Massachusetts and the federal government were splitting the cost of subsidized insurance for low- and moderate-income residents.  
The American Rescue Plan Act passed during the pandemic under President Joe Biden. This “really turbocharged how much the feds were kicking in both for coverage for people in the ConnectorCare program, which was at the time for people up to about three times the federal poverty level,” Gasteier said. “It also brought tax credits to even more people, even outside of what ConnectorCare had covered. So there was a really vast number of people in the Commonwealth who were helped either through the ConnectorCare program or directly through the tax credits that came along as a result of the American Rescue Plan.” 
What did that mean for the trust fund and coverage?
With those ARPA credits in place, about $425 million new dollars were flowing into the state each year, Gasteier said. That offset about $250 million a year in state spending, and the rest went directly to people who were newly helped by the expanded tax credits.  
This meant that the newly flush trust fund was able to expand coverage, through a pilot program, by increasing its income ceiling. 
According to Sheff, about one in five people in this expanded population reported getting preventive care that they had put off for affordability reasons. About one in 10 picked up a prescription they felt like they couldn’t afford to take before. “And on top of all of that, it lowered everybody’s premiums really significantly on a monthly basis,” he said. “So kind of a win-win from our perspective. And so then the question becomes, you know, how sustainable is this?” 
So what happened after the tax credits expired?
The state still has a few days left of open enrollment through the Connector — it ends on January 23. And from Gasteier’s perspective, Massachusetts saw “exactly what we worried we would see this open enrollment,” both due to “congressional inaction” on renewing the subsidies and the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed last year. 
“What we are seeing is double the number of people have proactively terminated their coverage for 2026 than we saw at this time last open enrollment period,” she said. “So that’s just the first wave of people who looked at their bill for January and said, ‘I cannot do this.’”  
About 25,000 people have canceled outright, she said, but the state will need to wait a bit longer to understand what she calls “quiet cancellations.” Those will be people who got a premium bill in December for their January coverage that they will not be able to afford and just didn’t pay it, she said. They will be terminated from their coverage if they don’t settle up by the end of January. 
The group she and Sheff are most concerned about in terms of dropping coverage are those on the other side of an “eligibility cliff,” or just over 400 percent of the federal poverty level and making about $63,000 a year, without much extra money after handling housing, rent, and other expenses.  
Health Care For All takes about 20,000 calls a year on its helpline, Sheff said, and “we heard from people that said, ‘Oh my gosh, this changes my whole budget, my whole universe.’”  
But we knew the credits would expire. Did the state treat the new funding like we would always have this bigger pot going forward?
“It can feel now like it was a foregone conclusion that these enhanced premium tax credits weren’t gonna continue,” Sheff said. But, “certainly when we started the pilot, and even a few months ago, I wouldn’t have said that was an obvious outcome.” 
The outcome of the presidential race was uncertain, he noted, as was control of Congress. 
“If a different party was in control, the outcomes might look different,” he said. Over the course of the year, advocates and the state were in conversation with the state’s congressional delegation, he said, and Gasteier testified on the issue before Congress.  
Sheff said there was “a real sense” that there could be bipartisan agreement to extend the credits. “I think we held out hope for quite a long time that that could still happen,” Sheff said.  
They were hoping that in a different world, the pilot could continue without additional cost to the state, he said, but designing it as a pilot was a tacit acknowledgment that the funding could evaporate. It was a proof of concept, he noted, that expanding coverage could lead to better health access outcomes for those on one side of the eligibility cliff.  
Why wait until January to announce the somewhat restored funding?
“Of course we’ve all been pressing, pressing, pressing all through 2025, the strongest advocacy possible all the way through this open enrollment period, even hoping after the new year something would happen,” Gasteier said. “The governor’s announcement was to acknowledge that because of that expiration, the state is going to have to spend 250 million more dollars in order to keep that program operating as intended.” 
This is a step, she said, to keep the state from moving backwards from its pre-pandemic coverage commitments. It’s a “clarification and a recommitment,” she said, that the federal government stepping back does not mean Massachusetts will step back from the ConnectorCare program. 
Healey took a different tone in her description of the investment, with her office dubbing it the “strongest plan in the country to protect against President Trump’s ACA cost hikes.”  
Gasteier described Massachusetts as “by far the best positioned state in terms of the tools we have in place to best buffer people with the tools that we do have… if we’re seeing this pain in Massachusetts with the tools and protections we have, I shudder to think what is happening in 49 other states while we’re still waiting for the dust to settle and all the data to come in.” 
The funding will protect about 40,000 people who were part of the expansion, Sheff said. But it will not solve for the group just over that eligibility cliff that saw expanded coverage through the Connector pilot — more than 27,000 people, according to Gasteier. 
Sheff said the Connector and Health Care For All tried to be proactive in sounding the alarm about the looming loss of federal funding. “There’s also just an extent to which people don’t fully absorb what’s happening until it’s happening,” he said. His organization often hears from people who plan to keep their coverage, “and then the bill is due and, and they just can’t do it. I think it just is a reality that folks are focused on what’s right in front of them, particularly for this group that’s operating kind of paycheck to paycheck. So I think the state has done a good job as they can.” 
But is this just a one-year fix?
The Connector makes all budgeting and policy and program design decisions “on an annual basis,” Gasteier said. “So I don’t want to sort of hold up a crystal ball with respect to where we’ll be three, four, or five years from now, but we were so heartened by the state and the governor’s leadership and continued commitment to making sure that we’re showing up for people in the ConnectorCare program in the way that we’ve been able to over the years, even as we see the feds walk away from a very proven, impactful model of enhancing affordability for people.” 
In simple terms, this funding is what’s needed to “hold things kind of harmless or close to harmless” as possible, she said. But there is still a $175 million impact set to hit residents this year who now sit just outside of the ConnectorCare’s reach. 
So where does that leave us in the long-term?
In an uncertain place. MassHealth and the Health Connector are in conversations about “how we can plug holes where we’re able,” Gasteier said. The program is “designed for the long haul,” she said, and the state will need to figure out a “holistic” response given the array of federal cuts it is weathering “as we’re navigating this new world order.” 
The trust fund does have some room, but between the expanded pilot and money dedicated to help shore up the state’s stretched Health Safety net, the $250 million would take a hefty chunk out of the surplus.  
According to Doug Howgate, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, at the end of 2020, before the new tax credits took effect, the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund sat at roughly $65 million. In 2024, it held about $510 million, and by the end of 2025 it sat at about $350 million because of dedicated Health Safety Net funding and the expanded coverage pilot. 
For now, with some stabilized financing for the year, the Connector and Health Care For All are focusing on outreach to impacted residents. Sheff points to the complicated MassHealth redetermination process that started in 2023 as an indicator that an outreach and engagement effort can reach hundreds of thousands of residents affected by major health coverage shifts.  
“It’s cold comfort to somebody who’s seeing their premium double that we’re doing everything we can to clearly communicate with you about your premium doubling,” Gasteier said. “But that is what we’re trying to do — is let these people know we see you, we’re hearing what you’re going through, we are doing everything we possibly can to connect you with coverage you can afford, and trying to be the sword and shield for these folks.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Health-Connector.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-20 09:57:46.068458

The family will hold a celebration of Maureen’s life this summer. 

Maureen Larkin Seiple, wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, friend, teacher and world traveler, passed away peacefully, at the age of 99, on Jan. 8, 2026. She touched many lives in her near-century on this planet, and left it a better place.
Maureen was born in Northampton, Massachusetts on Aug. 13, 1926, and lived in Hartford, Connecticut until eighth grade.  During that time, she lost her older sister to scarlet fever and her mother to cancer.  In 1940, her family moved to Washington D.C. After graduating from high school on D-Day, she attended evening classes at George Washington University, earning tuition money by working in the college dean’s office during the day.
One day a war vet named Stan Seiple stopped by the office. Maureen thought him quite handsome, and took advantage of her position to look up his schedule and sign up for one of his classes. The rest, as they say, is history, and they married shortly after she graduated in 1950 — a union that lasted 60 years.
In 1964, Maureen and Stan and their three children left D.C. for the greener pastures of Essex Junction, Vermont.  As her children grew older, Maureen began searching for a career that would offer her new challenges, and soon decided on teaching.
After completing a master’s degree from St. Michael’s College, she began teaching children with learning disabilities in the Essex Junction school system. It was a career that she loved, and one in which she made a big difference in her students’ lives — and not only in the classroom. For example, she once persuaded a local merchant to provide a pair of winter shoes to a student in need. 
Her students returned her affection, and some of them stayed in touch with her for the rest of her life.  She loved to tell of the letter she received from one them years after she had him as a student.  “Dear Mrs. Seiple,” it read, “I miss you.  I hope you miss me.”
Maureen retired from teaching in her early ’60s, frustrated with the educational bureaucracy. But, still needing to be involved in her community, she began a new career working with refugees from places like Russia, Africa, Bhutan and Myanmar, helping them learn a new language and acclimate to American life. As usual, she couldn’t avoid becoming personally involved in their lives, frequently becoming a family friend. When the mother in one of her refugee families died, Maureen stayed close to her children for many years.
Whether it was her students or her refugee families, Maureen always went the extra mile. “You get involved in their lives,” she said.  “You don’t just walk in, teach, and leave.”
Maureen kept busy outside of teaching. Soon after retiring, someone contacted her to ask if she knew anyone interested in trading homes for a year with a French IBM employee and his family.  She and Stan decided they were interested — and within a few days they were off on a yearlong adventure that took them all over Europe.  They enjoyed the experience so much that, a few years later, they arranged to spend several months traveling around Australia and New Zealand after trading homes with a family from Sydney.
In her later years, Maureen enjoyed spending time with her family and a devoted circle of friends. She was proud to be a member of the book club she helped found more that 20 years ago, whose meetings she always loved attending. She also enjoyed attending the annual fundraiser for Dismas of Vermont along with the family of one of her former students.
When Stan began his long battle with Alzheimer’s, Maureen cared for him at home as long as she could, before his death in 2011, and afterward maintained ties to his sister, Faith, and her family. In 2001, she lost her adored brother Pat, but stayed in close touch with his wife, Mary Ann, their children, and their families. She also maintained close ties with her nephew David Stan Hettich and his family. Maureen was predeceased by her granddaughter Katy Currier whom she loved dearly and whose smile and spontaneous visits on her way home from school always perked up her day.
In addition to her children, Andy, Pam and Garth, and her grandchildren, Larkin, Lizzie, Julia, Stephen, Katie and Emily, Maureen was delighted to become a great-grandmother to Gus, Rosie, Kaia, Kane and Sadie, proudly displaying to visitors their latest photos.
The family will hold a celebration of Maureen’s life this summer.  We encourage anyone wishing to honor Maureen’s memory to consider making a donation to Dismas of Vermont, which helps formerly incarcerated Vermonters reintegrate with society. You can donate at their website.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from the Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications committee hearing)TOPEKA — Projected increases in electricity load growth are as high as 99% by 2035, a data point that pushed regional energy regulators to create a plan to stabilize and expand grid capacity and transmission, a legislative committee learned Thursday.
Part of that process includes building a controversial transmission line that will travel through four Kansas counties.
Justin Grady, director of utilities for the Kansas Corporation Commission, told the House Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications Committee that a proposed 133-mile, 345 kilovolt transmission line to be built by Evergy will travel through western Sedgwick, Sumner, Cowley and Chautauqua counties.
The project is part of Southwest Power Pool’s annual plan to support projected growth in electricity usage across its 14-state coverage area, Grady said. SPP is one of seven nonprofit organizations approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to oversee transmission infrastructure, ensure utility system reliability and manage the wholesale electricity market.
Grady said the original SPP transmission plan included $18.1 billion of transmission projects to handle expected grid expansion, but KCC and others in the state’s energy industry met with SPP and agreed on fewer projects in the immediate future.
“The projects that ultimately got notices to construct were the consensus, essentially, of the stakeholders, that these are the projects we cannot afford to delay,” Grady said. “These are reliability projects.”
Transmission projects are challenging to implement because people don’t like them, he said. 
“It’s not easy to site a transmission line,” Grady said. “By and large, landowners do not like it, and I understand completely. It carves a scar basically across the state of Kansas.”
Landowners on the planned transmission route showed up at two public hearings on Jan. 8 and 9 to voice concerns and objections to the transmission line.
John Timmerman said he has a contract for a wind energy project on his Sumner County land where the transmission line will cross. He told Evergy and KCC at the hearing that he stands to lose as much as $250,000 if he loses the wind contract.
“This line for the height and the position that it’s in will negate that windmill project,” he said at the public hearing.
Grady told the Energy committee the transmission project is necessary to support additional generation that will be added in upcoming years. Electricity needs in the region have been emphasized by storms in the past few years, including storm Uri in winter 2021 and storm Elliott, a 2022 winter storm, when the grid was stressed, he said.
“Last year during pretty mild weather, there were actual controlled load shed events in the southwest portion of the systems,” Grady said.  
Load shed refers to a purposeful, controlled shutoff of electricity in order to avoid a larger collapse of electric reliability, Grady said in an email after the meeting.
“When that one day of load shed comes in an 80-year period of time, which was winter storm Uri, then all we talk about for three years is, why did the lights go off?” he said. “Reliability is obviously job No. 1 for electric utilities and regulators, mixed in with affordability.”
Grady said load growth projections are almost “unbelievable,” showing growth in two years that previously would have been projected for 10 years. The SPP’s plan projected how many load shed events would occur if no changes occurred, he said, and the estimate is 114 days a year in 2034.
“The standard is one day in 10 years — that’s the legal standard FERC requires them to uphold,” Grady said.
In the most conservative SPP models, the $8 billion transmission project will pay for itself by 2034.
“At its worst, when this $8 billion of transmission is built at the highest price it will ever be, in 2034 that will cost an average residential customer $2.99 a month,” Grady said, adding that models that include economic benefits show a $5.31 benefit to Kansas customers.
Looking outside of transmission to need for new electricity generation resources, Grady said SPP’s projects show adequate capacity for 2025, with a 20.7% reserve margin. However, if new generating resources aren’t added by summer 2027, the reserve margin will fall to 11.8%, and by 2030, that margin would be -1.6%.
Grady said one of the questions that came up at public hearings about the proposed transmission line was whether the addition supports Kansas electricity needs or is only about shipping electricity outside the state.
“That line was engineered and designed to correct for the severe reliability issues that occurred during winter storm Elliott,” Grady said.
Elliott occurred just after Uri and resulted in millions of people losing electricity on Christmas Eve, he said.
“We avoided load shed in SPP, mainly because there was 20,000 megawatts of wind online,” Grady said. “We are connected electrically to the entire eastern United States. Sometimes major reliability events that are happening in North Carolina can even ultimately affect what happens in southeast Kansas. The reality is that’s the reason this transmission line was designed and built. My position is that certainly that line will benefit Kansans.”
KCC is holding a third public hearing on the proposed transmission line at 6 p.m. Tuesday, at the Hutchinson Community College Stringer Fine Arts Center. The meeting can be attended by Zoom or in-person, but residents wanting to make public comments should register by noon Monday.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Justin-Grady-legislature-1024x656.png,,,2026-01-20 09:57:46.068458

(Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)Alaska schools, students and education funding will continue to be in focus in the 2026 legislative session set to begin on Jan. 20, but early signs show they are unlikely to be at the center of the political spotlight as they were last year. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy will not be pursuing education policy changes this year, according to a spokesperson with his office on Friday. Instead, he will focus on a state fiscal plan and the proposed development of the Alaska LNG gas pipeline, his office said. 
Those policy changes were at the heart of Dunleavy’s objection to increased education funding last year, and he said they were essential to boosting student achievement. He called a special session in August for lawmakers to address his policy items, but legislators took no action other than overriding two of his vetoes. 
One of those veto overrides was an historic win for education advocates: it restored a $700 increase to per student funding, known as the base student allocation, adding $50.6 million in education funding to the state’s budget.  
Yet many Alaska school districts continue to face steep budget deficits, and struggle to address the rising cost of operations, school maintenance, teacher retention and lost of federal funding. The Anchorage School District — the state’s largest district — is grappling with an $80 million shortfall, however the district and the union representing teachers reached a tentative agreement over the weekend on a new three-year contract. There may also be changes on the federal level because the Trump administration has promised to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education.
Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage, and chair of the Senate Education Committee, said it is still unclear whether lawmakers will again take action this year to increase education funding through the base student allocation. Tobin also co-chairs the special task force on education funding created this year. 
“It is difficult to know what the body is willing to do at this point in time,” Tobin said, as lawmakers are in transit back to Juneau this week, and caucuses are meeting to discuss policy priorities. 
But Tobin said she anticipates some kind of funding increase to help districts keep up with inflation. “Inflation continues to be a pressing issue in the state, and we don’t want the gains we made by increasing the basic allocation by $700 this last budget cycle to diminish because of inflation,” she said.
Rep. Andi Story, D-Juneau is co-chair of the House Education Committee and agreed an inflation adjustment is a major priority. “We don’t want to lose any ground,” she said in an interview Friday, pointing out the increase to the BSA only added $20 per student more than the year before.  
Dunleavy told reporters in December he hoped the legislature would pass a bill to launch a pilot program for schools run by Alaska Native tribes, known as tribal compacting, introduced last year. Tobin said the initiative is a priority, and said she supports tribal compacting statewide and wants to see greater tribal consultation and engagement throughout all districts. 
She said increasing funding for school maintenance will also be a major priority, as many rural districts grapple with deteriorating facilities and an estimated $800 million in deferred maintenance. 
Tobin said members of the task force recently made a visit to a school in Fairbanks with one of three boilers working — in subzero temperatures — and a plan to evacuate students if the last one failed. “That’s 726 students that will be displaced. It will be a huge hit to the Fairbanks education community,” she said. “It has the potential to really harm our students’ learning and what we need to do in Juneau, during this 34th legislature, to set us up for a long term solution on rebuilding our schools, is very much at the forefront of my mind.”
Tobin co-chairs the task force on education funding, which was established this spring to conduct an 18-month study and create policy recommendations for how the state funds schools. Members have expressed interest in a wide variety of policy initiatives: from revisiting the school funding formula, to investigating chronic absenteeism, to student performance and accountability measures, and policy changes sought by the governor like open enrollment and reading incentive programs. They are slated to deliver their recommendations at the start of the next legislative session in 2027. 
Tobin said task force members have made visits to schools in Fairbanks, the Matanuska-Susitna, Anchorage and Kenai Peninsula boroughs, and have plans to visit Skagway, Juneau, Bethel and Western Alaska. 
Republican leaders of the Senate and House minority caucuses did not respond to interview requests on their priorities for education. 
Veto override for additional education funding still in question
Lawmakers could also take up another veto override vote within the first five days of the session. Last year, lawmakers passed a corporate tax bill tied to online sales in Alaska that could generate up to $65 million in revenue that would go to fund career and technical education and K-12 reading improvement programs. Dunleavy vetoed it in September. 
Whether lawmakers will take up the override vote next week is unclear. At least 40 of 60 legislators are needed to override the governor’s veto within the first five days of the legislative session. 
In August, lawmakers narrowly overrode the governor’s budget veto of last year’s education funding increase by a vote of 45 to 14.
Tobin and Story, as education committee chairs, said the override vote and restoring additional education dollars is essential, especially for reading, and funding programs instituted by the Alaska Reads Act.  
House Speaker Rep. Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said via text that the Majority caucus is meeting to discuss legislative priorities this weekend. “Protecting education and public safety items in the budget along with other core services will be a priority in an environment that will be fiscally constrained,” he said. 
Edgmon did not confirm whether an override vote would take place, as of Thursday.

The Norwich Personnel and Pension Board is scheduled to consider a request Tuesday from the longtime mayor to participate in a pension plan for city employees and elected officials.
Nystrom finished his last term as mayor in early December 2025. Records reviewed by Connecticut Public show two weeks before stepping down, Nystrom contacted the city’s pension board and asked to buy back eight years of service credit, encompassing the last two of his three terms in office.
If the request is granted, Nystrom would be eligible to immediately begin receiving pension benefits after making a one-time payment into the municipal retirement system, which is funded by contributions from employees and the city.
Nystrom, a 68-year-old former Republican lawmaker, also receives a state pension. He previously represented the community in the Connecticut General Assembly, serving 18 years as a state representative.
Nystrom began receiving monthly pension payments from the state in 2014 after officially retiring from state service, according to records provided by the State Employees Retirement System.
State law doesn’t prevent Nystrom from receiving a second public pension, though it’s unclear whether he is eligible to join the city’s plan.
During a preliminary discussion in November, members of the Norwich pension board expressed confusion about how to handle his request. They questioned whether Nystrom declined offers to participate in the retirement system when he took office in 2017, or at the start of his final term in 2021.
Joining now after twice saying no “would go against everything that I have ever heard” about pension rules, one board member said, according to a recording reviewed by Connecticut Public.
“If that didn’t happen, then that’s a different story,” said the board member, whose identity was unclear from the recording.
“The issue for me is he’ll be old enough to collect immediately,” board member Patrick McMahon said. “So it’s eight years of investment that doesn’t exist. Now, it’s over a $400 million plan, so it’s peanuts. But … if you can’t invest it, you can’t get a return.”
The board voted to table the discussion until Jan. 20. They asked city staff to determine how much Nystrom must contribute to join the retirement system, and whether he received previous opportunities to participate.
Norwich mayor’s role
Nystrom received an annual salary of $45,000 during his time in office, a figure set by the city charter.
Norwich operates under a council/manager form of government. The six members of the council and the mayor are elected at large, and the council appoints a city manager, who serves as the community’s chief administrator.
The mayor nevertheless carries out important functions for the city, including coordinating economic development.
Mayors are eligible for retirement benefits under the charter, which establishes that “The Mayor shall be entitled to the same benefits package as is available to the elected registrars and the City Treasurer.”
However, elected officials aren’t automatically enrolled. The city’s pension rules stipulate those who are eligible can participate “by notifying the board in writing, within 90 days of the date of their election or appointment.”
The chairperson of the Personnel and Pension Board declined to discuss Nystrom’s request in advance of the board’s January meeting. Administrative staff from the city also declined to answer questions about Nystrom’s eligibility.
Nystrom did not respond to emails and a letter seeking comment. He could not be reached by phone.
Decades of public service
A Norwich native, Nystrom has a long record of public service in the community. He first won office to the city council in 1979 at age 22, and served in the House from 1984 to 2002, when he lost a bid for state senate.
Nystrom returned to municipal politics, and served his first term as mayor from 2009 to 2013. After losing to Democrat Deberey Hinchey, he returned to the mayor’s office four years later and won reelection in 2021.
He was barred from competing in the 2025 race by the city charter, which allows a maximum of two consecutive four-year terms. Nystrom now serves on the city council.
Outside of public life, Nystrom worked for more than two decades for the United Parcel Service.
His decision to balance full-time employment with his part-time duties as mayor drew criticism from at least one of his political opponents. During the 2013 race, Hinchey vowed to devote her full attention to serving as mayor, contrasting herself with Nystrom’s dual employment.
But The Day of New London endorsed Nystrom, writing that he proved he was “working full-time for Norwich citizens, or close to it” by attending numerous meetings and functions.
Buyback would be costly
Under one calculation described in the city’s retirement plan documents, Nystrom would stand to earn an annual pension in the range of $7,000 to $8,000, depending on whether his participation start date is determined to be before or after Jan. 1, 2018.
The calculation sets pension payments at between 1.95% and 2.2% of the average of an employee’s three highest earning years, multiplied by years of service.
However, city officials have not described how they would interpret the pension rules.
It’s also unclear whether Nystrom’s request to buy back service credit is permissible. A plan document describes limited scenarios in which buybacks are allowed, including for military service, time spent on worker’s compensation, and probationary periods, when new employees aren’t yet contributing to retirement.
Buying back service credit would require Nystrom to make a significant lump-sum payment, meant to account for eight years of missed contributions, plus compounding interest. During the November meeting, members of the pension board speculated the amount would be in the tens of thousands of dollars, based on multiplying his $45,000 annual salary by an 8% contribution rate, and eight years of service.
Records obtained via a state Freedom of Information Act request show Nystrom receives a separate monthly pension benefit totaling $1,860.29 from the state retirement system.
His state pension stems largely from his service as a legislator. Documents show he earned an average salary of $34,849 during his final three years in the House. Nystrom also worked part-time for Eastern Connecticut State University from 1979 through 1984 during the spring and fall semesters, according to his pension paperwork.

More than a year after the Eaton Fire ripped through Los Angeles County’s Altadena neighborhood, small businesses in the area still face various hurdles as they struggle to recover from a disaster that killed at least 19 people.
As CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay explains, the wildfire destroyed more than 9,000 structures, wiping out about half of Altadena’s businesses. Many small business owners Levi spoke with brought up similar challenges as they try to get back on their feet, such as frustrating delays from insurance companies and limited assistance from federal and state governments.
Some help available to homeowners, for example, is not extended to small business owners. Matt Schodorf, a co-owner of an Altadena coffee shop that burned down, said the Federal Emergency Management Agency initially excluded the store for debris removal. It was only after he took his story to the media and received support from an L.A. County supervisor, Schodorf said, that FEMA included the shop in its debris cleanup.

Schodorf: “It feels frustrating because it feels we are very small potatoes, especially from the perspective of the government. It doesn’t seem like it would be too much to ask: Waive permit fees, clean our lots out. Don’t make us go on national news pleading for help.”

State law also allows homeowners to get some upfront payouts from insurance companies without having to provide a full itemized inventory — a policy that isn’t extended to businesses and could lengthen the claims process.
For some business owners, the obstacles and the fallout from the fire, prove to be too much.

Carrie Meyers, owner of a former Altadena pet store that burned down and won’t be reopened: “People want me back. But I don’t know if we can survive up there. No one lives there … mentally I’m not there.”

$23 billion for CA research?

From CalMatters higher education reporter Mikhail Zinshteyn:
A bipartisan coalition of state lawmakers is backing a bill to place a bond measure before voters in 2026 on whether to approve $23 billion in science research funding.Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, is leading the effort. He presents Senate Bill 895 as a California contingency plan to fund research into vaccines, wildfire prevention and other disciplines at a time when the Trump administration is either attempting to slash already approved research or install rules that halt funding for research that federal agencies used to support before President Donald Trump took office last year. 
When asked if the measure is necessary once Trump is out of office, Wiener said U.S. political instability may mean more federal science cuts even after Trump. 

Wiener, to CalMatters during a press call Friday: “It’s important for California just to be like a rock in the storm, so that we’re just doing science here and investing in science … regardless of what’s happening with the federal government at that moment in time.”

Any drugs created with this state money would be discounted for Californians, according to the legislation. The funding would flow to California’s public universities and other research entities. The union of graduate student workers is also backing the bond.



New rules for CA homelessness funds

Gov. Gavin Newsom is turning up the pressure on California cities and counties to do more to curb homeless encampments by adding new strings to homelessness funds, write Marisa Kendall and Ben Christopher.
In Mendocino County, for example, the state appears to be holding funds hostage — which were already approved in the 2024-25 budget and have recently become available — until the county can explain its plans to pass an encampment ordinance to the state, according to the senior program manager with the county’s Department of Social Services. But the new rule puts the social services department in a bind, since it doesn’t have the authority to weigh in on enforcement. 
Newsom, the Legislature, local officials and other stakeholders are also likely to continue hashing out the conditions for the $500 million in homelessness funding proposed in this year’s budget, which must be passed by late June.
This call for local governments to step up isn’t sitting well with some advocates. 

Carolyn Coleman, executive director and CEO of the League of California Cities: “I worry that, one, we may leave more cities out. And, two, that we may cause delays in the ability to get more people housed sooner, which I think is the goal.”

Its methane gas leak in 2015-16 displaced 10,000 families and caused illness.","Guest Commentary written by

Madison Kerbeck
Madison Kerbeck is a graduate student at Columbia University


This is the 10-year anniversary of the largest methane gas leak in United States history. Over  four months in 2015 and 2016, the Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility in Los Angeles County — the largest gas storage site in California — released more than 100,000 tons of methane, drowning nearby communities in toxic fumes. 
The leak caused pounding headaches, uncontrollable nausea and bloody noses, and displaced  10,000 families. Some health effects were more detrimental, including memory loss, slurred speech and impaired vision. UCLA researchers also found the gas leak led to full-term newborns being born underweight, some weighing 5 and a half pounds or less. 
I was 14, living four miles from the facility. I can still remember the smell. Two of my good friends suffered horrible headaches and were displaced. They lived in a house provided to them for a couple of months.
After the incident, the facility shut down in 2016 only to be reopened in 2017. Was reopening the facility safe, or couldn’t Southern California Gas Co. bear the financial loss any longer? 
After the gas leak, revenue for SoCalGas’ parent company, Sempra Energy, dropped by 8.9%, to $2.16 billion. The most state Senator Henry Stern was able to secure from SoCalGas was a $71 million settlement, which represents just 5% of Sempra’s 2016 profit. 
The settlement will benefit the 1.8 million residents of neighboring communities where traces of methane were found. It is being invested in green infrastructure for homes and schools, with the goal of reducing natural gas use. 
So why, then, do we need to keep this site open? 
While working as Stern’s legislative intern in 2024 and attending a press conference in front of the SoCalGas headquarters that December, I saw firsthand that residents in the affected communities do not consider this a win. Members of the public want the facility to remain closed.

Residents still received power the year Aliso was shut down, proving the facility is not essential to the community and, more importantly, not worth the risk. 
State officials claimed the facility can only be shut down once natural gas demand decreases, but California has already proven how quickly we can move away from fossil fuels. 
The 2018 California Clean Energy Act proposed to increase zero-carbon energy sources by 60% over 12 years. The goals were met in just three years. With the right municipal mandates, the San Fernando Valley can reduce gas usage while meeting its energy demands. By increasing renewable energy and setting reduction requirements, we will not have to depend on Aliso Canyon. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom promised during his first term to close the facility. A coalition of scientists, including PhDs from top universities, wrote a joint letter supporting the closure.
However, in December 2024, Newsom ignored this advice and broke the trust the community placed in him. He supported state officials’ decision to not only keep the facility open but to expand it.
The need for a shutdown is dire because the storage facility sits directly above the Santa Susana fault line.
The facility failed during the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.7. Currently, the surrounding area of Aliso Canyon has a 78% chance of experiencing a major earthquake over the next 50 years. Reopening and expanding a massive gas facility above a fault line is not just irresponsible, it’s reckless. 
The public has protested. Lawmakers have pleaded. Scientists have spoken. And yet, 10 years later, Aliso Canyon still stands. 
How long do we wait? Until the next blowout? Until another earthquake? We cannot afford to wait any longer — not when lives are at stake. 
It’s time to shut it down.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110521-Aliso-Canyon-Gas-Plant-AP-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-20 08:57:01.151972

Michelle Lujan Grisham signed an executive order that bans CYFD from housing youth in its offices. The ban goes into effect March, 2026. ((Dean Hanson/Albuquerque Journal)Starting March 1, the New Mexico Children, Youth & Families Department can no longer house youth in its custody in government office buildings while awaiting foster placement, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office announced on Monday.
The ban comes via an executive order and follows years of concerns and incidents regarding the practice.
“Children who have experienced trauma deserve safety, stability and dignity — not sleeping in offices,” the governor said in a statement. “This executive order makes clear that New Mexico will not accept anything less than appropriate care for children in our custody.”
According to a news release, as of Friday CYFD had stopped new office, is in the process of “relocating remaining youth into appropriate placements.” The practice of using office space began, the news release said, “when agencies couldn’t place sibling groups together, when treatment facilities discharged them without available placements, or when older youth refused other options.”
“This executive order reflects the standard our children deserve and the responsibility we carry as a department,” CYFD Acting Secretary Valerie Sandoval said in a statement. “We have taken decisive steps to stop office stays, and we will continue working with providers, caregivers, and partners across state government to ensure every child in our care has a safe and appropriate place to stay.”
The order comes as the state begins to stand up a new Office of Advocacy at CYFD, established during the 2025 legislative session via House Bill 5. It also comes ahead of an expected push for additional reforms in the legislative session starting Tuesday.
One of those reforms comes from State Rep. Rebecca Dow (R-Truth or Consequences): a pilot program to address the lack of adequate and appropriate foster placements.
In a news release Monday, Dow noted that “an executive order alone doesn’t create placements for kids who have nowhere else to go.” Her bill, she said, “is about putting children first by stabilizing placements, supporting foster families, and using proven, evidence-based care to make sure no child is ever forced to sleep in a government office again.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CYFD-1024x522.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 08:57:01.151972

Leah Hansen. (Photos courtesy of the Utah Senate and House)After three lawmakers quit their legislative roles to take other state leadership appointments, local office, or to open up unprecedented third-party elections, three newcomers will be casting their first votes in a general legislative session starting Tuesday.
Forward Party of Utah Sen. Emily Buss of Eagle Mountain is kicking off her public office career in the Utah Senate this year. She was chosen in an open, nonpartisan selection vote in her district to replace former longtime West Valley City Sen. Daniel Thatcher, who switched parties and then stepped down last year, opening up a spot for a new third-party lawmaker.
Rep. John Arthur, a Holladay Democrat, is replacing former Rep. Gay Lynn Bennion after she switched her state capitol seat for Cottonwood Heights’ Mayor’s Office. 
After former House Majority Leader Rep. Jefferson Moss was tapped to lead the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity, District 51 Republicans elected Rep. Leah Hansen of Saratoga Springs last summer.

All will serve until the end of the year, unless they are reelected in November.
Buss, Arthur and Hansen spoke to Utah News Dispatch about their legislative ambitions as they prepared for the 45-day general session. 
A lawmaker with no caucus
When Emily Buss starts her first legislative session as state senator, she won’t have a caucus to convene with. She, like her predecessor, will be the only Forward party voice in the Capitol, and she’s already feeling the pressure, she said. 
“I kind of feel like I’m a political experiment for everybody involved,” Buss said.
The Forward Party of Utah came together when the state’s two centrist groups merged last year. It is an affiliate of the national Forward Party.
While many at the Capitol are helping her to get up to speed, Buss expects to be out of the loop on some issues.
“I hope that I can be an example of what politics can look like, and we’re just trying to solve the bipartisan issues,” she said, “and what you can achieve when your hands aren’t tied by party leadership.”
Buss, the 35-year-old founder of the Birthday Box Foundation, is now one of the youngest lawmakers this session. She hopes “to bring the resourceful millennial working-class mindset,” she said.
This year she’s working on a bill that would create a database for bill summaries described in plain language and with details on the financial impact they may have on county, city and personal taxes. 
She’s also trying to find solutions for areas experiencing rapid growth, like the one where she lives. A goal for Buss, for example, is to find a way to create a grant for high-growth school districts.
“The area I’m from is exploding at the seams, and rather than putting all of that property tax burden onto the taxpayers, (the idea is) creating a fund that high-growth districts can qualify for to help secure land and capital improvements, like starting to build schools before they’re already bursting at the seams,” she said.
Buss’ district also encompasses other areas, like much of Tooele, and parts of West Valley City, Magna, Kearns and other municipalities west of Interstate 15. She plans on meeting with all of the mayors, city council members and city managers in the district to learn about their top concerns, she said. However, she has already defined a big priority for the area.
“I’m going to be a huge advocate on transportation and just infrastructure and connectivity in general for the west side and all of the communities that are growing,” Buss said.
While she may be considered “a wild card in the political sphere,” she said, don’t expect major drama from her time in the Legislature. 
“No one knows what to expect from me, and I hope they’ll be pleasantly surprised that I’m just a nice, easy-to-get-along-with person who doesn’t care about the drama,” Buss said. “I’m just here to help the most people while I can make the biggest impact while I’m here. I don’t have ambitions of being a politician for my whole life.”
A Utah ‘teacher of the year’
The week before the start of the session, John Arthur was still “cranking out sub plans,” he said on Wednesday. Finding a long-term substitute for the full 45 days the Legislature is in session was a big concern for him as a teacher at a Title I school elementary school in Salt Lake City.
However, his job was also what inspired his political career, he said. Seeing how public education governance impacted his work, especially after receiving the 2021 Utah Teacher of the Year recognition, made him want to push for different standards and considerations as policy is being written. 
While Arthur’s young years were spent on different army bases following his father, a U.S. Army airborne ranger, he grew up in Cottonwood Heights, where his family settled. 
“Now, all these years later, I moved my wife and two little girls to nearby, in Holladay, but basically the same area and same community,” he said. “And now I am the representative in the statehouse for the same middle school and high school and friends and neighbors I grew up with.”
Arthur has filed his first bill, which aims to “deliver on the promises that we’ve made to educators,” he said, by ensuring teachers keep the raises they received when the Utah Fits All Scholarship passed, regardless of the program’s fate after a district court ruled it to be unconstitutional.
“If that program fails, then that raise for educators will also go away, and every teacher in the state of Utah will lose that money,” Arthur said. “And so my bill is an attempt to make sure that that is not a threat that we have to worry about.”
 Another issue he’s hoping to pursue is the “amount of polarization and conflict” experienced in the Utah State Board of Education, an issue that has been ramping up since a 2016 law made the institution a partisan office.
“State school board races forever were nonpartisan, until that law passed,” he said. “And now we’re in a situation where our state school board is often in the news for not great things, because we are electing partisan school board members where we should really be focusing on (their) expertise and excellence in education.”
While that’s a big part of his platform, Arthur is also planning to push on natural resources and climate policy, he said. 
Still, he acknowledges that entering the Legislature as a Democratic freshman may be rocky.
“I am not naive. I know that I am the newest kid in the minority caucus,” he said. “But I also believe my whole life that if you come to people with dignity and care, and you humanize them, and you let them know that you’re not coming with ulterior motives, you are coming to do good work that most people will meet you in that work.”
‘An ordinary citizen’
Leah Hansen has gradually learned all the ins and outs of citizen participation in the legislative process since she started attending committee and floor meetings 10 years ago.
“I learned all these things through trial and error, and it’s just become something that I don’t want to say I enjoy doing, but something that I feel I’ve needed to do,” Hansen said, “and I see so few of the ordinary citizens up there.”
Hansen said she’s first and foremost a wife and a mother. With her children grown she has been volunteering to manage a Saratoga Springs community social media account, and now, she’s preparing for a more active role, representing them in the Legislature. 
However, the new Republican lawmaker isn’t aiming to file tons of legislative proposals.
As state leaders complain that lawmakers continue breaking the record number of bills introduced during the general session, Hansen’s approach is to start light this year.
“I don’t have any bills at this time because I believe that restraint begins with me. If I’m wanting to limit government, I’d better start by limiting myself,” she said. “But more so because there were so many bills that there were just so many to stay on top of, that I didn’t want to put any more burden on us than we need to be having at the moment.”
She’s looking at some issues, she said. But she hasn’t agreed to running any bills yet.
“I want to make sure that they are actually necessary and proper for the government to be doing,” she said. 
Hansen was born in Hawaii to students from Tonga and New Zealand attending Brigham Young University-Hawaii. She lived in Tonga until she turned 12 years old, when her family moved to Utah and hasn’t left since.
Now, as a legislator, she says she wants to keep a connection to her Saratoga Springs community and have individual, “ordinary citizens,” like her, join lawmakers at the Capitol to see for themselves how laws take shape.
But also, she’s aiming to advocate for freedom and the proper role of government, she said. 
Hansen hopes for better things for the country and the state, and she believes a lot of that can happen when leaders evaluate which direction the state is taking.
“Are we heading toward freedom, or is it something else that’s unrecognizable?” she said. “There are so many laws. I personally think that there are a lot of unnecessary laws that don’t need to be there.”
When asked about her thoughts on the role of government, she said, it should “stay in its lane, allow the people to live their lives.”
“I think government needs to mind their own business and just do the things that they’re supposed to do, which is to protect and secure the rights of the people, period,” she said.

But nothing has so defined and marked Nevada – physical, culturally and eternally – like the development and testing of nuclear weapons […]","Operation Buster-Jangle - Dog test — with troops participating in exercise Desert Rock I. It was the first U.S. nuclear field exercise conducted on land; troops shown are a mere 6 miles from the blast at the Nevada test site in 1951. (Public domain)There are many things that have defined Nevada over time: the Kit Carson trail, the legalization of gaming and loosening of divorce laws, the construction of the Hoover Dam to name a few. But nothing has so defined and marked Nevada – physical, culturally and eternally – like the development and testing of nuclear weapons here. 
Nevada’s deserts played a pivotal role in America’s rise as a nuclear superpower. The Nevada Test Site (now the Nevada National Security Site) hosted over 900 nuclear weapons tests between the 1950s and 1990s. But relentless Cold War testing came at a tremendous cost. Many Nevadans and other Americans in “downwinder” communities were exposed to radioactive fallout and later developed serious illnesses like cancer. 
These diagnoses continue to this day; a reminder for us all that the price of our security is still being paid.
In 1990, Congress created the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) to provide financial compensation to individuals harmed by radiation exposure from U.S. nuclear tests and uranium mining. Since then, the program has helped over 39,000 Americans suffering from radiation-linked cancers and illnesses to find treatment and care, saving many lives.
RECA was set to expire in June 2024, just as many Cold War veterans are entering their golden years and facing compounding illnesses. But our Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen recognized this immorality and fought to extend RECA, introducing standalone legislation and lobbying their Republican colleagues on its importance, including working with Nevada’s only Republican in Congress, Rep. Mark Amodei. Because of this bipartisan work, the Republican-controlled Senate extended RECA this year and raised the maximum payout to $100,000 per claim.
Unfortunately, the extension of RECA only partially solved this problem because even RECA’s revival leaves some Nevadans behind. 
When Congress passed RECA, the law specifically excluded servicemen and women who worked on classified projects and settings at Nevada’s sites, even though many suffered the same deadly illnesses and cancers as civilian downwinders. 
That’s why Nevada Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen introduced the “Fighting for the Overlooked Recognition of Groups Operating in Toxic Test Environments in Nevada Act,” or the FORGOTTEN Veterans Act, which would ensure no veteran of the Cold War is excluded from coverage and left behind.
The bill would officially classify the Nevada Test and Training Range as a “contaminated” location and require DoD to document all toxic exposures in each service member’s confidential records. When those individuals seek medical care at the VA, there will be proof in their file of where they served and what hazards they faced, without revealing any sensitive mission details publicly. The proposal will verify all service at the sites since 1951, and provide medical coverage for radiation-related illnesses, fully closing the loophole for Nevada’s veterans.
As Sen. Cortez Masto herself said when introducing the FORGOTTEN Veterans Act, “as a nation, it is our obligation to take care of all veterans once their service has ended.” 
The Forgotten Veterans Act was very nearly enacted into law in December 2025. With the leadership of Senator Rosen and Senator Cortez Masto, the bill garnered bipartisan support and was added to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for final passage. Unfortunately, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson deleted the proposal from the NDAA before the final vote despite widespread support in both parties and in both chambers of Congress. This incredibly immoral act by Speaker Johnson requires us to double down with public advocacy on the need to pass this legislation.
Nevada has learned the hard way that the fallout of nuclear testing isn’t just a cloud in the sky, it’s a generations-long burden on real people. And our nation shouldn’t turn a blind eye to the burden that civilians and veterans are still shouldering. 
Thanks to the advocacy of Sens Cortez Masto and Rosen, Nevadans are finally having their voice heard on an issue so long ignored. But, while we are on the verge of securing the medical treatments and financial support that has long been denied for decades, the forces that have tried to sweep this under the rug are still at work. It’s on all of us to keep this in the light and keep up the fight until we deliver on the promise the nation made to these Nevadans.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Exercise_Desert_Rock_I_Buster-Jangle_Dog_002.jpg,,,2026-01-20 08:57:01.151972

“This makes the tax system more fair for rural Alabama,” Albritton said in an interview on Tuesday. “It allows the destination monies, the taxes that are paid on transactions, to be carried forward to the destination.”
A third Albritton bill, SB 150, reallocates a $10 fee that municipal courts collect to pay for operations to the state General Fund.
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit criticized Albritton’s proposals last week.
“Senator Albritton’s two bills would defund police departments, bankrupt school systems and freeze economic development in every municipality in Alabama,” a spokesperson for the city of Tuscaloosa said in a statement on Wednesday. “Senator Albritton publicly threatened retribution and appears to be delivering with this proposed legislation. For nearly a decade, multiple cities have engaged the Alabama Department of Revenue and the Legislature to fix the legal issues with Simplified Sellers Use Tax.”
The SSUT has been a stabilizing revenue stream for the General Fund, which for years struggled with rising program costs and flat revenue growth. The Education Trust Fund, a separate budget that pays for public education, gets nearly all of the state’s income and sales tax revenues, and most General Fund revenues prior to the SSUT tended to show flat annual growth.
‘I am going to take their money’
The lawsuit, filed against the Alabama Department of Revenue in August, seeks to remove several companies from the SSUT program, which allocates a greater amount directly to local municipalities and their respective school districts than the traditional sales tax.
The lawsuit alleges that the Simplified Sellers Use Tax is unconstitutional and that the Alabama Department of Revenue, the state agency responsible for administering it, is allowing companies to take part in the program that allows them to collect a reduced sales tax rate of 8%, compared to some municipalities with that levy a higher percentage through a traditional sales tax.
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the cities of Tuscaloosa, Mountain Brook and Montgomery and the Alabama Education Association, which represents K-12 teachers in the state.
Albritton has been an outspoken critic of the lawsuit, which he sees as a threat to a critical revenue source for the General Fund. The senator, a member of the Contract Review Committee, twice delayed state agency contracts in protest of the lawsuit. He said that taxes are within the purview of the Alabama Legislature and not within the jurisdiction of the judicial branch of government.
“They are trying to steal my money, so I am going to take their money,” Albritton said on Tuesday.
The plaintiffs want a state court to disqualify several larger retailers with a significant presence in the state because SSUT was originally meant to apply sales taxes to transactions from Alabama residents who make purchases online from retailers that are not based in the state, which would not be possible using the Internet.
The city of Tuscaloosa alleges in the lawsuit that SSUT is creating a shortfall in revenues of about $14.6 million.
Alabama is allocated a portion of the sales taxes collected from brick-and-mortar stores, but the money is directed toward the Educational Trust Fund budget. That is not the case with taxes gained from online sales, which is given to the General Fund budget. Disqualifying retailers from SSUT would redirect the sales tax revenues from the General Fund budget to the ETF.
The Association of County Commissions of Alabama (ACCA) opposes the lawsuit and has said it could cut critical revenue for counties, which have little to no power to levy their own taxes.
“The position that they are taking on SSUT is not consistent with the position they take on sales tax,” said Sonny Brasfield, executive director of the ACCA, in an interview on Friday. “In SSUT, their position is if products are sold and wind up in the city limits of Tuscaloosa, then Tuscaloosa should get all the money.”
That is different from sales tax.
“When people drive to Tuscaloosa to shop and make purchases and drive back home to use those products, if we are being consistent in our arguments, then we should let that tax money follow the product back where the product is used,” Brasfield said. “That is the core of their argument in the lawsuit.”
Greg Cochran, the executive director of the Alabama League of Municipalities, an organization that represents cities, said in an interview Wednesday that the group plans to meet with Albritton “and talk to him about the complexity of trying to exempt nonresidents from paying those local taxes, sales taxes and lodging taxes that come into a municipality, and the chaos that it could create when you have places like Jefferson County and Shelby County that have over 60 municipalities.”
“It would create shopping venues for residents from outside of your district getting incentivized to go next door and shop,” he said.
Graham Smith, the mayor of Mountain Brook, a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said in a statement that plaintiffs were looking for “a modern, thoughtful solution” to the issue.“Over 20 states have already implemented a more robust and fair way of approaching SSUT,” the statement said.  “We welcome any and all discussion with our State Representatives.”
Richard Rush, who leads the government relations, external affairs, and crisis communications efforts for the city of Tuscaloosa said that the arguments in the lawsuit are valid.
“The claim that his proposed legislation is in any way comparable to our solutions is preposterous,” Rush said in a statement on Wednesday. “Frankly, it is apples to oranges. Beyond the impossible implementation of his proposed legislation, taking Senator Albritton at face value, when he travels I-65 like hundreds of thousands of others to Montgomery and stops at Bates House of Turkey, he would not pay any sales taxes to the City of Greenville. Greenville’s schools, police, fire and essential services would suffer.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Albritton-April-3-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-20 08:57:01.151972

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement steps up the use of digital surveillance to track immigrants and citizens alike, Minnesotans can use a new, little-known law to push back.
The Minnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act — signed into law in 2024 — gives Minnesota residents the right to tell companies “no” when it comes to selling their data or using it for profiling and targeted advertising. The problem is that even with the help of the legislation, the data market has become too vast and opaque for the average person to rein in their information.
Still, this power became newly relevant when ICE bought access in September to a social media and phone surveillance system that allows them to monitor city blocks and neighborhoods — and track the movements of people’s smart phones, watches and other devices, 404 Media reported last week.
ICE obtained the technology from the Nebraska-based contractor Penlink, which uses commercial and publicly available location data acquired from hundreds of millions of phones. ICE can access the data without a warrant, 404 Media reported.
ICE didn’t respond to the Reformer’s request for comment about whether it was using surveillance systems to track people in Minnesota in its latest immigration surge.
Minnesota has been the focus of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts since December, with tensions escalating last week when ICE agent Johnathan Ross fatally shot Renee Good in her car in south Minneapolis.
John Boehler, a policy counsel with ACLU Minnesota, said that the organization is aware of ICE using facial recognition software and license plate readers in Minnesota. Federal agents have reportedly for years been using surveillance mechanisms to track people.
To use the new Minnesota data privacy law, people need to reach out to companies, such as data brokers, to request that their information be deleted and not sold to a third party. This is difficult for people who are unfamiliar with the expansive and elusive web of data brokerages that gather and profit off of millions of peoples’ data every day — including those with ICE contracts.
People often do not know when their data is being collected, used and sold for profit; the Minnesota law was designed to give people more agency in how their information is used.
The Minnesota law is unlikely to completely delete a person’s personal data from all sources, but it provides an avenue to ensure at least one company doesn’t use their information.
The law defines personal data as any information that is linked to an identifiable person. It does not cover publicly available information.
Data brokers and surveillance companies often gather cell phone location data from software development kits, which are bundles of code used by developers to make applications, like weather apps. The software development kit owners then pay app developers for user location data.
Real-time bidding is also a source of location data, according to 404 Media. Companies in online advertising place bids to get their advertisements in front of certain demographics. But many popular apps, like Candy Crush and prayer and dating apps, are likely being co-opted to harvest location data, Wired reported.
In short, there are many ways data brokers and companies can acquire a person’s location data and personal information. At least one of these companies, Penlink, has contracted with ICE, so it’s possible ICE is using geolocation data to track people’s location.
Penlink didn’t respond to the Reformer’s request for comment about whether their surveillance systems were being used by ICE to track Minnesotans.
Data privacy advocates are alleging that federal agents are using private data to intimidate observers and activists during “Operation Metro Surge,” MPR News earlier this week reported.
“Data is being weaponized,” Boehler said. “It’s being weaponized by a hostile federal government, and that was always the intended use for all that data collection.”
How do I use the Minnesota law to keep my data private?
Minnesota residents will need to reach out to individual companies. They can ask to obtain a list of third parties to whom their data was sold; tell a business “no” to selling their data; obtain a copy of what sensitive information a company has about them; and demand that a company delete the personal information it has about them.
The company must respond to their request within 45 days, and they could face a $7,500 fine per violation of the Minnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act. The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office is responsible for enforcing the law, and people can use AG forms to send to companies.
The most all-encompassing measure a person can take is to download a “universal opt out mechanism” onto their internet browser. This allows your browser to send a signal that tells websites you visit that you don’t want your data sold.
Most data brokers are subject to Minnesota’s law, but the state doesn’t have a list of brokers that operate in Minnesota. California, however, keeps a list of data brokers that operate there. A person could start with that list, as many of those brokers also do business in Minnesota.
Businesses that control or process the personal data of 100,000 Minnesota consumers or more are subject to the Minnesota law. In addition, companies that process personal data of 25,000 Minnesotans and derive over 25% of their gross revenues from the sale of the data are also subject to the law.
The process is wonky, and Minnesota lawmakers, who convene for the 2026 session next month, would need to act if they wanted to make it easier for everyday Minnesotans to utilize this law.
The Attorney General has a Q&A and forms on its site that you can use as templates for requests to companies.

(Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)Nevada is looking for ways to break away from a decades-long dependence on California fuel as the Golden State experiences refinery closures — including the back-to-back closures of two major oil refineries.
In October, Phillips 66 produced its final barrel of fuel at its Los Angeles facility, citing regulatory pressure, rising costs, and declining gasoline demand in California. Valero Energy also announced plans to close its oil refinery near San Francisco by April, citing similar reasons.
Together, the two facilities represent about 17% of California’s capacity to refine crude oil into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other petroleum products. 
Nevada — which imports about 86% of its transportation fuels from California — will likely feel the impacts of those closures, including price hikes at the pump, say industry experts.
Nevada’s Fuel Resiliency Committee, which had its first meeting last week, was proposed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo to help address the state’s current and emerging fuel challenges. And there are many.
For one, Nevada doesn’t have any significant crude oil reserves. In 2024, the state only produced about 170,000 barrels — a literal drop in the barrel compared to U.S. production of nearly 14 million barrels per day.
Nevada also has only one crude oil refinery located in Nye County, which is limited to producing asphalt for roads. Additionally, Nevada doesn’t have the capacity to store large quantities of fuel in cases of emergency like California does.
As a result, Nevada relies almost entirely on imported transportation fuels from California, leaving the state vulnerable to supply disruptions from the neighboring state.
Nevada isn’t alone. California refineries supply more than one-third of transportation fuel in the neighboring state of Arizona, which also doesn’t have significant oil reserves or a single crude oil refinery.
In general, California and the West Coast is geographically isolated from other refining centers, notably the Gulf Coast where 55% of U.S. refining capacity is located, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That makes it difficult for Nevada to draw supply from other regions.
Miranda Hoover, the state executive for the Energy and Convenience Association of Nevada, said it’s clear Nevada will need to diversify its fuel supply sources to build resiliency. Hoover said she has been working with Lombardo on fuel affordability for the past four years and is now serving as a non-voting member for the Nevada Fuel Resiliency Committee.
“We’ve done a lot of research on if it would even be possible or plausible for Nevada to have its own refinery. Unfortunately, the simple answer is no,” said Hoover, whose trade association represents fuel distributors, transporters, and gas stations. “Nevada doesn’t have any of the right crude oil that could even be put into the refinery.”
The subcommittee will be tasked with conducting assessments of Nevada’s current and projected fuel supply, exploring options to expand infrastructure, assessing the state’s vulnerabilities, and strengthening emergency responses. The committee expects to submit its recommended policies in September. Part of those recommendations will likely include plans to expand permitting and addressing barriers to infrastructure projects, said Hoover.
One major solution that is being pushed on the committee is more pipelines. 
Nevada relies on three major pipelines: Kinder Morgan’s CALNEV pipeline which supplies 90% of Southern Nevada’s fuel, H.F. Sinclair’s UNEV Pipeline which pipes about 15% of Nevada’s total fuel from Utah, and Kinder Morgan’s SFPP North Line from California which fuels the Reno area.
Representatives for several fuel companies with tentative plans to expand pipelines into Nevada, including H.F. Sinclair and Phillips 66, serve as non voting members on the Fuel Resiliency Committee.
In October, HF Sinclair announced that it was evaluating an expansion of its UNEV Pipeline from Utah that could increase capacity into Las Vegas by about 35,000 barrels a day by moving more fuel from the Rockies into Nevada. That plan would also include a new lateral line from Utah to Reno — which has a single pipeline for its gasoline and diesel supply.
That same month, Phillips 66 and Kinder Morgan announced they were accepting shipper commitments for their Western Gateway Pipeline, a 1,300 mile pipeline from Texas that would supply gasoline to California, Arizona and Nevada. If built, the pipeline would be the first to pipe refined fuels to California from outside the state.
During the committee’s first meeting, Hoover said several fuel companies gave updates about potential infrastructure projects that could expand Nevada’s supply of refined fuels.
“To truly be resilient, we must diversify. That means we can’t have just one new pipeline coming into Las Vegas. It’s probably going to be two and or three multiple projects or infrastructure improvements that are going to really create not only short term solutions, but also long term solutions,” Hoover said.
Brett Compston, administrator of the Nevada Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security and chair of the committee, highlighted that the committee was created under the Nevada Department of Homeland Security because the state’s reliance on California fuel is impacting the state’s military bases.
“Right now, one of the things I worry about or we worry about for the emergency management and the homeland security side is disruption to critical infrastructure, in this case, fuel,” said Compston, during the committee hearing last week.
In 2023, Gov. Joe Lombardo declared a state of emergency when Kinder Morgan’s CALNEV pipeline, which serves Nellis and Edwards Air Force bases and McCarran International Airport, was temporarily shut down because of a California wildfire.
Earlier this year, wildfires in California also caused widespread power outages, shutting down two pipelines that send fuel to Nevada and Arizona.
The infrastructure plans to expand pipelines into Nevada would likely take years, if constructed at all. HF Sinclair’s UNEV Pipeline expansion wouldn’t be complete until 2028, while Phillips 66 and Kinder Morgan’s Western Gateway Pipeline would be completed in 2029.
Gaps in fuel resiliency, and the years it could take to address them, is especially concerning for rural and northern Nevada, said state Sen. Robin Titus, who serves as a voting member on the committee. 
“I think we raised more questions than we had answers the other day,” Titus said of the first committee meeting.
Last year, Titus sponsored Senate Bill 505 to establish an Energy Independence Task Force to explore alternatives to relying on California fuel, but the bill never got a hearing.
Titus said she hopes the Fuel Resiliency Committee can explore more immediate solutions, including expanding storage capacity in the state to mitigate moments of fuel volatility. In the long-term, Nevada will need to move away from depending almost entirely on California fuel, Titus said.
“What they do in California impacts us here. Many of us in rural areas can’t get across the state in an electric car. There’s no public transportation or anything out here, so we’re reliant on our cars to get places. Our needs are different, and so we want to make sure that we aren’t dependent on what happens in California,” Titus said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasmo-1024x723.jpg,,,2026-01-20 08:57:01.151972

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana represents the heartland of America. It’s a place where community ties run deep, where neighbors look out for each other, and where common sense and hard work define the character of its people. That’s why, with Indiana’s 2026 legislative session underway, Defend Forgotten America commissioned a poll of Hoosiers.
As a nonpartisan organization committed to elevating the voices of heartland communities too often overlooked in national debates, we wanted to understand what Hoosiers truly need and what they’re asking their leaders to prioritize.
The statewide poll, conducted in early December by the respected national pollster Public Opinion Strategies, reveals a clear message to lawmakers as they kick off the second part of the session. Hoosiers, regardless of party affiliation, are unified around the urgent need to increase investment in health care access and protect local hospitals.
Nearly three-quarters of all voters — 73% — agree that the Indiana state government should do more to protect hospitals in local communities, with 45% strongly agreeing. This sentiment crosses party lines, with more than two-thirds of both Republicans and Democrats supporting greater hospital protections.
Indiana unveils multi-year rural health plan in newly released federal application

Unsurprisingly, they are greatly concerned about proposed cuts to Indiana’s Medicaid program. Nearly half of Hoosiers have heard about plans to cut over $1 billion annually from the state’s Medicaid program, and the response is striking: 71% oppose these cuts, including 57% who strongly oppose them. Majorities of Republicans, independents, and Democrats alike oppose the proposed reductions, as do nearly two-thirds of rural Hoosiers.
Hoosiers worry about rural residents losing health care access, local hospitals eliminating critical services, emergency room overcrowding, and rural women losing access to OBGYNs. Between 86% and 90% of voters express concern about each of these potential impacts, with roughly 40% very concerned about each.
These fears reflect real challenges already facing Indiana’s health care landscape. Fully 91% of Hoosiers say helping residents manage chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease is important to improving public health, with 76% calling it very important. This becomes out of reach for many communities as rural health collapses. Four rural hospitals have closed in recent years, and more are at risk of closure.
This is not just a problem in Indiana as a similar crisis in rural health care has unfolded across the country. In small towns across rural America, families worry that their local hospital might not be there tomorrow. Clinics are shutting down, women travel hours for prenatal checkups, and emergency rooms are stretched to capacity.
The poll also reveals other pressing concerns on Hoosiers’ minds. Groceries and everyday essentials are putting the most pressure on household budgets. On education, only 25% rate Indiana’s public schools as excellent or good, with residents most focused on strengthening college and career readiness and improving teacher pay. And on infrastructure, deteriorating local roads emerge as the biggest concern, with 35% identifying this as their top problem.
Though most Hoosiers believe the state is on the wrong track, our poll offers a path for leaders to bring back a sense of optimism to the state. By prioritizing the concerns that unite their constituents and turning their priorities into action, the 2026 legislative session offers an opportunity for Indiana to take bold action that forgotten communities are demanding across the country.

Many immigrants, including U.S. citizens, are afraid to go out. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesotans, especially Somali Minnesotans like me, are feeling besieged. Our adopted home state has become a destination for right-wing tourists, who are now harassing Somali social service providers responsible for looking after the most vulnerable in our community.
Right-wing influencers from Washington state to Maine are knocking on child care center doors operated by Somali Americans, asking to see the children. This comes after Nick Shirley, a MAGA influencer and YouTuber, posted a 42-minute video on X on December 26, accusing Somali child care centers in the Twin Cities of committing more than $100 million in fraud after visiting 10 centers in a single day. That video has been viewed 140 million times, and has been shared by Elon Musk and Vice President J.D. Vance. 
As someone who has worked as a fraud investigator in the Medicaid Fraud Division of the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, I can tell you Shirley doesn’t know the first thing about this type of fraud or how to investigate it. 
Fraud occurs when the provider bills the state for services they never provided. This is why investigators submit requests for claims data weeks after conducting surveillance. In Minnesota, child care fraud is investigated by special agents from the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Fraud in adult daycare and other programs funded by Medicaid are investigated by the Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Division.
Investigators must review and document hundreds of hours of surveillance footage from pole cameras to prove how many recipients received services at a particular facility and compare that data to claims submitted by the provider to find overbilling. They then have to interview numerous recipients to find which recipients didn’t receive services.
Generally, law enforcement is conducting their investigation while the fraud is ongoing, and must not arouse suspicion for fear pertinent records may be destroyed. Prosecutors can only charge what they can prove, which is often a small portion of the overall fraud scheme. 
Investigators cannot credibly state in open court that all proceeds received by a provider were fraudulently obtained because they observed no services being rendered the day they conducted surveillance, which is how Shirley tabulated the amount of fraud he claims he uncovered. 
On January 14, Shirley posted another video to social media claiming to have unearthed even more fraud. This time, he visited non-emergency medical transportation businesses operated by Somali Americans in the Twin Cities and claimed to have discovered $16 million in fraud because he could not locate several of the companies, concluding that they must be operating fraudulently.
If Shirley was serious about locating those providers, he could have contacted the Department of Human Services to find the correct addresses. Shirely relied on the Secretary of State’s website, which from my experience is not always accurate because businesses fail to update their contact information.
Transportation fraud is difficult to uncover and is not as easy to detect as Shirley would have you believe. He surmises that non-medical transportation companies without vehicles in their parking lot must be committing fraud. From my experience, these companies hire employees who use their personal vehicles to provide rides to medical appointments. So it would not be a surprise that they would not be sitting at the company’s parking lot. He also insinuates that because some of the vehicles at the transportation company’s parking lot have not been moved for some time, they must be committing fraud. Again, the fraud would occur when the company bills for services that are not rendered. 
During my time working as a fraud investigator at the Attorney General’s Office, my colleagues and I investigated provider, interpreter and transportation fraud in a case known as PIT Stop. Non-emergency medical transportation drivers and interpreters from the Somali community colluded with health providers, who were in need of clients for their struggling businesses. In this scheme, hundreds of Somali Americans recipients from the Faribault area had their identities fraudulently used by drivers, interpreters and health providers. 
Granted, the standard of journalistic evidence is different from the standard of legal evidence, but the principle is the same, and if Shirley had an ethical editor they would have told him his work was incomplete, at best. 
A stopped clock is right twice a day, however, and Shirley does seem to have stumbled on to something. Local reporters at the Star Tribune and KARE-11 looked for ties between the care featured in Shirley’s video and the Feeding Our Future fraud. That’s how we now know that seven of the child care centers visited by Shirley served as meal sites that received $6.3 million from Feeding Our Future after claiming to have served 2.8 million meals between 2018 and 2021. 
The Reformer was the first to report in the summer of 2023 that nearly half of the 60 defendants charged in the Feeding Our Future fraud at the time had billed the state for other services, including child care. Since then, federal prosecutors have charged 18 additional defendants in the federal meals program fraud and more than a dozen for defrauding programs intended to provide autism services to children and housing assistance to the homeless. 
This means that once again, the administration of Gov. Tim Walz failed to do the most basic due diligence by continuing to pay providers who had ties to Feeding Our Future. 
Which raises the question: Why weren’t they more aggressive about stopping this sooner?
Because of politics and race. In July 2024, I explained how fraudsters leveraged the burgeoning political power of the Somali community by weaponizing race and religion to escape accountability. 
Early last year, a recorded conversation between Attorney General Keith Ellision with several Somali individuals, two of whom would be charged in the Feeding Our Future fraud, was released. The audio, recorded in December 2021, was surreptitiously recorded by one of the charged individuals, and was listed in a trial exhibit. 
In the 54-minute recording, Ellison agrees with the individuals lobbying him that state agencies are discriminating against East African providers. Ellison states that Walz agrees with him that too much focus on compliance is hurting small businesses. 
One individual can be heard telling Ellison that the Somali community will use its votes and money to get behind politicians who will support the community’s efforts to impede state agencies who he says are targeting Somali providers. 
Within 10 days of this meeting, Ellison and his son, a Minneapolis council member at the time, received $17,500 from Somali Americans participating in the federal child nutrition program, many of whom would be charged with defrauding the federal child nutrition program. (To his credit, Ellison can be heard on the audio rebuffing their offers to help him with campaign donations.)
During the second Feeding Our Future trial, one of the defendants, who prosecutors presented as a witness, testified that fraudsters used state Sen. Omar Fateh to hinder the Minnesota Department of Education’s efforts to stop the fraud by smearing the agency as racist. 
Fateh, who accused state agencies of discrimination in December 2021 in a public forum attended by members of the Somali community, announced he would return $11,000 in campaign donations days after federal agents executed a bevy of search warrants tied to the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme in January 2022. Since then, he has returned thousands of more dollars in campaign donations from individuals who have been charged. 
Jim Nobles, who served as Minnesota’s non-partisan legislative auditor for 38 years before retiring in 2021, gently suggested last year that political cowardice was at the root of the failure of vigilance when it came to the theft of state and federal money. Democrats didn’t want public hearings when he conducted audits that might be embarrassing for the Somali community, he wrote in an op-ed in October.  
The late House Speaker Melissa Hortman “acknowledged that some members of her caucus were upset” because they “felt that Office of Legislative Auditor reports were subjecting human service programs to too much criticism, particularly programs administered by Somali community organizations.” 
Paradoxically, these efforts to protect the Somali community now threaten to destroy us. Now we’re enduring a wave of masked immigration agents — sent under the pretext of stamping out immigration and public services fraud, including in the Somali community. 
When Minnesota Democrats allowed fraud to run rampant in our public programs, tarnishing our state and my community’s image in the process, they started a chain of unfortunate events that led us here.

When Purcell was convinced to come out of retirement this past fall to teach at Mackinaw City High School, he saw a remarkable difference teaching students in a district that had long banned cell phone use during the school day.
“It makes a world of difference when there is a school wide policy that is enforced by all the teachers consistently and supported by the administration,” said Purcell, who has taught math, been an academic counselor and served as an assistant principal throughout his career. “Students have and always will find ways to be distracted from the learning, but not having cell phones may take away the biggest distraction that students face.”
Mackinaw City Public Schools’ cell phone ban was instituted around 2010, coinciding with the rise of teen cell phone ownership, longtime Superintendent Jeffrey Curth said. 
Teachers have all taken on the responsibility of enforcing that students’ cell phones are left in their locker with the ringer off from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m, Curth said, removing a major source of distractions and potential source of cyber bullying.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Because we’ve just had it in place so long, it’s just what’s expected,” Curth said. “I think when you see the amount of cyber bullying and things that it’s raised to the level that it has in society today, I think it’s just further strengthened our stance that we feel that we’ve done the right thing.”
As the state considers a school cell phone ban that received overwhelming bipartisan support in the Michigan House last week, an increasing number of Michigan school districts have followed Mackinaw City’s lead by enacting bans and passing cell phone policies limiting use in the classroom in recent years.
Nationwide, 26 states have passed full bans on cell phone use, while six others have required districts to establish their own policies or limited cell phone use in class, according to Newsweek. A 2024 American Association of Educators survey of 1,517 teachers from across the country, on the other hand, found that 70% want cellphones to be banned during the school day.
From passive presence to active participation
Anchor Bay High School student success teacher Jamie Pietron said she was initially apprehensive about how students would adjust to the districtwide ban that started this fall, wondering how the policy would be enforced by administration.
There have been consequences for students who violate the district’s “away for the day” cell phone policy, Pietron said, helping contribute to a more connected learning atmosphere.
“In the past, when kids were done with their work, they went on their phones,” Pietron said. “Teachers are making lessons and activities more engaging to cover any ‘down time’ and students are focused on what they need to do. 
“… It is amazing to walk through the cafeteria and see kids actually talking, playing cards and having conversations with each other instead of staring at their screens.”

Northville Middle School teacher Richard Tabor said he also has seen a shift from “passive presence” to active participation in his classroom since the district enacted its cell phone ban in 2024-25 for students in grades K-8 during class time, requiring them to be collected by teachers at the start of the day.
Prior to the ban being in place, Tabor said it was teachers’ responsibility to enforce their own policies on student cell phone use, leading to inconsistency in where students were allowed to use cell phones and where they weren’t.
Without the option to scroll during downtime, students are able to engage with the classroom environment,” Tabor said. “Students are more likely to ask questions, take physical notes and participate in discussions because they have no alternative ‘escape’ during moments of boredom or difficulty.”
Mackinaw City special education teacher Elizabeth McNeil said her transition from teaching in a district without a cell phone policy to one where a ban has long been in place has been a “breath of fresh air” in removing “distraction and drama.”
“At my previous district, there were daily arguments about giving up phones and discipline problems, even when just asking a student to put their phone away,” she said.
“In a society where adults are addicted to their phones, it is encouraging to see that we are encouraging students here at MCPS to realize that their phones are not part of their lifeline,” McNeil said”
Parental approval
Beyond support from teachers, bans have largely been met with approval from parents, who acknowledge that devices that continually cause them distractions throughout the day shouldn’t be in the hands of their children during school.
Heather Gatny’s opinion has evolved on the issue, from trying to hold off on getting her son a cell phone until he is in high school to recently getting him one as an eighth grader for Christmas.
She likes the idea of him having one in his possession, even if it is kept off while he is in class at Plymouth-Canton Community Schools, but stressed that in the classroom it can only cause distractions.
“If the kids were allowed to have their phones in the classrooms, they’d be looking at them the whole time,” she said. “I think that’s for the best for them to not have access to it, because they’re just on apps. They’re goofing around. They’re not paying attention to what the teacher is saying. They’re paying attention to what their friends are texting them.”
With two young children in second and fourth grades at Plymouth-Canton Community Schools, Sarah Krzyzanski said she is for cell phones being stored in a central location in the classroom for those who are concerned about students being able to respond to an emergency.
In the classroom, however, she said schools should be aiming to keep the focus on learning and not conditioning students to be dependent on having a cell phone by their side.
“These kids are at the point where they’re kind of addicted to that ‘ding,’ and they get to where they crave it, and it becomes an impulse,” she said. “I don’t believe that a child with a phone on their person has the ability to pay attention to the teacher and actually follow lessons and do it with enough of their brain engaged to be taking that educational content out the way that they should be.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2193693341-e1757087878361-700x467-1.jpg,,,2026-01-20 07:59:31.337808

(Photo by Doug Wilson via Getty Images)Indiana firefighters logged elevated levels of potentially hazardous PFAS chemicals in their blood serum, the state has found — with some connections to the frequency with which they handled firefighting foam, protective gear and specialized emergency responses.
PFAS is an abbreviation for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. They have water, oil and heat-resistant properties but have been linked to health effects including potential increased risk of cancer.
The study, conducted by the Indiana Department of Homeland Security and external diagnostic laboratory Eurofins Scientific, was authorized in House Enrolled Act 1219 from 2023. The results were prepared by consultant Delineate and released last week, although the report is dated November.
More states ban PFAS, or ‘forever chemicals,’ in more products

“These findings confirm what firefighters and their families have been raising alarms about for years,” said the law’s author, Rep. Maureen Bauer, in a news release. “PFAS exposure is not isolated. It is systemic, occupational, and statewide. Because of (House Enrolled Act) 1219, we now have real data instead of unanswered questions.”
“Biomonitoring is about prevention and accountability,” added Bauer, D-South Bend. “You cannot fix what you do not measure. This program gives us the tools to protect the people who protect us.”
About 930 Hoosier firefighters — mostly active but some retired — responded to an initial online survey launched August of 2024 about their demographics, occupational history, potential exposure and more.
Respondents primarily served municipal fire departments, with about a quarter stationed in volunteer or combination departments and small numbers working for airports or industry, according to the report.
They were largely highly experienced, with 70% serving 15 years or more.
Testing performed
Of the 485 who reconsented to blood testing following procedural changes, 380 were selected in stratified random sampling and 316 returned their kits.
The samples were tested for 45 different PFAS analytes.
Most — 88% — had between 2 and 20 nanograms per milliliter of PFAS in their blood, putting them at medium risk of potential adverse health effects.
About 8.5% of those tested were in the low risk category, while 3.5% — all with 15 years or more of experience — were living at high risk.
The highest results were observed in two northwest Indiana Preparedness Districts, while the lowest came out of an east-central district.

Frequent exposure to PFAS-containing firefighting foams, which was self-reported, was statistically significantly associated with higher blood PFAS.
So was frequent contact with PFAS-containing equipment or gear, particularly among those handling or wearing gear on most or all shifts.
Residue on gear, along with dust in fire stations, can also contain PFAS.
Researchers observed a statistically significant association between how often firefighters decontaminated their gear and their biomarker category.
Firefighters who reported cleaning their gear after every exposure showed a modestly higher proportion of lower-level PFAS results, and those who rarely or never decontaminated it tended to cluster in the medium- or high-risk categories.
There was a similar trend for self-decontamination — like handwashing or showering — but it wasn’t statistically signifiant, according to the report.
Firefighters who frequently participated in hazardous materials response, water emergencies, construction-related rescues and other specialized tasks also recorded slightly higher PFAS concentrations.
About three-quarters of respondents reported at least some knowledge of PFAS safety, leaving a quarter with no awareness at all. Nearly all were at least moderately concerned about PFAS risks — especially those in higher-risk categories — but most hadn’t completed any safety training.
“This combination, broad concern and limited formal training, suggests strong receptivity to practical guidance, standardized procedures and targeted education at the department and state levels,” researchers wrote.
Recommendations made
The report called the results a “foundation” for further study.
“This pilot establishes an initial, preliminary baseline understanding of PFAS levels in a targeted population of Indiana firefighters,” researchers wrote. “While these data are not conclusive, they serve as a foundation for future, larger-scale efforts, enabling longitudinal studies that track changes in PFAS levels over time and correlate them with health outcomes.”
They recommended a variety of ways to reduce inhalation, skin and hand-to-mouth PFAS exposure: on-scene decontamination, bagging gear after use and laundering it promptly, keeping gear out of living spaces, HEPA-filtered vacuuming and wet-mopping, dedicated extractors and more.
They also aimed some suggestions at PFAS-containing foams: using non-PFAS alternatives “where mission-appropriate,” avoiding foams in training, pre-planning “containment” for emergency foam use and so on.
There are no approved medical treatments to remove PFAS from the body.

Formal safety training was another recommendation.
All active and retired firefighters should have access to voluntary serum testing, possibly with an exposure history survey, per the report.
But the state should also expand the scope of testing to measure non-occupational exposure, like how close respondents live to industrial sites, their primary drinking water sources and dietary habits — and sample for PFAS contamination in fire station dust, turnout gear, apparatus cabs and training grounds, researchers said.
The Indiana Department of Environmental Management could pursue federal and other grants to fund such work.
The study acknowledged some limitations, like challenges in establishing a baseline for PFAS levels.
New protocols for handling participant data were also introduced partway through the pilot, requiring a reconsent form. It came with delays and researchers “lost nearly half … of our sample,” limiting the data analysis they could perform.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents showed up to a Star City Mall in St. Cloud last week to target the Somali community for so-called “immigration enforcement.” Federal agents used chemical irritants and brandished firearms against people gathered to protest what they characterized as racial profiling. 
Witnesses described agents pointing firearms at unarmed citizen-observers and elected officials, turning a community center into a militarized zone of fear. The violence escalated further when, as reported by KSTP, an ICE agent was caught on video attacking a bystander named Chase Benjamin with a baton in the mall parking lot, underscoring the agency’s indiscriminate use of force. 
The ‘operation’ was chaotic. On their way out, they recklessly sped vehicles through the crowd of bystanders.
The raid resulted in at least three arrests and widespread fear among residents. Local officials present on the scene — state Sen. Aric Putnam, City Council Member Hudda Ibrahim, and DFL District 6 Chair Chantal Oechsle — all condemned the tactics as a politically-motivated occupation rather than legitimate enforcement, criticizing the deployment of dozens of agents to a peaceful neighborhood strip mall. 
St. Cloud police received no advance notice, underscoring ICE’s disregard for local law enforcement. To see such brazen disregard for human safety by ICE in a community I once called home is enraging. At this very Somali mall, I used to purchase groceries, get my prescriptions from Afya Pharmacy, eat at the restaurants and pray in the mosque there. 
The Pew Research Center reports that, as of 2023, Minnesota’s unauthorized immigrant population was  estimated at 130,000, accounting for approximately 2.2% of all state residents, notably lower than the national average. We do not have a serious undocumented immigration problem in Minnesota. Moreover, as the Reformer has reported, roughly 90% of Somalis in Minnesota are U.S. citizens, 
So, why is a militarized ICE terrorizing Minnesotans? 
As a St. Cloud State alumnus and former St. Cloud resident of a combined eight years, I am horrified by the potentially unconstitutional manner in which ICE conducted itself in St. Cloud. As a father of children, who are descendants of both Norwegian and Somali immigrants, I fear for their safety and the safety of all Minnesotans. ICE is retraumatizing St. Cloud’s Muslim residents, compounding the fear in a city already scarred by a history of Islamophobia.
Following the fatal shooting of Renée Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross in Minnesota and subsequent raids in this month, public approval for the agency has dropped sharply, with 51% of Americans deeming ICE’s current tactics “too forceful,” according to a recent YouGov poll. A Quinnipiac University poll revealed that 57% of voters disapproved of ICE enforcement of immigration laws, while only 39% approved. According to an NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist College poll, 54% of Americans believe that ICE has “gone too far” in its enforcement of immigration laws. Recently, a CNN poll indicated that 53% of Americans oppose President Trump’s proposed expansion of ICE funding, while only 31% expressed support. In a YouGov poll from Jan 14, 2026, 53% of Americans think agent Ross should face criminal charges for the shooting of Ms. Good, whereas only 30% responded that he shouldn’t be charged.  
In short, Americans are done with ICE, especially Minnesotans. As far back as a June Star Tribune poll and a more recent KSTP poll, a majority oppose Trump’s immigration policies.  
Somali Minnesotans are just like their neighbors — they work and pay taxes and contribute in other ways. According to Bruce Corrie of Concordia University St. Paul, Somali Minnesotans generate at least $500 million in income yearly. Somalis pay approximately $67 million in state and local taxes, and Somalis have an estimated $8 billion impact on the state’s economy. 
These tax-paying Americans should not have to fear a police state. If this ICE surge is some kind of revenge for fraud, doesn’t targeting the entire Somali-American community for the criminal fraud perpetrated by a few individuals constitute immoral collective punishment that violates the core American and international legal principles of presumption of innocence and protection from arbitrary detention? The militarized terror inflicted upon our neighbors is not only a violation of American and international civil liberties but an affront to the sacred values held by Minnesota’s diverse faith communities. 
In the Old Testament, the moral mandate is clear and repetitive: “You shall not oppress a foreigner, you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners” (Exodus 23:9), a call to empathy born from the memory of one’s own displacement. 
This is echoed in the Gospel, where the Biblical Jesus explicitly aligns himself with the outcast, stating, “I was a stranger and you took me in” (Matthew 25:35). Islam similarly elevates the protection of the Ibn al-Sabīl (the migrant), commands believers to stand firmly for justice, and to be witnesses of injustice for God, even if it is against their own kin (Qurʾān 4:135, cf. 2:177, 2:215, 4:36, 8:41, 9:60, 17:26, 30:38, 59:7). 
When militarized agents storm our cities, forcefully enter our homes without judicial warrants and deploy chemical irritants against peaceful families, they violate this shared Abrahamic duty to offer sanctuary. The United States cannot claim to be a moral authority while allowing the machinery of ICE to tear apart the very families we are commanded to aid and protect; our Abrahamic heritage demands we stand between the oppressor and the oppressed. 
To truly uphold that heritage and address our nation’s moral dilemma, we must heed Martin Luther King III’s reflection on the recent state violence in Minneapolis: “It feels like humanity has left,” and our charge now “really is once again redeeming the soul of America.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_351-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 07:59:31.337808

Brad Hudson, pictured speaking during special session Sept. 12, 2025, is proposing an expansion to the MOScholars program that would “significantly increase the amount of funding needed for the program,"" according to the bill's fiscal note. His bill is the first to be heard at the committee level proposing changes to MOScholars (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri lawmakers are considering expanding the state’s private school voucher program with proposals to open eligibility and remove demands on private schools who accept voucher funds.
But the program, which has spent a majority of the $50 million it received in state funding this fiscal year, may lack room to grow with Gov. Mike Kehoe proposing only a small bump for MOScholars alongside a cut of $600 million from the state budget.
MOScholars uses state money, funded directly in the state budget and indirectly through tax-credit donations, to subsidize K-12 education outside a student’s local public school. The program is largely used to fund private, religious education. But some homeschool families use the funds to buy supplies, and a couple students have used the funds to enroll in neighboring public schools.
The program is in its fourth year and provides scholarships to over 6,000 students, thanks in large part to an infusion of $50 million of general revenue last year.
State Treasurer Vivek Malek, pictured speaking during the Disability Advocacy Day rally in the Missouri State Capitol rotunda Feb. 25, 2025, oversees the MOScholars program. Malek’s office is seeking to more than double the number of students served by MOScholars (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
State Treasurer Vivek Malek, whose office oversees MOScholars, wants to keep the momentum going this upcoming fiscal year. His office asked for $100 million in its budget request for the program, seeking to provide funding for 13,000 students next school year.
Kehoe, who lauded the program’s success in his State of the State speech Tuesday, budgeted $60 million in state funds to MOScholars.
“This program is working,” he said, “and Missouri families are counting on it.”
Malek’s office has already spent nearly $40 million on scholarships this fiscal year, according to the Missouri Accountability Portal. Most students with MOScholars funding return the next year, so without funding above and beyond last year’s appropriation, the program will not be able to offer scholarships to many new students.
Despite this funding challenge, the Senate Education Committee appears poised to prioritize MOScholars expansion.
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville, chairs the committee and has spoken in strong support of MOScholars. His children attend Summit Christian Academy, a school that received $727,000 from the program in its first three years.
Among the first bills Brattin selected for a hearing Tuesday was a proposal by state Sen. Brad Hudson, a Republican from Cape Fair, to open eligibility to students already enrolled in private schools.
In the bill’s fiscal note, the treasurer’s office warns the legislation would “significantly increase the amount of funding needed for the program.”
Currently, eligibility for MOScholars is multi-pronged.
Students with an individualized education plan, which public schools administer to students with disabilities requiring accommodations, can apply without restrictions on family income. Students who qualify for free or reduced price lunch are eligible as long as they have attended public school for at least one semester in the past year or are entering kindergarten or first grade. Siblings of MOScholars recipients are also eligible.
Heather Smith, a mother from Cass County, told the committee the expansion would help families like hers. She told them about her son, who struggled in the local public school but “thrived” with the smaller classroom size at Summit Christian Academy.
“The financial strain has been absolutely crushing to our family,” she said.
This school year, her family couldn’t afford the private school tuition. But since her son has been out of public school for over a year, he doesn’t qualify for MOScholars.
“(School) should absolutely be a parent’s choice,” Smith said. “And that choice should not bring a family so far underwater financially that there is little to no way out.”
The bill also seeks to expand eligibility to students with disabilities diagnosed by a medical provider, but it does not define disability nor specify what types of conditions would be covered.
In addition to expanding program eligibility, Hudson’s bill would require judges to allow organizations representing parents to intervene in cases challenging the MOScholars statute. Currently, EdChoice, a nonprofit organization that advocates for school vouchers and similar programs, is an intervener in a case challenging the state’s use of general revenue to fund MOScholars.
Hudson’s bill also seeks to bar administrative rules that would place requirements on schools accepting MOScholars students.
The Missouri House is not set to move MOScholars bills early in the legislative session, with its education committee concentrating on matters affecting public schools.
Moberly Republican state Rep. Ed Lewis, the committee chairman and a former public school teacher, said in the committee’s first meeting Wednesday that he is focusing on teacher certification and retention, literacy and transparency and accountability in public education.
The committee will consider bills outside of these topics, he said, adding: “We want to make sure that we focus on those things this session to try to move education in Missouri forward.”
Some bills seek to reign in MOScholars, adding requirements for private schools to be eligible to receive program funds.
A bill filed by state Sen. Barbara Washington, a Democrat from Kansas City, would require charter schools and private schools accepting MOScholars funds to follow accreditation and accountability measures set by the state, among other requirements.
Similarly, a bill by state Rep. Mark Boyko, a Democrat from Kirkwood, private schools with MOScholars students would be required to follow safety requirements, like teaching CPR in high schools and screening for dyslexia.
“If a school is being supported with state dollars, then I think it’s important that the state takes responsibility for the safety of those students, just like they would a public school student,” Boyko told The Independent.
He filed the bill last year, but it did not get a hearing. If MOScholars legislation makes it to the full House, Boyko said, he is open to adding his legislation as an amendment.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091225_hudson1-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-20 07:59:31.337808

Yet in […]","Missouri Gov. MIke Kehoe waves after completing his 2026 State of the State address on Jan. 13, as House Speaker Jon Patterson claps in the foreground (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications). Gov. Mike Kehoe’s State of the State address rested on a tension he never resolved.
Missouri, he warned, is falling behind. Its population is “stagnant.” Economic growth over the past decade has been “average at best.” When competing with states like Texas and Tennessee, Missouri too often loses before the conversation even begins.
Yet in the same breath, Kehoe insisted Missouri has “already seen success” cutting taxes. Over the last decade, Missouri has trimmed the income and corporate taxes while eliminating the franchise and capital gains taxes. This argument did much of the heavy lifting for the signature proposal in the speech: a five-year phaseout of the individual income tax.
But if tax cuts are already delivering growth, why does Missouri still lag its peers?
And if the state is falling behind, why double down on a strategy that has yet to close the gap?
The governor never reconciled that contradiction, even as he dismissed critics who argue tax cuts have worsened the state’s budget outlook as people who “just want to spend more of your money.”
There is also a political reality left unspoken.
Republicans have controlled the Missouri legislature for more than two decades and the governor’s office since 2016. The conditions Kehoe now decries did not arise in a vacuum. His agenda is not a sharp break from the past so much as an escalation of it — a bet that going further down the same road will finally produce different results.
Kehoe attempted to reassure skeptics by drawing bright lines. He pledged he would “never support” extending sales taxes to agriculture, health care or real estate. He described his plan as deliberate, responsible and safeguarded against runaway sales taxes.
But the language of the constitutional amendment introduced in the Missouri House the day Kehoe gave his speech — the apparent vehicle for that tax-cut promise — tells a different story.
The proposal explicitly allows state and local sales and use taxes to be expanded “to impose taxes on transactions involving any goods and services” for the purpose of eliminating the income tax.
Any resulting tax increase would be exempt from Missouri’s constitutional revenue limits and Hancock Amendment protections, meaning lawmakers could raise or broaden taxes without triggering the usual requirement to take the issue to voters.
Missouri revenue surplus nearly gone as Gov. Mike Kehoe unveils his budget plan

All of this is unfolding as Kehoe warns, in stark terms, that the era of pandemic-era budget surpluses is over and that federal funds that once bolstered state coffers are no longer filling gaps. He proposes roughly $600 million in cuts to the core operating budget while warning that the state’s revenue surplus of $4.3 billion on June 30 will be only $4.7 million next year.
This is not abstract belt-tightening. Kehoe explicitly warned lawmakers against restoring cuts or slipping pet projects into the budget without identifying how to pay for them. The message was unmistakable: lean years are coming, and discipline will be enforced from the governor’s office.
That context makes his tax plan more controversial, not less. States that have successfully eliminated the individual income tax typically rely on alternative revenue streams to balance their budgets, such as oil and gas production, massive tourism economies or both.
Missouri has none of those advantages on a scale large enough to matter.
The coming months will reveal whether Kehoe’s foundation for growth is solid — or whether the cracks he papered over in this speech widen under fiscal pressure.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/011326-1635-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 06:57:38.196710

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)When former state Sen. Dick Codey died earlier this month, the first thing Louise Walpin thought of was his unsuccessful plea on the Senate floor in 2010 to legalize gay marriage.
If legislators didn’t pass it, Codey warned, the world would look back and wonder: “What were they thinking? What were they afraid of?”
Walpin, an LGBTQ activist, thinks the same will happen with the push to protect health care for the transgender community. Legislation that would have codified access to it failed to pass in the waning weeks of the last legislative session, so Walpin and other advocates now are counting on Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D) to shepherd the bill into law. Sherrill will be sworn in Tuesday at noon.
“I look at this from a historical perspective. In LGBTQ rights, we didn’t get marriage equality right away. There has never been an LGBTQ thing that has gone through just smoothly, where everyone says, ‘This is great! We love the language, so we’re going to accept it,’” Walpin said.
Sherrill didn’t say much on the campaign trail about this issue, other than offering broad statements of support for marginalized groups, including transgender people. Some in the community noticed.
Kathleen Gallinaro of Gloucester County has a son who socially transitioned at 13, began receiving testosterone at 16, and is now 19.
“The good in me wants to believe that she didn’t want to bring up something that has been so heavily politicized, because the bottom line is that people have politicized the lives of trans children and trans adults in a way that nobody should be reduced to. Human beings are not politics,” Gallinaro said.
Transgender people and their allies say the fight for protections remains more urgent than ever, as federal threats to the community escalate.
Congressional Republicans have tried to bar Medicaid coverage of all gender transition procedures, while the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority upheld a Tennessee law banning such care for minors. President Donald Trump’s administration has barred transgender people from serving in the military, declared genders are “not changeable,” and tried to block such care for minors, among other things. The federal threats have driven some New Jersey providers to end or scale back services for transgender people.
“They want all of us gone,” said Melissa Firstenberg, a transgender woman from Marlton. “It’s not about the children, for the people who would attack us. It never has been. It’s about their power. It’s about demonizing and dehumanizing a small portion of the population. We’ve just got to make sure that they’re not successful here in New Jersey.”

Sean Higgins, a Sherrill spokesman, told the New Jersey Monitor that Sherrill will keep a 2023 executive order in place in which outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy declared the denial of gender-affirming care a violation of anti-discrimination laws. Higgins said he would not comment on the health care bill because it is pending. Bill sponsor Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex) reintroduced it last week when the new legislative session began.
Jeannine Frisby LaRue, board chair for LGBTQ rights group Garden State Equality Action Fund, said she expects legislators to pass the bill by June — and Sherrill to sign it.
“If this bill takes a year to get to Gov. Mikie Sherrill’s desk, that’s not a win for us. That’s not a win,” LaRue said. “I spoke directly to Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill. She assured me that this is an issue that she cares about, and it’s a priority, and she said if the bill gets to her desk, she’s going to sign the bill.”
In New Jersey, threats to the transgender community have gone beyond health care.
The state has been in court since 2024 defending a state policy that advises school districts they can accept a student’s change in gender identity without notifying parents. Christin Heaps, the father challenging the guidance, has framed his fight as one of parental rights, while the state’s attorneys have centered students’ safety and rights in their arguments. Heaps sued the Delaware Valley Regional High School in Frenchtown for not alerting him in the fall of 2023 that his child, then a freshman, had changed their pronouns and name at school.
Heaps’ case took a big blow last week when a federal appeals court dismissed his request for an injunction that would have blocked districts from following the state guidance. Heaps and his family recently moved from Hunterdon County to Florida, according to a court filing. It’s unclear if he will continue to pursue any claim for damages against the district.
While that case may fizzle out, some LGBTQ advocates fear more New Jersey school districts could follow the lead of Colts Neck’s school board, which rejected the state guidance that prompted Heaps’ lawsuit and also passed a “parental bill of rights” policy in November. That policy requires school officials to notify parents of a change in their child’s pronouns or gender identity, which critics decry as “forced outing.” It also allows them to opt their child out of sex education and decline school counseling.
Despite those other battles, advocates agree the health care bill remains their top priority.
“When we look at inclusion and these other issues, these are battles that will need to be undertaken by our community and our allies,” Firstenberg said. “But first, we need to make sure that we have the right to exist, and that’s what this health care battle is about. At its very core, this is a question about, do trans people have the right to exist?”
The bill would codify Murphy’s executive order and shield patients and providers of gender-affirming and reproductive health care from civil and criminal liability; it defines the former as all health care, including medication, related to the treatment of gender dysphoria and gender incongruence. It has been stalled in the Statehouse since Ruiz introduced it in June 2024, even though it has widespread legislative support (nearly half of each chamber signed on as sponsors), amid disagreement among advocates and lawmakers about the bill’s verbiage.
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex), who controls what bills move in the lower chamber, told reporters last week that lawmakers and stakeholders were close to agreeing on the bill’s verbiage, but “complicated” legislation takes time.
“There’s lots of conversations and proposed languages that make drafts go back and forth, and sometimes, there’s loggerheads, and so it takes time to overcome those. It is alchemy. It’s not a pure science,” he said.
LaRue attributed some of the disagreement to how the bill would define gender-affirming care, with some advocates looking to avoid that phrase altogether over concerns it had become politicized. It’s a tricky balance, she said.
“I was the lead lobbyist on the Marriage Equality Act, and there were some folks who actually said to me, ‘I’ll never support the bill if the word marriage is in it.’ I’m like, well, excuse me, that’s the whole point of it,” LaRue said.

For the last several years, Republican lawmakers have sought to limit DEI in Wisconsin including by introducing bills that were vetoed by Gov. Tony Evers, holding hostage pay raises for the University of Wisconsin system employees during negotiations to limit DEI, and now, placing a constitutional amendment before voters. The efforts come as the Trump administration has also targeted DEI in the federal government and throughout the country.
“It’s just a larger attack that we’re seeing in this country against anything that uplifts our most marginalized communities…,” Chair of the Legislative Black Caucus Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview. “This started even before, you know, President Trump was elected. There’s just been a pushback with these programs and it’s because we’re starting to see some progress.” 
The Wisconsin State Senate will vote this week on a constitutional amendment that would prohibit local governments from “discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to” anyone based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. The proposal was first introduced and passed by the Republican-led Legislature in 2024. It is one of three constitutional amendment proposals that voters may have the final say on in November.
Drake has been seeking to increase awareness of the anti-DEI constitutional amendment over the last week.
Constitutional amendment proposals must pass two consecutive sessions of the state Legislature before they are  placed on ballots. In recent years, Republicans have, with mixed results, relied on constitutional amendment proposals to bypass Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.
If AJR 102 passes on Wednesday, voters will see the following question on their ballots in November: “Shall section 27 of article I of the constitution be created to prohibit governmental entities in the state from discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, public education, public contracting, or public administration?”
Authors of the amendment, including Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Hortonville), have said the proposal will restore “merit, fairness and equality to government practices from the state Capitol, all the way down to our school boards and everything in between.” It passed the Assembly last week. 
Drake counters that Republican lawmakers are misleading Wisconsinites.

“Legislative Republicans had the opportunity to expand economic and educational opportunities for all Wisconsinites. They’re the ones that have power, and yet they chose not to,” Drake said. “They are now trying to pin the reason why people are struggling on Black and brown people, women and other minority Wisconsinites for their failures by misleading people with what this ballot measure would do.”
Drake brought together Black leaders in Milwaukee including Mayor Cavalier Johnson and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, who is running for governor, to speak against the constitutional amendment proposal. 
Johnson said at the press conference that the city complies with state and federal law. 
“As mayor of a majority-minority city, I know firsthand that when every resident has the tools and every resident has the resources at their disposal to succeed, the entire community is strong,” he said. 
Drake has spoken about the risk of losing programs including the state’s Supplier Diversity Program, which was established in the 1980s and certifies minority-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned and woman-owned businesses to provide better opportunities for them to do business with the state of Wisconsin. She also says she thinks the proposal could have farther reaching consequences. For example, she said, she thinks the Holocaust education bill that lawmakers passed and Evers signed last session could be disallowed. That effort was approved in the same year that the state enacted legislation to require education on Hmong and Asian American history in schools.
“The reality is in the constitutional amendment resolution they’re putting forth, it applies for any type of public dollars, so… if our public schools and school boards put money towards that, in a way, you’re giving preferential treatment to teaching that specific history,” Drake said. “It’s so much more than just the programs… that Milwaukee county and the city have.”
“They’re saying that this constitutional amendment would prevent discrimination, but then it’s preventing the government from taking actions when discrimination actually happens, so essentially, you’re outlawing accountability when discrimination does occur,” Drake said. 
The Senate will vote on the proposal just days after Martin Luther King Day. Republican lawmakers have cited the civil rights leader’s teachings as justification for the amendment. 
“The principle of a colorblind equality and merit-based decision-making is again articulated by one of their greatest civil rights leaders, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr,” Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater), the other lead author of the proposed amendment, said at a hearing in the Senate Licensing, Regulatory Reform, State and Federal Affairs Committee on Jan. 7. “Using immutable characteristics like race, sex, color, ethnicity, national origin and the like to discriminate against or grant any individual or group is wrong, no matter who it targets or what the reason, it creates distrust and injust division and represents resentments that divide people instead of uniting them. Past discrimination, however wrong, cannot be corrected with more discrimination.” 
Nass said the amendment would ensure people are hired, promoted, selected and admitted to school in the “same way we choose people for our Olympic team.” 
Drake said the lawmakers who are citing MLK misunderstand his legacy. 
“The reality is that he was someone that was a pioneer in his time and he wasn’t liked because he actually challenged and named the systematic structures that cause disparities throughout this country,” Drake said. “He actively called out his fellow white faith leaders on why they were silent in the face of injustice. He never advocated for a so-called colorblind society. What he was advocating for was that people have access to opportunity.”
GOAT report identifies recommendations to eliminate DEI
The goals of the amendment — and the broader desire to eliminate DEI — were on display during an informational hearing in the Assembly Government Operations, Accountability and Transparency (GOAT) committee on a recent report compiled by Rep. Shae Sortwell.

The Republican from Two Rivers used his authority on the GOAT committee, which was created to be the state’s version of the federal Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), in February 2025 to begin investigating DEI practices in local government. He submitted open records requests to Wisconsin’s 72 counties, the 50 largest municipalities throughout the state and all school districts.
The resulting report released on Jan. 9 was more than 80 pages long. Sortwell also listed thousands of pages of records from counties and municipalities on his website. 
During a Jan. 15 hearing on the report, Sortwell told the GOAT committee that he wanted it to be a “fact-finding” mission. The Wisconsin Counties Association helped guide counties in responding to the requests.
“This is what we found so that you can draw your own conclusions as to what you think,” Sortwell said.
Four counties Buffalo, Richland, Sawyer and Waupaca didn’t have relevant records to share. 
Pierce County did not provide any records to the committee and was identified as uncooperative, according to the report. Sortwell noted during the hearing that Pierce is small and it is possible that is the reason they didn’t reply. 
The following municipalities reported that they had no records: Ashwaubenon, Brookfield, Caledonia, Fond du Lac, Fox Crossing, Germantown, Howard, Marshfield, Menasha, Menominee Falls, Mequon, Mount Pleasant, New Berlin, Oak Creek, Oconomowoc, Pleasant Prairie, West Bend and Wisconsin Rapids. Janesville and Sheboygan failed to provide records to the committee. 
Sortwell discussed spending that some counties, including Rock, Milwaukee and Waukesha, did on DEI training and a “disproportionality” conference hosted by the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) in 2024.
He also highlighted the report’s finding that the Manitowoc mayor attended 24 DEI-related trainings between 2021 and 2023 for a cost of $4,000.
“I’m trying to understand what he didn’t get in the first 23… Is he so racist and homophobic or something that you couldn’t manage to figure out not to treat people badly because they’re different from him in the first 23?” Sortwell said. “Where’s the controls here?”
The report listed a number of recommendations for potential bills lawmakers could pass including one to remove DEI language from state grants, to “prohibit all levels of government from contracting with vendors within a discriminatory DEI lens,” to remove the term “health equity” from all state laws and administrative codes, to prohibit policies and practices relating to equity, prohibit the hiring of DEI staff and use of DEI terminology throughout government, the use of funds for DEI trainings and the requirement that employees participate in such trainings and to prohibit DPI from requiring that school districts “adhere to discriminatory and race-based policies and practices, including spending local tax dollars to fund such.”
Sortwell said he thought the constitutional amendment would take care of some of the recommendations, but that other measures could be needed.
Chair of the committee Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said at the hearing that she thought the report “presents a lot of high-level evidence, probably just scratching the surface really, for why we need this constitutional amendment.”
Sortwell said the recommendations included in the report were based on his judgment.
Democratic lawmakers on the committee, however, spoke to the value of DEI work and questioned the framing and findings of the report.
Rep. Angelina Cruz (D-Racine) told the Wisconsin Examiner that the report includes “gross mischaracterizations” of DEI and “reflects a deep misunderstanding of what DEI is,” and said she would frame the report as more of a “witch hunt” than an investigation.
Cruz said she thought the process of compiling the report was not transparent. She noted that Sortwell’s work on the report was not discussed with Democratic members of the committee before he started and that lawmakers did not have much time to review the thousands of pages before the hearing. 
“If you want to talk about waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer money, it is to waste public servants’ time and our taxpayer resources on generating the data that produce these conclusions that are not grounded in good research methodology,” Cruz said. 
Rep. Mike Bare (D-Verona), the ranking member of the committee, told Nedweski during the hearing that he found her comment troubling.
“I don’t want to make a partisan game here, but I think there’s one side who sees these as not valuable and one side that does see them as valuable,” Bare said. 
The report noted that local health departments have prioritized “health equity” — noting that the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) includes in its rules that local health departments work to help create it. The report called “health equity” a “phantom DEI term.” 
Republicans and Democrats then engaged in a back and forth about the meaning of the term health equity.
“I don’t think we should be treating people differently because they check some box… that’s equality and I support that, and equity says I want a certain outcome, so I’m going to rig the system,” Sortwell said. 
“I don’t think you have to rig the system — and I don’t think a lot of the things that you’ve pointed out are about rigging the system — services for moms or children support services,” Bare said. “We’re trying to allow for an outcome to be possible… You’ve got 50,000 pages. You didn’t do any analysis to tell us why this is bad. There is a lot more that goes into [the question] should we have health equity or not beyond ideology.”

(Keila Szpaller / Daily Montanan)Montana has a simple rule: If you say you support something, you vote for it. Crazy, right? Unless you’re talking about passenger rail—and a certain U.S. Senator in Washington.
In 2021, Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Big deal. Big money. Big opportunity. Buried inside: Funding to study and restore long-distance passenger rail through Montana. Hi-Line upgrades. Maybe even the North Coast Hiawatha back on the tracks. Communities were thrilled.
Then came the vote.
Cue the record scratch.
One Montana senator spent months praising passenger rail. Co-sponsored efforts. Made speeches. Smiled for the cameras. And then…voted no.
So here’s the question, Sen. Steve Daines: Why talk a big game about rail—and then vote against the one bill that made it real? I’d ask you in person, but you stopped answering letters years ago and refuse town halls. So we’re asking in public.
Passenger rail isn’t a luxury. It’s infrastructure. It connects small towns to jobs, schools, hospitals, and the rest of the country. Supports tourism. Supports small businesses. Supports seniors who shouldn’t have to drive five hours to see a doctor.
Montana asked for trains. Daines shrugged and voted no.
The 2021 infrastructure law did three things Montanans had begged for:

First serious federal study in decades on restoring long-distance routes.
Funding for Empire Builder planning and upgrades.
A path to bring back routes that once tied Montana together.

The law passed. The study was completed. Communities are acting on it. But somehow, the senator who “supports rail” voted against all of it.
Passenger rail in Montana isn’t just about trains—it’s about cash in local tills, jobs in construction and tourism, and towns that don’t vanish from the map when everyone drives past. It saves Montanans from endless highway marathons, keeps seniors and students from being stranded, and connects small towns to hospitals, schools, and jobs. Tourists can hit Glacier and Yellowstone without a car, spreading the love (and their spending) statewide. It’s safer than our icy highways, cleaner than another gas-guzzling road trip, and—here’s the kicker—actually makes communities stronger. More travel options, more visitors, more money, fewer accidents, less pollution, and towns that thrive instead of survive. All aboard, Montana—if only someone would vote yes.
Montanans get it:

“He supports rail… in press releases only.”
“Say yes in Montana, votes no in Washington.”
“He wants the credit without paying for the tracks.”
“If double-talk ran on rails, it would never be late.”

It’s like saying you love firefighters but voting against the fire department’s water supply. That’s fiscal responsibility, Daines-style.
Bottom line: The infrastructure law wasn’t perfect. No big bill ever is. But for Montana, it finally cracked open the door to long-distance passenger rail. That door exists today because Congress passed the bill. Without it? Still shut. Towns left out in the cold.
Sen. Daines, Montanans want an answer: If you really support rail, why did you vote against the only bill that delivered it?
Hint: Reading the voting record isn’t partisan. It’s just…reading.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TrainStory1-e1744826151245-1024x577.png,,,2026-01-20 06:57:38.196710

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Derek Caster, a 30-year-old Nebraskan with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, worries that proposed changes to how the State of Nebraska administers a Medicaid waiver for the aging and those with disabilities could be the difference between life and death.
At issue is a 238-page proposal from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services seeking to cap the number of hours for which live-in, often-family caregivers can be reimbursed under Medicaid for providing in-home care such as to Caster or others. The proposal would also place an annual cost limit on reimbursable care based on a DHHS estimate of nursing home costs statewide.

Caster, other waiver recipients, caregivers and advocates for the elderly and people with disabilities have been among many rallying at the Nebraska State Capitol and urging lawmakers to support them.
“If we get a drop in our quality of care, I know for a fact I would be dead,” Caster said at a Capitol rally last week.
‘A deadly direction’
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen supports the proposed DHHS caps and included a DHHS-estimated $14.12 million cut to the Medicaid waiver program in his proposed state budget cuts.
In total, the Pillen budget proposal would cut DHHS’s budget by $152 million. The changes to the “Aged and Disabled Waiver” are among the largest health-related cuts. Lawmakers must balance the budget by late March as they face a projected $471 million state shortfall.
Caster said the current in-home care he receives from his parents, Tammy and Darin, is “exceptional,” in part because they understand his needs and how best to care for his condition, which causes muscles to get weaker over time.

If those changes result in him having to constantly teach strangers his care routines, including the likelihood of staffing turnover, Caster said, could cause his level of care to “slip detrimentally into a deadly direction.”
“A long, quality life is the right of every disabled Nebraskan,” Caster said.
Caster said if DHHS, Pillen and state lawmakers spent one or two days in his shoes, or those of his parents, they would understand why having a say in how people are cared for matters, including in-home care.
Balancing the budget
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, a previous chair of the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, was among a handful of lawmakers who attended the rally. He said it was good to hear from people who are concerned, and he isn’t surprised.
“With uncertainty comes fear, and that’s what this kind of created,” Hansen told the Examiner.
Hansen, a registered Republican, the same as Pillen, said he has priorities about how to spend taxpayer money. Among Hansen’s highest priorities is helping to take care of people who can’t take care of themselves or of people whose families and churches can’t help alone.

The Blair senator said there are many other places to cut to balance the budget, which he said should occur first and not on the “backs” of waiver recipients, families and caregivers.
“These are the people that I want to prioritize above all else first,” Hansen said. “To see us deprioritize them really concerns me.”
State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, another Republican in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, also attended, as did Democratic State Sens. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and Margo Juarez of Omaha. 
Wordekemper said the state needs to look at the Medicaid waivers and how they’re evaluated to better support individuals. 
He said families save the state money by caring for loved ones at home.
“I understand we have to be fiscally responsible, but, at the same point, we have to be realistic and try to do no harm,” said Wordekemper.



Proposed waiver changes

Maximum reimbursable caregiver hours, reduced from 112 hours to 70 hours.

No more than 40 hours could be paid to an in-home family caregiver.
An additional 30 hours could be added, but would need to be delivered by someone outside the home.


Maximum reimbursable costs each year are based on yearly nursing home costs, which were $92,438 as calculated by DHHS.

Families would need to undergo an administrative review when costs reach 150% of the annual cost ($138,657).
Families could be paid as much as 175% of the cost of nursing home care if they pass a clinical review from a DHHS team ($161,767).

‘Doing nothing wasn’t on the table’
The changes come as part of a five-year renewal period for Nebraska’s Aged and Disabled Waiver, which is set to expire July 31. Tony Green, director of the DHHS Division of Developmental Disabilities, said the goal of the changes is “stabilizing” the program and ensuring sustainability.
By mid-2025, the waiver had reached annual costs of $383.6 million, compared to $91 million in mid-2016. That’s an average annual increase of about $29.3 million.

Absent changes, Green said DHHS might have to implement a waiting list, limiting how quickly some families could access the waiver.
“The option of looking at that data and seeing those costs continue to rise at such a drastic rate, the option of doing nothing wasn’t on the table,” Green said in a one-on-one interview.
Pillen and his state budget administrator, Neil Sullivan, have also argued the costs have risen too much. Pillen said the state was “paying grandmas to be grandmas,” while Sullivan had said the state was paying “four times the cost of nursing homes so one person can stay home.” 
Either situation would likely be an outlier, according to DHHS’s own data, with neither Pillen nor Sullivan describing the care individuals in those circumstances would have been receiving. Of about 10,000 waiver recipients, 255 of them had received reimbursable care above $162,000.

The DHHS proposal would also limit families to up to 40 hours of in-home care, down from a current cap of 112 hours. Up to an additional 30 hours could be allowed, but those hours would need to be covered by someone from outside the home, such as from a private provider. 
DHHS is reviewing public comments
Advocates say they rely on the reimbursable hours so they can provide needed 24/7 care at home care without having to also juggle a job, or two, outside the home. Most of the reimbursements are minimum wage, now $15 an hour.
Outside care providers might pay workers $30 to $45 an hour, advocates said last week, leaving some to question whether the DHHS plan would actually save money.
Advocacy organizations and waiver recipients also criticize the DHHS estimate for nursing level of care as a general level and not the heightened care that many individuals on the Aged and Disabled Waiver might need. DHHS estimated the cap this fiscal year as nearly $162,000, which advocates criticized as locking out care at nursing facilities that might charge $1,000 each day.


Aged and Disabled Waiver eligibility

Be eligible for Nebraska Medicaid.
Have a disability or be over the age of 65.
Meet Nursing Facility Level of Care.
Demonstrate need for services.

More information is available here.


In response to questions from the Examiner, Green noted that provider capacity in more traditional facilities is always being worked on and that direct care workforce shortages are “real.” He said DHHS continues to try to be creative with providers to meet needs.
Green said his division is reviewing “well over” 300 comments received on the proposal. Under state law, he said, the state must categorize the responses and address whether changes would be made.
“We are evaluating each and every one of those [comments] in all sincerity,” Green said.
Green said the “drop-dead deadline” to submit the state’s waiver to the federal government for renewal is around March 1. He said that leaves a “little room” in which DHHS could make changes and allow another 30-day public comment period.
Many families say they’re hoping that happens, though they note time is ticking.
“This is not about decreasing services or decreasing any quality in care,” Green said. “It’s really about making sure that the hours that we do authorize into a family’s home are based on need and that we have enough resources to go around for everybody so that the program continues to be sustainable.”
‘Restrain massive cuts’
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha introduced Legislative Bill 958 this year. It would require DHHS to “collaborate” with the Legislature around Medicaid waivers for Home and Community Based Services. 
State Sens. John Fredrickson of Omaha, Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha and Merv Riepe of Ralston. Jan. 7, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
If passed, DHHS would need legislative approval to request a waiver that would introduce an individual cost limit, reduce service hours or narrow eligibility. The bill also would define “nursing facility level of care” as care for which a Medicaid recipient requires assistance with two or more activities of daily living, regardless of the cost.
“It is to restrain massive cuts to developmental disabilities and to ensure that we as a state are doing our utmost to protect this vulnerable population and ensure that they are able to live the full lives that we want them to, and, to the best of their ability, to do it at home when possible,” Cavanaugh said of her bill.
Cavanaugh, a former HHS Committee member who now sits on the Legislature’s budget-writing Appropriations Committee, said she understands some of the waiver changes stemmed from a state audit that found some fraudulently paid DHHS claims.
However, she argued that “sweeping” changes aren’t needed after “a failure of the system to catch errors.” She said investment and training in DHHS would be a better solution.
‘Not just numbers on a page’
Susan Samuelson, “Nana” to her grandson Hunter, who also has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, helped organize and spoke at last week’s rally. She said the proposal would lead many families to consider institutionalization, contrary to U.S. Supreme Court case law and federal law requiring states to provide services so people can live in the “most integrated setting appropriate.”

Samuelson said private providers are “critical,” but when loved ones are stepping up to provide care, that’s not a “luxury” but a “lifeline.” Samuelson also helps lead the new organization “Nebraska Rare,” which focuses on empowering families affected by rare diseases.
“These proposed Medicaid changes are not just numbers on a page,” Samuelson said last week. “They represent real people … real families and real lives.”
She said it’s not trimming the budget but trimming the safety, dignity and independence of some of Nebraska’s most vulnerable neighbors.
Richard Troia, president of Special Sitters, a licensed home health agency serving Omaha and surrounding areas, said he worries about a “domino effect” in which fewer reimbursable hours mean fewer caregivers and fewer options for families, leading to weakened families and increased institutionalization.
Samuelson said families and advocates can’t accept the changes and won’t stop fighting. She described the changes as “a bigger deal than just our disability community.”
“This affects everybody in the state, and we should all have humanity as our No. 1 objective for those who generally cannot advocate for themselves,” Samuelson said.
Hansen said his message to concerned Nebraskans is, “I’m on their side.”
“I’m going to fight for it,” Hansen said. “I’m going to find one way or the other to help make sure that we don’t get this cut.”

Rural areas saw a 16.6% increase in people experiencing homelessness between 2023 and 2025, according to Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority data. During that same time period, urban areas saw a 9.4% increase. 
Those figures don’t tell the full story – “homelessness in rural areas is more complex and often harder to see,” said Brandi Pirtle, housing director for Jeffersonville-based New Hope Services.
Brandi Pirtle, housing director for Jeffersonville-based New Hope Services.
Existing data on homelessness is gathered via point-in-time surveys. These surveys are conducted annually over a one-day period, typically in January or February, and it seldom provides a complete picture.
For example – in IHCDA Region 13, building codes vary across seven counties. Region 13 covers Orange, Washington, Scott, Jefferson, Crawford, Floyd and Clark counties and what’s considered uninhabitable in one county may not be considered such elsewhere, meaning individuals may not show in a PIT count, but they’re in unsafe conditions. Rural homelessness, Pirtle noted is “frequently undercounted,” because it doesn’t neatly fit Housing and Urban Development categories.
Another reason PIT data doesn’t provide a complete picture is that it only covers one day. Pirtle said many families are “doubled-up” – they share a living space but it isn’t permanent or stable. Those families get missed by PIT counts.
“You don’t find the couch surfers, folks that are hidden in the woods or that pop in and out of a friend’s home,” via PIT counts, Jason Hayes, executive director of the men’s residence center at the Evansville Rescue Mission, said.
Pam Brookshire, vice president of community services at northeastern Indiana-based Brightpoint Services, discussed a situation she knew of — a family inherited a home. They’ve had financial and some criminal issues. They owe $2,500 in electricity bills. They’re also over the Energy Assistance Program income guidelines, “and in this county, there are very few resources – nobody can touch that bill. Nobody has the kind of money just to touch that bill.” 
If it isn’t paid, “they are going to be homeless,” she said. To Brookshire, this illustrates the rural homelessness situation.
 “Families make decisions,” she said, “we’ve all made decisions we wish we could take back but they’re in a situation now where they’re going to lose,” their home.
“This is affordable housing for them,” she emphasized. “If they lose this – they can’t find anything comparable that they will be able to afford. There’s nothing out there. It’s those kinds of situations that more rural families face and, because of the lack of resources, it’s everybody trying to pull together instead of one or two agencies that could resolve this situation. They’re not as visible because they’re not that wandering the street homeless.”
Homeless advocates oppose Indiana bill to criminalize sidewalk camping

 The COVID-19 pandemic ultimately made housing in rural areas worse. Brookshire said she was hopeful the “perfect storm” of factors would ease after COVID but “none of that has happened.” A two-bedroom apartment in the Fort Wayne area ranges between $1,300 and $1,500 a month. Senior citizens who used to be able to get by in a one-bedroom apartment with social security can’t afford their homes as rent increases.
New developments and increasing property values are also factors – Pirtle said she’s seen situations where property taxes increased and priced people out of homes they’d lived in for years. 
“That kind of displacement can happen quickly in small, rural communities,” she said.
Development itself can prove challenging depending on local codes, zoning, land availability, local government and infrastructure. Funding exists for rural development, but programs like low-income housing tax credits and others, are competitive and there are concerns about federal-level reductions or eliminations.

 When contacted with questions regarding information in the 2025 State of Homelessness presentation, the IHCDA provided the following:

“IHCDA believes that a portion of the increase in homelessness in rural counties could be attributed to efforts to ensure a more comprehensive and accurate count.The annual Point-In-Time count does not provide us with the data needed to know exactly why there is an increase in individuals experiencing homelessness in rural areas. Many shelter and housing providers remain at or near capacity and as the number of individuals experiencing homelessness continues to rise, a disproportionate percentage of that increase will more than likely be for unsheltered individuals as a result.”
The IHCDA added that in 2023, the Indiana Balance of State Continuum of Care secured funding for three three-year projects addressing rural homelessness. 
The IHCDA is responsible for two initiatives in Jackson and Starke counties. According to the IHCDA “one goal of these projects is to identify and evaluate effective strategies for reducing homelessness in rural communities. By implementing and monitoring target interventions, these programs aim to establish best practices that can be adapted throughout similar rural areas.” 
Pirtle said Hoosiers need to use the expertise that already exists within their own communities to strengthen housing stability “rather than waiting for or relying solely on state or federal intervention.
She emphasized the importance of a local approach to addressing homelessness — “hope alone is not a plan; however action, collaboration and local ownership are,” she said.

This story was originally reported by Candice Norwood of The 19th.  Meet Candice and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A mother shoved to the ground in front of her children in the hallways of a immigration courthouse in New York. A young woman pulled from her car and handcuffed on a busy street in Key Largo, Florida. A child care worker dragged out of her workplace in Chicago, in front of parents and children. A pregnant woman yanked by one arm through the snowy streets of Minneapolis.
In each of these cases, the aggressors were men working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and their actions were caught on video widely shared online.
Then came Renee Nicole Good.
On Jan. 7, the 37-year-old mother of three and her wife had dropped off their 6-year-old son at school and were blocks away from home when they stopped by an ICE protest to “support their neighbors,” according to Good’s wife, Becca. People had gathered to blow whistles and shout to alert nearby residents about ICE’s presence in Minneapolis’ Central neighborhood.
Video taken at the scene from different angles and analyzed by multiple news outlets shows Good trying to leave as an ICE agent grasps at the driver-side door handle of her car. A second agent, later identified as Jonathan Ross, was standing toward the front of the car. He fired at least three shots aimed at Good as she attempted to drive away. An agent can be heard saying in one of the videos, “Fucking bitch” after the shots were fired.
Good was killed.
President Trump and Vice President JD Vance have, without evidence, accused Good of attacking Ross and justified his actions as self-defense.
There is no database tracking when ICE agents use force against women. But a growing number of videos captured throughout the first year of the second Trump administration offer some insight into the violent encounters that women have experienced: broken car windows, yanking, shoving, pepper-spraying and shootings, all of them out in the open and available on social media.
ICE agents’ history of violence against men, women and transgender people in detention facilities has been documented. Gender-based violence researchers told The 19th that the widespread visibility of physical violence against women in public spaces does not happen in a vacuum and goes hand-in-hand with the policies and messaging coming from the administration.
The visible attacks shared online come on the heels of President Donald Trump insulting women reporters as “piggy” and “ugly” and downplaying the severity of domestic violence. They also come at a time when reproductive rights and access to gender-affirming care have been significantly restricted, and as funding for gender-based violence services and research centering women and LGBTQ+ people has been stripped.
“All of these things converge to entrap women and make more violence in their lives and have fewer ways for them to escape the violence,” said Dr. Carolyn West, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington Tacoma. “So, it’s not just the violence in your home, it’s the violence in your workplace, it’s the violence in the larger community. It’s state-sponsored violence; all of these things converging together.”
“State-sponsored violence,” as West refers to it, is a term used by researchers to discuss violence perpetrated by government authorities, including local and federal police and ICE agents.
Between 1999 and 2015, the percentage of women who made up the population of people experiencing police use of force increased from 13 percent to 25 percent according to an analysis by the nonprofit think tank Prison Policy Initiative. A study published in the journal for the National Academy of Sciences, based on data from 2013 to 2018, found that Indigenous women and girls experienced a lifetime risk of 4 per 100,000 potentially being killed by police, while the rate for Black women and girls ranged from 2.4 to 5.4 per 100,000; the rate for White women and girls was 2 deaths per 100,000. A 2022 survey of LGBTQ+ people found that 25 percent said they were verbally assaulted during their most recent encounter with police, 13.4 percent said they were sexually harassed and 12.8 percent said they were physically assaulted.
Data tracking use of force by members of law enforcement is underreported and not standardized across the thousands of law enforcement agencies throughout the country, so what is available does not fully reflect the scope of the issue.
For example, the most recent data from government sources, news and academic analysis do not capture specific rates of force among immigration officials against women. One report, by the American Immigration Council, indicates that ICE encounters and arrests with women increased from the end of the Obama administration through the beginning of Trump’s first term. Scenes of Latinas on the receiving end of violence by ICE agents are more common among recent online videos, in part because about half of all immigrants in the United States are from Latin America.
This dearth of more complete data is more apparent in the current Trump administration, researchers said. Over the course of the last year, executive orders on gender and diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility banned the use of certain words. As a result, federal departments and some advocacy groups that cater to marginalized populations removed these words from information in their grant applications and on their websites.
“I’m writing something now and I’ve got seven configurations of the word gender that can’t be used in a grant application,” said Dr. Earl Smith, a professor of women and gender studies at the University of Delaware.
West stated that the lagging research and support for data create a vicious cycle: without updated data, it becomes impossible to show there is a problem, she said.
“It’s almost like a willful ignorance,” West said. “If we can not collect the data, if we defund all these programs, and if nobody’s counting, then there’s the gaslighting that says, ‘Well, there’s no data to say there’s a problem.’”
This has been part of the challenge when speaking about violence by ICE agents since the start of the second Trump administration, researchers said. Without comprehensive tracking, it is difficult to demonstrate a pattern of behavior and its effects. Still, as immigration enforcement escalates to unprecedented levels during the second Trump administration, unbothered by objections and court challenges by state and city leaders, the increasing presence of online videos depicting violent ICE encounters with women has caught public attention, fueling outrage and protest that, at times, has led to more violence.
Six days after the fatal shooting of Good, a video shared and liked by thousands on the social media site Bluesky shows ICE agents in Minneapolis breaking the car window, cutting the seatbelt and forcibly removing a woman of color from her car as she screams, “I’m disabled.”
In another video, a woman can be heard saying “shame on you” to an ICE agent in Minneapolis. In response, the officer says, “Have you all not learned from the past couple of days?” presumably referring to Good’s killing. He then appears to grab the woman’s phone out of her hand.
Reflecting on this dynamic, Hillary Potter, an associate professor of Women and Gender Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, said, “I wonder how much of that culture of machismo, toxic masculinity, whatever you want to call it, is impacting how ICE agents are treating women in the field.”
Potter and other researchers agreed that violence against Black, Brown and LGBTQ+ women has been normalized for years. Good was a White queer woman who was killed while participating in a neighborhood protest to show solidarity with immigrant communities. In Minneapolis, Latinos, Somalis and Hmong people have been the main targets of ICE enforcement actions.
“This is new to the current generation of folks looking in,” Smith said. “But Black folks for sure, Somalis, for sure, Hmong people in Minneapolis — they know the deal. They’ve been abused for years.”
Trump, meanwhile, has called Good “very violent” and “very radical,” and said she was “very, very disrespectful to law enforcement” before she was shot dead. It is a similar kind of language he has used to vilify immigrants of color and justify his administration’s pursuit.
“We’ve seen countless numbers of marginalized women, transgender women, who have been brutalized by law enforcement,” West said. “So it’s really interesting to me at this time that White people are seeing that they’re not going to be protected either. Your Whiteness and your femaleness is not going to protect you, not from these systems.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_1499-scaled-e1768908616995-1024x684.jpg,,,2026-01-20 06:57:38.196710

The Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry’s Local Food for Schools Program, which launched last year, connects local agricultural producers and farms with school cafeterias.
Brady Womack, rural economic development coordinator for the Department of Agriculture and approver for the program, said one of the program’s goals is educating students about the culinary “farm-to-table or farm-to-school” movement, which emphasizes the importance of using locally sourced ingredients and supporting local economies.
Oklahoma’s program is modeled after a larger one managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which the state participated in from 2022 through 2025. 
Oklahoma’s Legislature allocated $3.2 million for the program, which allows approved schools to use state funding to purchase minimally processed foods such as fruits, vegetables, eggs, meat, dairy products, and nuts. 
Minimally processed refers to foods that haven’t been altered in a way that significantly changes the fundamental properties, Womack said. He said his agency works directly with its Food Safety Division to choose which farmers and ranchers are approved and to ensure they have completed all requirements to be able to sell food to schools or the public, Womack said. 
“The Food Safety makes sure they have all their verifications or classes taken to be able to sell food to schools or the public,” Womack said.  
The program allows schools to request a maximum of $25,000 per month in increments of $5,000, with a limit of $100,000 per fiscal year. After the initial allocation, schools can then only apply once monthly.  
Meriruth Sellers, director of market development for the state Department of Agriculture,  said schools can choose which farms or ranches to purchase from as long as they follow the program’s requirements. 
“Many schools are able to buy from nearby farms, while others may have to travel farther,” she said.
The program reimburses schools for purchases of local food so it only saves them the exact dollar that they purchased, Sellers said. 
“This program is not intended to cover entire food costs … it is intended to help schools build relationships with local farmers by offsetting the cost of food,” she said.
To meet higher consumer demand resulting from utilization of the new program, some producers have had to adjust their production rate but most have been able to maintain their normal daily operations, according to the American Farmers and Rancher’s Cooperative. 
Katie Whitfield, a field representative and coordinator with the Oklahoma Certified Beef Association, said that the program has a significant positive impact on the Oklahoma farmers and ranchers who participate. 
“It provides them with stable, consistent buyers who purchase substantial quantities of their products, helping to create financial security while also allowing them to support their local schools and communities,” she said.
Whitfield said the biggest challenge is logistics — getting the product to the schools efficiently. Some districts require large quantities of beef, which can pose transportation or delivery challenges, but these are manageable as the program continues to grow, and infrastructure improves.”
“Programs like this shorten the supply chain, making the food system more resilient, transparent, and sustainable,” Whitfield said. “They keep food dollars circulating within the state, support local economies, and reduce dependence on out-of-state suppliers—all while giving students access to fresh, nutritious, locally produced food.”
She said her organization views Oklahoma’s Food for Schools Program as becoming an essential part of the state’s food supply chain.
“As more schools participate and more producers get involved, we anticipate expanded product offerings, stronger local supply networks, and deeper partnerships between agriculture and education,” Whitfield said. “Ultimately, the goal is for locally sourced food to become the norm in Oklahoma school cafeterias.”

Buttigieg was following in the footsteps of other Democrats who have visited Wisconsin’s closely divided 3rd Congressional District to needle Republican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden for failing to meet publicly with his constituents who are bearing the brunt of tariffs, high prices and unaffordable health care spurred by Trump administration policies Van Orden has supported. 
In making his La Crosse appearance to bolster a Democratic candidate in a swing district ahead of the midterms — and perhaps to stick his toe in the water ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run — Buttigieg connected with rural and blue-collar Midwestern voters.That’s something Democrats arguably need to do better if they are going to overcome total domination by the party of President Donald Trump. 
The most interesting thing about the La Crosse town hall was the energized audience of rural and small-town Wisconsin and Minnesota residents worried about the the scary, violent authoritarian regime that is rapidly consolidating its power over a stunned and fractured citizenry. 
Democratic state Sen. Brad Pfaff, who took the stage ahead of Buttigieg, praised him as “a son of the Midwest,” denounced President Donald Trump’s gilded White House ballroom, and declared, “The rich get tax breaks and what do the rest of us get? Rising costs!” Pfaff also took a jab at “tech bros” who got front-row seats at Trump’s inauguration and are profiting from algorithms that sow “hate and distrust and division.” 
Buttigieg picked up on that theme, urging people to reach out in person to connect with their neighbors who might disagree with them. Responding to a veteran in the audience who said he was in despair about talking to people who live in a pro-Trump social media bubble and who “don’t know how close to the abyss we really are,” Buttigeig said, ”This is where I believe in the power of the offline.” 
“We are increasingly sorted into these silos where not just our opinions, but our facts, or would-be facts, are presented to us. But our relationships, our families, our neighborhoods, our communities, our churches, our little league, our sports loyalty, right? That’s where we have a chance to get through to people.”
Rebecca Cooke speaking in La Crosse on Jan. 16, 2026 | Ruth Conniff/Wisconsin Examiner
Rebecca Cooke, who lost her challenge to Van Orden in 2024 by three percentage points and is seeking a rematch, used her few minutes on stage ahead of Buttigieg to emphasize her dairy farm upbringing and work experience as a waitress, declaring, “I’m a working-class Wisconsinite who hopes to be your next member of Congress.” Cooke touted “right to repair,” legislation, “so every time your John Deere breaks down you don’t have to go to the dealership.” Her parents, she said, were on their annual trip to Mexico to get their dental work done for an affordable price “which is ridiculous.” She described how her dad was hit with a bill for over $1,000 at Walgreen’s when he went to fill a prescription for cancer medication. She’s running, she said, to represent people who “just want to be able to put gas in the car and have a little money left over.”
Going beyond Democrats’ ubiquitous talking points about “affordability,” audience members brought up their spiritual beliefs, the meaning of democracy, how technological change is driving a growing sense of alienation, the need to reconnect with neighbors and overcome political divisions, and the horror of seeing federal agents gun down a woman in a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis.
A young woman who lives near Minneapolis broke down crying as she asked Buttigieg, “How do we deal with this attack on our community, on people that we love?”
“The only antidote to a politics of fear is a politics of courage,” Buttigieg told her, praising her compassion and her desire to work for change. “It seems like you’re alone in caring,” he added, but “the majority of Americans think what’s going on there is wrong.” He had just come from talking to farmers in a conservative area of the state, he said, who were very worried about the impact of immigration enforcement on their workers. “We can bring together strange bedfellows,” he said, “as they’re doing everything they can to pull us apart.” 
A Vietnam veteran, part of a large contingent of vets who stood to accept applause as Buttigieg acknowledged them and thanked them for their service, held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution and said he was upset by Trump’s “abuse” of the military and the National Guard. “I’m really worried that a lot of our people are going to look at our veterans, look at the National Guard — and I’ve got that same creepy feeling that we used to have when we came back before — we’re not going to get the respect for what we really are.”
“Thank you for reminding us of your experience, and I know that was an experience for, really, a generation of service members,” Buttigieg said. When he finished his tour of duty in Afghanistan, he added, “I was fortunate to belong to a generation of veterans who came home to a pretty good welcome, because our country learned the hard way how to separate its attitudes about a policy from its attitudes about the people who were sent somewhere by that policy.”
He connected that change in attitude to a general capacity Americans have for learning from their mistakes, “We learned, we grew. That’s the best thing about this country,” he said. Current efforts to whitewash U.S. history assume that “any time you talk about the things that were wrong about America, that must mean you hate America,” he said, but “some of the finest moments that brought out the greatest character of this country is how we put it right.”
There’s a long way to go before we put things right in our country now, just one year into what already appears to be the most destructive administration in U.S. history. But the feeling in the room at the town hall in La Crosse was hopeful that a new, majoritarian politics could shake off the divisiveness and fear of the Trump era and reclaim democracy and a government by and for the people.
As third-generation dairy farmer Sabrina Servais put it, describing the loss of half of dairy farms in Wisconsin since the early 2000s and her fierce love for her own family’s small, organic farm, “the most beautiful place on Earth,”  “It’s easy to feel small when you’re so far away in rural America. Will anyone listen? … But we matter. We’re a swing state. We have the power to change the outcome of elections. We are the working class of America. How dare they doubt us? … We believe that, despite everything, the world is still beautiful.”

Parks Elementary in Oklahoma City on the first day of school on Aug. 13, 2025. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma’s legislators are, once again, seeking a silver bullet to solve our complex education problems.
It doesn’t exist, and their annoying habit of trying to take shortcuts to solve complicated, intertwined problems and repeating lobbyists’ popular talking points, continue to undermine teaching and learning. 
No “miracle” is going to quickly fix our sagging literacy rates and restore reading for comprehension or simply increase our testing outcomes. 
It will take a marathon to do that.
Unfortunately that hasn’t dawned on lawmakers yet judging by the fact that they’ve become focused on a new “silverbullet” — the Oklahoma State Chamber’s education plan, called “Oklahoma Competes.” The strategy relies heavily on the assumption that retaining third graders will benefit more students than it harms.
And while there is evidence that retention improves test scores, there is also even more compelling evidence that it increases dropout rates, and that it reduces children’s earnings as adults and stigmatizes youth.
Yet, our legislators and lobbyists constantly praise the “Mississippi Miracle,” which is a policy package policy that laid a foundation for student supports, including remediation services for students, phonics, and teacher training programs, as well as controversial online tutoring. It also focuses on accountability metrics that, I believe, drove down teaching and learning over the last quarter of a century.
Those policies led to boosts in fourth grade performance on the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) tests. The test is often used as a barometer to measure how each state’s education system is performing against its peers. 
But I’m doubtful about the overall success of the program.
Sure, Mississippi fourth grade scores saw a jump in test scores, but if there had been long-term gains in reading comprehension, we would have seen that translate into the 8th grade NAEP scores by now.  
In 2024, research found that Mississippi’s eighth grade reading scores have not changed since 2002, which raises doubts in my mind about the long-term effectiveness of Mississippi’s strategy and if third grade children are actually learning the basics of reading or if they’re teaching to a test.
The other elephant in the room that Oklahoma legislative leaders seem to be avoiding is that Mississippi’s program started with a $100 million grant by the Barksdale Foundation. It was a private investment that had been successfully tested in other schools, which trained teachers in literacy instruction.
What is the chance that Oklahoma would do something like that? 
Yes, the Chamber now supports a number of programs along the lines of the services Mississippi funds. But, why are supporters so quiet about their price tags, and where the money will come from?
I’ll tell you why. It’s going to cost a ton of money to do this right, and spending that money will be a tough sell among our penny-pinching lawmakers. 
At a time when funding is being cut for a range of service providers and nonprofit organizations whose support for public education is often essential, what are the chances that we would fully invest in the more expensive parts of the Mississippi plan?
So, before we discuss retaining students, we should consider starting with win-win, long-term investments in early literacy screenings, intervention specialists, additional instructional time, structured summer programs and targeted support for at-risk students. 
Once we have those in place — and adequately funded — for several years, then we could talk about implementing retention policies.  
Instead of seeking quick fixes that will do little to address underlying problems, we should heed the wisdom of State Superintendent Lindel Fields.
He says instead of a “miracle,” we need a “marathon.”  
Indeed, there is no quick way of reversing our literacy crisis. 
It’s going to take a concentrated, long-term investment in teachers, children, and schools to improve student outcomes. 
Whether we are talking about test-driven accountability for third graders or for teachers, the supports they need, or how to fund these efforts, one thing is abundantly clear.
We need open, balanced discussions, and research on both sides of the issues that includes educators and parents.
Because there is no easy fix to our education system.

Mikie Sherrill, but New Jersey's deficit may force hard choices. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill will face growing budget deficits, shrinking federal support, and a resistance to new tax hikes as she moves to enact her first spending bill in the coming months.
But Sherrill, a Democrat who becomes governor on Tuesday at noon, will enter office with far more resources than her predecessors.
New Jersey’s reserves will remain at some of their highest levels in decades after Gov. Phil Murphy (D) leaves office. And though spending that has already been approved and expiring one-shot revenue sources stand to expand New Jersey’s deficit and shrink its reserves, experts said past treasurers and governors would envy the Sherrill administration’s position.

Rather than having to raise hundreds of millions in new revenue or cut the same amount in spending, Sherrill can decide which of her priorities she wants to pursue first, said David Rousseau, who served as state treasurer under Gov. Jon Corzine.
“Recognizing that the challenges of meeting the spending needs of the state still exist, and the need to look forward, any governor and treasurer since 2001 would love to have this situation,” he said. “This allows a more focused look at the budget, instead of dealing in a crisis situation.”
New Jersey’s current budget calls for state spending to exceed state revenue by $1.5 billion. That deficit is set to grow after non-recurring revenue that has buttressed the budget in the current July-to-June fiscal year runs dry and steep cost increases from the nascent property tax relief program Stay NJ take effect in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Those include a $550 million transfer from a state fund meant to pay down higher-interest debt to reduce long-term borrowing costs, and the roughly $900 million increase to the annual costs of Stay NJ.
The lost revenue and added costs could speed the draining of New Jersey’s surplus, which was expected to fall to $6.7 billion by the end of June, and leave it less prepared to backfill steep reductions to federal aid, said Peter Chen, senior policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective.
“It makes sense to save up even more money in your rainy-day fund for the rainy day, the bad weather that’s yet to come,” he said. “Dipping into your savings to pay your bills now is only going to hurt you down the road.”
State officials have said federal changes to Medicaid would reduce annual federal funding for the program by about $3.6 billion. Some of those costs are likely to pass through to charity care or hospital emergency rooms, boosting some state expenses.
But with New Jersey’s surplus still near record highs, Sherrill has room to spend some down, a flexibility governors like Chris Christie and Jon Corzine never enjoyed.
“There is this structural deficit, but the discussion is ‘what actions do we have to take to maintain whatever surplus we want?’ It’s not ‘what actions do we have to take to meet our constitutional obligation and have any surplus?’” said Rousseau.
A lack of legislative support for new taxes could complicate Sherrill’s path to her own spending priorities. She’s due to deliver her first budget address in late February or March.
Democrats in Trenton homed in on affordability as a top issue following legislative losses and a narrow gubernatorial win in 2021, and they’ve credited that focus for recent election wins that delivered the party a third consecutive governorship and its broadest Assembly majority in more than half a century.
“I think we need to continue to look at ways and find ways to make New Jersey more affordable,” Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) told reporters last week.
Chen and other progressives have argued the state can boost revenue without politically costly broad-based tax hikes by creating new brackets for higher earners — at $2 million or $5 million in income, say — and for highly profitable businesses.
Reforms to the tax code that don’t alter rates, like changes to capture more business income reported outside the United States, could also boost revenue without straining New Jersey residents writ large. Either way, Chen said, something would have to give.
“The reality of the budget and of maintaining services is going to require more revenue at some point,” Chen said. “Or it will require the kinds of cuts that we’re already seeing in some districts. We’re hearing about layoffs. We’re hearing about cuts.”
New Jersey’s corporate taxes on high-earning businesses are already the highest in the nation, and its marginal rate on top-level individual incomes only lags behind rates in California, Hawaii, and neighboring New York.
Republican lawmakers who have chaffed at the state budget’s growth under Murphy — it rose from about $39 billion in Murphy’s first year to around $59 billion in the current fiscal year — said Sherrill would eventually have to make those tough budget decisions.
“We are going to reach a point where the governor’s going to have to look at the budget in total, and she’s going to have to make some hard decisions, and we’re going to have to decide what the state of New Jersey has to do, what it would like to do, and what it can no longer afford to do,” state Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris), his chamber’s minority leader, told reporters last week.

Project Jade could eventually use the same amount of electricity as produced by 10 nuclear power plants.
The post Laramie County approves construction of what could become the largest data center in US appeared first on WyoFile .","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Wyoming is poised to become an artificial-intelligence powerhouse after Laramie County commissioners earlier this month unanimously voted to move forward with the construction of a 1.8 gigawatt data center designed to eventually scale up to 10 gigawatts, which would be the largest single AI campus in the U.S. 
The facility will include the Project Jade data center campus built by AI infrastructure company Crusoe and the BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub built next door by Tallgrass Energy Partners to provide it with electricity. BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub will provide on-site power from natural gas turbines. Matt Field, chief real estate officer for Crusoe, told the Laramie County commissioners during the Jan. 6 hearing that the first phase of the project will leverage natural gas with a potential pathway for CO2 sequestration in the future. 
Crusoe and Tallgrass announced in July that the center’s close proximity to Tallgrass’ existing CO2 sequestration hub will “provide long-term carbon capture solutions” for the gas turbines powering the data center. “Future renewable energy developments” touted by the companies in their joint statement could include solar power to augment the gas turbines in later stages of the project, according to Wyoming Energy Authority.
The companies have yet to announce the specific tech firms to benefit from the Jade data center, but the project is expected to meet the extreme power and infrastructure demands of hyperscale cloud providers and AI industry leaders, said Crusoe spokesperson Andrew Schmitt.
Both of the interconnected projects are now proceeding to the construction phase in the Switch Grass Industrial Park area, located 8 miles south of Cheyenne. With the site plans approved by the county, Crusoe and Tallgrass Energy expect construction to be completed on the first buildings in 2027.
Prior to the final vote, the Hyndman Homesites Homeowners Association, which represents a community adjacent to the project, wrote a letter to the county commissioners requesting that the site plan adhere to certain considerations. The letter details residents’ concerns with deep wells drilled into the aquifer, increased traffic and noise, light pollution, gas turbine emissions, noxious odors and the location of wastewater ponds. Additionally, the letter urged the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to ensure compliance with requirements to minimize the impacts on wildlife migration routes and sensitive habitat inside the project area. 



“We accept the inevitability of the project and want to identify and mitigate concerns before they become problems,” the homeowners’ association wrote.
The AI campus is expected to open with a capacity of 1.8 gigawatts of electricity, over five times more than the roughly 238,000 homes in Wyoming currently use, with the potential to scale up to 10 gigawatts, pending state and county approvals. One gigawatt can power approximately 750,000 to one million average U.S. homes, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. 
The Associated Press reported that electricity needed to power the first phase of the center is predicted to double the entire state of Wyoming’s current energy generation. Compared to a report listing the 15 largest data centers in the world by the information technology provider Brightlio, the Jade Project could set a global record in energy use by a single center if the planned expansion reaches 10 gigawatts. Jones Lang LaSalle’s 2026 Global Data Center Outlook projects total global data center energy capacity to rise from 103 gigawatts to about 200 gigawatts by 2030. 
“Building an American AI factory that can scale to 10 gigawatts of capacity illustrates Crusoe’s commitment to delivering infrastructure at the scale needed for the U.S. to win the global AI race,” Crusoe co-founder and CEO Chase Lochmiller stated in a July press release announcing the project. 
Jumping into the AI race
Wyoming developers and state officials have touted the projected benefits of becoming a hub for AI and high-performance computing, which they say will include job creation, economic diversification, increased tax revenue and demand for natural gas and renewable energy. The project’s construction phase is expected to employ approximately 5,000 workers at its peak, per the site plan. Field said the data center will have approximately 400 permanent jobs, ranging from janitorial positions to engineers. 
“Wyoming is pro-business and pro-growth,” U.S. Sen. John Barrasso said in a press release. “Our commitment to innovation and investment is what makes our state great. New, state-of-the-art data centers like this will bring high-paying jobs and a skilled workforce to southeast Wyoming.”
The state is also looking to nuclear energy to meet the increasing demands of the AI industry. TerraPower, the advanced nuclear reactor company founded by Bill Gates, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced earlier this month that Cheyenne is one of the sites being considered for a dual-unit Natrium power plant that could be completed as soon as 2032 to fuel the Meta AI data center already under construction there. TerraPower is building the world’s first Natrium reactor in Kemmerer.

The proposals for AI are exciting for the state’s fossil fuel industry as well.
In a statement last year when the Jade data center was announced, Gov. Mark Gordon wrote that the news was exciting for “Wyoming and for Wyoming natural gas producers.” Gordon had previously called Wyoming an optimal location for AI expansion, partly due to its energy infrastructure and cooler climate.
Wyoming Energy Authority Executive Director Rob Creager told Inside Climate News that the state needs to keep up with the world’s growing demand for AI. Creager said that the AI platform ChatGPT will eventually become as mainstream as a Google search.
“I’ve heard it as an arms race before,” Creager said. “We can’t lose track of the fact that we’re in a competition with folk in China. It is really crucial to national security that we lead on AI and that we have those technologies.” 
But Johanna Fornberg, a senior researcher at Greenpeace USA, has urged local and state governments to rein in huge AI investments. Legislators should instead focus on what directly benefits people’s lives, such as transitioning to renewable energy, Fornberg said.
“The industry has been using a lot of these big hypothetical promises about the benefits of AI,” Fornberg said. “They’re selling it for health care and curing cancer, accelerating climate action, improving well-being, even in your day-to-day life and in your job. And that’s all sort of a tactic to create demand and support for the data center buildout that’s happening.” 
Fornberg noted that the Crusoe and Tallgrass project, which will use “an unprecedented amount of power in a relatively short amount of time,” is an example of charging ahead without fully investigating the potential risks involved.
“This data center, at 10 gigawatts, is huge,” Fornberg said. “I mean, a large nuclear power plant provides about 1 gigawatt of energy. So, at the top end, we’re talking about the same energy output as 10 big nuclear power plants, which is a lot.”
AI’s opportunities and challenges for Wyoming energy 
Wyoming’s energy resources position the state to capitalize on AI, Creager said. 
“Everybody knows that there is plenty sitting in the ground that can help fuel this,” Creager said, noting that Crusoe’s plan to augment its electricity supply with solar should bring down the demand for gas. “I think it’s doable. I think as we do this … we’ll figure out how to do it more efficiently.”
Some AI data centers, including Microsoft’s facility in Cheyenne, power their servers with a mix of fossil fuels and renewable energy, and learning how to power and manage data centers efficiently is a work in progress, Creager said. 
Neither Crusoe nor Tallgrass made representatives available for comment, but Crusoe’s website stated that the center would source energy from natural gas rigs outfitted with carbon capture and sequestration technology to limit their emissions of climate-warming gases. 
But Fornberg believes using carbon capture and sequestration for data center energy generation is counterproductive.
“Carbon capture is sort of one of these techno solutions that is very energy intensive, expensive and often just increases net emissions and pollution overall,” she said. “Especially when compared to just replacing those energy sources with clean energy sources. It’s a way that we are really providing a longer lifespan for existing fossil fuel infrastructure. And in some cases, even justifying new fossil fuels.”
An August analysis from Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that about 60% of the increasing electricity demands from U.S. data centers will be met by burning fossil fuels, increasing carbon emissions through 2030 by approximately 220 million tons. Those increased emissions could also impact human health, Fornberg added. 
“Part of the nature of working with gas as an energy source is that you have these leaks and in some cases, intentional flares or releases of gas,” Fornberg said. “That is a major climate impact but can also cause well-documented health impacts for the communities that live locally to those gas generation facilities.” 
Crusoe and Tallgrass have yet to state the amount of solar power that will be paired with natural gas or at what stage in the project solar power would be included in the energy mix.
Thirsty technology in a water-stressed state
A single data center’s cooling towers can consume millions of gallons of water annually to prevent the computing infrastructure from overheating, according to Veolia Water Technologies & Solutions, which is particularly problematic for a facility as large as Project Jade in an arid state like Wyoming. 
To reduce that demand, Crusoe announced plans in its 2024 Impact Report to combat significant water loss at its data centers by implementing closed-loop cooling systems that recycle treated water and treatment fluids.
Still, there are always system losses, said Jonathan Brant, a University of Wyoming environmental engineering professor. 
“Even if it’s a quote-unquote closed loop, you’re going to have losses because of the nature of heat exchange,” Brant said. “Those computers generate an incredible amount of heat.”
To remove the most heat from computers, water must transform from a liquid into a vapor, Brant explained, and a portion of that evaporates, much like the billowing clouds that rise from the cooling towers at power plants. How much new freshwater will be needed to replace what evaporates from the cooling system is a critical question, he said. 
“It’s scary when you think about the power and the water that’s going to be consumed by these facilities,” Brant said. “That’s why they keep it secret.”
Many AI centers in Wyoming tap into brackish or alkaline groundwater, as opposed to using freshwater, Brant said, but even if the cooling water is sourced from an aquifer with water of too low quality for other uses, it could potentially impact a connected aquifer with a potable supply, so industry engineers must study how aquifers are connected before tapping into them. And safely disposing of increasingly salty water after it has undergone many cycles of heat exchange also poses a challenge, Brant said. 
“Some say they’re going to reinject it, like they do in the oil and gas field,” Brant said. “That may work. But if that’s not something that can be done, are they just going to use surface impoundments? Evaporation ponds can be an environmental hazard just like they are in the gas sector.”
If wastewater is expelled during the cooling process, it could be contaminated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals. PFAS are used to prevent the corrosion of AI electronics, which would pose other health concerns, Fornberg cautioned. Studies have linked long-term exposure to even low levels of some PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals” for their persistence in the environment, with serious health problems, including cancer and damage to reproductive and immune systems.
A lack of regulation
During the hearing to review the Jade project’s site plan, several Laramie County residents voiced concerns about the lack of water regulations.
The plan states that engineers plan to drill deep wells underneath the shale and sandstone Lance Formation to access industrial water beneath the Ogallala Aquifer’s potable water. But Randy Fox, president of Hyndman Homesites Homeowners Association, questioned whether the geologic survey of the region that will guide the drilling of the wells adequately maps the varying size and depth of the aquifer to protect the drinking-water supply.

“You don’t know until you punch a hole in it what you’re dealing with,” Fox said. “Does the state have the data to support drilling deep wells into the Lance Formation without compromising the Ogallala Formation’s [drinking water] above it?”
Resident Thomas White, who lives near the site of the Jade data center, is also concerned about water contamination. 
“They say that they’re going to drill deeper,” White said. “What happens when they punch a hole and there’s leaks that contaminate the aquifer? How much water will they be taking out of the ground? We have to take that into consideration.”
In November, the Wyoming Outdoor Council released a white paper about data center policy in Wyoming that recommends regulations for permitting, site selection and community assistance. 
Among them: mandating public energy and water use reporting “to allow regulators and communities to assess impacts of data centers and track progress toward efficiency or sustainability goals.” The report pointed to Illinois’ Data Center Energy and Water Reporting Act as a regulatory guide.
Wyoming has yet to establish laws to track the environmental and economic impacts of AI centers, and state legislators are not expected to discuss the growth of the industry during the upcoming budget session in February. 
In December, Greenpeace USA, along with over 230 environmental groups, signed an open letter to Congress demanding a national moratorium on new data-center construction until regulations address environmental and economic concerns. State and local governments, which negotiate deals with data developers, need comprehensive rules, Fornberg said—protecting consumers from utility rate hikes, requiring renewable energy and more.
“There has to be strong regulations in place in order for these companies to do the right thing,” Fornberg said. “I think the issue is not whether or not we should value innovation, it’s how we are valuing innovation.”

Punishing UW, gutting Wyoming Business Council are mistakes by power hungry budget-cutters, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Wyoming lawmakers give young people more reasons to leave appeared first on WyoFile .","When my family moved to Wyoming in 1969, folks told me most young people were destined to leave this rural state. Self-deportation was often chalked up to wanderlust, but many of my friends bolted because of the lack of job opportunities after high school and college.

Opinion

I’ve watched generations of state lawmakers tearfully lament the loss of our “best and brightest” and “our future,” yet they never find ways to stem the tide. Many don’t even try. Our current crop of legislative leaders in Cheyenne — many who came from out of state — seem hell-bent on finding new ways to make Wyoming a less attractive place to live and raise a family.
What other conclusion should we reach after the Joint Appropriations Committee last week turned in a budget that punishes both higher education and efforts to recruit and retain businesses? It was loonier than any Mad Hatter’s tea party.
I can’t imagine that most Wyomingites agree with the committee’s short-sighted goal to cut budgets at all costs. A state can be fiscally conservative without making the kind of reckless, nonsensical moves that’s become our Legislature’s trademark.
There are many reasons to be proud of the University of Wyoming, which has developed a unique culture over the past 140 years as the state’s only public four-year university. But the Legislature’s budget cuts to UW show a pattern of punishing the institution for its failure to conform to lawmakers’ values.
In recent years, some lawmakers have focused on gutting the UW Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, shutting down gender studies programs and ensuring that students can’t get a state-funded abortion. They spent more time debating those issues than funding academic programs.
Last week, the Joint Appropriations Committee gave us a downright chilling preview of UW’s future. Put on a coat and take a look:
The panel slashed $40 million from UW’s block grant without even bothering to make a case for why the drastic cut was necessary. It made $21 million in other cuts to targeted programs, for a total budget reduction of nearly 13%.
Among the casualties: 

Wyoming Public Media, which saw all of its $1.69 million allocation for public radio removed from UW’s block grant.
The athletic department’s $6 million request aimed at  better compensating student athletes for their name, image and likeness, commonly known as NIL, which was made necessary by a landmark NCAA settlement in 2025.
A $285,783 request to hire a physician assistant at UW’s family medical residency program in Casper. 
The denial of $450,000 from UW’s $4.5 million request for its critical minerals institute.

Adding insult to injury, the committee also nixed UW’s request for $12.5 million to obtain matching donations or grants that potentially could have made up some of these losses.
The cuts to Wyoming Public Media and the athletics department are particularly egregious decisions that strike at the heart of what unites the people of Wyoming. Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, a far-right Freedom Caucus member who also brought the $40 million block grant reduction to the committee, made both motions.

Wyoming Public Media ramped up its fundraising efforts to deal with a $500,000 cut after Congress defunded the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. But if it stands, this state cut would result in eight employees losing their jobs and reduce the news reporting and local programs the station provides its statewide audience.
The athletic budget cut has sparked renewed speculation that UW might leave the NCAA’s Division 1 for inferior but less costly competition. UW sports boosters have weathered such calls from within the university and the Legislature for years, but the inability to raise NIL budgets without state assistance could be the tipping point. 
If it happens, UW’s fan base will never recover, and many donors to athletic and academic programs will disappear. Playing colleges in Montana and South Dakota can’t remotely match fans’ excitement when UW is in a football bowl game or national basketball tournament with top-notch competition.
The budget-cutters have already given Wyoming’s young adults more reasons to shun UW and look at universities beyond our borders. What about the Legislature’s failure to deliver on calls for economic diversification and higher-paying jobs?
Sen. Dan Laursen, R-Powell, led the effort to dismantle the Wyoming Business Council, proposing to reassign some of its work to agencies that haven’t even been notified and completely shut down programs like Main Street and the Small Business Investment Credit.
Why? Let’s hear Pendergraft’s explanation.
“The concept, the underlying idea behind this, is to get government out of the way and allow businesses to find their own way and work for themselves, to survive on their own,” Pendergraft said.
I agree that parts of government should get out of the way, specifically legislators who don’t believe that government should have anything to do with how the state can assist businesses and grow the economy by adding jobs and infrastructure that help communities thrive. 
Yes, if businesses somehow do find a reason to come to Wyoming, I guess they can just fend for themselves. Why care if they survive?

Randall Luthi, Gov. Mark Gordon’s policy director and a former GOP speaker of the House, had an appropriate response to the committee’s work: “This is nuts. This is crazy.”
Sen. Ogden Driskill, R-Devils Tower, former Senate president, told his colleagues that if Wyoming wants a tax base it must want businesses to come here.
“We’re doing just the opposite,” Driskill said. “We’ve openly come out and said we’re anti-wind, anti-solar, anti-carbon capture, anti-this, anti-that. Name me, around this table, what you’re for — and how do you want taxes paid in Wyoming?”
When I was a kid, I planned to leave Wyoming as soon as I could. I don’t regret my decision to stay because I grew to love this state. It’s been a good home.
But as a senior, I look at how lawmakers punish the university, push to decimate the Business Council and do virtually nothing to solve monumental problems like lack of access to quality health care and our unaffordable housing statewide, and I can’t honestly say I’d recommend my decision to any young person today.
What I would say to them is, “Will you please stay and run for the Legislature and get these dangerous people out of office before they do more damage?” Because that’s really our best hope.

He says lawmakers failed to heed his myriad recommendations. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)In almost six years as New Jersey’s acting comptroller, Kevin Walsh has issued more than 100 reports and audits revealing public fraud, waste, and abuse that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.
In each, he handed lawmakers evidence of corruption and a roadmap for reform, listing recommendations that typically require legislative action. But legislators too often ignored his recommendations and sometimes even acted to undermine his work, Walsh said.
Now, as he prepares to hand off the job to successor Shirley Emehelu — tapped by Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, who takes office Tuesday — Walsh listed that failure as among his biggest takeaways from his time as a state watchdog.
“I’m really struck by how much corruption there is and how much acquiescence there is around it,” Walsh said.
Paid family leave expands to more workers under new law

Among his allegations were that politically connected insurance brokers profited from public health plans and nursing home operators stole public funds through illicit Medicaid schemes. His recommendations on both issues went unheeded, he said.
Nursing home fraud, especially, has been well-documented for years, by his office and others. Yet policymakers enacted only “performative reform” or failed to crack down on it while continuing to give billions in public funds to operators, Walsh said.
“We’ve gone backwards in nursing homes despite the evidence showing the depth of the problem,” he said. “I do know that the Legislature has done things that have made the problem worse, and I do know that they have ignored every single recommendation that I have made in report after report that shows the degree of fraud, waste, and abuse in nursing homes.”
He pointed to a 2021 report, in which his investigators discovered state Treasury officials had a yearslong backlog of hundreds of cases of suspected pension fraud to investigate. Walsh recommended lawmakers give Treasury’s pension fraud and abuse unit subpoena power to compel the compliance of defiant local governments. That’s a bill Assemblyman Erik Peterson (R-Hunterdon) has introduced eight times since 2010, but it has never moved.
“That’s been a big focus of Governor Murphy and of the Legislature — strengthening our pension systems. So why are we tolerating that?” Walsh said. “There’s a backlog of hundreds of people for over a decade who have been flagged as requiring an investigation, but they’re being blocked because they don’t have subpoena power. Why would the Legislature not do something? It’s inexcusable.”
Spokespeople for Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) did not respond to a request for comment.

John Donnadio, executive director of the New Jersey Association of Counties, suspects legislative inaction arose, in part, from concerns about Walsh’s methods. Donnadio said the county officials he represents were frequently frustrated by Walsh’s “salacious” reports and his failure to include in them the full responses of his targets.
“He was just an overzealous bureaucrat who injected his own opinion in legal matters that many times were disputed,” Donnadio said. “There should be some type of final arbiter before he tries these cases in the press without any due process.”
Walsh’s legacy, he added, “is that there should be some type of check and balance on giving someone that much power to say and do whatever they want.”
Donnadio’s association in 2024 urged legislative leaders to investigate Walsh’s office. That never happened, although Scutari recently tried to strip Walsh’s office of its investigatory powers before backpedaling after backlash from critics.
State senators aligned with South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross — whose allies have been targets of Walsh’s investigations — blocked Walsh’s confirmation, leaving him as acting comptroller for his entire time in office.
Walsh noted that much of the criticism has been lobbed by people he’s investigated.
“I welcome criticism. I don’t mind people saying what they have to say. It’s a good, healthy part of government, oversight, and democracy. But when that criticism comes in, especially when it is over-the-top, I see it for what it is — bluster that is intended to distract and discomfort with accountability,” he said.
Walsh added that, given how many policymakers say they want to make New Jersey more affordable, cracking down on fraud, waste, and abuse can achieve that “if we figure out the politics of it.”
“There is a playbook for the Sherrill administration in our reports and for legislators who care about affordability, especially at the local level, but also within Medicaid, about how one can protect taxpayer funds and get a more efficient government,” Walsh said.
Walsh praised Emehelu, a former federal prosecutor and ex-state executive assistant attorney general, as someone with “a great set of experiences that she’d bring to the job.”
“My sense is that the office is in great shape, and I’m looking forward to handing it off,” he said.
Walsh, a civil rights attorney who once headed the Fair Share Housing Center, considers a police accountability project he launched in 2022 to be among his more notable accomplishments. His office has exposed problematic police training, abuse of police courtesy cards, oversight lapses of police pensions, and other problems, and it annually reviews the performance of the state police.
“Reform without oversight is much less likely to be effective reform,” Walsh said. “So I’m really proud of our work in the area of police accountability, because it is work that helps policymakers and residents evaluate whether we are keeping our commitments on police reform.”
He expects he’ll continue to work in the public’s interest, and said he has ruled out a run for office (the comptroller is barred by state statute from seeking elected office for two years, though Walsh was never confirmed to the position).
“I have developed new skills in doing this work, so some combination of things for me is what I’m aiming to do,” he said. “But I have intentionally avoided engaging that just so that I could focus on this job all the way.”

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s public records watchdog is raising questions about a Republican-backed bill that would conceal the names of all law enforcement officers involved in immigration enforcement.
The Tennessee Coalition for Open Government put Senate Bill 1464 sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson at the top of its list for problematic bills this session.
“Changes need to be made in this bill. Secrecy can protect bad actors,” said Deborah Fisher, executive director of the coalition, in a release. “If identities must be confidential to protect a particular officer or official, it should be for a limited amount of time and based on real and documented threats.”
Johnson, a Franklin Republican spearheading the state’s efforts to remove undocumented immigrants, told the Lookout he’s willing to work with the Coalition for Open Government to avoid interfering with public records on law enforcement activities normally available to the public. 
Deborah Fisher with the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government says a bill to protect the identity of law enforcement officers engaging in immigration enforcement sacrifices public transparency. (Photo: submitted)
“But going out of your way to doxx or provide personal information about ICE officers with the intention of harassment or something for them and their families, that’s what we’re not going to tolerate,” Johnson said.
Johnson filed the bill in June 2025 after Metro Nashville listed the identities of some Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on its web site following a federal and state operation to round up immigrants without legal documentation in South Nashville. 
Metro Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell said the names listed inadvertently and were removed. But he still drew criticism from Republican lawmakers who are now focusing on Nashville with this measure.
Fisher said the bill also could require redaction of officers’ names from arrest affidavits, court filings and judicial records, giving “blanket” protection to state, local and federal officers who take part in immigration enforcement.
The bill contains no end date for the length of time that identities would remain confidential or a mechanism to make identities public even when it’s important for public oversight, Fisher said.
“The bill prioritizes safety of officers by redacting their names from records, but it sacrifices transparency,” Fisher said in the statement. She noted that it is possible to protect law enforcement officers without secrecy.
Republicans also introduced a separate package of bills last week designed to target undocumented immigrants statewide, mainly by requiring local and state governments to keep track of people’s immigration status.

Pete Ricketts touted provisions from Trump's tax and spending bill, hoping to be rewarded by Nebraska voters for it.","Nebraska U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts during his campaign event in Omaha on Jan. 16, 2026. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Nebraska Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts set up shop in the state’s most populous city as he faces his first real test as a Senate incumbent. 
Ricketts spoke to a crowd of 50 at the opening of his Omaha campaign office last week. He touched on similar notes to his previous campaign speeches, from “conservative leadership matters” to “conservative leadership delivers.” 
“We’re going to raise a bunch of money,” Ricketts told the crowd. “We’re going to spend a bunch of money … We’re going to be out there on TV talking about what we’re doing as Senate Republicans.” 
The former governor is in a heated campaign against former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn. The race has drawn national attention as Osborn hopes to build on his 2024 bid against U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., who beat him by 6 percentage points in a state where Republicans outnumber Democrats roughly 2 to 1 and nonpartisans make up a growing share of the electorate.

Ricketts touted President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” which Ricketts now calls the “working families tax cut.” The rebrand comes from the White House. He pointed to temporary provisions offering “no tax on tips” and “no tax on overtime” as examples of the Senate GOP “trying to put more money back” in people’s pockets after high inflation from the Biden administration.

The tax and spending law made most tax cuts from the first Trump administration permanent, cementing most of its benefits for higher earners. Its new work requirements for Medicaid and other social safety net programs are meant to offset the costs of the tax cuts and other funding for Trump’s domestic agenda.
Osborn has said the Trump tax and spending bill overwhelmingly benefits the wealthy “off the backs of people.” Osborn says he is campaigning on what the law actually does. He says it hurts working people.
Ricketts, like other Republicans facing reelection this year, is banking on changing public perception of the law. State and national Republican strategists are emphasizing specific provisions ahead of this year’s midterm elections. 
Ricketts highlighted a recent trip to the border in Texas. He was on in a group of GOP U.S. senators who visited the Rio Grande Valley to praise Trump’s border policies ahead of November’s midterm elections, according to the Texas Tribune. 
As he has for the past year, Ricketts painted Osborn, a registered nonpartisan, as secretly a Democrat. He describes Osborn’s nonpartisan approach as “fake.” 
Osborn and his team have laughed off the critics’ attempts, describing them as “comical.” Osborn has said he wants his campaign to connect with people who’ve given up on politics and who think the system wasn’t built for them.
Ricketts plans several campaign events this week with the Senate out for recess. The general election in the Senate race is Nov. 3.

(Photo: Getty Images)Tennessee construction companies are feeling the impact of the Trump administration immigration crackdown as workers failed to show up at job sites due to fears of enforcement activity, according to a survey by the Associated General Contractors of America.
The survey of all 50 states included responses from 22 commercial construction firms and contractors in Tennessee. Nearly a third of those surveyed reported annual revenues between $50 and $500 million; the majority were mid-sized firms, employing between 20 and 100 workers.
Over the past six months, 9% of Tennessee construction companies surveyed reported a jobsite was visited by immigration agents; 18% reported that workers failed to appear at work or left job sites “because of actual or rumored immigration actions”; and 32% reported their subcontractors had lost workers as a result of immigration enforcement actions.
Nearly one in four companies said they had adjusted project schedules or scopes due to labor or material shortages linked to immigration enforcement and other Trump policy changes.
A majority of companies listed economic worries as their biggest concerns for 2026, including fears of an economic slowdown or recession and the rising costs of labor and materials. 
The concerns of Tennessee businesses were echoed in other states.
“One reason for their lowered expectations is that contractors are increasingly worried about the broader economy, the possibility of a recession, and the outlook for materials costs amid ongoing uncertainty around tariffs and trade policy,” the survey concluded. “At the same time, many firms remain concerned about persistent labor shortages and also report plans to boost investments in artificial intelligence to improve efficiency.”

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The 2026 election cycle marks the first time a new Republican Party of Arkansas rule prohibiting registered Democrats from voting in GOP primary races will be enforced. 
The new rule has an impact in a state where Republicans hold every statewide partisan office, every seat in the congressional delegation and a majority in both chambers of the Legislature. 
This spring’s primary election features contested Republican primaries for several races, including U.S. Senate, secretary of state and some high-profile state legislative seats. The primary election is March 3 and the general election is Nov. 3.
Here’s what to know about the rule change: 
Who can participate in primary elections?
Arkansas’ preferential primary elections have been open, meaning voters can choose if they want to vote a ballot with Republican candidates or one with Democrat candidates, regardless of the voters’ registered party affiliation. 
That changed when the Republican Party of Arkansas voted at its state committee meeting in June to approve a new rule that prohibits registered Democrats from voting in Republican primaries. 
What does the new GOP rule say?
“Qualified electors shall NOT be a registered Democrat before being issued a Republican primary ballot to vote in a Republican party primary election,” according to the updated party rules.
Republican Party of Arkansas Chairman Joseph Wood said the purpose of the rule is to prevent voters registered as Democrats from participating in Republican primary elections.
Who suggested the rule?
Republican Sen. Joshua Bryant of Rogers presented the rule. Having experienced open and closed primaries living in different states, Bryant said he can see both sides and didn’t really have a stance on the issue. However, he suggested the rule in response to some “endfighting” in the party over closing primaries. 
Proponents of closed primaries are often concerned about voters changing their party affiliation to sway the results of the opposing party’s race, which could happen in races decided by a handful of votes, Bryant said. 
The GOP’s new rule makes the party’s primaries “semi-closed,” he said, because there are still ways for voters who aren’t registered Republicans to vote in Republican primaries.
“If you are convicted in your policy beliefs to be a registered Democrat, then stay as a registered Democrat, don’t vote in Republican primaries,” Bryant said. “Otherwise remove your registration to Optional or Republican or Libertarian and then come on over.” 
However, Bryant said the Democrat and Republican platforms are different enough that if someone wants to “wear that banner” as a registered Democrat, they should “just stay in your lane.”
Do Democrats have the same rule?
Democrat primaries remain open, and anyone can participate, Democratic Party of Arkansas Communications Director Micah Wallace said. 
“Any voters that wish to participate in the Democratic primary are welcome to do so,” Wallace said. “We didn’t close our primary because there’s no reason to. We want to invite more voters to participate in the Democratic primary.”
Wallace said the new Republican primary rule makes voting appear more inaccessible in a state that already has low voter participation. 
“While this does virtue-signal how exclusive and cliqueish the Arkansas GOP is, it doesn’t actually prevent many Democrats from participating in the Republican primary if they are determined to do so,” she said.
Do I have to pick a party?
Arkansans are not required to select a party affiliation when they register to vote. Arkansas voters can register as an Independent (Party Optional). Independents can choose whether they want to vote in Republican or Democrat primaries. Or they can choose to vote only in the non-partisan judicial elections March 3. 
Nearly 87% of registered voters have their party listed as Optional, according to the secretary of state’s office. 
Can I switch party affiliations?
Yes. You can change your party affiliation prior to the election by contacting your local county clerk or at the polls on Election Day. 
Chris Powell, the secretary of state’s director of public affairs, said his office doesn’t see a lot of voters switch party affiliations around election time, and they have not noticed an unusual number of changes ahead of the March primary.
What happens if there’s a runoff in the primary?
If you choose to vote in a Republican primary election, you can’t vote in a Democrat primary runoff, and vice versa. There’s no “crossover voting” between a primary and a runoff, Powell said.
Who’s eligible to vote in the March 3 primary?
Arkansans must be registered to vote by Feb. 2 to be eligible to cast a ballot in the March 3 preferential primary election and the nonpartisan judicial election. State law requires you to present a photo ID to vote. 
Details about how to register to vote are available on the secretary of state’s website.

(Photo courtesy of the Idaho Community Foundation)One thing seems certain about this year’s legislative session. With a daunting budget shortfall lying before them, it’s a good bet that trimming budgets will be high on the lawmakers’ “do” list.
That means saying “no” to a lot of heart-wrenching causes in state government and, perhaps, to nonprofits as well. Kevin Bailey, who heads the Idaho Community Foundation’s Nonprofit Center, is well aware of the challenges and lends a sympathetic eye to legislators who have to make hard decisions.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little wants more Medicaid cuts, but not to repeal expansion

“It’s a difficult job,” he says. “There will be around 700 bills introduced, along with dozens and dozens of special interests making requests.”
The community foundation is one of the groups with a “policy agenda” for this session, but it’s one than legislators might be receptive to in this cost-cutting environment. Nonprofits receive almost no general fund dollars.
 “It’s largely maintaining appropriations for grants that are paid with federal dollars, such as Meals on Wheels for seniors,” Bailey says. 
The center’s wish list includes maintaining property tax exemptions for nonprofits, supporting appropriations that enhance nonprofits’ ability to provide essential community services and keeping the federal and state tax codes friendly toward charitable giving. The agenda also backs initiatives that promote increasing the supply “of high-quality affordable child care, policies that allow for innovative/pooled employee benefit solutions, and policies that ensure a stable and affordable health insurance market for employers, which affects all businesses (nonprofit and for-profit alike).”
Bailey says that Idaho legislators generally are supportive of nonprofits, and for good reason. “Idaho runs on nonprofits,” he says.
He makes a good point. Something I have learned in my 10 months writing about nonprofits is that this state is full of good people doing good things – with minimal, if any, help from the government. And this is what Bailey sees every day in his job.
“I think about it from the aspect of my own family life,” Bailey says. “Nonprofits are places of worship, after-school programs, child care, places we send our kids for summer camps, the Discovery Center, the performances we see at the Morrison Center. Nonprofits are like oxygen … we take them for granted, but people will notice if you take them away and our communities will die off.”
For conservative-minded legislators, nonprofits help keep government small by providing social services that substantially are not paid by taxpayer dollars.
“Nonprofits are a good deal for the taxpayer because in many ways, they save the state from having to create its own programs,” Bailey says. “Not all nonprofits are perfect, certainly there are exceptions, but nonprofits are local, generally small and are well managed. Almost all have 10 to 25 board members who make decisions about the community and organizations that they shepherd. If that’s not democracy in action, then I don’t know what is.”
As with other groups, Bailey says, there are advocates at the Statehouse lobbying for the center’s policy agenda and other issues of interest to nonprofits. As Bailey sees it, there’s a critical need for having that presence.
“Nonprofits should be at the table when it comes to public policy,” he says. “If you are not at the table, then you’re on the menu.”

Michael Bennet are raising campaign funds at a roughly equal clip in their head-to-head contest for the Democratic nomination for Colorado governor, but a billionaire-funded group backing Bennet is amassing a cash advantage as the primary election heats up.
Weiser, who launched his campaign on Jan. 2 last year, raised a total of over $4.6 million over the course of 2025, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the secretary of state’s office last week.
After entering the race on April 10, Bennet raised about $3.5 million, about three-quarters of Weiser’s total, in the last three quarters of the year.

Both candidates said their fundraising numbers demonstrated strong grassroots support, including from small-dollar donors. Colorado’s campaign finance laws limit direct campaign contributions to $725 per individual, and corporate contributions are prohibited.
“Michael is running for Governor to protect Colorado from Donald Trump’s chaos and deliver a stronger, more affordable future for our state — and his robust grassroots support shows that Coloradans are behind him,” Nellie Moran, Bennet’s campaign manager, said in a statement.
Weiser’s campaign highlighted its $3.4 million in cash on hand at the beginning of 2026 — more than double the Bennet campaign’s figure of just under $1.6 million.
But Bennet stands to benefit from millions in spending by an independent expenditure committee, better known as a super PAC, that is supporting his campaign. Super PACs can raise unlimited sums of money from individuals, corporations and nonprofits, but they are barred from coordinating directly with candidates.
Rocky Mountain Way, the super PAC supporting Bennet, has raised over $3.3 million from 82 donors who have contributed an average of nearly $44,000 each. The group’s top donors, accounting for half of its total receipts, are former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Brighter Future for Colorado, a so-called dark money nonprofit that does not disclose its donors.
“We don’t have out-of-state billionaires behind us,” Weiser said in a press release. “We have the people of Colorado powering our campaign and responding to our commitment to fight for Colorado and to always show up, listen, and deliver results.”
Weiser also has super PAC support from the group Fighting For Colorado, which has raised $562,651 since it was registered in August 2025. Seventy-one donors have contributed an average of $7,947. Its top donors — Jason Mendelson, Tom Ray, Arthur Reimers and Jim Kelley — are all venture capitalists or private equity investors who have contributed $50,000 each.
Weiser, a former law professor, is serving his second term as attorney general after he was first elected in 2018.
Bennet is a former Denver Public Schools superintendent who was appointed to the Senate by Gov. Bill Ritter in 2009. He ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020 before winning reelection to a third full term in 2022.
The winner of the primary between Weiser and Bennet will be heavily favored to win the general election in November. Coloradans have elected only one Republican governor in the last 50 years. Democrats have won every statewide election held in the last eight years by an average of more than 10 percentage points, and are widely expected to gain ground in a favorable midterm election year.
Democratic Gov. Jared Polis is term-limited. The primary election is June 30.

Patrick Morrisey is asking lawmakers to increase funding for the federal food assistance program SNAP by $13.5 million. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Patrick Morrisey is asking lawmakers to increase funding for the federal food assistance program SNAP by $13.5 million in fiscal year 2027 to make up for changes brought about by federal legislation, state budget officials said this week.
Currently, the federal government pays 100% of SNAP benefits, and the state and the federal government evenly split the administrative costs of the program. 
Beginning Oct. 1, under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law July 4, 2025, states will take on 75% of the program’s administrative cost, while the federal government will cover 25% of those costs.
The $13.5 million increase would cover the state portion of the administrative costs for the first nine months of 2027, budget director Mike McKown told the Senate Finance Committee Thursday. It will cost $18 million to cover the state portion of the administrative costs for the entire year, he said. 
Lawmakers would have to approve the request. 
Generally, Morrisey has directed state agencies not to try to replace lost federal funding. McKown said of the $21 billion appropriated in the proposed budget bill, half are federal funds.
“West Virginia relies very heavily on federal funds. There is no way we could supplement or replace all those federal dollars if that ever happens,” he said. “There’s questions about how certain programs are going to be affected in future. It’s way too early to determine some of those, but we do have some answers on some of that.”
Each federal program will be looked at separately and some exceptions will be made, McKown said. 
Angel Hightower, a communications specialist for the state Department of Human Services, told West Virginia Watch that the administrative costs for SNAP include personnel, technology, operations, informing the public about SNAP and detecting fraud, and direct program support. 
About 275,000 West Virginia residents — or one in six — rely on SNAP, commonly referred to as food stamps. 
McKown said the state could also be on the hook to pay for some of the cost of SNAP benefits beginning in 2028 unless it decreases its SNAP payment error rate, a measure of accuracy of each state’s eligibility and benefit determination. 
The federal government currently pays the entire cost of SNAP benefits, which equal $565 million in West Virginia, McKown said. 
Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, beginning in 2028, states that have a SNAP error rate of more than 6% will be required to take on between 5 and 5% of the cost of SNAP benefits in their states, depending on how high their error rate is.  
For West Virginia, that would amount to approximately $28 million on the low end, and about $84 million at the highest, based on McKown’s estimate of the cost of SNAP benefits paid to West Virginians. 
In 2024, the latest numbers that are available, West Virginia had a SNAP error rate of 9.43%. In 2023, the error rate was 10.98%.
In 2024, only eight states had error rates below 6%. 
Hightower said the agency has developed a “multifaceted approach” to address the payment error rate. 
The plan includes enhanced local monitoring, increased quality control and targeted training. The plan also includes changing most SNAP cases with a 12-month reporting period to a 6-month period, which provides greater flexibility and coordination for the Department of Human Services, while reducing required paperwork for most SNAP households, Hightower said. 
Since the plan was implemented, the state’s payment error rate has decreased from 9.43% to 6.37% for fiscal year 2025, Hightower said. 
“This strategic rollout is designed to establish a continuous improvement loop, using weekly accountability reports and monthly timeliness data to track progress and enforce corrective actions across all local offices,” Hightower said. 
Caitlin Cook, director of advocacy and public policy for Mountaineer Food Bank, told West Virginia Watch she’s “delighted” the governor included the $13.5 million SNAP increase in his proposed budget. 
Without the additional funding, Cook said she’s concerned the agency may not be able to lower its payment error rate.
“By fully funding that additional administrative cost share that the state will be on the hook starting Oct. 1, that puts us in a better position to lower the error rate, and hopefully be below 6% so the state share of those whose benefits is zero,” she said.

Josh Stein's State of the State address on March 12, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)One supposes that it’s not an especially unusual phenomenon for politicians who ascend to power to do everything they can to cling to it. Between the ability to shape public policy and the trappings that come with inhabiting high office, political power is almost always an addictive drug that’s hard to kick. That said, it’s also one of the hallmarks and great strengths of American democracy that, for most of the last 250 years, politicians of all parties have accepted – usually honorably – the will of voters.
Tragically, however, this great tradition of honor and discipline was egregiously abandoned by Donald Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 election – an action that led directly to the infamous January 6, 2021, insurrection. And now, five years later, it’s clear that this new practice of, when necessary, taking every conceivable step to evade the will of the citizenry in order to cling to power, has become the new modus operandi of Trump’s party in North Carolina.
We, of course, should have seen this coming. That the fear of voter decisions and the willingness to subvert them had become a new Republican tactic of choice was first made blatantly obvious in 2013 when the GOP-dominated General Assembly began enacting election law changes (like the infamous Monster Voting Law) that went to extreme lengths to both suppress the vote of disfavored groups – most notably voters of color – and rig electoral outcomes through the use of  extreme partisan gerrymandering.
The practice continued in the weeks immediately following the 2016 election. That was the period during which the lame duck GOP-dominated General Assembly hastily convened to enact laws stripping the newly elected Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, of an array of basic powers long and logically attached to the office.
Never mind that voters chose Cooper with the eminently reasonable expectation that he would wield authority – like numerous important appointment powers — long and naturally associated with the role of a state’s chief executive. Ignoring the obvious will of voters, GOP legislators moved quickly to remove them, and in most instances, seize them for themselves.
And in recent years, sadly, this trend has only continued to metastasize and become even more ingrained.
See, for example, the ongoing effort to take gerrymandering to ever greater depths by, quite literally, rendering the results of almost all legislative elections foreordained and rigged to elect large Republican majorities. Late last year, the GOP took this practice to a new and truly preposterous level when, heeding the dictates of Dear Leader Trump, it further rigged the state’s congressional elections so that our deeply purple state will almost assuredly be represented by a U.S. House delegation of 11 Republicans and 3 Democrats.
And then of course, there was the almost laughably bizarre move to, in the aftermath of Democrat Josh Stein’s landslide victory in the 2024 election, seize even more gubernatorial power – like appointing the state Board of Elections – and hand it to, of all people, the state’s accountant (i.e. the auditor). It was move so blatant and utterly contemptuous of the will of voters that it left many observers to conclude that Republicans would have gladly handed the seized power over to whatever GOP office holder happened to be handy – the Labor Commissioner? Agriculture Commissioner? – if the new GOP auditor, Dave Boliek, hadn’t been so cynically ready and willing to play along.
But wait, there’s more. As NC Newsline’s Brandon Kingdollar reported on January 19, the governor’s office isn’t the only one from which Republicans have shown themselves more than willing to seize powers in contravention of the voters’ judgment. Newly elected Democratic Attorney General Jeff Jackson is also a target.
Despite ample evidence that Jackson has worked hard to approach the task in a nonpartisan manner guided by the letter of the law and the likelihood of demonstrable harm to our state, Republican legislators advanced legislation last year that would strip the AG’s office of one of its central and most important constitutional duties – to challenge unlawful presidential executive orders that harm the state. One GOP lawmaker even promised he and his colleagues would wreak vengeance and render Jackson’s office “a feckless, empty shell of a position that has no authority to do anything,” if he dared to contest their action. Try to imagine that such a move could have occurred if Dan Bishop were AG and Kamala Harris in the White House.
All these moves come on top of many years of repeated legislative microaggressions toward Democrats elected to Council of State offices like the Superintendent of Public Instruction and Secretary of State via budget cuts and other power grabs.
Will this trend continue in the New Year? It’s hard to imagine that it won’t. While gerrymandering and political power jockeying has always been a feature of American politics, the modern, Trumpified Republican Party has taken both phenomena to new and extreme levels never seen before in American history. The only question that remains at this point is how much longer voters will stand for the fear and contempt directed their way by politicians supposedly sworn to serve them.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0870-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 06:57:38.196710

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee electric vehicle owners — and those passing through the Volunteer state — could find themselves paying a little extra at public charging stations if state lawmakers approve a new bill meant to mirror a gas tax.
As introduced, the bill would institute a tax of $0.03 per kilowatt-hour on public charging stations. The tax would apply to DC fast chargers, which have a charging capacity of 20 kilowatts or more. Residential chargers and those with charging capacity of less than 20 kilowatts would be exempt.
This new tax would be in addition to annual extra vehicle registration fees that began in 2024: $200 for electric vehicle owners and $100 for hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle owners. Registration rates will rise to $274 per year for electric vehicles starting Jan. 1, 2027.
Sen. Page Walley, a Savannah Republican, introduced the bill. He said Tennessee levies a gas tax as a revenue source for maintaining roadways, and instituted the electric vehicle registration fee in 2024 to contribute to road maintenance, since electric vehicle owners do not pay gas tax.

“One of the shortcomings, though, we have discovered, is that all these tourists and folks traveling through our state who are using our roads, many of them obviously will pay the gas tax when they stop and refuel, but those that are using hybrids or EVs and are charging those at charging stations — let’s say, at Buc-ee’s or somewhere else — are not contributing anything to the maintenance of our roads,” Walley said.
But layering a new tax on top of the registration fee is punitive for EV drivers, according to Anne Blair, vice president of policy and freight at the Electrification Coalition, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization that promotes electric vehicle adoption.
“Even with just the registration fee that Tennessee EV drivers pay, that is already much more than what your typical gasoline driver pays in gas tax,” Blair said.
In Tennessee, gasoline-powered vehicle drivers pay 27.4 cents per gallon in tax. The amount of tax paid depends on a vehicle’s fuel efficiency and miles of travel, but generally ranges from $115 to $280, according to various estimates from the U.S. Department of Energy, The Sycamore Institute, and Drive Electric Tennessee.
Walley said his bill is modeled after the electric vehicle charging tax instituted in Kentucky.
A handful of states, including Kentucky, have both additional registration fees for electric vehicles and taxes on publicly available chargers. Kentucky passed legislation approving a $0.03 per kilowatt-hour tax on high-capacity charges in 2024, exempting lower-capacity chargers and free-to-use chargers at churches, libraries, parks and other places likely to have slower chargers.
Walley said he believes most EV owners in Tennessee charge their vehicles at home, or when they visit friends or family. 
“But folks that are traveling through typically are going to be using, as Kentucky has found, these more publicly accessible (chargers), so that’s the logic,” he said.
The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that among EV owners, about 80% of charging happens at home. 










We need funding for our roads, but we need to holistically think about what those opportunities are to change the collection mechanism that is not reliant or not tied to a fuel type … but rather the use of roads.


– Anne Blair, Electrification Coalition


Tennessee had 64,910 electric vehicles on the road as of September 2025, according to an Atlas Public Policy analysis of state registration data. 
In Montana, which has a $0.03 per kilowatt-hour tax, an EV driver with no access to a home charger would pay an estimated $120 per year (assuming they use 4,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and drive 12,000 miles annually), according to an Atlas Public Policy study released in September 2025. An EV driver with access to a home charger would pay closer to $24 in annual charging tax.
Electrification Coalition Policy Manager Skye Golann cautioned that a “large contingent” of people rely on public charging, including residents of multi-unit dwellings and rideshare drivers, who are disproportionately likely to drive electric vehicles due to cost savings compared to gas.
“It’s a broader group of drivers that are using those than people might think when they’re imagining just people coming through from out of state,” Golann said.
Blair said the Electrification Coalition is not completely opposed to fees for EV drivers, but “there should be some account for those EV drivers in the state that are needing to use the charger.”
Better yet, she said, the state and the nation could consider broad-scale changes to how governments pay for transportation infrastructure.
“We need funding for our roads, but we need to holistically think about what those opportunities are to change the collection mechanism that is not reliant or not tied to a fuel type … but rather the use of roads,” Blair said.

Patrick Morrisey gives his State of the State address in the West Virginia Capitol in Charleston, West Virginia, on Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026. (Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Gov. Patrick Morrisey gave his second State of the State address last week, and the speech failed to touch on some of the state’s biggest problems.
Many of West Virginians’ issues stem from poverty, yet Morrisey only mentioned a 3% raise for state employees. Why not raise the state minimum wage? The last time West Virginia saw an increase in the minimum wage was in 2015. The $8.75 an hour isn’t even half of the $19.43 living wage that a single person with no children needs to support themself.
West Virginia has the highest average utility bill in the nation, with residents paying about $42 more per month than they were last year. WTOV talked to Delaney Eddy, state coordinator for West Virginia 211, who said there’s been an increased demand for utility assistance.
Morrisey did acknowledge “significant increases in all forms of energy” prices for West Virginians, but didn’t share any plans on how West Virginia can control those costs.
Health care costs are increasing and people who rely on the Public Employee Insurance Agency or use the Affordable Care Act Marketplace to purchase insurance are particularly feeling the pain. Morrisey said that instead of a 14% increase in premium rates for PEIA users, this year they would only see a 3% increase, and that in order to fix PEIA the “Legislature will need to work with me on real reforms.” He gave no hint on what his ideas for reform were.
People who use the ACA Marketplace are seeing their premiums increase by 133%, because of expiring premium tax credits that Congress hasn’t renewed. West Virginians already have poor health; in 2021, the state per capita led the nation in deaths caused by cancer (184.7 deaths per 100,000), drug overdoses (90.9), diabetes (47.6) and kidney disease (25.8), according to mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
This won’t change if people can’t afford to go to the doctor. They’ll suffer, get worse, self medicate or die. When we already have such a severe drug problem, we can’t afford to let our people continue to self medicate.
West Virginia is losing more than $1 billion per year in Medicaid funding for its hospitals under cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The Rural Health Transformation Program will only provide the state $199 million for 2026 — and some of that money is going to go to salaries of temporary state employees. 
So what did Morrisey have to say about our health crisis? He talked about his Mountaineer Mile initiative, which encourages everyone to walk one mile a day, last year’s law to remove artificial food dyes from food — which is now being held up in court — and banning SNAP recipients from buying soda with their benefits. He also mentioned the reinstatement of the Presidential Fitness test, a way to make children hate gym class by making them feel bad for not being able to climb a rope.
Thousands of West Virginians don’t have access to clean drinking water, but there was no mention of a solution for that. At least Morrisey did ask lawmakers for $10 million to fund a flood preparation initiative. The state’s flood fund has been empty since its creation, and multiple devastating floods happen each year in the state.
There wasn’t a single mention of schools closing and consolidating.
According to the state Department of Education, at least five public schools closed in 2025, and 16 closed in 2024, up from nine in 2023 and five in 2022. 
Instead, Morrisey focused on the state’s school voucher program, the Hope Scholarship, which is expected to cost around $230 million. Morrisey said that the state has “built it into our baseline so that Hope funding is not dependent upon surpluses.” He also said the state is “pre-paying” all of next year’s Hope Scholarship “as a commitment to this policy.”
Some Republicans have raised concerns over the increased costs of the program, and House Democrats are expected to introduce bills to put guardrails on how the money can be spent. 
I will give Morrisey credit for addressing two issues — bridge infrastructure and literacy.
Morrisey said he wants to give $100 million to supplement road and bridge repair work. About 17% of the state’s bridges are in poor condition, about 56% are in fair condition, and only about 27% are in good condition. This money is desperately needed.
He also said the state will implement LETRS, a program that Mississippi used to go from being ranked at the bottom in public education to the top. In 2024, 75% of West Virginia’s fourth graders were not proficient in reading.
We’re only a week in, but hopefully soon we’ll get more details on how Morrisey hopes to tackle some of these issues.

There were balloons, a DJ playing uptempo music, a line of people waiting with plates at the buffet. A table was piled with boxes and wrapped gifts, including Nike sneakers, restaurant gift cards, and bottles of whiskey and tequila. 
And there was Olivia Detsavanh carrying her phone around the room so people could offer greetings to the two guests of honor who couldn’t be with the 100 or so people in attendance.
Olivia’s father, John Detsavanh, 52, and her uncle, Mike Detsavanh, 50, were calling from custody at the Wyatt Detention Facility, the maximum security federal detention center in Central Falls. They had been held at the Wyatt since Sept. 11 when ICE agents picked up the brothers separately in Providence. Olivia’s dad John was on his way to work; her uncle was driving Olivia’s younger sister to school. 
The gathering at the Brightridge Club was a fundraiser for the brothers. All the items on the table were prizes in a raffle to raise money for their legal advocacy and other expenses. At one point, the music stopped, and Olivia took the microphone. She described her father as a funny and generous man who is quick to offer help. Her uncle, Mike, she said, was “selfless, dependable and loyal.” 
Their detention had shattered her family, she said. Her younger sister will now have to finish high school and navigate life without two strong male figures. Her older sister canceled her upcoming wedding because her father wouldn’t be able to walk her down the aisle. Their grandmother, in ailing health, no longer had her son Mike to diligently take care of her.
“This fight is not over,” Olivia said. “We can’t give up on trying to get them, not only back home, but justice.”
But three weeks after the fundraiser, the brothers were deported to Laos, a country that they left as child refugees.

Lao community in shock
In the first year of the second Trump administration, the United States deported more than 100 people to Laos, the rural, mountainous Southeast Asian country where the U.S. conducted a “Secret War” from 1964 to 1973. During the entire four years President Joe Biden was in office, the number was just six, according to data from the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center in Washington, D.C.
In Rhode Island — which has been a settlement area for Southeast Asian refugees since the 1970s — at least six Rhode Island men of Lao descent were deported by immigration authorities in 2025. All of them arrived legally in the U.S. as children and were granted refugee status. All of them were subsequently convicted of crimes that led to removal orders. 
But those orders were never carried out for years, even decades. 
In the 1990s, the Detsavanh brothers pleaded guilty to felony charges for their part in a series of gang-related robberies of local restaurants as teenagers in Florida. They moved to Rhode Island after prison, started fresh, and settled into lives with regular check-ins with enforcement authorities. Neither has had a run-in with the criminal justice system since. During that time, John got married, had kids, and volunteered with PrYSM, a Providence  advocacy organization focused on the Southeast Asian community. Mike became a popular barber in Providence. All told, 29 years passed between their deportation orders and actual removal from the country in November.. 
The wave of recent deportations to Laos has left Rhode Island’s Southeast Asian community reeling. Supporters have held protests, and launched fundraisers. They have held campaigns to call and email ICE and elected officials to urge intervention in these cases. Family members of deportees — pressed unexpectedly into public positions of advocacy —  have participated in interviews, forums, and documentaries to try to raise awareness. 
“Everybody’s scared,” PrySYM Deportation Defense Director Theary Voeul told Rhode Island Current. “I get calls every day from folks that [ask], ‘Theary, is it safe for me to even go outside?’” 
It no longer mattered that these deported men had come to the United States as refugees from the most bombed country in the world per capita. And that the United States is the very country that dropped more than 2 million tons of bombs on Laos, more than were dropped on Germany and Japan combined during World War II.
And it no longer mattered that they had turned their lives around. The Detsavanh brothers had the longest stretch between their deportation orders and their removals among other recent Rhode Islanders deported to Laos. The others had remained in the U.S. between five months and 18 years since their ordered removal.

‘Ripped out from under them’
The deportations reflect what Providence-based immigration attorney Zachary Lyons calls a new “extreme enforcement posture” by the Trump administration. Previously, various factors, including limited ICE resources or a lack of a formal repatriation agreement between countries, might keep a person in the U.S. years after their ordered removal, Lyons says. (The U.S. still has no formal repatriation agreement with Laos, according to the Asian Law Caucus.) Now, people are being arrested in the streets, at work, or detained at check-in appointments with ICE they went to for years without incident.
Because those targeted had been here for so long, the impact of their removal has been more pronounced. The U.S. government has allowed them to remain and have children, go to school, perhaps marry or start a business. “Now all of that is being ripped out from under them…in an instant,” Lyons said.  
In May 2025, community members rallied at the Wyatt Detention Facility to call for the release of three Laotian men – Khek Choummala, Manoutham Phommachan and Vanhhatdy Souvannaxa – who had recently been detained. All had previous convictions for criminal charges, but had served their sentences. In each case, supporters launched fundraisers and petitions to try to stop their loved ones’ deportation. But all three were eventually deported.  
In response to questions about their cases, ICE spokesman Christopher Celozzi stated that the three men had “entered the United States lawfully; however, they violated the terms of their lawful admissions.” Phommachan’s charges included felony firearm possession and felony possession of a controlled substance. Souvannaxa had been convicted for knowingly receiving and possessing a pipe bomb and maliciously damaging by means of fire and explosive materials a building resulting in personal injury, both felonies. Celozzi confirmed all were deported on May 25, 2025. 
Rhode Island Current reached out to Souvannaxa and Phommachan, as well as their spouses, but received no response. In an August 2025 interview with Ocean State Media (formerly The Public’s Radio), Souvannaxa’s wife, Cassie, described her husband as “somebody who has already done their time, and they’re still treated like a criminal.” In a short documentary film released in October, Phommachan’s wife, Saroeur, described him as a “great husband” and “wonderful father.” Rhode Island Current was unable to contact Choummala or a representative.
‘Dropped into poverty’
Southeast Asian refugees landing in Rhode Island after the Vietnam War ended in 1975 primarily settled in Providence and Woonsocket. In 2022, the Rhode Island Laotian population was 2,890. New arrivals faced a long list of challenges, including separation from family members, memories of horrific violence, a new language and culture, and dramatically different climate.

Phaykham Phrachanhsiri, 46, grew up in Providence after his family arrived in Boston legally as refugees in 1981 when he was 2 years old and his sister Phayvanh was 5. Their father had fought against Communism in Laos during the Vietnam War. When the war ended and Communists took over the country, his dad was arrested and beaten and tortured in custody. 
Phaykham went by the nicknames “Ai” and “Eggroll.” His parents struggled with English and worked a lot, sometimes two jobs. His sister, Phayvanh Phrachanhsiri, who now works as an emergency department nurse in Houston, said she and her brother were essentially left to navigate this new country alone. 
“We were dropped into poverty,” she said. 
In 2005, in Texas, Ai Phrachanhsiri pleaded guilty to one federal charge of involving use of a phone in connection to a drug deal, as part of a broader sting related to the trafficking of ecstasy. He served two years of a 37-month sentence and was released from prison in late 2007. As part of his punishment, he was also ordered to be deported. The order was never carried out. 
Eighteen years passed between his ordered removal and his arrest and deportation by ICE in 2025. In that time, he moved back to Rhode Island and stayed out of trouble. He found work at various body shops in Rhode Island. He most recently worked at a West Warwick shop where he ran a concierge collision recovery program that handles pick-up and drop-off for the damaged car, rental car arrangements, and logistics coordination with insurance providers. 
On Aug. 18, ICE agents arrested Ai Phrachanhsiri at his job. He was deported in early November. 
“Ai is not just someone being deported,” read a testimonial on a GoFundMe campaign launched after his arrest. “He is a brother, a son, a friend, and a man with a heart of gold.” 
Phaykham ‘Ai’ Phrachanhsiri is shown with a striped bass he caught off East Greenwich in May 2024. (Facebook photo)
The GoFundMe campaign ended, and the page has since been taken down. 
When Phayvanh heard the news of her brother’s deportation, she said she couldn’t stop crying. Her brother had come to the U.S. legally, as a toddler. Now, he was “leaving America in shackles,” she said.
In a statement, ICE Boston spokesman James Covington acknowledged that Ai Phrachanhsiri entered the country legally, but violated the terms of his lawful admission. 
“Phaykham Phrachansiri is an illegal alien from Laos whose criminal history includes a conviction for using a communication facility during the commission of a drug trafficking crime,” Covington said.
In a phone interview Monday from Laos, Phrachanhsiri said he considers himself lucky to have an uncle and cousins in Laos who have helped him with the transition.
But his new life remains difficult. He has no citizenship and no driver’s license. He cannot read or write in the local language. He hasn’t yet landed a job. And he misses his family and friends in the U.S. An avid fisherman who loved to fish for striped bass and flounder off the coast of Rhode Island, he’s tried fishing in landlocked Laos but said it’s not the same.
“There’s no ocean over here,” he said. “It’s just all ponds.”
 Legislation aimed to offer special case exceptions
In recent years, members of Congress introduced legislation that would carve out deportation protections for certain Southeast Asian refugees, acknowledging the population’s unique experiences and their reasons for living in the U.S. 
Minnesota U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum introduced the “Hmong and Lao Refugee Deportation Prohibition Act of 2020,” which called for a six-year stoppage of deportations to Laos so that people with final orders of removal could have their cases reassessed. Two years later, California U.S. Rep. Alan Lowenthal introduced the “Southeast Asian Deportation Relief Act of 2022,” which aimed to establish limits on DHS’s authority to deport refugees from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia who arrived in the U.S. before 2008.
Neither bill passed. 
Quyen Dinh, the executive director of the Washington-based Southeast Asia Resource Action Center (SEARAC) recommends legal representation for Southeast Asian folks facing deportation. “The odds of success really increase,” she said. “But the legal field has been so inundated that it’s really hard to find an attorney, period.” 
Dinh calls the jump in deportations to Laos from the Biden administration to the first year of Trump’s second term an “exponential” and “astronomical” shift.
In Rhode Island, PrYSM has published a Google doc called the “Lao Deportation Toolkit: A Guide for Lao Individuals Facing Deportation,” outlining what to expect upon arrival in the country. It includes information about the state-run compound in Laos where U.S. deportees are held until securing a sponsor to officially enter the country, the sponsorship process, and warnings on how to avoid exploitation.
The toolkit links to Facebook groups for deportees and their families; shares a visitor’s guide to the country’s capital, Vientiane; and offers guidance on local access to transportation, housing, banking, and health care. One section advises that many employers in Laos are hesitant to hire people over the age of 40. “Many folks are finding jobs in the service industry,” the toolkit said. “Our advice is to look into getting certified as an English teacher.”
The document states it was developed “out of PrYSM’s experience in supporting Rhode Island community members as they’ve navigated detention, deportation, and resettlement in Laos.”

‘Prioritizing public safety’ vs. social justice concerns
The Department of Homeland Security says detentions and deportations during Trump’s second term are about keeping people safe. 
Asked to comment on the deportation of the Detsavanh brothers, Covington pointed to their convictions on three counts of armed robbery and noted that the felonies violated the terms of their admission as refugees. Mike’s deportation order was in 1995 and John’s in 1996.
John Detsavanh’s daughter, Olivia, says her father and uncle were wrongly convicted. 
In an interview posted to Instagram, she said as teens her father and uncle were “nerds” who were bullied and threatened into participation in the crimes for which they were convicted. When they were interrogated by the police, they weren’t offered the presence of a lawyer or parent, she said. 
In her view, there were three stages to the injustice her father and uncle endured at the hands of the United States. The first was the country’s military intervention in Laos that made them refugees in the first place. The second was what she believes was their wrongful conviction. The third is their detention and deportation by ICE.
Olivia described herself as normally private and reserved. But because her father and uncle would do anything for anybody, she feels compelled to do anything she can for them. 
“I had to speak out for at least my father and my uncle, since they don’t currently have a voice,” she said.

(Getty Images)Less than a year ago, the General Assembly created the Kentucky Film Leadership Council, giving it the responsibility of reviewing and approving taxpayer subsidies for projects filmed in the state. The film council held its first meeting in July.
The owner of the Lexington-based studio Wrigley Media, Misdee Wrigley Miller, was out front advocating for the council’s creation. In 2017, Wrigley Miller acquired a majority share of Post Time Productions, renamed it and transformed a former multiplex movie theater into a 50,000-square-foot production studio.
Wrigley Miller has been a generous campaign contributor, donating a total of $44,800 to various Kentucky political campaigns and legislative caucus committees since 2020. So, when it came time for Gov. Andy Beshear to appoint the film council’s new members, it should come as no surprise that she got the gig. 
One of the film council’s first actions was adopting bylaws that prescribe how it would conduct its business. A standard feature of an organization’s bylaws is a conflict-of-interest policy, which the film council included as part of theirs. 
The policy states that no member of the film council “shall have ownership in any firm … interested in a contract or agreement with the council.” Pretty strong stuff — negated, more or less, by the next provision requiring only that a member with a financial interest in a project being considered for subsidies disclose their interest and refrain from discussing or voting on the project’s application.
The film council’s meeting packets and minutes are posted online. Twenty-nine projects have been approved for financial awards since August. Of those, Wrigley Miller disclosed a financial interest in eight of the projects and left the room while they were being discussed and voted on. All eight were approved, qualifying for a total of $8,318,260 in subsidies. 
Another film council member, Jeremy Winton, the co-founder of the Kentucky Sound Stage in Owensboro, appears to be feeding from the same trough. In accordance with the bylaws, Winton has removed himself nine times from the council’s discussion of projects he was involved with.
I’d say this kind of thing happens all the time in Frankfort, but this is pretty brazen. The film council has only seven members. Three are state employees — political appointees working in the Beshear administration.  
To be clear, nothing about this is illegal. The General Assembly could have prohibited people who own production studios and are interested in qualifying for the incentives from serving on the film council but chose not to.

I have no doubt that a number of legislators will find it troubling that two board members are reaping substantial cash awards paid for by their constituents’ tax dollars. But the train has left the station.
The legislation’s sponsor, Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, would almost certainly fight against any changes aimed at putting a stop to this kind of thing going forward. And, as chair of the Senate Economic Development Committee, Wheeler controls which bills are heard in his committee.
The best thing taxpayers might hope for is greater scrutiny on new economic development incentives in the 2026 session. At a minimum, the General Assembly should slow down the process, allowing for more input and scrutiny of any proposal. 
The film council legislation could have been brought forward during the interim period and would’ve benefited from transparency and time. Unfortunately, legislators often want to keep the public from knowing too much about anything that would prove unpopular if it was vetted in the open.
Something else caught my eye while reviewing the projects approved by the film council. Paramount Pictures won approval for a film budgeted at $24 million, qualifying for a $7.8 million subsidy.  
The film council’s vision is “to make Kentucky a leading hub for innovative entertainment production.” Paramount’s film will be a good test to see if we can compete against states like Georgia and attract a project from a major studio.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Standing just outside the iron fencing surrounding Virginia’s Capitol in downtown Richmond on Monday, Alexandria resident Gerald Vandendries hoisted a semi-automatic rifle and scanned the crowd gathering for Lobby Day — an annual ritual for gun rights supporters that carried renewed urgency this year.
“We’re hoping to just kind of give Democrats a friendly reminder that this is our right,” Vandendries said. “Our Constitution very specifically says our rights shall not be infringed. They do not have the right in any way, shape or form to dictate to us, the civilian population, what we can or cannot own.”
Monday’s pro-Second Amendment rally, organized by the Virginia Citizens Defense League, drew nearly 1,000 people to the Bell Tower in Capitol Square. 
Attendance was noticeably higher than in recent years, reflecting concerns among gun owners as Democrats once again control both chambers of the General Assembly and the governor’s office — a political alignment many supporters said felt familiar.
In early 2020, when Democrats  gained unified control of state government for the first time in more than two decades, lawmakers enacted sweeping changes to Virginia’s gun laws, including universal background checks, a one-handgun-a-month purchasing limit and a red-flag law allowing courts to temporarily remove firearms from people deemed a danger. 
The legislation, signed into law by then-Gov. Ralph Northam, triggered fierce opposition and drew tens of thousands of gun rights supporters to Capitol Square for Lobby Day that January, though the demonstration remained peaceful.
That history framed much of the message Monday, as speakers and attendees warned that a similar legislative push is again taking shape — and urged supporters to respond not only through rallies but by engaging in elections, local government and the courts.
Several speakers emphasized that even if new restrictions are enacted, gun rights advocates still have avenues to fight back.
Longtime VCDL coordinator Brendan Mooney, who now lives in Idaho, returned to Richmond to address the crowd. He urged attendees to run for or seek appointment to local offices, including school boards and planning commissions.
“There’s a lot of offices in your county that are probably filled with people that got there because they showed up,” Mooney said.
U.S. Rep. John McGuire, R-Goochland, also took the stage, urging supporters to mobilize ahead of this year’s congressional elections.
“We need all hands on deck. We’ve got the midterms coming up,” McGuire said. “I need 10 people to get 10 people to get 10 people to vote. We need your prayers. We need your dollars. We need you out there knocking on the doors now.”

Later Monday afternoon, a counter-protest gathered at the Bell Tower for an annual gun violence prevention rally that doubles as a day of remembrance for Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Friends and family members of gun violence victims joined advocates from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, forming a crowd of a few hundred. 
About 100 attendees wore blue Superman-themed beanie hats honoring Adam Turck, a Richmond-based actor who was shot and killed last summer after intervening in a domestic dispute while walking his dog.
“While we understand and even admire what Adam did, we’re also angry it wasn’t Adam’s job to protect the vulnerable from an act of violence,” said CJ Bergen, a friend of Turck’s who spoke at the rally. “That was the commonwealth’s job.”
The contrast between the two events was stark. While the VCDL rally centered on frustration and resistance to anticipated legislation, the gun safety gathering emphasized remembrance, gratitude and persistence.
According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,237 Virginians died from gun violence in 2023. Nationwide, the agency reported roughly 48,000 firearm-related deaths in the same period.
Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, who chairs a House Public Safety subcommittee, said at the later rally that addressing gun violence is personal for him after losing a family member.

Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, also attended the afternoon rally and expressed hope that legislation previously vetoed under Youngkin — including a safe storage proposal — could now advance under Gov. Abigail Spanberger.
 Virginia lawmakers set to debate these gun bills this session

Democrats have already filed a broad package of firearm-related legislation this session, signaling that gun policy will again dominate debate.
One proposal would impose an 11% excise tax on retail firearm and ammunition sales, directing the revenue to a state gun violence intervention and prevention fund. 
Other measures would establish standards of responsible conduct for gun manufacturers and dealers, allowing enforcement actions by the attorney general, local prosecutors or individuals harmed by violations.
Several bills focus on domestic violence, tightening firearm relinquishment requirements for people convicted of assault or subject to protective orders by adding age, residency and reporting standards designed to ensure guns are surrendered.
Lawmakers are also revisiting so-called ghost gun legislation, strengthening penalties for manufacturing, selling or possessing undetectable plastic firearms, unserialized guns and unfinished frames or receivers, with updated language reflecting modern security screening technology and delayed effective dates beginning in 2027.
Another proposal would narrow exemptions allowing firearms in Capitol Square and other government buildings, particularly on public college campuses, limiting them to approved academic or institutional activities.
Democrats have also revived an assault weapons ban, introduced by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, a measure supporters argue would reduce mass shootings but which gun rights advocates say would outlaw commonly owned firearms.
Republicans have countered with more limited proposals, including a bill that would exempt women with active protective orders from restrictions on carrying firearms in certain locations and another that would lower fees charged by local law enforcement for processing concealed handgun permit applications.
But their prospects may be limited after losing all three statewide offices and seeing Democrats expand their majority in the House.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Shortly after being sworn in on Saturday, Gov. Abigail Spanberger appointed members to the Boards of Visitors for George Mason University, the University of Virginia, and Virginia Military Institute. She also ordered a review of the higher-ed board confirmation process, which was the center of contention between lawmakers and the previous gubernatorial administration last year.
Spanberger’s actions come as the schools face multiple vacant seats on their governing boards and as the state weathers scrutiny from the federal government over its higher education institutions, which Democratic lawmakers pledged to protect from partisan influence. Spanberger’s nominees, like those of all governors, are subject to confirmation by the General Assembly.
On Saturday, Spanberger directed the secretary of education, in consultation with the secretary of the commonwealth, to submit a report detailing the procedures for board appointments, including member term lengths, reappointments, term start dates for new members, and the evaluation process used by the Virginia Commission on Higher Education Board Appointments.
“Under the current federal administration, Virginia colleges and universities have faced unprecedented challenges from shifts in federal policy to attacks on institutional autonomy and mission,” Spanberger said in Executive Order No. 6. “These pressures underscore the urgent need for the commonwealth to reevaluate how governing boards are appointed, ensuring they are composed of individuals dedicated to upholding the quality, independence, and reputation of our institutions.”
Last year, Democratic lawmakers clashed with Gov. Glenn Youngkin over his nominations to Virginia’s colleges and universities, with the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee rejecting 22 nominations largely because of conflicting ideals over diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. 
Lawmakers also questioned some boards’ decisions to align their policies more closely to ones outlined by the Trump administration and said they threatened Virginia institutions’ autonomy. 
“Strong governance is essential not just for protecting academic excellence, but for ensuring that our colleges and universities continue to prepare students to thrive in an increasingly complex and competitive world,” she wrote.
University of Richmond School of Law professor Carl Tobias interpreted Spanberger’s order as an opportunity to better the appointments process, put forward by a leader mindful of the current political environment.
“The governor is aware and has witnessed … the apparent politicization of the boards especially at UVA and George Mason and so, I think this is her effort to see if there can’t be a better way to have the governor select these people to serve on the boards,” Tobias said, “and hopefully, in that way, improve the process of selection and then improve the governing capabilities of of the boards.”
Tobias also said he is interested in whether the forthcoming report will address staggered terms. In Virginia, some K-12 schools use this method to keep some continuity on the board when the terms of members end before new members’ terms begin.
 New appointees join boards at universities facing federal investigations, racism allegations

Spanberger’s administration on Saturday announced 27 nominees to college boards — 12 to George Mason University, 10 to the University of Virginia and affiliates, and five to the Virginia Military Institute. 
Senate Democrats rejected 22 of Youngkin’s appointees to these boards, sparking a months-long battle that culminated in a Supreme Court appeal. Ultimately, the case became moot after the change in administration.
Former Congressmen Tom Davis, a Republican, and Jim Moran, a Democrat, top the list of Spanberger’s new nominees for George Mason’s Board of Visitors. The institution is under an ongoing U.S. Department of Justice civil rights investigation and faced allegations of racial discrimination in its hiring and admissions policies.
Amid federal investigations, George Mason leaders say negotiations continue with Dept. of Justice

Recently, Charles Stimson, who had been appointed as rector by Youngkin, stepped down, creating an opening on the board.
Last week, Spanberger shook up the University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors by asking several members to resign. She has nominated Carlos Brown, a former vice-rector, as well as Elizabeth Hayes, a UVA alumna and foundation board member. Mike Bisceglia, a business executive who served on Spanberger’s transition team, and Victoria Harker, who was nominated by former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell in 2012, also received nominations from the new governor.
Despite calls from Spanberger and others to suspend its search for a new UVA president, the board moved forward with selecting a leader, a decision leadership told lawmakers they weighed as necessary considering the time required to convene the full board and as they balanced the need for stability and leadership. 
The president search stemmed from a DOJ investigation that spurred former UVA President Jim Ryan’s resignation in June. Ryan wrote in November that Rector Rachel Sheridan and Vice Rector Porter Wilkinson worked with the DOJ and Youngkin’s office to pressure him to resign.
Sheridan neither disputed nor endorsed Ryan’s account at a Senate hearing on Jan. 12; instead, she focused on her own memory of the proceedings and said she and other leaders did what they believed was best for the institution.
Va. senators grill UVA leaders over DOJ deal, leadership search, diversity programs

The DOJ and UVA signed an agreement to suspend five of the seven investigations, which center on the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies and allegations of antisemitism on campus. The agreement sparked concerns about federal overreach from Democrats and the UVA community. Two of the investigations have been closed.
Spanberger also nominated former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam to join VMI’s governing board. Northam previously served on the board and completed his term in 2022. 
A 2021 state report noted that “racial and gender disparities exist and that improvement is needed” at VMI, and said racial slurs and jokes are “not uncommon” on campus. The same report found the state’s oldest public military school “lags behind other Virginia institutions of higher education and other military academies in race and gender metrics and diversity efforts.”
Simultaneously, the governing board selected Ret. Maj. Gen. Cedric Wins, the institution’s first Black superintendent, in April 2021. Four years later, Wins was ousted by the governing board composed of mostly Youngkin’s appointees. 
In addition to being a new appointee to VMI’s board, Northam was the first governor in the commonwealth to create a DEI office in the executive branch.
The remaining appointees are a mix of alumni, business and civic leaders.
 Next steps

The review of the boards and commissions’ nominations process, including a report and recommendations, is expected to be submitted to the governor prior to March 18 to inform decision-making and strengthen future appointments.
The House and Senate Privileges and Elections Committees are likely to take up the list of nominations by Feb. 17, the day of crossover when successful legislation is considered by opposite chambers.
Lawmakers will also consider Senate Bill 49, which changes the nomination process by requiring that only fully confirmed individuals may serve in positions requiring General Assembly confirmation. The bill would end the current practice of allowing nominees to begin serving before confirmation, ensuring that only those who have received General Assembly approval hold such positions.

(Photo courtesy of Henrico County Public Schools)If at first you don’t succeed with legislation at the Virginia General Assembly, try, try … wait for a new governor.
That’s the lesson for local officials, educators and state lawmakers when it comes to winning a reliable stream of money for major school construction projects around the commonwealth. It’s been well worth the fight.
Glenn Youngkin, whose term just ended, repeatedly vetoed proposals that would have allowed localities to add a one-cent sales tax earmarked for school construction and major renovations. (I chalk this up to Youngkin, a Republican, being able to say he didn’t raise taxes as governor when he inevitably runs for another electoral office.)
Only the city of Danville and the counties of Charlotte, Gloucester, Halifax, Henry, Mecklenburg, Northampton, Patrick, and Pittsylvania now have – following a voter referendum – the state’s blessing to raise the sales tax for capital school projects, due to the Dillon Rule. Those nine localities gained that ability before Youngkin became governor in 2022.
Localities can raise real-estate tax rates on their own, but many other essential services like public safety and garbage disposal gobble up the money from that source. Officials who want to borrow money for school construction often run into bonding limits in their cities and counties.
Democrat Abigail Spanberger, who was sworn in Saturday as governor, has said she would sign the latest legislation if it passes both chambers this session. The measure, in the state House and Senate, likely will win approval given the current Democratic majorities in both chambers, and because previous versions of the bill garnered bipartisan support.
“The need is only growing” in communities around Virginia, Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, told me. The sales tax option “adds a tool to help localities tackle the issue.”
McPike is the chief sponsor of the Senate bill and has waged a long battle to make it a law. He also knows about the crumbling conditions in so many ancient buildings around Virginia.
He sits on the Assembly’s Commission on School Construction and Modernization. In a report released in 2021, the panel found the total replacement cost for the 1,000-plus buildings then over 50 years old was nearly $25 billion. Many school structures have gotten worse since then.
I’ve written before about some of the woeful conditions that existed: a collapsed 750-pound section of an auditorium ceiling in Norfolk; air ducts that operated so loudly in Portsmouth they competed with the voices of teachers; worn-out HVAC systems; roofs, floors and windows that are deficient in Stafford County.
To Youngkin’s credit, in his first year in office in 2022, the General Assembly approved a historic $1.2 billion investment in school construction, aimed at modernizing facilities and reducing funding disparities among school divisions. The plan had grants and loans.
Loans, of course, have to be repaid. Besides, the needs across Virginia dwarf the amount of money the state has offered.  
Youngkin had previously claimed that, if the sales-tax increase became law, citizens would be on the hook for additional taxes of $1.5 billion annually. But as critics noted, you get to that figure only if voters in every locality approved the measure. Some of the state’s richer localities have enough revenue streams that they wouldn’t need the additional taxes.
That’s why so many communities are desperate to add this option for school construction. Several have publicly supported the one-cent sales tax in recent years – especially those with modest enrollments and limited tax bases.
“Given the magnitude of the issue, it requires a holistic approach to solve it,” said Jeremy Bennett, director of intergovernmental affairs with the Virginia Association of Counties. The group supports the proposal.
Some officials told me they currently must borrow money to complete major projects – which is part of the reason they often delay new construction and sizable renovations.
“It would be vital for us” if the tax proposal passed, said Zebedee Talley Jr., superintendent of the roughly 2,000-student Martinsville City Public Schools. Some sections of their five school buildings date to 1949.
“The kids are deserving of this 1% tax,” he added.
Prince Edward County also is among the places favoring the proposal. The Board of Supervisors in December there cited estimates that the tax could raise $3 million in annual revenue based on recent collections. The division has about 1,850 students.
“No one likes new taxes. I get that,” Donald (Chip) Jones Jr., superintendent of county schools, told me. But “this would allow us to take another revenue source. Anybody who shops or eats in Prince Edward County would contribute.” 
It never made sense that the Assembly granted nine localities this option but denied it elsewhere. Legislators and Spanberger should approve the measure for the rest of the state.
Students, educators and administrators would thank them.

(Photo courtesy Dominion Energy)Construction has resumed on the $11.2 billion offshore wind project by Dominion Energy three weeks after the federal government called for a pause on the work citing national security concerns.
A federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia ordered a preliminary injunction on Friday for Dominion to continue work while the company’s lawsuit challenging the U.S. Department of Interior’s 90 day stop order continues.  
Dominion said in a statement that the company would continue working with the federal government on a solution while work restarts.
CVOW is anticipated to bring on 2.6 gigawatts of energy — enough to power 660,000 homes at a time when the need is critical in the commonwealth. The project is already near completion with the first power expected to come online at the end of the first quarter of this year. That timeline is still on track despite the nearly three week delay in constructing the turbines.
The first of the 176 turbines were delivered by ship to the leasing area Saturday. The foundations for the turbines have already been installed and power will be rolled out on the project as the turbines are built. The entire project is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2026.
Members of Virginia’s congressional delegation applauded the court’s decision to allow the project to move forward and accused the pause of being politically motivated. The Department of the Interior’s stop work order did not specify the national security risks and the defense department reports were classified. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine along with Reps. Bobby Scott (3rd-District) and Jennifer McClellan (4th-District) — all Democrats — released a joint statement.
“(This) ruling is a victory for Virginians, who otherwise would face increased energy costs as a result of the Trump Administration’s shortsighted opposition to clean energy,” the statement read. “We will continue to work to protect this critical and growing industry and to ensure clean energy projects that have met every legal and regulatory requirement can move forward without undue political interference.”
This is not the first federal intervention that has targeted offshore wind projects. Funding for multiple offshore wind related projects was pulled last year including an attempt to cut funds for the Norfolk Offshore Wind Logistics Port, also known as Fairwinds Landing, and the Portsmouth Marine Terminal Offshore Wind Development Project which aided the CVOW project. However, the funding had already been spent for those port upgrades.
Attorneys general in multiple northeastern states have filed lawsuits against the federal government to push back against funding cuts and similar pauses on renewable projects in their states. Virginia Attorney General Jay Jones stated in a release when he took office over the weekend, “My office will fulfill its duty to protect ratepayers and ensure the completion of Virginia’s landmark offshore wind energy project and ensure this federal overreach does not drive up energy costs for Virginians.” 
Jones’ office did not respond immediately when asked if Virginia would officially enter into the lawsuit filed by Dominion.

“It’s not too late to get your flu shot…. People who are symptomatic should not go to work or school, they should stay home,” he said. “And then you do all the other things — washing your hands frequently and wearing a mask when you’re around others and have symptoms.”
Early in the flu season, which starts in the late fall, public health officials and health researchers warned that an emerging variant of influenza called subclade K was behind significant surges in flu cases across the world and would have similar impacts in the United States.
The current vaccine formula for the 2025-26 flu season is not as effective against troublesome flu variant, leading to greater transmission this year.
“We are seeing a more severe flu season than we traditionally have,” Benjamin said. “And the vaccine, while certainly effective, is not as great a match as it could have been.”
Benjamin also said that messaging from the Trump administration is stoking confusion around the efficacy and safety of vaccines, leading to reduced vaccination rates.
Moore administration wants health secretary to issue vaccine recommendations, apart from feds

“The federal government really has been asleep at the switch on this,” Benjamin said. “And they recently changed the recommendation for routine flu vaccination for kids. Which is a problem.
“Kids should still get their flu shots,” he said. “And if people have any questions, they should consult with their clinicians.”
Meanwhile, Maryland’s Combined Respiratory Illness Dashboard reports that there had already been 4,202 hospitalizations from late September through last Friday. The total number of hospitalizations during last flu season was more than 8,000, health officials say.
The current flu surge may have peaked during the last week of December, with 1,079 people hospitalized for flu-related reasons. Last year, which was already considered a fairly severe flu season, weekly hospitalization peaked in February at 1,044 people hospitalized for flu.
That said, hospitalizations have quickly dropped, according to state data. During the first week of January, there were 493 people hospitalized.
Andrew Pekosz, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who researches respiratory illnesses, hopes that the flu surge continues to drop.
“The initial signs that we are seeing here is that it’s a steep flu season, but it seems to be going away as quickly as it came,” Pekosz said. “I caution that every flu season is a little bit different, and there are two influenza viruses – we call them H1N1 and Influenza B virus – that can cause influenza. And it’s not uncommon to see a late-season surge with a different type of influenza.”
But this year’s flu deaths, while high, are still trailing far behind another severe seasonal respiratory illness – COVID-19. In the 2025-26 respiratory illness season, COVID has been responsible for 99 deaths this year. That’s significant because state data shows that current COVID-19 activity is “low” though it is increasing.
“When you look at COVID-19 numbers, there still is a significant danger of severe illness that is sometimes much higher than what we see for influenza,” Pekosz said. “So, while we don’t see as much COVID right now, it’s still a disease that is dangerous, if not maybe a little bit more dangerous, than influenza. Particularly in the high-risk groups.”
Those high-risk groups include people who are over the age of 65 and immunocompromised people.
Pekosz says that for both COVID and the flu, regular hand washing and staying home when sick will help prevent the spread. Antivirals are also available for those who get sick to help protect from severe illness.
He also urged people to get vaccinated to protect themselves from the rest of the respiratory illness season, and wear masks if they are around others while experiencing symptoms.

(Photo by Seksan Mongkhonkhamsao/Getty Images)In the weeks after the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk last year, online speech became a battleground. Commentators sparred over Kirk’s legacy; supporters of Kirk, urged on by Vice President JD Vance, sought to pressure employers to fire those who mocked or celebrated the event. In many cases, they succeeded. 
The furor was intense, but the techniques were nothing new. For years, the rise of social media has empowered new forms of backlash against both elected leaders and civilians over their political views. 
Now, one New Hampshire lawmaker is pushing to criminalize similar acts of retribution.
A pair of bills introduced by Rep. Terry Roy, a Deerfield Republican and the chairman of the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, would explicitly prohibit people from “doxing” people’s personal information and prevent employers from hiring or firing someone because of political opinions.
The bills would explicitly prevent behavior that has until now been handled through a patchwork of criminal statutes on harassment and stalking. But Roy argues the tense national political environment and unique force of social media necessitate explicit action. 
 “We’re all of a sudden going after people and hurting people and intimidating people — and this is not one party or the other, it’s the entire country — based on their political beliefs and what they express,” Roy said. “These are things that we used to celebrate in this country.” 
But some lawmakers are less sure about the approach, raising questions about the scope of the laws and their potential interpretation. And some outside experts say any new laws should be mindful of freedom of speech considerations. 
“There are problems with doxing,” said Belmont University Associate Professor of Law David Hudson Jr., who has studied anti-doxing laws across the country, in an interview Friday. “There are people that truly do have a nasty intent to cause harm to others. On the other hand, people do have the right to engage in free speech.” 
Roy’s first bill, House Bill 1464, would prevent employers from firing, refusing to hire, barring from employment, or discriminating against a person because of “that person’s political affiliation or opinion.” It would also expand the state law against harassment, which currently prohibits abusive phone calls, insults, taunts, threats, and other behavior. 
The bill would also criminalize harassing, annoying, or alarming another person based on their political affiliation or opinion. The law would apply if the behavior “would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress or fear for their safety, employment, or economic well-being.” If the behavior actually resulted in the victim losing their job or suffering economic harm, the perpetrator could face a Class B felony. 
Some fellow members of the Criminal Justice Committee questioned the definition of “political opinion.” Rep. Buzz Scherr, a Portsmouth Democrat, asked whether the law would protect someone who denied the Holocaust. Roy said he thought that would be a historical belief, not a political one, and thus would not be protected. But he said the scope of the law in individual instances might be a question for courts to decide. 
Roy has also proposed a bill criminalizing “doxing” — the practice of releasing someone’s personal information online to allow people to intimidate or harass them.
House Bill 1367 would define the offense as the “intentional” publication of a person’s identifying information “without their consent” and with the intent to “threaten, intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress or physical harm” to the person or their family. Doing so would be a Class A misdemeanor, according to the bill, which could lead to up to a year in jail and up to a $2,000 fine. 
The proposed law would carve out exceptions for information obtained from public records and “published for a lawful purpose,” reports of suspected criminal activity, and constitutionally protected speech such as journalism or “commentary on matters of public concern.”
Like many states, New Hampshire prosecutors instead rely on existing criminal statutes to punish harassing behavior. A 2021 review from the Network for Public Health Law found that only a handful of states had statutes specifically criminalizing the act of doxing.
For instance, New Hampshire’s existing stalking law punishes someone who “purposely, knowingly, or recklessly engages in a course of conduct targeted at a specific person which would cause a reasonable person to fear for his or her personal safety.” The law applies to family members, too. And it extends to actions that might not make a reasonable person fearful, but which the perpetrator “knows will place that individual in fear.”
Federal law is also limited. One federal statute prohibits the disclosure of personal information about a grand juror, witness, federal informant, or a public employee assisting in a federal investigation. That information includes phone numbers, addresses, and Social Security numbers. 
Roy said his bill would empower New Hampshire law enforcement to specifically investigate doxing. But other lawmakers again asked questions about scope. Rep. Jennifer Rhodes, a Winchester Republican, asked about the limits of the proposed new law. If someone disclosed another person’s personal information, and did not know it would later be used to harass them, would they be liable, she asked?
“The intent has to be established that the person doing the doxing and the posting — that that was their intent to cause” the harassment, Roy said. He added that the law would not apply to someone posting another’s phone number that they found in the White Pages, unless they were doing so with the intent to threaten or intimidate.
“It’s a relatively high bar that I’m setting here,” Roy continued. “So it’s only going to (affect) the egregious people who basically out themselves because they can’t help themselves.”
Some national groups disagree that doxing should be specifically prohibited. In a 2024 essay for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, the pro-first amendment institution known as FIRE, Hudson argued the laws can interfere with free speech protections for publishing truthful information, as well as protections for “offensive, obnoxious, and even repugnant speech.”
“It’s very dangerous to criminalize any speech that refers to expression that’s in the public domain, or that is in the public record,” he said. “It truly needs to be private information, I think, to have a better chance of being constitutional.”
Hudson said Roy’s anti-doxing bill appears better tailored than other states’ laws, given its exception for public information. “The general pattern on these things is when we start getting laws like this, they tend to get narrower as people learn you can’t (enforce them otherwise),” he said.
The Legislature has tried regulating doxing before; in 2020, a Democratic bill to crack down on cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and doxing, House Bill 1159, was sent to an interim study. 
Now, the effort has returned under a Republican banner. Speaking in favor of the bill. Rep. Henry Giasson, a Goffstown Republican, recounted a personal instance.
In 2025, a person angry about his votes as a lawmaker wrote a social media post calling for his house to be burned down, Giasson said. A second person then listed Giasson’s address in a comment, he said.
“I was concerned about going to vote in the next (session day) because I was concerned about leaving my house,” he said. “A job that pays me $100 a year cost me a security system,” he said, referring to the annual salary for New Hampshire lawmakers. 
“We need to make this illegal,” Giasson said. “We need to make this a backable law.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/doxing-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 05:56:28.118664

The second amendment would add language to the state’s constitution protecting citizens from discrimination based on race, color, creed or religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression regardless of sex assigned at birth, pregnancy status, genetic information, disease status, age, disability, recovery status, familial status, ancestry, national origin, or military and veteran status.

“Individual rights are constantly under attack in this country, and Ohioans deserve protections that cannot be taken away by shifting political winds,” said Susan Appel, Volunteer Campaign Manager for Ohio Equal Rights.
“We cannot trust that the government will always do the right thing simply because it should. So we’re doing what Ohioans have always done—we’re taking matters into our own hands.”
Ohio Equal Rights, a grassroots organization, will need to collect about 413,487 signatures from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties — 10% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election — for each amendment in order to get on the ballot. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose will then need to verify the signatures. 
Because they are trying to get two amendments on the ballot, volunteers are trying to circulate both petitions at the same time, said Lis Regula, Ohio Equal Rights Executive Co-Chair. 
Hocking County is the county that is closest to completion with signatures, he said. 
“The narrative that rural Ohio is less concerned about rights at this point does not seem to be the case,” Regula said. 
Ohio Equal Rights originally had one proposed amendment, but the Ohio Ballot Board decided over the summer their proposal actually contained two amendments. They could have challenged the ruling in the Ohio Supreme Court, but decided to move forward with two amendments. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost certified the summary language for both amendments in August. 
“This certification should not be construed as an affirmation of the enforceability, constitutionality, or wisdom of the proposed amendment,” Yost said in both of his Aug. 8 letters. “Those matters are left for a different forum and another day.”
Ohio’s constitution includes a ban on same-sex marriage after 61.7% of Ohio voters approved an amendment in 2004 that says marriage is only between one man and one woman. The United States Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015 through the Obergefell case originating out of Ohio. 
However, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas called on the justices to revisit Obergefell after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.
“Ohioans deserve a Constitution that reflects the will of the people—not outdated laws or political agendas,” Appel said. “These amendments are about protecting families, protecting freedom, and protecting the basic principle that government should not be telling people how to live their lives.” 
The 2026 ballot will also include the governor’s race and other statewide executive offices.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)In a win for President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, a recent court ruling has cleared the way for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to resume using states’ Medicaid data to find people who are in the country illegally.
The case is ongoing. But for now, immigrants — including those who are in the country legally — will have to weigh the benefits of gaining health coverage against the risk that enrolling in Medicaid could make them or their family members easier for ICE to find.
Last summer, 22 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration to block information sharing between ICE and Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program that primarily covers people with low incomes. But at the end of December, a federal judge ruled that ICE can pull some basic Medicaid data to use in its deportation proceedings, including addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and citizenship or immigration status.
The court ruled that in the states that sued, ICE is not allowed to collect information about lawful permanent residents or citizens, nor records about sensitive health information. In the 28 states that didn’t sue, however, the court did not place any limits on the Medicaid information ICE can access.
The U.S. District Court in San Francisco essentially said that government agencies can share some data, including basic identifying information. “That kind of data sharing is clearly authorized by statute,” the decision states.
But the court also ruled that agencies can’t share more sensitive data without adequately explaining why they need it. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria wrote that ICE and federal Medicaid information-sharing policies were “totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decisionmaking process.” He said the states had shown they would “suffer irreparable harm from these vague and likely overbroad” policies.
Worried about surveillance, states enact privacy laws and restrict license plate readers

By law, federal Medicaid money cannot be used to cover people who are in the country illegally.
But in recent years, nearly half of states, including some led by Republicans, have chosen to use their own Medicaid money to extend coverage to certain groups of people, such as children and pregnant women, regardless of immigration status.
Advocates for immigrants and some state officials worry that ICE’s use of Medicaid data will cause widespread fear among immigrant families, keeping them from seeking the health care that states have said they’re eligible to receive. California’s health department recently called the administration’s actions “a grave breach of public trust.”
“States have constantly reassured people that their health care information won’t be used against them, and that’s changed,” said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization focused on immigrant rights.
Court filings in the lawsuit illustrate the potential impact of the ruling.
In Chicago, for example, a patient at an Esperanza Health Center delayed her first prenatal visit until her third trimester because she worried enrolling in Medicaid could put her husband at risk of deportation, the clinic reported in a December court filing. By the time she received care, she had complications that could have been addressed with earlier health visits. Another patient refused to apply for Medicaid for her child, a U.S. citizen, because she worried that seeking benefits would allow ICE to locate her.
“The expectation of privacy that we all have when we seek to enroll in a health care program has been compromised,” said Broder.
“Not only undocumented immigrants but people who live in families with immigrants and the broader community are going to feel less comfortable in applying for these health programs, over concerns their information is going to be weaponized against them or their family members.”
An about-face
Several months into Trump’s second term, ICE gained access to the personal data of 79 million Medicaid enrollees as part of its efforts to find people who may be living illegally in the United States.
Data on Medicaid enrollees is routinely exchanged between states and the feds, including to verify eligibility to receive federal funding. But the new agreement marked an about-face from past federal policies of not using such information for immigration enforcement.
The effort is unprecedented at the national level, said Medha Makhlouf, a law professor at Penn State Dickinson Law who specializes in health and immigration.
“Previously the federal government has balanced immigration enforcement interests with the protection of health-related interests,” she said. “Now they’re weighing much more heavily the interests of immigration enforcement.”
That puts the federal government at odds with states that have expanded health coverage as a matter of public health and economic policy, she said. Many states have extended coverage to a wider swath of people on the premise that broader coverage helps prevent the spread of disease, prioritizes preventive care over more costly emergency treatment and reduces economic losses when employees miss work because of illness.
The judge’s order will stand until the case is resolved, as the judge considers what kinds of data can be released for use in immigration enforcement.
ICE courthouse arrests meet resistance from Democratic states

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said in a July statement that the Trump administration’s data-sharing move was illegal and “created a culture of fear that will lead to fewer people seeking vital emergency medical care.”
Federal officials say they’re allowed to use lawfully collected information for immigration enforcement purposes.
The Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to requests for comment.
Broder, of the National Immigration Law Center, said it isn’t clear whether the limited information the court has allowed the Department of Homeland Security to use can be cleanly separated from data belonging to citizens and lawful permanent residents. The ruling says that if that basic data can’t be separated from data that’s still protected, Medicaid can’t share it with ICE.
California’s Department of Health Care Services, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, emphasized that concern in a statement updated earlier this month. The department said the feds haven’t provided any information about how they plan to implement the court’s order.
Meanwhile, some states are looking at their options for protecting their Medicaid data. Oregon Health Authority Director Dr. Sejal Hathi called the move to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement “disappointing, to say the least” in a public board meeting earlier this month.
She said her agency is “committed to doing all that we can within our authority to protect the health privacy of our members” and is working with health providers to “ensure that Oregonians, no matter their background, can continue to seek and receive quick and responsive health care without worrying about the safety of their health information.”
States step up
In recent years, an increasing number of states have used their own money to extend health insurance coverage under their Medicaid programs to some noncitizens, such as people with green cards, refugees and those with temporary protected status.
For example, 14 states and the District of Columbia cover income-eligible children regardless of immigration status, while seven states and the district offer state-funded coverage to some adults with low incomes, regardless of immigration status. Nearly half of states — including a handful of red states — cover income-eligible pregnant women, regardless of their immigration status.











It should be an easy decision for families to accept help, but it’s not easy anymore.


– Medha Makhlouf, a law professor at Penn State Dickinson Law



Makhlouf, of Penn State, directs a legal clinic at her law school where law students assist people who face legal barriers to getting health care and other public benefits. The students have fielded questions from parents — even those who are in the country legally — who have asked if applying for Medicaid for their children, who are U.S. citizens, jeopardizes their own legal status or exposes household members to scrutiny from ICE.
“We see the chilling effects directly,” Makhlouf said. “Folks have many more questions about the risks versus the benefits of applying for government programs. It should be an easy decision for families to accept help, but it’s not easy anymore.”
In the past year, the Trump administration also has ordered states to hand over personal data from sources including voter rolls and food stamps, even as it consolidates information held across federal agencies into a trove of information on people who live in the United States.
In November, a federal judge blocked the IRS from sharing taxpayer information for immigration purposes.

After a massive request from Georgia Power to expand its energy capacity by about 10,000 megawatts due to unprecedented growth driven largely by a rise in data centers and a recent focus on energy affordability, particularly after Democratic successes campaigning on the issue in 2025, lawmakers seem likely to consider legislation that could help regulate the power-hungry, massive facilities.

Ratepayer protections
Rome Republican Sen. Chuck Hufstetler. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Rome Republican, is renewing his effort on Senate Bill 34, a bill designed to protect residential ratepayers from costs associated with data center infrastructure by prohibiting costs associated with fuel requirements, generation and transmission from being included in general rates.
Hufstetler said in a recent interview that, despite the Public Service Commission passing its own rule to address costs after his bill was introduced last year, his legislation still needs to pass. He said the current rule is insufficient and lacks the permanence of law.
“Their rule has enough loopholes in it to drive a truck through, so we need it codified into law,” Hufstetler said.
The commission’s rule could also be easily bypassed, said Amy Sharma, executive director of Science for Georgia. Sharma said the current PSC framework is “littered with loopholes” that give utilities too much flexibility.
“I do think that something more ironclad from the Georgia General Assembly is definitely needed,” Sharma said in a recent interview.
Data center ‘gold rush’ pits local officials’ hunt for new revenue against residents’ concerns

A central concern for Sharma is what she called vagueness in determining which infrastructure projects are actually for data centers. She pointed to a controversial project in Fayetteville in which high-voltage transmission lines were run through residential yards, and to the mixed messaging that followed about whether it was intended to serve data centers or residential customers.
“Who’s determining if this is needed for a data center, or if they can just be like, ‘Oh, this is grid strengthening,’” Sharma asked.
Tom Krause, a spokesperson for the PSC, said in a statement that the commission “philosophically agree(s) with Sen. Hufstetler’s bill because it mirrors the rule we had already put in place for Georgia Power,” but did not say if the commission supports or opposes the bill.
“Other states have since adopted their versions of the Georgia PSC rule. All the feedback we have gotten from other states is that Georgia’s rule very effectively protects existing ratepayers from data center costs,” Krause said.
Mandating disclosures
While Hufstetler’s bill addresses the costs associated with data centers, House Bill 528, sponsored by Junction City Democratic Rep. Debbie Buckner, focuses on the natural resources these facilities consume. The bipartisan bill would require facilities with a peak demand of 30 megawatts or greater to submit annual public disclosure reports on their energy and water usage.

Buckner described the measure as a “communication bill” intended to help local governments understand the impact of developments that often arrive under non-disclosure agreements.
“A lot of times, development authorities are the ones that recruit these kinds of industries, and that information about what they’re going to use is not always fully disclosed to the local governing authorities,” Buckner said.
Sharma said that understanding the current state of natural resources and the overall impact from development is essential for future planning, saying that Georgia currently lacks even a uniform system to track exactly how much power and water these centers use.
“Step one is understanding the problem,” she added. “We don’t know what the situation is on the ground right now.”
The data center industry, however, maintains that data center activity is a net positive for the state’s economy and its energy grid. Khara Boender, director of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, an organization representing the data center industry, said in a statement that the industry is already meeting its obligations and even helping to stabilize costs for other Georgians.
“Across the country, states are recognizing the critical role data centers play in the 21st-century economy and the many benefits they provide to local communities,” Boender said in a statement. “Data centers are committed to being responsible neighbors in the communities where they operate. The industry employs sustainable water practices in its operations and remains committed to paying its full cost of service for the energy it uses.”
Boender pointed to a rule adopted by the Public Service Commission aimed at helping ensure data centers pay for the energy infrastructure they need and Georgia Power’s 3-year rate freeze, saying the industry “will continue working with policymakers to ensure responsible, equitable treatment so Georgia can compete for this investment, supporting jobs, strengthening local tax bases, and positioning the state to lead in a modern, data‑driven economy.”
Re-examining tax incentives
Georgia regulators approve massive power grid expansion to serve data centers

A December audit by the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the University of Georgia examined the state’s sales and use tax exemption for data centers and concluded that the policy has cost the state at least $1.5 billion in lost revenue since its inception, including nearly $500 million in fiscal year 2025 alone. The audit found that about 70% of data center investment in Georgia would likely have occurred regardless of the tax break because of the state’s existing fiber infrastructure, low risk of natural disasters and utility reliability.
The fiscal impact of the credit is also projected to increase, potentially reaching an annual loss of $800 million for the state by 2030. The audit also concluded that the facilities create relatively few permanent jobs, typically fewer than 50 per center, once operational, after employing about 1,500 employees at peak construction. The audit’s authors estimated that the number of permanent data center jobs in 2025 was just under 1,900.

House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican, said at a recent press conference that while the credits helped attract the industry, clawing back the tax credits could be considered in the future.
“A lot of people have made decisions based on those tax credits, but that’s a discussion we’ll have on down the road,” Burns said.
The Georgia Assembly passed a bill in 2024 pitched as a pause on the tax credits to allow the state to assess the data centers’ impact on the grid, but it was ultimately vetoed by Gov. Brian Kemp. Now, some lawmakers are gearing up another push to reconsider the tax credit given to data centers.
Lawmakers on Friday introduced two bills to at least in part end the tax credit. Senate Bill 410, sponsored by Newnan Republican Sen. Matt Brass, would allow tax credits for data centers that have already been approved to remain in place, which could address Burns’ concerns. And Senate Bill 408, sponsored by Atlanta Democrat Sen. Nan Orrock, would sunset the tax credit incentive in 2027, five years ahead of the original date. In an interview Friday, Orrock said that her bill is aimed at reeling in the “mega installations” that have massive energy consumption, water usage and a lack of significant job creation.
“The public opinion, the public reaction to the data centers marching into the state, consuming all that electricity, all that water, and all that real estate — they’re vast installations, and oftentimes it plays very inappropriately in terms of their proximity to neighborhoods. It’s going to be a big issue that you’ll see us dealing with in this session,” Orrock said.
Sharma suggested that if the credits remain, they should be repurposed and granted only if a facility minimizes water use or invests in energy-saving technologies.
“You should use tax incentives to incentivize good behavior,” she said.

A statewide moratorium?
Also on Friday, Rep. Ruwa Romman, a Duluth Democrat and 2026 candidate for governor, introduced House Bill 1012, which would place a statewide moratorium on the construction of data centers until February 2027. She said the intent of the bill is to give local governments time to develop local policies that better serve their communities. Romman said the bill has bipartisan support, with Woodstock Republican Rep. Jordan Ridley as a co-signer, and that “people are filling city halls and county meetings, saying ‘we don’t want this.'”
“You can’t really restore the land to what it used to be. And a lot of these counties and cities have been very overwhelmed, trying to figure out what is the best policy,” Romman said.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/ct-health-care-subsidies-delay/,Prices quoted by CT's health exchange don’t reflect $70 million in pledged assistance yet — and might not until late March.,"Though Gov. Ned Lamont pledged $70 million in early December to partly offset vanishing federal aid for health insurance, prices quoted by the state’s health exchange don’t reflect that assistance yet — and might not until late March.
A high-ranking state budget official said this weekend that while it could take months to deliver the planned relief, the administration is committed to making this process work.
“It is one of the unfortunate things when you set up a brand-new system,” Claudio Gualtieri, a senior policy advisor at the Office of Policy and Management — Lamont’s chief fiscal and policy planning agency — told the Connecticut Mirror. “We’ve moved with lightning speed to try to get this done.”
Lamont announced Dec. 11 that he would dedicate $70 million in state funds to assist Connecticut families and individuals who collectively lost $295 million in federal tax credits on Jan. 1 that could have been used to help purchase health insurance.
Access Health CT, the state’s health insurance marketplace, typically opens enrollment on Nov. 15 each year, with the goal of getting most consumers into new or renewed plans effective Jan. 1.
The exchange has extended enrollment through Jan. 31 with the goal of getting most customers into policies by Feb. 1, and another extension is possible, Gualtieri said. And its website does include a page that outlines the income categories for customers eligible for the assistance Lamont outlined last month.
Households with yearly income between 100% and 200% of the Federal Poverty Level could receive a state subsidy equal to 100% of expired federal aid.
And those between 400% and 500% of the FPL could receive state assistance equal to half of expiring federal credits.
But the actual prices reflecting those discounts haven’t been added to the system yet. Connecticut also must develop new contracts with the insurance companies that will receive these new state subsidies, though Gualtieri said that process nearly is complete.
Still, could consumers — particularly those not aware of the governor’s plan — opt not to purchase coverage, believing it to be unaffordable?
James Michel, chief executive officer for Access Health CT, declined to be interviewed, but he wrote in a statement that “IT system changes will take a bit longer to implement.”
Michel added that his organization is taking several outreach steps to eliminate confusion.
Tens of thousands of people currently enrolled, or who were enrolled last year, will begin receiving letters or emails soon with information about the new state subsidy plan. Brokers and program counselors also are prepared with this information and will explain it to customers.
Access Health CT “is working as quickly as possible with the state of Connecticut, the Office of Policy and Management and the insurance companies to put these changes in place and to help Connecticut consumers,” Michel added.
Those who already purchased policies for 2026 but subsequently have learned they’re eligible for the governor’s relief plan can amend those applications online, Gualtieri said.
Both new applicants and those filing amendments should check the appropriate box indicating they are seeking financial help and should include their income information, he added. 
To be eligible for the new state assistance, applicants also must enroll in a “Bronze,” “Silver,” or “Gold” coverage plan. They cannot select a minimal coverage, “catastrophic” plan.
And while consumers could pay higher monthly premiums that don’t reflect Lamont’s assistance plan between now and the end of March, state officials are optimistic those customers would be fully reimbursed through premium discounts later in the year.
“Access Health CT, the state and the insurance carriers’ expectation is an individual will be able to fully maximize the savings,” Gualtieri said, though “there may be a lag to make someone whole.”
Connecticut officials have been scrambling for months to respond to massive changes in federal assistance, both to state governments and directly to households.
The GOP-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump agreed last July to eliminate health insurance tax credits and to cut deeply into Medicaid and nutrition assistance to help finance big federal tax cuts aimed chiefly at high-income households.
Though the U.S. House voted earlier this month to revive those credits, no agreement has been reached yet in the Senate.
“We want to do everything we can to … mitigate the pain and confusion that could impact a lot of people,” Lamont said on Dec. 11.
In a November special session, the General Assembly dedicated $500 million from last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion state budget surplus to mitigate federal cutbacks to health care and other human services, granting the governor broad discretion to assign those funds.
Besides tapping $70 million for a one-year plan to offset eliminated tax credits, Lamont also has assigned $168 million from that reserve to bolster nutrition assistance, Planned Parenthood, programs to combat homelessness and other human service initiatives.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/42992454-8AFD-4D81-A9CA-D704DC2E59E9-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-20 05:56:28.118664

(Getty Images)Some state officials and lawmakers are concerned that New Hampshire’s incoming Medicaid premium system may conflict with provisions in Congress’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
In June, New Hampshire lawmakers passed legislation to begin charging premiums to some New Hampshire Medicaid enrollees. Under the new system, enrollees earning 100% or more of the federal poverty level — which is $15,650 for a single person and $26,650 for a family of three, per 2025’s federal standards — will be required to pay a fee in order to receive health coverage through the program starting later this year.
Meanwhile, Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, a sprawling law that impacts myriad segments of the federal government, including Medicaid, which is run jointly by the state and federal governments. One of the bill’s provisions institutes a cost-sharing program for some Medicaid enrollees in all states. That cost sharing, which goes into effect October 2028, will require enrollees to pay $35 per service for most services (substance use disorder treatment, primary care, institutional long-term care, and others are exempted). But it also caps cost sharing at $35 per service.
In New Hampshire, state officials and lawmakers are concerned the cap would prohibit New Hampshire from charging its premiums.
“And I think there’s open questions about whether you can have both (state premiums and federal cost sharing),” Olivia May, New Hampshire’s director of Medicaid enterprise management, told the Bulletin. “The concern is how to implement them (premiums) while remaining compliant with the cap.”
The state would have until October 2028, when the cap goes into effect, to resolve the issue if it is determined the cap conflicts with the premium system.
May said the state Department of Health and Human Service is asking the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services whether the premiums run afoul of the new law, both because the premiums could exceed the cap and because the department is unsure the state is legally allowed to do both under the law.
“We would need federal permission, basically, to do premiums instead of the cost sharing,” May said. “That’s what we’re seeking CMS guidance on.”
Democrats, who oppose both the state premium system and the federal cost sharing, have used the potential conflict as evidence that the premium system is flawed. Democrats have long opposed the system on grounds it will be a financial burden for low-income families.
“Last spring, the budget enacted premiums for Medicaid before we knew what Congress was going to do,” state Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, of Portsmouth, said at a legislative hearing last week. “The sensible thing for us to do now is to change course and not waste money on a system we can only use for 18 months.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/medicaidkff-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 05:56:28.118664

(Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan Advance)The Trump administration notified agencies last Tuesday night that it was suddenly terminating $2 billion — including millions in Ohio — for programs supporting vulnerable people. Amid a powerful backlash, it reversed itself a day later.
The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, Tuesday night sent letters to public and private providers of services to support children’s mental health, prevent teen suicide, help the homeless, assist the addicted, and other services. 
Across the country, workers in those programs were left to wonder how they’d pay their own bills — and to worry what would happen to those who had suddenly lost their help. 
Even with the reversal of the cuts, the chaos further demoralized social-services workers already reeling from deep Republican cuts to Medicaid and federal food assistance that Trump signed last summer, NPR reported.
SAMHSA is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human services. That agency is led by Robert Kennedy Jr., himself a recovering drug addict who has made highly controversial changes to health policy.
The agency’s letter notified providers that it was terminating programs “if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” 
Mental health and substance-abuse recovery programs were among those being cut despite those priorities being in the agency’s name.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The letter said it wanted to promote “innovative programs and interventions that address the rising rates of mental illness and substance abuse conditions, overdose, and suicide and their connections to chronic diseases, homelessness, and other challenges our (n)ation’s communities face.”
It didn’t address the potential harm that eliminating existing programs with no warning might do to people suffering from those problems. 
The Ohio Children’s Alliance partners with local groups to help young adults aging out of foster care, provide behavioral health care to children, support to vulnerable families, and to provide other services. 
Funding for a program to provide extra help to families caring for children with special needs fell under Tuesday’s sudden budget ax.
“Like many charitable nonprofits across the country, we were caught in the rapid changes around SAMHSA’s grant decisions this week,” Children’s Alliance CEO Mecum said in an email Thursday. 
“One of our major initiatives—focused on building respite care capacity for children and families—was directly affected by the uncertainty. We appreciate our state partners at the Department of Behavioral Health, who have been transparent as we await formal federal guidance.” 
He added, “Regardless of the final outcome, this episode highlights how essential it is for federal funding decisions to be stable and predictable so that states and community organizations can provide reliable, sustainable programs that empower families.” 
Asked for comment on Wednesday, the office of Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and the Department of Behavioral Health said they were monitoring the situation and couldn’t comment further. It’s unclear whether DeWine registered any protest with the Trump administration. 
SAMHSA didn’t respond to a request for comment.
NPR reported an immediate, bipartisan backlash to the sudden cuts, which might explain why they were so quickly rescinded.
But while groups working with vulnerable populations might be breathing a sigh of relief, Tuesday’s cuts weren’t the first the Trump administration made to SAMHSA. 
Early last year, an Elon Musk-led group cut 100 workers at the agency, including some helping to run a 988 suicide and crisis hotline. 
Musk’s group also cut resources to fight the opioid crisis in Ohio.
“Overdose and substance misuse prevention has been particularly targeted by the (Musk) cuts, threatening recent progress in the fight to end the opioid epidemic…” Policy Matters Ohio reported in April. 
“SAMSHA staff also provide the expertise, support, and data tracking to manage the State Opioid and Stimulant Response Grant, a key part of Ohio’s response to the opioid crisis.“

More than three dozen child care organizations around the country signed on to a letter urging the federal government to continue funding child care resources like the Child Care Development Block Grant, and bring back funding that was taken from certain states as fraud allegations in Minnesota circulated.
Ohio’s early childhood advocacy group Groundwork Ohio was one of the groups who signed on.
In the letter, the organizations ask the federal Administration for Children and Families to disburse the funding “without further disruption,” and for Congress to “protect and prioritize child care investments” as they continue to debate the next appropriations bill.
The letter said fraud “at any level is unacceptable and takes valuable child care away from eligible families,” and any funding should be used “wisely and as intended.”
“Simultaneously, it is essential that the strong oversight and internal controls already in place to govern these resources are ensuring the funding is being used properly, and that it continues to reach hard-working, eligible families,” according to the letter.
The Minnesota fraud allegations, first made by a right-wing social media influencer, were parroted by the Trump administration, to the point that the administration froze $10 billion in federal child care funds to select states: Minnesota, California, Colorado, Illinois, and New York.
The move caused leaders in other states, including Ohio, to make statements defending their child care systems, the audits and oversight that happen in their systems, and the need for the federal funding to sustain them.
Gov. Mike DeWine joined with Ohio Department of Children and Youth Director Kara Wente to lay out the verification processes used in the state, and fraud investigation methods that can be used, should any legitimate information come to light.
State data showed nearly 20,000 inspections of licensed child care providers in fiscal year 2025.
A federal judge temporarily blocked the funding freeze to the five states on Jan. 9 as a lawsuit continues, but advocates are still nervous about the future of child care funding.
The fraud allegations and funding freeze come as the child care sector in Ohio and nationwide is still strapped with high demand and high worker turnover, combined with low wages and a lack of access in many areas of the country.
Funding freezes related to fraud are just the latest in a heap of financial issues created on the federal level, from Jan. 2025’s fund-freezing executive orders, to congressional Medicaid cuts, and the impact the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history had on Head Start programs and SNAP benefits.
“Any delays in funding would be catastrophic to a sector already in crisis,” said Ali Smith, of Policy Matters Ohio, in a research brief on the situation.

National groups agreed in a Jan. 13 press briefing that the unpredictability and uncertainty of the sector is already causing problems that will ripple out for years to come, and continuing the losses will only further challenge a system in the country that parents rely on to stay in the workforce, and help families thrive.
“Shutting down federal social services and income assistance funding to selected states will hurt babies, and not fraudsters,” said Melissa Boteach, chief policy officer for Zero to Three, a national non-profit early childhood advocacy group.
Phil Fisher, director of the Stanford Center on Early Childhood said the most recent of the annual national surveys the center conducts shows record rates of hardship for those already struggling to afford what they need.
The center’s RAPID Survey Project was started in April 2020 to study the impacts of policy and programs on child care and early childhood education.
Fisher said in Oct. 2025, the research showed the highest rates of “material hardship,” with 60% of families saying they couldn’t afford at least one of their basic needs, which include utilities, food, health care, housing, and child care.
“At present, we’re actually seeing rates that are considerably higher than we ever saw during the pandemic, with more than half of all families consistently reporting that they can’t pay for things,” Fisher said.
As affordability continues to be a problem in America, the child care funding challenges will continue to impact family decisions on what they can and can’t pay for, according to Fisher.
“And yet, we know that policy, from what we saw during the pandemic, can take a big bite out of these issues if we show the self-discipline to really make sure that things happen,” Fisher said.
At the local level, Smith and Policy Matters Ohio argue that the child care crisis could be helped by moving to an enrollment-based payment system, rather than the attendance-based reimbursement that’s currently in place for Ohio’s Publicly Funded Child Care.
The Administration for Children and Families in 2024 pledged to implement a nationwide payment requirement that would be prospective (pre-paid) and enrollment-based. The Ohio General Assembly put $89 million into the state operating budget to implement the federal rules, but that implementation hasn’t happened yet.
Now, the Trump administration has pushed back the deadline to make those changes into 2028.
Since pushing back the deadline, the federal agency has also introduced a new rule that would rescind that requirement, and maintain the attendance-based rules. Public comment on the federal proposal lasts until Feb. 4.
Smith argued taking away the future enrollment-based payments “will continue the crisis in the child care sector” by maintaining financial instability for providers.

(Photo via Maine Dept. of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife)A family of dedicated spin anglers are taking the state to court, arguing that fly fishing only regulations impede their freedom to harvest fish under Maine’s constitutionally protected right to food. 
The lawsuit, filed last month by Joe and Samantha Legendre in Kennebec County Superior Court, marks the second time Maine’s court system will be asked to interpret whether the Right to Food Amendment supersedes the mandate of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to “preserve, protect, and enhance the inland fisheries and wildlife resources.”
It also marks the second time out-of-state funding has been used to target Fish and Wildlife’s regulatory authority, with lobbyist Jared Borenstein again serving as the lead public spokesperson.
A 2022 lawsuit filed by a different Maine family tried and failed to overturn the state’s centuries-old Sunday hunting ban, arguing the controversial blue law violated the Right to Food Amendment, passed by voters in November 2021.
The latest legal challenge is backed by the International Order of Theodore Roosevelt, a self-described “proactive hunting and conservation foundation” headquartered in Wisconsin. 
Fly fishing only regulations, known throughout the department as FFO, mandate that anglers only use unbaited artificial flies and that those flies be propelled using the weight of the fly line. 
The time and money required for the Legendres and other spin anglers to purchase fly gear and become proficient is an unfair barrier, according to the lawsuit — an impediment Borenstein says prevents Joe, Samantha and their son Justin from accessing some of the most pristine trout waters in the state.
Method-based rules, whether dictating fishing tackle or hunting weaponry, are an oft-deployed tool for regulators tasked with protecting vulnerable species and ecosystems. The earliest FFO regulations were put in place on Yellowstone National Park’s Madison and Firehole Rivers in 1950. Over the last several decades, FFO rules have become more frequently deployed by regulators both out West and here in the East, including in Maine.
Out of Maine’s roughly 6,000 lakes and ponds and over 32,000 miles of rivers and streams, just 200 are listed as fly-fishing-only waters, a small fraction of the state’s total freshwater resource. 
Defenders of the state’s rules say it is no coincidence that those 200 bodies are some of the state’s best trout fishing.
“The reality is, it’s the best fishing because it’s fly fishing only,” said author, registered Maine guide, and avid fly angler Bob Mallard. “These laws were made 40 years ago or more, when there was an abundance of great fishing.”
Now, Mallard said, marginal fishing is the norm in Maine, with the state’s FFO waters serving as some of the best remaining refuge for native brook trout as well as landlocked salmon, the official state fish.
“These regulations were decided by concerned sportsmen that saw cherished resources dwindling away,” Mallard said.
“For a long time in America, we had no regulations,” said Greg Labonte, CEO of Maine Fly Guys, a company focused on education, conservation and affordable fly fishing gear. “And what quickly happened was the extirpation of all kinds of trout populations.”
“Trout are extremely fragile fish,” Labonte said. “If you go below a certain threshold in lakes and rivers, the population simply can’t sustain itself and it collapses.”
Comparing impacts of fly v. spin
The reason fly fishing only rules have helped stave off the destruction of Maine’s brook trout, landlocked salmon and other native species populations is a combination of biological and behavioral science.
Numerous studies have found barbless, single hook flies do less damage to a hooked trout than larger, heavier spin lures, which often feature barbed treble hooks. Part of it is the simple robustness of the tackle, and part of it is the fact that fish tend to attack spin lures, which more easily imitate fleeing bait fish, with more gusto, leading to more deeply set hooks. The research suggests injuries sustained during the catch-and-release process, as well as time spent out of water, are the major drivers of whether a released fish survives.
How Maine’s ‘right to food’ laws clash with tribal food sovereignty

But Mallard, Labonte and others contend that it’s more than the type of interaction that can be studied in a lab. It’s behavior, too.
“In practice, there’s a bigger difference [than in the lab],” Mallard said. “Fly fishing is less impactful than lure fishing. It’s more than just incidental mortality. It’s also a harassment factor.”
“Lure fishermen generally aren’t in the water,” he added. “They’re on the rocks, casting out, bringing fish up onto the rocks and handling them more than they should be.”
Lure fishing isn’t just more burdensome on fish, it’s also simply more efficient.
From a stationary spot on a river bank, the spin angler can rather quickly and easily cast a lure to the majority of places a trout or salmon might be holding. The fly angler, without momentum provided by the heft of an artificial lure, is limited in range and must account for more variables, such as the wind, or the space needed to propel the fly line back and forth while avoiding entanglement in branches and brush. Given these limitations, the fly angler must also change positions to target new spots, sometimes revealing themselves to fish that have evolved a healthy fear of large moving objects.
While an expert fly angler can go toe-to-toe with a competent spin angler, most agree that the average fly angler is much less effective than the average spin angler.










These regulations were decided by concerned sportsmen that saw cherished resources dwindling away.


– Bob Mallard, author and registered Maine guide


Labonte joked that even his young son can cast a spin rod easily — a contrast, he says, to the learning curve many anglers face with fly gear.
“The people who can be a competent rod and reel angler is pretty much everybody,” Labonte said. “Conversely, even people who fly fish are often not very good at it.”
Borenstein, the lobbyist representing the Legendre family, agrees that fly fishing is less efficient, and that’s part of the problem he says.
“You have to have a lot of free time to get good at fly fishing,” Borenstein said.
In other media appearances, Borenstein has emphasized the class dynamics at play, claiming he and the organization he represents would like to see “Maine’s working class have access to all the best waters in Maine.”
The Legendres’ lawsuit describes fly fishing as “a discipline dominated by the wealthy.” It’s a contention that some anglers bristle at, including Mallard, who ran a fly shop in Central Maine for 15-plus years.
“My customers were not wealthy, they were common people, people who worked in the woods, people who worked in the trades,” he said. “This [FFO] is not a matter of class warfare or elitism, it is done for biological reasons.”
Borenstein acknowledged that method-based rules can help relieve pressure on vulnerable fish populations, but argued that fly-fishing-only regulations shouldn’t be used in places where the state is stocking fish and allowing anglers to keep one or more of the fish they catch.
“If these places can sustain a harvest, if you are allowing a take, then the place should not be restricted to fly-fishing-only,” Borenstein said. “You’ve created a resource for them [fly fishers] that’s not available for other people, and we think that’s unjust.”
Asked about the lawsuit, Fisheries and Wildlife said it doesn’t comment on pending litigation. But should the Legendres’ succeed, Borenstein said he expects state regulators to expand catch-and-release-only regulations – rules that prohibit anglers from keeping, or harvesting, any of the fish they catch – in order to keep most of the current FFO rules in place.  
Balancing access with stewardship
The International Order of Theodore Roosevelt mission statement calls for “expanding accessibility” to hunting and fishing, and the group’s flagship policy initiative is advancing right to hunt and fish amendments at the state level. Its materials argue that “hunting is conservation” and that access restrictions weaken America’s conservation funding model.
In addition to invoking the legacy of Teddy Roosevelt, considered by many to be the father of the modern conservation movement, the group’s website features photos of big game hunters and language emphasizing “small government.” In that framing, hunting is presented not only as an expression of personal freedom, but as one of the cultural and economic foundations of conservation itself.
In a follow-up email, Borenstein admitted that the Legendres’ lawsuit could ultimately curtail harvest access, should Fish and Wildlife choose to expand catch-and-release-only regulations, as predicted.

“We would understand that the state was managing the resource in accordance with their mandate contained in the Right to Food Amendment,” he wrote.
Like the national group, the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine, known as SAM, is concerned about outsider groups and animal rights activists influencing how Mainers use and manage their natural resources, pointing to the failed 2014 bear trapping referendum that saw significant outside spending. 
The organization, with a mission to “enhance and preserve Maine’s outdoor heritage,” was intimately involved in the conception of the state’s Right to Food Amendment, and previously pushed for the lifting of Maine’s Sunday hunting ban.
But SAM and its leadership argue the Legendre’s lawsuit runs counter to their own mission.
“This is a direct assault on the management of the resource,” said David Trahan, SAM president and an avid hunter and angler. “We did not want the Right to Food Amendment used in this manner. We see this as a frivolous lawsuit.”
Trahan said he’s concerned efforts to undermine the state’s ability to manage natural resources could embolden ongoing efforts across the country to privatize natural resource access.
“We understand private property rights, but when you start selling the resource, you cross the line in my mind,” Trahan said. “The deer, the moose, the bear, the fish, they belong to all of us. But when you start piecemealing it, saying only the wealthy or large landowners can have access to the resource, that’s unjust. I think that’s what the Right to Food Amendment is trying to prevent.”
Every conservation group has a different set of priorities, but most see access not as primary but as one part of a complex whole – an important need that must be considered and weighed against others’ needs, such as the biological and ecological needs of a healthy trout population.
Maine Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Winthrop), one of the original sponsors and primary driver of the Right to Food Amendment, said no right is absolute and that competing interests must be balanced against one another. But he sees his amendment as a way to reframe the state’s public policy toward seriously addressing the problem of hunger and the cause of food autonomy.
“I see the Right to Food as a way of making the entire state more food self-sufficient,” Hickman said.
Hickman was complimentary of the court’s deliberation and ultimate determination that Maine’s longstanding ban on Sunday hunting did not violate the state constitution. Though Hickman and his colleagues deployed intentionally broad language when writing the amendment, they worked with state regulators to ensure they would protect the state’s ability to effectively manage shared resources.
Hickman doesn’t view the latest lawsuit as helping his cause or honoring its intent, nor does he expect it to be successful.
“I think it is people using this shiny new tool to advance their own agenda,” he said. “Courts see patterns, and I don’t think they’re going to go for it.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/595199729_1265284278966490_5813244131989111576_n-1024x677.jpg,,,2026-01-20 04:57:39.701568

(Photo by Christina Frazier)Ten years ago this January, I began to worry about my upcoming birthday.
It was one of those ages that sits neatly on a ten, and as a computer scientist who pays attention to numbers, that symmetry carried weight. At the same time, I was looking forward to the April publication of my first book, “The Last Wild Places of Kansas: Journeys into Hidden Landscapes,” a project I had been wandering toward long before I ever wrote a word of it.
While I was working on the book, as I began finding places so remarkable I couldn’t believe they were in Kansas, I was at a loss for what to call them. They weren’t wilderness in the academically charged sense of the “Wilderness Act of 1964.” I decided to call them simply “wild places.”
This spawned the question that shaped the book: What do we mean when we call a place wild? The environmental poet Gary Snyder describes it as a place where nature is in charge, a system self-regulated by nature processes. But what does natural even mean as we slog our way into the Anthropocene? Descriptions always fall short. It is better to take someone by the hand and point.
One frigid March night in ye gone days, my friend Alan and I were in a downtown Lawrence bar. We were both graduate students at the University of Kansas. While the Replacements and Husker Du played on the jukebox, we pored over a new publication on the status of greater prairie chickens in Kansas.
Tympanuchus cupido populations had been declining for 50 years. The main reason was habitat loss. More than 95 percent of the tallgrass prairie that the birds rely on had been plowed in the 150 years since Euro-Americans began carving farms from Midwestern grasslands. The Kansas Flint Hills and central Nebraska held the only remaining healthy populations. A time series of maps in the paper animated this shrinking territory at roughly 10-year spans.
As far as we knew, nobody had seen a prairie chicken in Douglas County, where Lawrence is located, for years, but a faint cross hatching in one of the maps teased that prairie chickens had been present in southwest Douglas County, near the hamlets of Worden and Globe, as recently as 20 years earlier.
Could prairie chickens still be hanging on near Lawrence, we wondered? They were the closest thing to free-roaming bison or buffalo wolves left in the eastern prairie. I had never seen a prairie chicken, but Alan grew up in the Flint Hills and knew what to look for. Tortured by the possibility, we left the bar, loaded up my car with camping equipment, and drove off into the night in search of ghosts.
At about 2 in the morning, we stopped beside a small lake to make a fire and rest. We slept on open ground, in bivy sacs instead of a tent. A screech owl purred somewhere in the pines. Occasionally the moon peeked through the clouds in bursts of amber.
Well before first light, a park officer woke us with the beam of his flashlight. We were sleeping in an area off-limits to camping and had to leave. As we packed up our gear, the officer shared his coffee with us. He lived near Globe. We told him our plan, and he said he had heard there were still a few prairie chickens in a pasture near US Highway 56, a two-lane road built on the ruins of the old Santa Fe Trail. Back in the car, we spread out road maps but eventually just began driving mile after mile on dirt roads.
Eventually we reached a large pasture in the general area the officer told us about and parked in a cemetery. A perimeter of section roads, each a mile long, bounded the prairie. We left the car and started hiking along the roads in a quagmire of mud and melting snow.
As the eastern sky began to soften with violet light, we noticed wallows in the prairie, ovals of earth compacted centuries before by buffalo rolling in the mud. They stood out from the taller grasses.
Walking once more, I saw what I thought were a dozen geese coming to land about a quarter mile from us in the pasture. Alan shouted: “Prairie chickens!”
The birds landed in a squat patio of trampled grass. As we watched through field glasses, the males began to drone like Tibetan monks and promenade in an ancient springtime mating ritual. It felt like we were in a dream.
Others had rediscovered these last Douglas County prairie chickens, in the finest remaining large prairie in the county. Three years later, the birds disappeared and today there are no prairie chickens in Douglas County. But on that cold spring morning, their booming incantations and the spooky heebie-jeebies of ghost buffalo made us feel like we’d tumbled into a wormhole connecting the past and a remnant of an ecosystem that we hoped teetered on the brink of renewal, part of the remaining wilderness heritage of the once vast American interior grassland.
There are no maps for these kinds of experiences.
In my travels, I found hundreds of similar places, where the vortex of history blooms in a great collision of nature and folklore. I wrote “The Last Wild Places of Kansas” not as cartographical exercise, but to share a process, a methodology for others to create their own maps. I have continued the work in a second book, “Riverine Dreams: Away to the Glorious and Forgotten Grassland Rivers of America.”
Ten years on, as another birthday approaches, I’ve met hundreds of people who feel as strongly as I do that Kansas wild places are unique in the pantheon of American wilderness. They are as important as redwood groves, Yellowstone geysers, and Rocky Mountain fourteeners.
My fellow Ad Astrians, never let anyone scoff you into believing that Kansas doesn’t have wild places worth fighting for. If you read my books, I hope you will form your own opinions about what does and does not qualify as wild in the Midwest and that you will come to better appreciate the singular natural legacy of places like Kansas.
If you already understand the subtle beauty and biological complexity of one square meter of prairie, or visit a cat run of wild pawpaw groves each September, or have wandered, awe-soaked, in centuries-old pecan groves along the Missouri or Marais des Cygnes rivers, or have consulted Amtrak schedules to see if you could hop out at Cimarron National Grasslands and catch a ride back after three days camping in the sand sage, then you already understand the central premise of my writing: Kansas and the Midwest still have wild places that matter.
For everybody else, read the book and get ready to change the way you feel about Kansas.

The basketball action around the state is ramping up with a little over four weeks until the regular season comes to an end. Here’s a quick recap of what happened in Delaware high school girls basketball between January 12 and January 18. 
 
Concord’s winning streak increases to five games
The Raiders finished a stretch of three straight road games earning victories over Hodgson and Glasgow, last week. Four different Raider players scored in double digits in their win over the Silver Eagles on Tuesday and junior Angelena Gabrysh scored 22 of Concord’s 52 points in its win over the Dragons, Thursday. The Raiders are undefeated against in-state competition this season with their only losses coming against a pair of Pennsylvania schools. Since then, the Raiders are on a five game winning streak scoring 50 or more points in each win. The Raiders next game will be at home against Archmere, Thursday afternoon. 
Sanford continues its strong season with two wins
The Warriors continued their impressive season with a pair of wins against Wilmington Friends and Smyrna, last week. Sanford scored over 60 points in both games continuing a stretch of four straight games scoring 60 or more points. Sophomore Aslyn Merrell led the team in scoring against Friends putting up a game-high 22 points. Junior Asia Adams led the team in their game against Smyrna, scoring 22 points in that win. The Warriors are 9-1 this season with their only loss coming against Bishop Ireton in Virginia. Bishop Ireton is the third ranked school in the state, according to Sports Illustrated. 
Odessa wins two straight continuing its winning streak

The Ducks continued their strong stretch of play with two victories last week defeating St. Andrew’s School and Hodgson. Odessa scored 39 points in a close game against St. Andrew’s that ended with the Ducks winning by four points. Junior Tori Richardson led the team with 14 points in that game and on Thursday, scored a game-high 21 to help Odessa defeat the Silver Eagles. The Ducks haven’t lost in over a month and are on a nine game win streak that began December 6, 2025. 
Tatnall bolsters record with undefeated week
The Hornets defeated Newark High School and Tower Hill last week, increasing their record to 7-4 this season. Tatnall’s defense played well in both games, holding its opponents to a combined 52 points across the two games. The Hornets held the Yellow Jackets under double digit points in each quarter of their win Tuesday and allowed only two points in the second quarter in their win against the Hillers, Thursday. Senior Jordan Cooke and Freshman Eva Baxter paced the offense scoring a combined 64 points across the two games. Tatnall will play twice this week taking on St. Georges on the road and Brandywine at home.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_fki0hwfki0hwfki0.png,,,2026-01-20 00:57:36.698503

His office has been an active participant with other Democratic attorneys general challenging the Trump administration. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)To Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D), it’s about stopping the “chaos coming from Washington” since President Donald Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, 2025.
Brown was reflecting last week on his part in the push by 23 attorneys general from Democratic states and the District of Columbia to challenge Trump administration policies in court. Planning for the lawsuits began after Trump’s election in 2024 and were guided by policies outlined in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, which served as a policy roadmap for the administration and the Republican-controlled Congress.
The first suit was filed the day after Trump’s swearing-in, challenging his attempt to end birthright citizenship. All told, the attorneys general have filed 71 lawsuits against the administration over the past year, with more to come this year.
Brown’s office has led, co-led or joined in more than 100 legal actions – taking part in 51 of the lawsuits, with the rest in briefs filed in support of others’ suits.
“I told Marylanders that I believe that chaos was coming from Washington, and it was putting Marylanders and Americans at risk. Well, chaos came,” Brown said.
Democratic state attorneys general will continue to lead opposition to Trump in new year

In the state’s legal fight against the Trump administration, Brown said during a press briefing the office’s Federal Accountability Unit has helped to preserve billions of dollars in federal funding toward transportation, education, environmental protection and other services.
Maryland sued to restore nearly $400 million for the AmeriCorps program (nearly $15 million in Maryland), to stop the administration from laying off thousands of employees with the federal Department of Health and Human Services and to ensure funding is provided for residents to receive gender-affirming care.
Brown’s office led in an amicus brief filed in October that called the Trump administration’s attempted deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois “unlawful, unconstitutional and undemocratic.” Two months later, the U.S. Supreme Court kept an injunction in place to block from the administration from deploying the troops.
Federal judges did grant preliminary injunctions on several cases filed by the attorneys general, such as the administration refusing to release about $5 billion under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, and not allowing the Trump administration to block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood and other health care providers.
Various lawsuits are pending, including a claim by the state and Prince George’s County in November against the administration’s plans to cancel an apporved plan to move the FBI headquarters to Greenbelt, and instead keep the agency in downtown Washington, D.C.
Maryland is leading a lawsuit filed three weeks ago against the U.S. Department of Education. That suit, joined by attorneys general from D.C. and North Carolina, challenges what it calls “unlawful cuts” to congressionally approved funding for Full Service Community School (FSCS) programs.
“We protected rights such as Maryland’s voting rights, whereby executive order that the administration attempted to restrict voting rights in Maryland and around the country,” he said. “So, these are issues and matters that … Marylanders care about.
One year of Donald Trump: Alarms sound over relentless expansion of presidential powers

“I would invite anyone to point to a specific action we brought [against the administration] … when we’re bringing back and saving hundreds of millions of dollars for Marylanders,” he said.
Lawsuits against an administration by the party out of power are hardly new: Republican attorneys general filed scores of suits against President Joe Biden (D), with Texas alone filing more than 100.
But not everyone in Maryland agrees the legal battles are necessary or advisable now, especially with the state facing a $1.5 billion budget deficit.
“There’s been numerous lawsuits over the Trump administration on what I think, on many subject matters that the overwhelming majority of Marylanders agree with,” said Del. Matt Morgan (R-St. Mary’s), chair of the seven-member House Freedom Caucus. “Years ago, politicians used to put the country ahead of their own ambitions and political parties. I’m not sure that’s happening in Maryland.”
But House Majority Leader David Moon (D-Montgomery) said Brown and other attorneys general are just doing what they have to do to challenge the Trump administration’s actions.
“I feel really bad for the attorney general because I’m not sure if he knew he was signing up when he ran for office to be a debt collector,” Moon said. “The attorney general is in court simply trying to get the administration, which is tasked with enforcing the laws, to follow the laws.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-20 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Childcare is essential infrastructure,Adrienne W. Cochrane,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/childcare-is-essential-infrastructure-for-connecticut/,There is no functioning economy without childcare. It is a load-bearing support for the workforce.,"YWCA Hartford Region is deeply concerned by recent federal actions that delay or disrupt childcare funding. 
Childcare is not a discretionary service — it is essential infrastructure, as critical to family and economic stability as housing or transportation. When childcare funding is weakened, families, employers and Connecticut’s economy feel the impact immediately. 
These effects are not abstract; they are visible every day in the lives of working parents who rely on safe, stable, and affordable care to maintain employment.
What happened?
Recently, federal officials announced new documentation and verification requirements connected to the Child Care and Development Fund  (CCDF). Although described as a procedural review, the practical effect is that states must complete additional verification steps before federal dollars are released. This has resulted in funding freezes or delayed reimbursements in several states. More than $10 billion affecting California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and New York was held pending intensified review. 
A federal judge has since temporarily paused parts of this freeze, allowing funding to resume in those five states while the legal challenges move forward.
Connecticut was not on the list of states where funds were withheld, reflecting strong state compliance and robust fiscal oversight. At this time, Connecticut has not experienced documented, statewide childcare service disruptions. However, the uncertainty itself is destabilizing. Because reimbursements rely in part on federal systems and timelines, any national delay or administrative slowdown can affect Connecticut providers’ confidence and planning.
Childcare is essential infrastructure
Even without active disruption, the instability created by federal shifts is harmful. Childcare providers operate on thin margins; delayed payments, added paperwork, and unclear timelines place strain on their capacity to maintain staffing ratios, program hours, and classroom safety. Connecticut’s families depend on federal and state partnership functioning smoothly. Sudden changes — even if temporary — place pressure on the entire system.
Federal instability threatens local stability
While Connecticut remains operational, the heightened federal verification requirements have created anxiety among providers who worry about future delays. The state must continue monitoring federal guidance closely, as disruptions in neighboring states can spill into Connecticut through regional workforce ties. Many Connecticut families work across state lines, and staffing shortages or closures in bordering communities could affect Connecticut’s labor force, particularly in health care, transportation, retail, and service industries.
Childcare is the load-bearing support of the economy
Connecticut has been proactive in strengthening childcare infrastructure. State actions include targeted operational grants during the pandemic, expansions in Care 4 Kids eligibility, and ongoing Office of Early Childhood (OEC) reforms to streamline oversight and improve access. Additionally, the state has developed workforce initiatives such as scholarships, credentialing supports, and compensation enhancements to stabilize the educator pipeline. These efforts have positioned Connecticut ahead of many states — but they remain vulnerable to federal funding uncertainty, which directly impacts reimbursements and long-term financial planning.
Connecticut’s working families depend on childcare 
In the Greater Hartford region, many families already live on the edge of economic insecurity. Single parents, women, families of color, immigrant households, and ALICE families — Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed — rely on stable childcare to stay employed in jobs that rarely offer flexibility or remote options. 
Research shows that childcare upholds parental employment. For example, Head Start participation has been tied to children meeting age-appropriate expectations and parents gaining or maintaining employment, with 90% of surveyed families reporting that the program helped them keep or get a job. When childcare is disrupted, consequences are proven to extend beyond individual families. 
Workforce and economic impact 
Childcare is a cornerstone of workforce participation. According to economic analyses by Bipartisan Policy Center, gaps in childcare access could cost the U.S. economy up to $329 billion over the next decade in lost productivity, labor shortages, and reduced income.  
Even before this latest funding threat, childcare was already stretching many families’ budgets. National data show that childcare can cost families as much as 10–13% of household income, making it one of the largest household expenses after housing. Meanwhile, the childcare workforce — overwhelmingly women — is paid significantly less than the average worker, and many childcare workers themselves struggle to make ends meet.  
In Connecticut specifically, these economic pressures are real. When childcare fails as a support structure, workforce participation suffers. Employers experience higher absenteeism and turnover; productivity decreases, and business operations — especially in health care, hospitality, and manufacturing — face instability. Childcare is not a support service — it is a workforce necessity. 
Children lose too 
Children are directly impacted by childcare instability. Early childhood is a critical period of brain development. Staffing shortages, reduced classroom hours, or turnover can disrupt routines and affect cognitive, social, and emotional growth. Even perceived instability can raise stress levels for both children and families.
We must act now
Although Connecticut is not experiencing active disruption today, the national uncertainty surrounding childcare funding is a clear warning sign. Federal instability can quickly impact state systems, and Connecticut’s progress must be protected. Ensuring uninterrupted funding, maintaining state-level investments, and safeguarding access for every family are urgent priorities.
A stable childcare system is the foundation of a strong and equitable future for Connecticut.

It is doing the work too.”
In a world that feels louder, faster, and more divided by the day, it’s easy to believe that meaningful change requires massive effort, deep pockets, or heroic sacrifice. It doesn’t.

Ken Engelman

Sometimes, all it takes is 30 minutes.

Thirty minutes a week.
Thirty minutes a month.
Even thirty minutes once a quarter.

That small window of time – often lost to scrolling, streaming, or worrying – can become one of the most powerful investments you’ll ever make when given to a local community nonprofit.
The value to the community: Small help, real impact
Local nonprofits are the quiet backbone of our communities. They feed families, support veterans, protect animals, mentor students, care for seniors, and respond when government systems fall short. Yet most operate with limited budgets, skeletal staff, and volunteers who are already stretched thin.
When someone offers even a short, consistent block of time, it matters more than most people realize.
Thirty minutes might mean:

Updating a flyer or social post that brings in new donors
Making a few thank-you calls that strengthen donor relationships
Helping organize supplies, files, or schedules
Sharing professional insight that saves a nonprofit time and money

These organizations don’t need perfection – they need participation. And when communities step up, local nonprofits become stronger, more sustainable, and more responsive to real needs.
The value to the volunteer: Purpose you can feel
Volunteering isn’t charity – it’s connection. It’s pro bono services that helps everyone. People who give their time often discover something unexpected: they receive just as much as they give.
Volunteering restores perspective. It reminds us that our skills matter beyond paychecks and job titles. It reconnects us to neighbors we may never have met. It provides a sense of purpose that no algorithm can deliver.
For professionals especially, volunteering offers:

A renewed sense of meaning and fulfillment
Opportunities to use talents in creative, human-centered ways
Reduced stress and increased mental well-being
Stronger ties to the community they live in – not just pass through

In a culture that measures success by income and status, volunteering reframes success as contribution. That shift is powerful.
The value to humanity: Sharing what made us successful
Every skill you used to build your career – communication, organization, leadership, creativity, strategy – was shaped with the help of others: teachers, mentors, communities, opportunities.
Volunteering is how we pay that forward.
When people share their hard-earned abilities with local nonprofits, something profound happens: experience becomes legacy. Knowledge becomes service. Success becomes shared.
Caring about local nonprofits isn’t just about helping “others.” It’s about reinforcing the idea that we belong to one another. That progress isn’t individual. That humanity works best when compassion and contribution are normalized – not exceptional.
Thirty minutes won’t fix everything. But multiplied across neighborhoods, towns, and cities, it creates momentum. And momentum creates change.
The ask is simple:

You don’t need to overhaul your life.
You don’t need to volunteer forever.
You don’t need to do it all.

Just show up – briefly, consistently, and sincerely. Give a little time. Share what you know. Care where you live.
Because when people choose to give back – even in small ways – communities grow stronger, individuals grow more fulfilled, and humanity becomes a little more human.
Thirty minutes. That’s it. That’s enough.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-20 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,When a ‘bad-tempered doofus’ runs the world,Sallie Marsico,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/when-a-bad-tempered-doofus-runs-the-world/,Pay attention when a U.S. president says something both belligerent and strange to the leader of a European NATO nation.,"President Trump is not the first leader in Western civilization to see himself, as he says, “the only one who matters.” 
Western civilization is littered with rulers who convinced themselves that “there is only one person who is master in this empire and I am not going to tolerate any other” – Wilhelm II, Germany’s Kaiser from 1888 to 1918. 
Numerous wildly misguided European kings and one Fuhrer led their countries into war with neighboring states throughout the 19th and 20th centuries – with disastrous consequences: Napoleon III initiated the Franco-Prussian war, which was a disaster for France. Kaiser Wilhem II of Germany banked his country’s future on its ability to overpower France in 1914.  We all know how that turned out. Spoiler Alert: it was not good – and definitely not to the benefit of Germany.
So, when a U.S. president says something both belligerent and strange to the leader of a European NATO nation, one is inclined to take more than passing note: 
“Considering your country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped eight wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace…” President Donald Trump, to the Prime Minister of Norway, Sunday, January 18.
 If this is a threat, it is hardly veiled. Wars between European trading partners began on grounds of considerably less during the 19th and 20th centuries.
Whatever his motivations, beyond being obsessed with militarism, Kaiser Wilhem II was more than a tad myopic in waging war against the neighboring nation of France. In 1914 France “was a top destination for German exports”  –  ahead of Russia. France contributed to Germany’s balance of trade, positively and significantly. The Kaiser’s Germany was the direct beneficiary of multiple millions of dollars in trade with France, which plummeted, disastrously, after Wilhelm’s declaration of war in August of 1914, after declaring war on Russia three days earlier.
Presently, there can be no disagreement over the fact that the European Union is a “premier trading partner for the U.S.; it is the largest trading bloc and a top destination for export of U.S. goods and services – exceeding $1.5 trillion in trade.” The reality that the EU has “a massive, deeply integrated economic relationship with the U.S., underpinning millions of jobs” cannot be denied. The EU trade deficit with the U.S. can hardly be grounds for grievance worthy of unsettling the peace between Europe and the U.S. –  unless the U.S. State Department and the Department of Commerce are totally inept. (Quotes from an AI overview.)
Where is the fly in the ointment that could undermine peace between two longstanding compatible nations? Alain Berset, secretary general of the Council on Europe says, “I did not think that I would ever have to write about the possibility of the United States taking military action against a member state (of NATO). Yet, here we are. President Trump has vowed to make Greenland – a semiautonomous territory of Denmark….part of the United States, and that he will do so ‘the easy way’ or “the hard way.”
Wake up people!
This fight is not necessary. This fight is more than dangerous; this fight would be deadly. To be over a perceived slight? What’s not ridiculous about that?
A rather extraordinary similarity of personality characteristics exists between Germany’s Kaiser of 1914 and America’s president of 2026. Based on English historian M.J. Carter’s consequential historic analysis, none are flattering. As Carter says, “You don’t really want a narcissist in control of global power.” (See The New Yorker, reprint, “What Happens When A Bad-Tempered Distractable Doofus Runs an Empire.” By Miranda Carter,  June 6, 2018.

There was plenty of action on the court throughout the state last week including an undefeated week from St. Georges, Smyrna and others. Here is a quick recap of what happened in Delaware high school boys basketball between January 12 and January 18.
 
Hawks bounce back with two win week
St. Georges entered last week following a pair of losses the week prior, but it bounced back with road victories over Appoquinimink and Burlington City High School — located in New Jersey. The Hawks scored 21 points in the fourth quarter against the Jaguars and 21 in the second quarter against the Burlington Blue Devils in their pair of wins. Senior Joshua Obiora led the team in scoring both games with 18 and 15 points respectively. Obiora is the team’s leading scorer this season with 216 total points through 11 games.
Smyrna earns big win in undefeated week
The Eagles started their week with a big matchup against Cape Henlopen. The Vikings entered the game as Delaware Online’s third ranked team in the state with eight wins and only one loss. Smyrna delivered Cape Henlopen’s second loss of the season beating the Vikings, 49-43, Tuesday night. Seniors Chase Sullivan and Logan Shaw paced the Eagle’s offense with a combined 30 points and the Smyrna defense played well holding Cape Henlopen to its lowest point total this season. The Eagles finished their week with a double-digit victory over Caesar Rodney to bring their season record to 7-3.
Concord starts five game homestand with a pair of wins
The Raiders won two of their three games this week beginning their five game homestand with wins over Hodgson and Glasgow. Four Concord players scored in double figures in its first win against Hodgson on Tuesday and a 21-point performance by senior Carlin Hollis helped Concord to its third win in a row, Thursday. The Raiders one loss this week came against Appoquinimink on Saturday, disrupting the Raiders’ win streak. The Raiders begin this week with an 8-3 record and will conclude their homestand with games against Christiana and John Dickinson.
Dover increases its winning streak to eight
The Senators won all three of their games this week by double figures staying undefeated in the month of January. Dover scored 90 points in its first game of the week with over half of those points coming in the second half. The Senators scored 29 points in the second quarter of their win over Sussex Tech and in their final game of the week senior Tarrance Williams led all players with 21 points, defeating Howard. Dover’s only loss this season happened in mid December against Bergen Catholic in New Jersey — the 77th ranked program in the country by MaxPreps. Since then, the Senators have scored 90 or more points twice and won by double digits all but twice.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_kr8773kr8773kr87.png,,,2026-01-19 23:56:46.278677

Bernie Sanders has endorsed activist Analilia Mejia in the 12-person race to succeed Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill in Congress.,"Vermont Sen.

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)WAYNE — Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders slammed Donald Trump as a “narcissistic, mentally unstable” president to a crowd of about 1,200 on the William Paterson University campus on Monday at a campaign event boosting congressional candidate Analilia Mejia.
During a 40-minute speech, Sanders said wealth inequality is plaguing the United States, criticized the role money plays in politics, and advocated for electing more progressives to positions of power.
“When we stand together, not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we will create the type of nation and government the American people deserve,” said Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.

Mejia is one of 11 Democrats vying in a Feb. 5 special primary to win their party’s nomination in the race to fill the House vacancy left when Mikie Sherrill resigned to become governor (Sherrill will be sworn in Tuesday at noon).
A Glen Ridge activist and former Sanders staffer, Mejia took the stage to the strains of Jay-Z’s “Public Service Announcement” and then took aim at corporate greed and authoritarianism.
Growing up as the daughter of immigrants who fled political and economic violence, Mejia relied on free health clinics and food pantries, and sometimes went without meals, she said. She hears similar stories of economic struggle from her neighbors now, she added.
“This world doesn’t feel built to represent, to allow us all to thrive. This world, our economy, our democracy, seems captured by big money, by oligarchs, by people who care more about adding another zero to their offshore bank account or trading in stocks when they shouldn’t be,” she said.
The line about trading stock is an apparent shot at former Rep. Tom Malinowski, another candidate in the race to succeed Sherrill. The Office of Congressional Ethics in 2021 alleged Malinowski, who served two terms in the House starting in 2019, violated federal laws by not timely disclosing stock sales made by his broker, an error Malinowski has said was a careless mistake.
Sanders’ stop at William Paterson University was part of his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour. The former presidential candidate — who often co-headlines with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D), another Mejia backer — has drawn thousands of people at his rallies nationwide.
On Monday, more than 500 people listened to the speakers from a separate room, where Sanders and Mejia delivered hot chocolate before addressing the raucous crowd.
Sanders’ appearance in Wayne underscores the national attention on the race to succeed Sherrill in the 11th Congressional District, which includes towns in Essex, Morris, and Passaic counties. The district was a Republican stronghold until Sherrill flipped it to the Democratic column in 2018, and its boundaries have since changed to make it a safer seat for Democrats to win.
In addition to Malinowski and Mejia, the Democrats competing in the Feb. 5 primary are: Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett; Army veteran and businessman Zachary Beecher; attorney and comedian J-L Cauvin; former Obama staffer Cammie Croft; Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill; Morris Township Committeeman Jeff Grayzel; Chatham Councilman Justin Strickland, a U.S. Army veteran; Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way; and community activist Anna Lee Williams.
The winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican Randolph Mayor Joe Hathaway, who is running unopposed in the GOP primary, on April 16.

During Monday’s rally, hundreds of audience members chanted “Sign the bill!” to urge Gov. Phil Murphy to sign legislation on his desk that would codify and expand protections for undocumented immigrants and limit local cooperation with federal immigration agents. Murphy leaves office Tuesday at noon, and any legislation he doesn’t sign by then will not become law.
During Mejia’s speech, the crowd also chanted “Abolish ICE!”
“It is shameful that those with power sit on their hands while working people are out in the streets, armed with whistles, demanding justice — braver than anything I’ve ever seen at a Congress,” she said.
Mejia’s campaign has criticized her opponents for being part of the “political machine,” which Gill has taken to mean a swipe at him because he has the support of numerous Democratic officials from Essex and Morris counties. Asked about Mejia’s support from Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, Gill noted that they are “out of state” members of Congress.
“That doesn’t hold a lot of weight with me because I don’t really know what that person would know about the local issues that the communities that you’re seeking to represent are basically,” Gill said.

Way, like Gill, questioned whether support from non-Jersey Democrats will resonate with voters in the 11th District.
“From day one, as a county commissioner up until now, my focus is just being on the voters, right, and their interests. They’re worried about their rights, their wallets, the personal attacks, and that is why I am in this race. And I’m going to deliver for them as I have done in the past,” Way said.
Hathaway said he thinks the Sanders event is part of the Democratic Party’s move “toward socialism, antisemitism, anti-law enforcement.”
“I truly believe that voters in New Jersey, I don’t care if they’re Democrats, Republicans, independents, I don’t think people want that brand of representative in Washington,” he said. “People want someone who’s going to go down there and work just as hard as they are to make life a little better.”

We are past sentiment and nostalgia. We will be in crisis if we do not act.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Linda Smith: Education reform requires hard choices.","Dear Editor,



I am a school board member, but I write today as a past teacher. I am a Democrat, but I support the governor’s efforts to change our education system because we will be in crisis otherwise.
Almost three years ago, the Joint Fiscal Office Report identified possible options to contain educational costs, including encouraging or mandating more mergers, consolidating administrative services and moving education spending decisions to a statewide level. 
But there was very little discussion about managing administration. 
We have 52 supervisory unions and 119 districts. I understand that reducing the number to 12 or 13 might be too drastic to start with, but if we cut it by just half, there would be savings.
Do we have too many buildings for 80,000 students and 630,000 people in our state? There is only so much money in the pot. There will be very little money coming from the federal government. 
Moving some of the children 15 to 30 minutes away to another school and closing a small school could be an option. Why are we spending money that could be used for children on buildings?
We do not need more administration. We need more teachers in classrooms. We may have fewer children, but teachers today handle more emotional needs of the students than in the past. 
The number of children requiring special education is growing in the state. Consolidation would help with some of the costs. However, what I often hear from neighbors is “We want to keep our little school with 60 children.” We are past sentiment and nostalgia. We will be in crisis if we do not act.
The supervisory unions have curriculum directors. Are we so big that we cannot have a statewide curriculum? Principals and teachers are smart enough to take a statewide curriculum and adapt it to their needs. What is so different that each supervisory union must have a separate one?
I love town schools. But I know that things have to change. 
Linda M.W. Smith, Poultney, Vt.

(Leah Romero for Source New Mexico)As communities in New Mexico and across the country respond to the Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies and roundups by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico Director Leon Howard marked Martin Luther King Jr. Day by calling on New Mexicans to stand with their neighbors and “with every community under threat.”
Howard, who took over the ACLU’s New Mexico branch in June 2025, was the keynote speaker at this year’s MLK Day brunch, hosted annually by the Doña Ana County Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He spoke to a packed ballroom at the Las Cruces Convention Center, highlighting King’s words from his 1963 “I have a dream speech” as his theme: “fierce urgency of now.”
“He didn’t describe it as panic or chaos,” Howard said of the quote from King. “He meant the danger of getting used to injustice. The danger of letting the unacceptable become normal. And we’re living in a moment when the unacceptable keeps trying to present itself as everyday life.”
Howard pointed to Indigenous Americans who experienced the “machine of state power” first, and the minority communities that have been singled out in the years since — from slave patrols in the 1700s and the Chinese Exclusion Act in the 1800s, to internment of Japanese-Americans in the 1940s and profiling people of Mexican and Latin descent today.
Howard spoke of Presley Eze, a Black Las Cruces resident who was killed by a Las Cruces police officer with a gunshot to the back of the head in 2022. “Presley’s death is not an isolated tragedy,” he said. “It’s one point on a long line that stretches back through American history.”
“We have been litigating the same exact issue for generations, and now we have a new version: stops based on race, accent, language, type of work, location. A cluster of factors that government claims to create reasonable suspicion,” Howard said. “These enforcement patterns are old. The vocabulary is new.”
Howard said King’s calls for people to be good neighbors were not meant for only people who look the same or believe in the same things, but anyone in need. “[King] taught us the real test of our humanity is what we do for people who the world has decided are easy to ignore,” Howard said. 
But New Mexico has taken steps to push back against the Trump administration’s immigration policies, Howard noted, speaking of an updated “Welcoming Community” resolution the Las Cruces City Council passed in October 2025. The resolution updates a previous 2017 resolution by calling for stronger immigrant protections in the “immigrant-friendly” community and provides updated guidance for how the city responds to federal law enforcement. 
The resolution does not go so far as to designate Las Cruces as a formal sanctuary city. The Trump administration has repeatedly threatened so-called sanctuary cities with funding cuts, and included Albuquerque on a list last summer of such jurisdictions.
“That choice stands as a model the rest of the state and country should take seriously. That kind of courage doesn’t come out of nowhere,” Howard said of the Las Cruces resolution. “It comes from tradition, by standing with every community under threat.” 
He pointed out that collaboration between the NAACP and ACLU has a long history, such as the Brown v. Board of Education lawsuit that resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court finding segregated education unconstitutional. “Organizations work together not because it’s politically convenient, but because when injustice spreads across communities, the response has to spread too,” Howard said. “And if there’s one group who can’t afford to step back in this moment, it’s the next generation.”
Doña Ana County NAACP President Bobbie Green told the audience that the organization has long played a “critical role in social advocacy,” but “never, in my lifetime anyway, has advocacy been more critical than the fierce urgency of now.” (Leah Romero for Source New Mexico)
Doña Ana County NAACP President Bobbie Green told the audience that the organization has long played a “critical role in social advocacy,” but “never, in my lifetime anyway, has advocacy been more critical than the fierce urgency of now.” 
Green also said she and various local NAACP chapters are working with the ACLU of New Mexico, the New Mexico attorney general and state lawmakers to support a bill this legislative session to update in-service training curriculum for law enforcement in the state – a step toward reforming state law enforcement during a time when federal enforcement has been criticized.
State Sen. Antonio Maestas (D-Albuquerque) told Source New Mexico that the bill would authorize the New Mexico Law Enforcement Standards and Training Council to develop updated “evidence-based curriculum” for officers to complete on a constant basis, rather than every two years as is the current requirement. The bill would not address the initial training officers receive in the academy. He said he, Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte) and Rep. Pamelya Herndon (D-Albuquerque) have collaborated during the interim, along with local sheriffs and police chiefs, and intend to cosponsor the bill.
“[The curriculum] has not been updated in decades,” Maestas said. “What we’d like to do is evolve policing in New Mexico to constant training; weekly, monthly training….Regardless of where people are coming from in terms of policing, everyone should be happy with this bill.”
Howard concluded his speech stating that “resistance has a throughline too,” of communities coming together and “refusing” to look the other way and ignore indifference. 
“The question for us now is not whether the moment is urgent, it absolutely is,” Howard said. “The question is whether we will meet the moment with the same courage Dr. King demanded of us, because the ‘now’ he spoke of belongs to us, and what we do with it will decide the road ahead.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MLK1-1024x683.png,,,2026-01-19 19:56:52.415474

(Adrian Ashford/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — At this year’s King Day at the Dome, Democrats seeking statewide office this year pitched themselves to voters, urging them not to lose hope that Democrats could triumph in Republican-dominated South Carolina.
And U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, told the crowd gathered for Martin Luther King Jr. Day to look to civil rights history for inspiration.

“How dare we surrender to cynicism or fall to fear, thinking that the obstacles before us are greater than who we are and who we can be together,” the New Jersey Democrat said in his keynote address. “American history, if it is anything, it is a perpetual testimony to the achievement of impossible things against impossible odds.”
A crowd of several hundred gathered in front of the Statehouse on Monday for the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration organized by the NAACP’s state chapter.
South Carolina State University’s flag flew from the dome, marking the first time the state’s only public historically Black university received that honor.
The annual event started at Zion Baptist Church on Washington Street before attendees marched the roughly half mile to the Statehouse, led by drummers from SC State’s marching band.
The school’s football team triumphed last month in the Celebration Bowl, winning a 40-38 fourth-overtime victory to become national football champions for historically Black colleges and universities. Several legislators who graduated from SC State, including Rep. Hamilton Grant and Sen. Deon Tedder, asked Gov. Henry McMaster to fly the school’s flag to honor that victory.
This is believed to be the first time an HBCU’s flag has flown from the dome.
A crowd of people gathered to listen to speeches from state and national Democratic leaders, including U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, another potential 2028 contender, and former Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison of Columbia.
SC voters will elect 7 constitutional officers in 2026. So far, most aren’t a contest.

Harrison highlighted the upcoming November elections for statewide offices.
“We need some of you to run,” he told the crowd, saying he hopes to see Democrats compete for every office on 2026 ballots.
So far, Democrats have announced bids for only two of the seven elected constitutional offices, state Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain told the SC Daily Gazette last week.
Those are state superintendent of education and governor. For two offices, only the incumbent Republican has announced a run for re-election. For two open offices, a single Republican has announced a campaign. And for state attorney general, the competition so far is only among Republicans.
“Our call to action is plain,” Spain said Monday about 2026 elections. She urged people to ensure they’re registered to vote and bring friends and neighbors with them to the polls.
State Rep. Jermaine Johnson, a Richland County Democrat running for governor, said King laid the groundwork for his political ambitions.
“I will be the first Black man as the governor of South Carolina,” he said to cheers from the audience.
Johnson announced last week that he’s not running for his state House seat again, saying he wants to focus on his campaign for governor.

No Democrat has won a statewide race in South Carolina since 2006. It’s been 28 years since voters elected a Democrat as governor.
Three Democrats running to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham also took to the podium to make their case to voters.
Dr. Annie Andrews, a Charleston pediatrician, highlighted that Harrison had endorsed her as the party’s nominee to challenge Graham. Andrews, who tried unsuccessfully in 2022 to unseat U.S. Nancy Mace in the coastal 1st Congressional District, told the crowd she was used to being disappointed by the government but, quoting King, urged them to “never lose infinite hope.”
Brandon Brown, an Upstate business owner, called Graham a “domestic terrorist” and described U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as the modern-day “Ku Klux Klan.”
Catherine Fleming Bruce said South Carolina can make history by electing her, since no Black woman has represented the Palmetto State in the U.S. House or U.S. Senate. Four years ago, the Columbia author and activist ran to unseat U.S. Sen. Tim Scott but was defeated in a Democratic primary runoff.
Sylvia Wright, who’s running for state superintendent of education, criticized the Trump administration’s moves to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, saying it would exacerbate inequality in the state’s schools.

During a stop in South Carolina last month, Education Secretary Linda McMahon pledged that the federal government would continue to fund programs. She contends the dismantling is about reducing bureaucracy to better serve students. A complete dismantling of the agency created by Congress in 1979 would likely require congressional action.
Wright said the state needs a plan, should the Trump administration succeed in its efforts, and promised she would focus on rural school districts like Dorchester 4 (based in St. George), where she worked as a district coordinator before resigning last fall to campaign.
A scattering of people throughout the crowd held signs criticizing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with messages including “Stop ICE terror” and “we protect our neighbors.”
Khanna told the crowd that his grandfather participated in Mohandas “Mahatma” Gandhi’s nonviolent protest of British rule in India, which influenced King’s nonviolent approach in fighting for civil rights. Both were assassinated: Gandhi in January 1948, months after India and Pakistan became independent nations, and King in April 1968. King would have turned 97 on Jan. 15.
Khanna, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from India, has said that his grandfather spent time in jail with Gandhi.
On Monday, he said immigrants are part of America’s future.
“I believe we can become a composite nation,” he said. “I believe that is our destiny — to be a multiracial, multicultural democracy.”
King Day at the Dome has become an essential stop for Democrats seeking their party’s nomination and the crucial support of South Carolina Democratic primary voters.
SC State University flag to fly from Statehouse during King Day at the Dome

After Booker’s address, legislators who asked for SC State’s flag to fly above the dome, along with the school’s president, spoke about the significance of that honor.
From the Statehouse steps, school President Alexander Conyers thanked Gov. Henry McMaster for approving legislators’ request.
“It recognizes that we are a valued partner in South Carolina,” he told the SC Daily Gazette.
After the ceremony, Booker reiterated his message of hope in an interview with the Gazette.
“I was standing in front of the Capitol dome that used to have the Confederate flag on top, and now they have the flag of an HBCU today,” he said. “If there’s any symbol of hope for me, it’s seeing something that would have been thought to be impossible just 25 years ago.”
King Day at the Dome began in 2000 as a protest against the Confederate flag, which then flew from the dome. Six months later, the flag was taken down from atop the Statehouse in a compromise that put a smaller version of the battle flag in a prominent spot on the Statehouse’s front lawn.
That legislative compromise made Martin Luther King Jr. Day a mandatory state holiday for the first time, while also restoring the permanent status of Confederate Memorial Day.
The Legislature didn’t vote to remove the Confederate flag entirely from Statehouse grounds until 2015, following the massacre of nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, known as Mother Emanuel.

Bryant Clark, D-Pickens, speaks at a press conference in front of the Mississippi State Capitol in Jackson on Monday, Jan. 19, 2026, to discuss introducing a state version of the Voting Rights Act.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
As the U.S. Supreme Court weighs a case that could further weaken the federal Voting Rights Act, some Mississippi lawmakers are moving to write their own version.
State lawmakers in the the Legislative Black Caucus on Martin Luther King Jr. Day filed legislation to create a state-level version of the Voting Rights Act. They said their act is designed to safeguard minority voting rights, as the nation’s highest court has indicated it’s open to revisit provisions of the Civil Rights era federal law and has already overturned some.
The state legislation would prohibit dilution of minority voters, create a Mississippi Voting Rights Commission and require some jurisdictions to obtain preclearance approval from the newly created commission.  
Rep. Zakiya Summers, a Democrat from Jackson and author of the legislation, said at a press conference in front of the state Capitol on Monday that the bill is not about one party or one race, but about protecting the voting rights of future generations. 
“I’m a mother of three sons, and what we do today determines what we do with their future,” Summers said. 
The bill would be named the Robert G. Clark Jr. Voting Rights Act, in honor of Clark, who in 1967 became the first Black Mississippian elected to the state Legislature in the modern era. Clark was ostracized when first elected to the House and sat at a desk by himself without the traditional deskmates that other House members had. But he became a respected legislative leader.
Clark later held some of the highest positions in the Legislature. He served 10 years as chairman of the House Education Committee, including during the period when the historic Education Reform Act of 1982 was passed.
Clark later served as speaker pro tempore of the House, the second-highest position in the chamber. Clark died last year at age 96. 
Rep. Bryant Clark, a Democrat from Pickens and son of Robert Clark, said his father would be horrified to know that the U.S. Supreme Court is considering rolling back the protections that he and so many civil rights pioneers fought for so heavily. 
“But my daddy taught me one thing,” Clark said. “He taught me when democracy is threatened, you don’t give up. You fight harder.” 
In a Legislature dominated by Republican politics, it’s doubtful that the legislation will gain major traction. 
In 2024, a federal three-judge panel ruled the Legislature violated the Voting Rights Act when it redistricted itself and it ordered the lawmakers to redraw some legislative seats to give Black voters in certain areas of the state a fair shot at electing a candidate. 
Republican leaders largely complied with the order, though many of them complained that the judges, who were appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, were forcing them to redraw the districts and disagreed with the rulings.
Last year, another federal judge, also appointed by Bush, ruled the state violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting Black voting strength in Mississippi’s state Supreme Court district lines and ordered the Legislature to redraw them. 
In each of these instances, Black voters were able to file such a suit because of protections in the Voting Rights Act — the same federal law the U.S. Supreme Court is considering dismantling. 
Amir Badat, an attorney with Fair Fight Action, encouraged hundreds of people at a rally on Monday to call legislators and urge them to pass the voting rights legislation and to signal to the U.S. Supreme Court that overturning federal voting protections would be a grave mistake. 
“Justice does not move on its own,” Badat said. “People move it. So today we are choosing to move. We are choosing to fight.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/19170002/MG_9087.jpg,,,2026-01-19 19:56:52.415474

(Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington state’s plan to transition the biggest ferry system in the United States to hybrid-electric by 2040 by purchasing new boats and undertaking complex conversions with several of our existing ferries is ambitious and laudable. No one disputes that we are in dire need of new ferries. Six of 21 ferries were pulled from service in recent weeks, and the converted hybrid electric ferry Wenatchee has been pulled for repairs several times since being put into service in July. 
Washington State Ferries has been struggling with reliability for years, and some important steps have been taken towards righting the ship. Gov. Bob Ferguson prioritized restoration of reliable ferry service and has made changes and investments that make good on campaign promises. In addition to committing to building new ferries, the governor elevated the director of the ferry system to a cabinet-level position, and postponed taking the M/V Tacoma and Puyallup ferries out of service for conversion so as not to disrupt ferry service during the busy summer season and with the World Cup coming to Seattle. 
But what’s driving unreliable ferry service today isn’t just too few boats on the water. Cancelled and delayed sailings are more often the result of a lack of licensed engine room crew required by Coast Guard regulations, and also a backlog of maintenance and repairs needed for a fleet of boats that, on average, are more than 50 years old. It is marine engineers who are responsible for operating, repairing and maintaining all the systems that keep ferries running smoothly. Few passengers are aware of this highly skilled workforce because they are out of sight below the car deck in the engine room, but they are essential to safe, reliable ferry service.
Washington State Ferries used to be one of the best-paying ferry systems in the country, but wages haven’t kept up with the market. Today, wages for engine room crews have fallen 20% below those of our deck counterparts. Because the state failed to close the wage gap in our last contract, we are still short-staffed. Adding to the challenges, we are on the edge of a retirement cliff, with half of our most skilled and experienced crew eligible to retire in 2027.
Without competitive wages, we won’t have enough licensed crew to operate and repair the new hybrid electric fleet vessels when they come into service. Skilled mariners are choosing private-sector shipping companies or other ferry systems that provide better wages and benefits. 
The good news is that the cost of closing the wage gap for marine engineers is minuscule compared to more than $1 billion being spent on new ferries. But if that gap isn’t closed, those new boats won’t be able to sail. The state needs to balance its investments in greening the fleet for the future with support for competitive wages necessary to recruit and retain crewmembers essential to ferry service today — a need that will be even greater when we have a full fleet of hybrid-electric vessels ferrying passengers around the Puget Sound in the years to come.
The first few months of operating the Wenatchee after it was converted to hybrid-electric demonstrated the complexity of merging old and new systems. One takeaway has been how important extensive sea trials and training on the new systems will be. With competitive wages, we’ll be better able to keep our senior engineers long enough for new crew to gain the experience and credentials to step into those roles.
Ferry routes are a critical part of our state’s transportation system. Canceled and delayed sailings have serious impacts on the people and businesses that depend on them for goods, transportation to work, medical appointments, and school. Washington State Ferries are one of the state’s leading tourist attractions, pumping millions of out-of-state dollars into the local economy. Ferry-dependent communities and all Washington taxpayers deserve to have a reliable system and that is only possible when engine room crew are paid fair wages.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/samish-ferry-boat-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-19 18:56:53.556073

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Reviews are in for Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson’s debut budget blueprint. They are mostly two thumbs down.
In the course of six hours of public hearings over three days last week, dozens of people criticized the governor’s approach to closing a projected $2.3 billion shortfall.
They booed his push to cap access to a coveted child care program, cut funding for public schools and colleges, and redirect climate dollars away from pollution reduction and toward tax credits for low-income working families.
There was applause for Ferguson’s embrace of an income tax on millionaire-earners. But because it could be years before it might generate revenue, testifiers urged members of the House and Senate budget-writing committees to find ways to raise money sooner.
A recurring theme was the lasting negative effects of further paring public resources after the widespread reductions made last year to plug a budget hole that Ferguson pegged at $16 billion over four years.
Tyler Muench of the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction said “significant cuts” proposed to popular programs like Running Start and cancellation of a planned funding boost for rural school districts carry longer-term consequences.
“OSPI cannot continue to absorb cuts and still deliver services that Washingtonians expect and deserve,” he said.
Ferguson’s budget director foresaw the negative response and empathized with lawmakers who are crafting their own spending plans in the House and Senate.
“It’s a very difficult set of budget decisions that we dealt with and that you all will have in front of you as well,” said K.D. Chapman-See, Ferguson’s chief budget writer, in presenting the governor’s proposal at hearings in the House Appropriations and Senate Ways and Means committees.
The big picture
Ferguson, a Democrat in his first term as governor, released his budget proposal Dec. 23. It makes adjustments to the two-year budget he signed in May and that took effect July 1, 2025.
The governor and legislative Democrats balanced the budget with a combination of billions in cuts and more than $9 billion in new and higher taxes.
Since last spring, the state has collected less in taxes than expected while dealing with greater demand for services, rising expenses due to inflation and costly new federal requirements under congressional Republicans’ so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.”
The state is facing another shortfall. This one is $2.3 billion in the current operating budget, which runs through mid-2027. Ferguson proposes to patch it by trimming $800 million in spending, withdrawing $1 billion from the state’s rainy day reserve fund, and using revenues from the state’s auctions of air pollution allowances to shore up other programs.
Chapman-See said tapping into the rainy day fund, formally known as the budget stabilization account, was “a really, really difficult decision” for the governor. It got to the point where they were discussing cuts to critical services that he was not comfortable making, she said.
The reductions he settled on are what drew fire at the hearings.

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)
Changes in child care programming account for nearly 40% of the reductions, advocates say.
Ferguson wants to close enrollment to the Working Connections Child Care program that provides lower-income families with subsidies to pay for care. There were 44,333 enrolled as of last February, with an active caseload of 33,465 as of November 2024, the Department of Children, Youth and Families reported in the summer.
The governor wants to halt new sign-ups until the caseload drops to 33,000. It is estimated that this will save $217 million.
He also wants to freeze the level of state funding to child care centers, rather than proceed with a previously approved increase. That is a $41 million cut for providers.
“Child care should never be a discretionary line item as it is the work that makes all the other work possible,” said Alex Galeana, executive director of the Children’s Campaign Fund. “Please reject these reductions and stand by children and families.”
Ferguson’s plan calls for 3% cuts in funding to Washington State University and the University of Washington, and 1.5% for community and technical colleges.
Jacqui Cain, president of the American Federation of Teachers in Washington, said across-the-board cuts would have “immediate consequences. Even modest cuts lead to hiring delays, fewer course offerings, and increased workloads.”
She also called on lawmakers to restore a provision concerning the Workforce Education Investment Account, which derives its money from a tax imposed on very large high-tech firms.
Ferguson and Democratic lawmakers made a change last year to allow the dollars, which will total hundreds of millions in this budget cycle, to be used to supplant spending from the general fund. It is limited to this budget. Absent that revision, those dollars were used to supplement higher education spending.
Not using the dollars as originally intended could lead to hiring freezes, program cuts and less financial aid, critics warned.
Chris Mulick, senior director of state relations for Washington State University, said a proposed 3% cut in the Cougars’ financial hide would be the fifth straight year of reductions.
“Just in the past six months, we’ve cut administration, academic programming, and public service while eliminating several hundred jobs,” he said.
Mulick then delivered uncharacteristically sharp remarks on what he said is a proposed quadrupling of WSU’s premium for the state’s self-insurance liability coverage “without any corresponding increase in claims or payouts.”
To cover the increase, he said, the governor counts on new tuition revenue “that never existed in the first place,” and that had at one point been earmarked for other spending.
“These are the same phantom tuition dollars that were supposed to have partially funded university COLAs but didn’t,” he said, referring to cost-of-living adjustments for employees. “It’s absolute make-believe and it sharply increases our already outlying cut to well beyond 5%. Please don’t do this.”
Some of the strongest criticism came from foes of Ferguson’s desire to redirect $569 million of proceeds from carbon auctions under the Climate Commitment Act into the Working Families Tax Credit program. 
“Our members are outraged at the proposal,” said Robin Everett, deputy director for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign. They recognize the budget challenge and “share the goal of keeping our lowest income folks afloat during difficult times. But we also can’t ignore the climate crisis that is unfolding,” she said.
Use of the money for the tax credits is allowed under the law that created the climate program.
While the idea may be “technically legal, it is profoundly out of step” with the spirit of the law, Everett said. “Gutting this program will set a deeply troubling precedent.”
Not everyone’s unhappy
Those with kudos for Ferguson’s handiwork urged lawmakers to follow his lead.
Dawn Rains, chief executive officer of Treehouse, said a $7 million cut last year forced the nonprofit to end services to 400 students in foster care aimed at helping them graduate high school.
A patchwork of private and one-time funding helped keep the group going. But that approach “is neither sustainable nor equitable,” she said.
The governor’s budget restores $3.5 million, a sum that “would stabilize and expand a proven program” for some of Washington’s most vulnerable students, she said. 
An $8.5 million cut to a program supporting access to abortion-related services was one of the more controversial budget moves last year. Restoring those dollars to the Abortion Access Project is the top priority of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates — and it is in the proposed budget. 
The five abortion care agencies in the state supported by the program provided 80% of the total abortions in 2022, according to the Department of Health’s Center for Health Statistics. These clinics are located in 20 out of the 39 counties in Washington state. Planned Parenthood is the largest recipient of funds from the program.
“Without full restoration, patients will likely see reduced services, limited appointment times, higher out-of-pocket costs, fewer management options, and less secure health centers, and even clinic closures,” said Nicole Kern, government relations manager for the alliance.
How much of Ferguson’s proposal survives will become clearer when majority Democrats in the House and Senate release their respective spending blueprints. Those will come out following the next revenue forecast on Feb. 16.

This story by Marion Umpleby was first published in Valley News on Jan. 19, 2026.
SOUTH ROYALTON — To the unknowing passerby walking down Chelsea Street last week, RB’s Delicatessen may have looked like a business on its way out of town.
A large dumpster outside the store was filled to the brim with garbage and discarded odds and ends, while inside, Brenda Cohen, the building’s owner and RB’s original founder, was busy cleaning out the deli with the help of a handful of friends. 
“This was overwhelming. There was no way we were going to let (Cohen) tackle it on her own,” Mike Barnaby, a Tunbridge resident who’s known Cohen since he was a kid, said while using a razor blade to scrape a Monster Energy decal off a store window. 
But in spite of appearances, RB’s isn’t going anywhere. It is, however, getting a new owner. Daisey Darling, who had owned the South Royalton deli since 2014 with her now ex-husband Anthony Salls, decided to close the business in December as the pair went through a divorce and the business struggled to be profitable. 
After closing the deli, she asked Cohen to “take the store back,” Darling said. It wasn’t long before Cohen found a new person to take up the reins. Cohen declined to name the new owner because she said the person wasn’t ready to be identified publicly.
Cohen and her late husband Roger Cattabriga opened RB’s on South Royalton’s main drag in 1991. Over the years, the store has become a reliable spot to get a quick lunch, a carton of cigarettes or a pack of beer.

Darling, a Royalton native, got a job at RB’s when she was 18. When she found work in construction soon after, she kept the job at RB’s to tie her over during the winter off-season.
When Cohen decided to retire and devote her time to her dream of raising her Irish Setters for national competitions, Darling and Salls purchased the business for $200,000. 
“I was excited to own something and contribute more to the community,” Darling said.
When Darling took over RB’s, she was no stranger to life in a family-run business. At age 7, she started helping out at her parents’ sawmill on Waterman Road in Royalton. Working there was “always so fun,” Darling said.  Running RB’s gave her an opportunity to give back to her hometown. 
Pam Levasseur, a member of the Royalton and Area Lions Club, said Darling used her connections with a purveyor to secure discounted ingredients for the club’s burger booth at the town’s annual Old Home Days. 
“She did so much for the community,” Levasseur said. 
Darling also ran a pay-it-forward system at RB’s where customers could buy a grocery item such as a carton of milk or a can of soup, and leave a note indicating that it had been paid for so someone else could take it home for free. 
Open until 9 or 9:30 p.m. depending on the day, RB’s also was a reliable place to get the odd ingredient or household item when other stores such as the nearby South Royalton Market had closed for the day. 
RB’s “has been a staple here for years,” Sherri Michaud said while cutting hair at Sherri’s Headquarters Ltd., the salon she runs two doors up from the deli. 
The ready-made meals such as spaghetti and Shepherd’s pie became Michaud’s “go-to” when she needed a quick lunch between seeing clients. 
The deli also offered a menu of coffee, sub sandwiches, salads, fried food, and in the summer, ice cream served out of a window at the front of the store. 
Even though RB’s was a beloved spot in town, turning a profit wasn’t easy, especially after Dollar General, a discount retailer chain, opened in late 2024 on Route 14, a few minutes’ drive from the village center, Darling said. 
After the store opened, she noticed a decline in sales of grocery items such as milk, but she couldn’t afford to match Dollar General’s prices.   
Several Upper Valley general stores have closed their doors in recent years, including Erin’s General Store in West Fairlee, which shuttered in 2024 after reopening under a new owner four years prior. Other Upper Valley towns where general stores have closed include Brownsville, Canaan Village, Cornish, Grafton, Quechee and Taftsville, the Valley News reported in 2024.
Darling estimates she made a net profit of $700 last year, after paying staff and bills and buying product for the store. 
The divorce added additional strain. “It really went downhill when we split and there was no heart left,” Darling said. 
Since closing the deli, she’s found new work which she declined to detail. 
More than anything, she’s going to miss the high school kids she employed. “I love kids. They don’t judge you,” she said.
Now Cohen and her friends are focused on getting RB’s ready for a professional deep clean and giving the deli a paint job in advance of a tentative opening in early April.
“Time for (the store) to get cleaned up and get a new start,” Barnaby said.

After owning Radio Bean for more than 25 years, Lee Anderson announced Sunday that he’s ready to hand off the downtown Burlington bar and music venue and let what he calls “the spirit of the Bean” live on with someone else. 
The news comes only six months after Nectar’s, a fixture of the Queen City’s music scene, announced it would close in July. The business was floundering as a result of a drawn-out city construction project on its block and perceived public safety challenges downtown, the company said. 
But only several blocks away, Anderson promises that the show will go on — whether in front of a glittery curtain or below a sky full of twinkling misfit lamps. Gigs are on the books for the coming months, he said.

When Anderson first opened the joint, he was 22 years old and lived in an apartment upstairs. He paid for it with several credit cards and managed it day and night, he said. But now the 47 year-old lives about an hour away in Lincoln, where he helps raise his two young children, he said. 
“My relationship from me to the business is just different now,” he said. 
It felt like the right time for him, the venue and the community to consider other ownership options, he said. 
Anderson wrote in a social media post that he would ideally like to see a group of people co-own and operate the place, allowing him to stay involved. But he’s open to different possibilities, he said, and wants to reassure people that Radio Bean “isn’t going to vanish.”

Since his announcement, many people have reached out to Anderson with messages thanking him and proposing ideas about the future, he said. After running the place for so long, he’s seen the children of couples who met at the bar grow up, Anderson said. 
And he’s seen the place itself evolve. For its first 10 years, the Bean often hosted theater performers and puppeteers, Anderson said. Now it gets mostly musical acts.
At the venue’s “25th Birthday Bash” in November, the setlist convened over 100 acts. That night, a man in his underwear wore a giant hat shaped like a nose while he played the accordion to a sea of laughing people. At the same time in the venue’s other room, local rap group A2VT moved a bumping crowd. 
Over the years, he said he’s had supernatural experiences that moved him, including seeing unplugged lamps glow with light, which left him with a reassuring feeling. 
“That’s telling me — whatever you’re doing right now is exactly what you should be doing right now,” he said. 
Anderson has announced a “State of the Bean” meeting Wednesday, where he hopes to get people together and listen to their “hopes and dreams and fears” about the venue’s future, he said.

WILMINGTON, Del. — Three Wilmington City Council members on Monday used MLK Day to renew calls for sweeping affordability reforms, reviving a debate that last year drew sharp resistance from Mayor John Carney and state housing officials who warned that rent stabilization could undermine housing supply and investment.
Council members Coby Owens, Shané Darby, and Christian Willauer held a press conference to outline a broad affordability agenda addressing rising rents, property taxes, water bills, and homelessness. The plan is endorsed by the Working Families Party of Delaware and builds directly on Darby’s 2025 rent-stabilization proposal, which stalled amid opposition from city and state leaders.
While supporters argue the measures are needed to prevent displacement, critics — including Carney and Gov. Matt Meyer’s housing administration — have warned against similar plans, calling instead for increasing housing supply and not regulating prices, as a more effective long-term solution.
Council Members Frame Urgency
Owens, who represents the city’s 1st District, focused on housing conditions and homelessness, calling it unacceptable for residents to be forced into unsafe housing or onto the streets.
Owens said Darby’s earlier rent bill would not stop rent increases, but would “slow them a little bit,” giving families time to adjust while other solutions are pursued.
Darby, the 2nd District council member and a longtime advocate of rent stabilization, framed the issue as one affecting working- and middle-class residents.
“It isn’t just about protecting the poor,” Darby said during a previous City Council committee meeting. “This is about working-class and middle-class residents — the backbone of our city — who are being priced out of their homes year after year.”
Willauer, who represents the 5th District, emphasized property tax fairness and the need to pair tenant protections with relief for homeowners and small landlords.
“We need to do something about the rising cost of rent now,” Willauer said in an earlier interview, “while we’re putting in place other long-term solutions like more housing that people can afford.”
What the Plan Calls For
The agenda includes:


Rent stabilization limiting annual increases


Restoring pre-rental housing inspections


Correcting property tax assessment errors


Creating a housing trust fund


Expanding eviction-prevention assistance


Limiting water shutoffs and foreclosures


Increasing shelter and supportive housing capacity


Council members said legislation reflecting these ideas will be introduced in coming weeks.
Carney, State Officials Push Back
The proposals revive objections raised in 2025, when Darby’s rent stabilization ordinance faced stiff resistance from the Carney administration and state housing officials.
Mayor Carney opposed the measure outright, with his administration warning that the city lacked the staffing and expertise to enforce rent caps. Daniel Walker, Carney’s deputy chief of staff, said at the time that the city should focus on expanding housing supply rather than regulating rents.
“Our position is that we double down on what we know is working in increasing the supply of affordable housing across the city of Wilmington,” Walker said.
At the state level, Matthew Heckles, director of the Delaware State Housing Authority under Gov. Matt Meyer, also warned that rent stabilization could discourage development.
“This won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick, but this is the solution,” Heckles wrote in a May 7, 2025 email to city officials, referring to new construction. “It is critical that Delaware not close the door on this path, and I believe rent control will do exactly that.”
Heckles later said rent caps could signal to developers that Delaware may limit financial returns on housing investments, adding that decisions made in Wilmington carry statewide implications.
“What is done in Wilmington has implications across the state,” Heckles said. “It’s the largest city in the state.”
Landlords, Moderates Echo Concerns
Landlord groups and moderate council members also raised concerns during last year’s debate, many of which remain unresolved.
Local landlords warned that rent caps could make it difficult to cover rising costs for taxes, insurance, and maintenance, particularly in older buildings. Some said the policy could push small, local landlords to sell to out-of-state investors.
“Tenants in controlled units will become a privileged class,” landlord Adam Bivens told council last year, warning that uncontrolled units could see higher rents to compensate.
Several council members questioned how enforcement would work and where fines or penalties would go. Others warned that rent stabilization could punish responsible landlords who already keep rents reasonable.
A Broader Affordability Debate
The renewed affordability push comes as Wilmington residents continue to face rising costs. About 54% of city residents rent, nearly one in four live below the poverty line, and median household income remains well below the state average.
Supporters argue immediate protections are needed as federal rental assistance programs have ended. Critics counter that price controls risk shrinking housing supply and delaying investment, making affordability worse over time.
With legislation expected soon, the debate that divided City Hall in 2025 is once again shaping up as one of Wilmington’s most consequential policy fights — balancing urgency for relief against concerns over long-term economic impact.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/820NMadisonStWilmingtonDE19801.jpg,,,2026-01-19 17:56:45.743744

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Two days after taking the oath of office as the first woman to lead Virginia, Gov. Abigail Spanberger on Monday urged lawmakers to move quickly on a slate of constitutional amendments and cost-of-living legislation, framing the moment as an early test of whether Virginia’s new political alignment can deliver results.
In her first address to a joint session of the General Assembly, Spanberger outlined her governing priorities and pressed for swift action on four Democratic-backed constitutional amendments, singling out a proposal that would allow lawmakers, under narrow circumstances, to redraw congressional maps mid-decade. 
She described the measure as narrowly tailored to counter what she said are growing efforts in other states to undermine democratic norms.
“Virginia’s proposed redistricting amendment is a response to what we’re seeing in other states that have taken extreme measures,” Spanberger said, emphasizing that any change would be “short-term, highly targeted, and completely dependent on what other states decide to do themselves.” 
Ultimately, she said, voters should have the final say.
Spanberger also voiced strong support for amendments protecting reproductive freedom, marriage equality and automatic restoration of voting rights for Virginians who have completed felony sentences — all of which will now be on the ballot in November. 
Democrats have argued the measures are necessary to lock in rights they fear could be rolled back through future court rulings or shifting political control.
Beyond constitutional questions, the new governor used the address to press lawmakers to focus on affordability — an issue she repeatedly returned to as the defining challenge of her administration. 
She pointed to rising housing costs, prescription drug prices and energy bills as pressures cutting across regions and party lines.
“More than 70% of Virginians say they cannot find housing they can afford to rent or buy,” she said, rejecting claims that affordability concerns are exaggerated. “This is not a hoax. This is real life.”
Spanberger said executive actions she signed immediately after her inauguration are intended to jump-start that effort, including orders directing agencies to identify ways to cut costs for families and to review regulations that slow housing construction. 
But she also emphasized that lasting relief will require legislation.
To that end, she pointed to what she called an “Affordable Virginia Agenda,” asking lawmakers to move a package of bills aimed at lowering costs in health care, energy and housing. 
The proposals include new rules governing pharmacy benefit managers to push drug rebates back to patients, targeted assistance to offset rising Affordable Care Act marketplace premiums, and incentives to recruit health care providers to underserved areas.
On energy, Spanberger called for expanded energy storage, increased weatherization programs for low-income households and renewed commitment to a diversified power mix that includes solar, nuclear and offshore wind. 
She pledged to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, saying its proceeds previously helped fund flood mitigation and energy-efficiency programs. Her comments come as Virginia’s offshore wind project has faced renewed uncertainty amid federal actions. 
Housing proposals outlined in the speech included extending the period tenants have to respond to eviction filings, giving localities more flexibility to adopt affordable housing programs and creating a revolving loan fund to finance mixed-income developments.
Republicans offered a competing affordability vision following the address. 
House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said House Republicans agree that lowering costs should be the General Assembly’s top priority and pointed to their newly announced the GOP’s “Affordability Done Right” agenda, which includes eliminating the grocery tax, phasing out the car tax, making the higher standard deduction permanent, lowering power bills and expanding auto insurance options. 
If the governor “truly wants to make life more affordable,” Kilgore said, she should support those proposals.
In her speech, Spanberger also waded into debates over public safety and gun policy, calling on lawmakers to revive measures vetoed in recent years. 
She said she respects the Second Amendment but urged passage of bills banning ghost guns, restricting firearm access for convicted domestic abusers and strengthening “red flag” laws.
“These are commonsense measures,” she said. “Virginia is ready. And I am ready to sign. Send them to my desk.”
Education was another focal point, with Spanberger calling for higher teacher pay and renewed emphasis on reading and math instruction after Virginia ranked last nationally in math recovery. 
She said her administration would avoid what she described as culture-war battles in classrooms and instead prioritize academic outcomes and partnerships between parents and educators.
The governor also addressed higher education governance, announcing a review of appointments to boards of visitors and signaling support for reforms to prevent future administrations from politicizing university leadership — a topic that has generated intense scrutiny in recent months.
Woven throughout the speech was a warning about economic turbulence stemming from Washington, including federal job cuts, trade policies and their ripple effects on Virginia’s economy. 
Spanberger said she has created an Economic Resiliency Task Force to assess the damage and recommend responses, particularly for displaced federal workers and rural communities affected by declining exports through the Port of Virginia.
While emphasizing bipartisanship — noting she was ranked among the most bipartisan members of Virginia’s congressional delegation — Spanberger said she would not shy away from confronting federal actions she believes harm the commonwealth.
“When federal actions attack and threaten Virginia jobs, I will not hesitate to push back,” she said.
She closed by invoking the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whose holiday coincided with the address, urging lawmakers to reject political intimidation and dehumanization and to model a different approach to governance.
“Disagreement need not mean contempt,” Spanberger said. “Before anything else, we are all Virginians.”

This story by Tim Calabro was first published in The Herald on Jan. 15, 2026.
After more than 30 years of developing and managing affordable housing and community initiatives in the Randolph area, the Randolph Area Community Development Corporation has announced that it will dissolve over the course of 2026. Executive Director Peter Reed confirmed the transition, citing dwindling funding sources, project pipeline issues, and organizational sustainability as key factors in the decision.
Founded in the aftermath of a series of devastating downtown fires in 1991 and 1992, RACDC has been a driving force in affordable housing in Randolph, developing properties including Randolph House, Joslyn House, Branchwood Apartments, the Red Lion Inn and the Jacobs and Armstrong mobile home parks, among others. The organization’s departure marks the end of a local era, but its leadership is working to ensure a smooth transition of its housing stock and community programs.
“We’ve had the writing on the wall for the last year and have been kind of trying to position ourselves to deal with it as effectively as we could,” Reed said.
The majority of RACDC’s properties — including Randolph House, Branchwood Apartments, Red Lion Inn, and the two mobile home parks — are slated to be transferred to Downstreet Housing & Community Development, a larger, Barre-based organization that manages hundreds of affordable units across central Vermont.
“Downstreet … they manage something in the range of 450 apartments and mobile home lots. So they’re probably three times bigger than RACDC is today,” Reed said. “They do similar activities. We’ve worked with them in the past on a number of projects. It’s a good organization.” 
One exception is Joslyn House, an independent senior housing facility, which will be transferred to a new nonprofit being formed by the Wright family. The family has long been involved with the property — Becky Wright currently serves as the resident manager, following in the footsteps of her mother, Arlene.
“It’s a great little community,” Reed said. “There was a [Vermont Public] Rumble Strip story about it recently. … Yhe tagline on the story was, ‘Every town should have a Joslyn House.’”
Changing federal landscape
At the core of RACDC’s decision is a shift in federal housing policy and funding, Reed said.
“In the current federal environment with cutting back on many different supports for people in need, including housing … HUD has been significantly cut back,” said Reed. “Funding for low-income housing has definitely dropped. It starts at the federal level, then they send blocks of funds to the state, and the state allocates them around. So there’s just less of a pool,” he said.
The dearth of funding for affordable housing projects has had ripple effects for RACDC. “Financially if we don’t do projects every year or two, we can’t fund the organization.”
Reed noted that while the funding challenges have been mounting for some time, the final blow came last year in the middle of work on the Salisbury Square project, a novel affordable housing development integrating smartgrid technology.
“We had a second phase of that for single-family homes that we don’t have funding for now,” Reed said. “We had some funding from the state that got pulled in the spring just because they were concerned that we wouldn’t be able to finish on time.”
Although the multi-unit apartment portion and infrastructure were completed, the organization now plans to hand off the remaining development of single-family homes to private developers.
Compounding RACDC’s challenges was a phishing attack that cost the organization — and its funders — hundreds of thousands of dollars. Scammers infiltrated the organization’s email system and redirected payments intended for RACDC.
“It was actually a couple of our funders that paid money to scammers,” said Reed. “One of them they caught in time. The other one they didn’t. That was kind of the total loss of confidence at that point.”
The breach, which exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure, undermined already-fragile relationships with funding agencies.
“That moment I realized that there was no way we were going to be able to survive,” he said. The scam amounted to a $450,000 loss.
Winding down
At its peak, RACDC employed a full-time staff of eight. Today, all employees are working part-time as the organization wraps up operations. Reed, who stepped in as executive director from the board amid a leadership transition, has been working to ensure that the shutdown proceeds in an orderly fashion.
“My whole goal in this … has been an orderly transition and not a financial crisis,” Reed said. “Some of the other housing groups in the state that have had to merge have been under more dire circumstances, and it’s just not a good way to go”.
In addition to housing, RACDC has administered Randolph’s downtown designation program with financial support from the town and the state’s downtown vibrancy fund. Reed and the RACDC board hope the program can be handed off to a new organization, though the structure and leadership are still being worked out.
“The town gives us $20,000 a year,” Reed said. “We get another $25,000 from the state… but that doesn’t cover the cost of an administrator. It’s probably a $50,000–$60,000 a year expense base that you have to cover.”
Reed has also confirmed that RACDC will liquidate its remaining physical assets — including lots on Maple Street and a few mobile homes — to fund remaining operational expenses. The organization currently has around $1 million in annual revenue, most of which has been tied to project-based funding. Payroll makes up an estimated 75% of day-to-day expenses, Reed said.
Housing remains essential
Despite its closure, Reed emphasized that RACDC’s work will continue in new forms.
“We don’t want to lose the ability to generate affordable housing in Randolph,” Reed said. “The mission is going to continue in some form. It’ll be different people doing it.”
Downstreet Housing is expected to take on some future housing development in the area, though its leadership has acknowledged they won’t be able to match RACDC’s level of activity in Randolph. “They’ve said, no, we are not going to drive housing in Randolph the way you guys have in the last 30 years. We just can’t. But we’ll do what we can,” Reed said.
RACDC’s annual meeting, scheduled for January 28, will serve as a venue for community members and residents to ask questions and learn more about the transition.
“We’re going to lay out to everybody again sort of what’s happening and be available for questions that might come up,” Reed said.

After delaying the vote by one day on Friday, the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee voted to adopt the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment’s recommended revenue projection of more than $5.6 billion for the current fiscal year 2026 and about $5.8 billion for next year’s fiscal year 2027. 
In both cases, the revenue figures were higher than the revenue projections Little recommended in conjunction with his State of the State address last week. 
JFAC’s adopted revenue total is about $152.5 million, or 2.8% more than Little’s this year, and $137.4 million, or 2.4% more than Little’s next year.
The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short, is a powerful legislative committee that sets all of the budgets for every state agency and department. 
 January revenue report for Idaho looks strong

Adopting a revenue figure is an important part of the budget-setting process because the revenue figure essentially represents the upper limit of what can be spent in the state budget. The Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced budget where expenses do not exceed revenues.

Rep. Josh Tanner, an Eagle Republican who serves as one of the two co-chairs of JFAC, said he felt safe adopting the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee’s recommendation because the projection is lower than the Idaho State Tax Commission’s $6.3 billion projection for fiscal year 2027. 
Tanner also referenced a strong new January state monthly revenue report that showed a dramatic increase in corporate income tax collections and now projects the state budget to end the current fiscal year 2026 with a budget surplus of $106.2 million. 
December revenue collections were so strong that they reversed a projected $40 million budget deficit, to the point Idaho is now projecting a budget surplus for the first time in months. 
“So we’re sitting heavy as we sit right now,” Tanner said. 
Although all JFAC members eventually agreed to adopt the same revenue targets unanimously, there was some confusion along the way to reaching agreement. Shortly before voting to adopt the revenue projection, JFAC members voted down an earlier motion to accept the revenue report from the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee. 
In the end, different members of JFAC appeared to have different reasons for supporting the higher revenue figure they all agreed to vote for. 
Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said she appreciated the more optimistic revenue number because it may mean the Idaho Legislature does not have to cut programs and services as deeply in order to balance the budget.
Sen. Jim Woodward, R-Sagle, said he hopes the higher revenue figure means Idaho will have more money to invest in wildfire suppression and transportation infrastructure. 
Rep. Kyle Harris, R-Lewiston, said he favored the higher revenue target because it leaves more room in the budget for tax cuts and full compliance with federal tax cuts championed by President Donald Trump in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Rep. Rod Furniss, R-Rigby, said after Monday’s meeting adjourned that he favored the higher revenue figure because it gives legislators more of a cushion to leave a larger ending cash balance at the end of the budget year to guard against economic uncertainty. 
This year, JFAC adopted a revenue projection much earlier in the year than during the last two legislative sessions. While Monday marked the eighth day of the 2026 legislative session, JFAC did not adopt a revenue target last year until March 5, which was 59 days into the legislative session. Last year, some members of both political parties criticized JFAC for setting the revenue projection after passing major budgets and tax cuts.

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)As Hancock County Schools are unable to pay teachers next month due to finances, members of the West Virginia House of Delegates fast-tracked a pair of bills that would allow the county to make payroll.
The full House suspended constitutional rules Monday to swiftly approve two measures related to the school district’s financial debacle, including legislation that would give $8 million to the district so they can pay employees. 
“It’s a lot of uncertainty in Hancock County right now. People that are innocent that are caught up in this, and we really just need to honor obligations, keep those folks paid, [and] make sure schools are open for the rest of the year,” said House Majority Leader Pat McGeehan, who represents the area.
McGeehan, R-Hancock, described the situation as “gross mismanagement” of finances under Hancock County school administration. He said years ago, the district had a more than a million dollar surplus. 
“The state school board has taken them over on Friday, but even if they take all of the school aid formula that they have though June 30 and advance that now, that may not even get them through March,” he said. “The state school board said they’ve never seen anything like it.”
On Friday, the state school board intervened in Hancock County, terminating the superintendent and appointing a replacement. 
The county has been operating with 143 more positions than what the county school aid formula called for, according to the state education department. State officials have said the county used federal COVID-19 relief dollars to cover expenses.
Along with a $5 million cash shortfall, there are numerous ongoing construction projects, including a $1 million turf project.
House Bill 4574, sponsored by McGeehan, would provide condition-based emergency funding to financially distressed counties, like Hancock. It would be available for counties whose reserve funding has fallen below 5% so they can make payroll and continue operating. 
Any school district that receives the funding has to pay it black to the state.
W.Va. House Minority Leader Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, urged members to pass the bill but said he did so “with caution.” 
“The reason for urgent passage, there are kids involved … Then, there’s also jobs,” Hornbuckle said. “But more importantly, I will recommend to this body, we need to reevaluate also what we have done and what we will do to make sure we are not putting financial hardships on counties, that we are not sitting here yet again, having to make emergency action, because if we do not, we will be here.”
House members overwhelmingly approved the measure. They approved a second bill, House Bill 4575, also sponsored by McGeehan, that would give $8 million to the state Board of Education for Hancock County Schools. The pair of bills were the first to be passed this session by the House, and both measures head to the Senate for consideration.
“I’m optimistic they’ll be taking it up, probably today, but once they get the bill, maybe tomorrow or next day,” McGeehan said.
There are numerous districts under state control, many due to financial issues tied to drying up pandemic relief dollars and West Virginia’s declining population. 
State schools Superintendent Michele Blatt said she believed Hancock County was the only county that would qualify for the emergency funding at this time. She testified before the House Committee on Finance earlier Monday while members initially vetted the school financial relief bills. 
Yearly audits didn’t catch Hancock County’s financial situation, Blatt said, because the county didn’t submit accurate information. 
Additionally, Blatt said the school district’s former chief business officer, who has since been fired, turned off certain triggers within the state’s Education Information System that would have alerted the West Virginia Department of Education about financial issues. The state department of education first learned about the financial crisis in September.
“They were literally putting into WV EIS what they had to for us to see, and not using the full functionality of that plot of that platform,” Blatt told lawmakers. “The system did not have in it what was actually occurring in that county.”
Del. Daniel Linville, R-Cabell
In response, Del. Daniel Linville, R-Cabell, said, “Effectively, you’re telling me they intentionally misled the department.”
Blatt said the department is looking into whether other counties have turned over similar triggers into the information center that could signal financial issues. The department believed that the situation in Hancock County was “an anomaly,” she said.
“This is something that really just … caught all of us off guard,” Blatt said. 
School Board President Paul Hardesty told lawmakers that he expected other counties could be in a similar financial spot as Hancock County.
“If these counties don’t start making the tough cuts, and now that we’ve got this lifeline possibly coming into play, there’ll be others within two, three years, heading your way,” Hardesty said. “You cannot continue to spend money that you do not have. It does not work.”
Blatt said that the education department, which continues to investigate Hancock County’s financial situation, will work with the county prosecutor to determine if possible charges could be brought against local school officials related to financial mismanagement.

Elissa Slotkin speaks at the Samantha Woll Interfaith Roundtable, which she hosted in Lansing on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in Lansing. Jan. 19, 2026. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin is not giving up on working across the aisle, despite becoming the target of federal investigations and the ire of President Donald Trump in the last two months. But she has also drawn some lines in the sand — including voting for any increases to funding for federal law enforcement, specifically ICE, without significant reforms to their behavior. 
“I’m someone who believes we need law enforcement, I’m someone who served in the CIA, so I’m very supportive of, in general, law and order and safety, but that’s not what we have,” she told the Michigan Advance following a roundtable event in Lansing on Monday. “Until they reform themselves, I’m not going to feel comfortable supporting more resources going to them.”
Slotkin became a target of the president, the FBI and, most recently, the Department of Justice, after a November video where she and other members of Congress who are former military and national security officials urged current military servicemembers to “refuse illegal orders.” 
The roundtable event, which included faith leaders from around the state to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day was hosted by Slotkin at the Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce in honor of Samantha Woll, a Jewish community leader in Detroit who was killed in 2023 while she served as a deputy district director for Slotkin during her time in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Slotkin emphasized the importance of bringing visibility to the violence coming from ICE and other federal law enforcement, in Minnesota and elsewhere.  
“There’s a veil over the eyes of many Americans that’s just like, ‘Well, that’s not happening in my town, in my community, to my family’,” Slotkin said, responding to questions about how to effectively amplify the work being done by faith leaders around the country. “2026 feels like there’s a few more pinpoints in the veil than there was in 2025 and I think the feeling is that this is just going beyond the pale, even for folks who are still very, in many ways, supportive of the president.”

She emphasized again to the Advance how responding to the “well-worn playback on authoritarianism,” a phrasing she has used many times to describe the Trump administration, requires regular Americans to stand up to what they see as crossing an “internal red line for authoritarianism,” as she described it during the roundtable.
“When average people who don’t consider themselves activists or very political people start taking notice and saying, ‘No, that’s not okay,’ that’s when things change,” she said.
“You’re starting to see people who are not activists stand up and say, ‘No, I’m not going to let my country that I love do this.’ And I think that is the playbook for pushing back on this kind of behavior.”
Despite Slotkin’s head-on approach to the Trump administration, she emphasized to the Advance that she would not abandon attempts at bipartisanship in the Senate or in the upcoming Munich Security Conference, which she told the roundtable participants she plans to attend next month.
“If there’s an agriculture bill, or we just put out a bill on ending red tape around permitting reform, those are things where we work very hard across the aisle because they will help real Michiganders. And I’m not going to give up on that,” she said. “There are senators who refuse to do any bipartisan work because of what’s going on, and I’m not one of them, but I think it’s important that everyone just calls balls and strikes on what’s really happening”
One of those pieces of legislation that Slotkin hopes to push through with a bipartisan effort is the National Housing Emergency Act, introduced last month. 
“We drilled down after hearing from a ton of Michiganders on what the real problems were. We are short 4 million units of housing across the country, and that creates a terrible supply and demand problem that drives up prices,” she said. “Even as I deal with things like ICE or uniformed military in our streets, it’s still my job to be responsive to the issues that are affecting every single Michigander.”
But that bill has not garnered support from across the aisle, making it likely to fail in a Congress where the GOP controls both chambers. Still, she emphasized the importance of introducing those kinds of legislation that address the issues she hears from her constituents.

Editor’s note: The following is part of a series examining how the success of the Ole Mis football team could provide some solutions to Mississippi’s brain drain.

College football fans in Mississippi will be talking about the 2025-26 season for a long time, no matter what team they support. Ole Miss’s record-setting 13-2 season came to an end in the semifinals of the College Football Playoff.
In a state where potential has historically outstripped performance, the Rebels accomplished what few imagined was possible at the beginning of the season – if ever. The first playoff appearance for a team from Mississippi. The most wins in a season. The highest final regular season ranking since 1962. And – one can only assume – the most Trinidad and Tobago flags ever sold outside of the Caribbean. 
But this season will also be remembered for the topic that has dominated conversation for months among fans and non-fans alike: Mississippi’s brain drain. 
Two days after the Egg Bowl win against rival Mississippi State, Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin left Mississippi to take the head job at LSU. Despite six years of tweeting #ComeToTheSip, Kiffin felt that Baton Rouge, Louisiana, offered him more opportunity and prestige than Oxford, Mississippi. Nobody has ever departed the state with so much sound and fury, but plenty before him have moved away for similar reasons. In the past 12 years, Mississippi has lost more people to other states than the 68,251 who filled Vaught-Hemingway Stadium for the first-round playoff game against Tulane.  
Kiffin’s departure dramatized the relationship that has always existed between college football and the brain drain. The state’s first intercollegiate game was played in 1893, around the time that Mississippi began losing population to other states. Since that time, Mississippi’s migration history includes long stretches of losing years, punctuated by a few brief periods of success – similar to the records of Mississippi’s major football programs.  
Like the brain drain, college football is a prism for a place’s people, culture and economy. It is a national sport built on local pride, and its symbols and traditions are expressions of communal identity. Cowbells, the Grove, the Sonic Boom and the Fighting Okra encapsulate Mississippi culture as well as whole books written on the subject. 
But beneath the pageantry, college football boils down to a multibillion-dollar competition for talent. The best teams at the end of the season are almost always the teams that recruited the most talent before the season. It is an open competition, but it is not an equal one. Each school’s recruiting ability is determined by the economic and social structures that surround the university: schools with large fanbases and wealthy donors located in talent-rich regions usually draw the best players.
Mississippi is a small state that produces prodigious football talent, but it is divided between two SEC programs and another in the Sun Belt, as well as a trio of SWAC programs. Schools in Mississippi have rarely been able to amass as much talent as their larger and wealthier rivals from more populous states. 
In other words, college football is the brain drain in microcosm. Since most Mississippians follow college football as a matter of birthright, it is the best way to understand why Mississippi loses the talent competition with other states – and what it will take to win.
Top programs and places corner the market on talent 
The 136 schools that play at the highest Division I-FBS level work year-round to recruit and retain as much talent as possible from a limited pool of 18-to-22-year-old players. It is not uncommon for teams to replace half their rosters between seasons while most coaches last only three to four years at the same school. Despite the rapid personnel turnover, college football is the most hierarchical major American sport. Every program has good and bad years, but most have stayed in the same echelon since the era of leather helmets.
The eight schools with the best records since the turn of the 20th century (using Sports Reference’s Simple Rating System, which takes into account strength of schedule and point differential) have won eight of the 11 national championships since the playoff began in 2014. All eight finished in the top 18 of this year’s final regular season rankings. Even in a year that is poised to produce an improbable national champion, a school’s historical performance is the best predictor of how its 2025 team played. 

Places are similarly stratified, even as the people who live in them are changing constantly. Almost two in three people live in a different city than where they grew up, and roughly one-third live in a different state.
Yet most of the wealthiest places half a century ago sit atop of the economic hierarchy today, while most of the poorest places remain on the bottom today. The distribution of places by past and present per capita income resembles the ranking of college football programs. 
a



The top programs and places maintain their preeminence – and prevent the rise of rivals from lower tiers – because the competition for talent is biased in their favor. Five-star prospects go to Ohio State and Alabama for the same reason that the top financiers go to New York and computer scientists go to Silicon Valley: that’s where the best in their fields have always gone. Over time, they have accumulated institutional advantages – more wealth, higher professional ceilings, greater national recognition – that make them attractive destinations for the next generation. 
You don’t have to like Kiffin’s decision to acknowledge that it is easier to follow the well-worn path to success than to try to create it where it has not previously existed.
Mississippi excels at producing talent, not recruiting it
You’ll find Mississippians in the top ranks of nearly every profession, but most had to leave the state to get there. 
Football is the clearest example, in part because it affords us the most complete data. Mississippi produces football talent at a higher rate than any state in the country. Mississippi ranks first per capita in professional football players all-time, active NFL players, Hall of Famers and professional games played. 

By default, every professional football player who grew up in Mississippi left the state for their career. The outmigration of NFL players mirrors the brain drain in other fields. In both cases, Mississippi’s universities are often the launchpad for out-of-state job opportunities. A college education is hardly the only marker of talent, but it is the sharpest dividing line between who stays in Mississippi and who leaves. 
Almost half of Mississippi natives move away after earning a bachelor’s degree, compared to only 30% of Mississippians without a four-year degree. University graduates account for all of the net outmigration from Mississippi since 2010. If football is the rite of fall on campus, the rite of spring is newly-minted graduates packing up to leave Mississippi.
It is no coincidence that the most popular destinations are cities with pro football teams like Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and Nashville. Other top employers are located in those cities for the same reasons as the NFL: that’s where the people and money are. 
Nevertheless, Mississippians are only slightly more likely to leave their home state than other Southerners. What separates Mississippi from nearby states is the ability to recruit newcomers to replace them. For every 100 people born in the average Southern state, 28 move away while 59 move in. Mississippi loses 36 but gains only 26. 
College students are the primary exception. The state’s universities are the best recruiters of talent to the state – in part because of the national exposure from their college football teams. Approximately 4,500 more college students move to Mississippi each year than move away, the 15th-highest rate of net in-migration in the country. In total, about 38% of the enrollment at Mississippi’s eight public universities has come from outside the state.
The football rosters are even more geographically diverse than the campuses at large. Nearly three-quarters of Ole Miss’s team moved from another state, and about 60% of the teams at MSU and USM. More than half of the 77 active NFL players who played at one of Mississippi’s D1 programs were born outside of Mississippi. Most of them chose to play college ball in Mississippi over offers around the country. Twice in the past 13 years, the top high school recruit in the country chose to sign with a Mississippi school: Robert Nkemdiche came to Ole Miss from Georgia in 2013 and Travis Hunter came to JSU from Florida in 2021. 
Student-athletes enroll at Mississippi’s universities for the same reasons as other students: because they offer quality professional development, vibrant social atmospheres and competitive financial packages. Their recruiting success proves that Mississippi is capable of attracting talent from anywhere – as long as it can match the opportunities that exist in other places. 
The brain drain occurs because the opportunities in Mississippi dry up as soon as students graduate. The state ranks last in the share of jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or more. The cost of living is low, but the pay is even lower: college grads take home 10% less in Mississippi than in other Southeastern states even after accounting for price differences. Most of the population lives in rural areas or small towns, which do not appeal to young people seeking big-city amenities or cultural diversity. 
As a result, approximately 95% of out-of-state students leave within five years of graduation, to go along with the nearly half of Mississippi natives. Only two graduates move in from another state for every three who leave. From 2010 to 2020, Mississippi’s colleges and universities jumped from 43rd to 29th in the number of bachelor’s degrees granted per capita, but the share of college-educated 25-to-34-year-olds living in Mississippi dropped from 49th to 50th over the same period. 
A changing recruiting landscape is creating unlikely winners
Only six schools have won national championships in the playoff era. This year will produce the seventh. 
The final four contenders were Indiana, Oregon, Miami and Ole Miss. Only Indiana and Oregon had made a playoff prior to this season, but neither has won a national championship in school history. Miami won its most recent title in 2001, before any of the players on its current team were born. Ole Miss’s last championship (claimed by the school, though not recognized by the NCAA) came in 1962, another season overshadowed by off-field events. 
The common thread among the four semifinalists  is that they have aggressively adapted to the changing recruiting landscape. On the heels of a Supreme Court decision, the NCAA granted players the ability to be paid for their name, image and likeness (NIL) in 2020, followed by the lifting of restrictions on transferring between schools. Revenue sharing now allows schools to pay players directly. 
Players can now move around the country and compare financial offers, just as workers in other sectors have always been able to do. In the new era, recruiting talent has less to do with a program’s pedigree than its budget. The four semifinalists all have well-funded and well-organized NIL collectives that have allowed them to land talented transfers. While blue-bloods Georgia, Ohio State, Alabama still build their rosters through the high school ranks, more than half of the starters at Miami, Indiana and Ole Miss have come out of the portal. In the first two rounds of this year’s playoff, the team that started more transfers was 6-1 (Oregon and James Madison had an equal share). 
The changing landscape has not upended the established hierarchy – after all, blue-blood programs typically still have the largest fan bases and deepest pockets – but it has created new opportunities for upward mobility among programs that can raise enough money and invest it wisely.  
Broader societal and economic changes in wake of the pandemic have also shifted the migration of talent among the general population. Many of the largest and wealthiest cities began losing residents in 2020 as knowledge workers took advantage of their newfound ability to work remotely. Housing costs had been growing for decades in the nation’s top talent hubs, and COVID-era inflation brought affordability to a breaking point. In response, young professionals have flocked to smaller cities that offer many of the same urban amenities at a fraction of the price. 
According to Zillow, the nation’s hottest housing markets in 2025 were Buffalo, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; Providence, Rhode Island; and Hartford, Connecticut. All have historically been second- or third-tier cities in their regions. Three of the four had lost population since 1970. 
As in college football, the established hierarchy remains intact, but with more potential for upward mobility. Talent still tends to flow in the direction of the cities with the biggest economies and highest-paid jobs, but the changes since 2020 have created opportunities to redirect more talent to places that previous generations had left behind. 
Ole Miss built one of the nation’s best football teams because it figured out how to use the changing landscape to its advantage. As a state, Mississippi has not yet followed suit.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-19 20:00:37+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Federal cuts deepening food insecurity in Connecticut,Theo Peck-Suzuki,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/19/ct-food-insecurity-federal-cuts/,"CT plans to spend roughly $27.6 million more on food insecurity through FY27, but federal spending could drop $180 million over that time.","Food insecurity is rising in Connecticut, and the problem is likely to keep getting worse amid major cuts to federal food programs, according to a report released Friday by the Commission on Women, Children, Seniors, Equity & Opportunity.
The report noted that Connecticut has the highest rate of food insecurity in New England (14.3%, according to the most recent data from Feeding America) and trails many of its neighbors in spending to combat the problem. Although the state is projected to spend roughly $27.6 million more on food insecurity through fiscal year 2027, those increases are dwarfed by the loss of over $180 million in federal spending over that same period.
Specific losses include: 

The termination of the SNAP-ED program, which educates SNAP recipients on how to cook healthy meals and achieve physically active lifestyles; 
An increased administrative cost share for SNAP,  which begins in fiscal year 2027
Significant restrictions on SNAP-LIHEAP, which provides food and heating assistance to low-income households
The cancellation of certain bonus loads from TFAP (federal Emergency Food Assistance Program)
The termination of the LFPA (federal Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program), which purchased food for food banks from local farmers
The termination of the LFS (federal Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program), which purchased food for schools from local farmers

An additional $133 million loss is projected for 2028, which is when cost sharing for SNAP benefits themselves will begin. That’s how much the state will have to pay if its SNAP error rate — that is, how accurately the state calculates eligibility and benefits — remains unchanged. Based on that number, the report puts the total decrease in federal food spending for Connecticut in fiscal year 2028 at over $243 million.
Although inflation is not included in those calculations, the report notes grocery store inflation remained at 3% in 2025, likely putting further pressure on families’ food budgets.

The dramatic loss of funding is one reason the report’s primary recommendation this year is to establish a special fund to support food and nutrition programs statewide. The report envisions the fund working like others already in existence for tourism, insurance and transportation. 
The report suggests a handful of potential funding sources. One involves removing sales tax exemptions from certain extremely unhealthy foods and beverages and dedicating the revenue from items already taxed to the fund. Others include dedicating revenue from the 1% prepared meals surcharge; expanding the luxury tax to include high-value food and drink; and an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverage distributors.
Creating a fund might help Connecticut catch back up to its New England peers, some of which are significantly out-spending the state already. According to the report, Connecticut spends a total of $14.81 per capita on food across 51 programs. By comparison, Vermont spends $28.53 per capita across just its three top programs, while Massachusetts spends $35.03 per capita, also across three programs.

Rep. Gary Turco, D-Newington, said he was “ashamed” by those numbers and expressed support for the idea of a special fund to combat food insecurity.
“We have a special transportation fund. We believe transportation’s really important, right? People need to be able to get to work and school and things like that, so we have a dedicated revenue stream that goes into that that is not part of our spending cap. Why isn’t food as important?” he said during the presentation of the report.
The report also includes three new recommendations to specifically improve food and nutrition knowledge, the lack of which contributes significantly to food insecurity. 
“These are things that we think would cost little or no money but would help promote access to information for these families who currently have barriers to that,” said CWCSEO’s Christian Duborg.
One of these includes establishing an official methodology for collecting food insecurity data at the state level. The data in the report comes from a mix of sources including Feeding America, DataHaven and the USDA, not from the state government.
“There’s a lot of data at the federal level that is either not measured at all, has been stopped — they’re stopping measuring, or is rarely updated,” Duborg said. An official state data collection process could help fix that, he said.
The other two recommendations are to develop new labeling requirements for food content to establish a holistic food education roadmap for the state. This would involve creating model policies and curricula for K-12 schools and reconstituting SNAP-ED at the state level.
While strong food and nutrition education is “necessary” to combat food insecurity, Duborg said, it must be paired with food benefits to actually address the problem.
Rep. Jaime Foster, D-East Windsor, was one of a handful of state legislators at the presentation who suggested tapping into a $500 million pool the state set aside to offset federal cuts.
That money could be used to “reinstate programs like SNAP education … or address SNAP cuts or groups that are disproportionately impacted by changes in SNAP,” Foster said. “And then during session, we can renew our efforts on expanding programs that we know are meeting critical gaps in our system.”
Jacob Jakubowski of Connecticut Foodshare said he’s glad elected officials in Connecticut are actively looking for solutions and told presentation attendees the situation is grave.
“We can’t forget what just happened a couple of months ago [during the government shutdown],” Jakubowski said. “The SNAP crisis was the biggest threat to people facing food insecurity at least in my lifetime here in this country.”
Jakubowski said last year’s pause in SNAP benefits has caused “permanent damage” to the food security system.
“There’s people we’re finding right now, they don’t want to sign up for SNAP because they think SNAP is going away,” Jakubowski said.
Jakubowski also called attention to changes in TFAP, a federal program that provides food to food banks and pantries. In the first quarter of 2025, his organization got 84 truckloads of food from TFAP; in the first quarter of 2026, the projection is 26 loads. That means less food for food banks and pantries at a time when SNAP benefits are also likely to shrink.
Sen. Matthew Lesser, D-Cromwell, said pressures on food providers and constituents have been growing since the loss of COVID-era funding and said the passage of HR-1, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, has exacerbated those challenges.
Lesser also pointed out that “as recently as 2017, the state operated our own food security program … that we have now walked away from.”
“I think it really makes sense for us to sort of think creatively about what our role is in ensuring food security to our neighbors at a time when the federal government just is not a reliable partner,” Lesser said.
Duborg was frank about the scale of the challenge facing Connecticut.
“I wish I could say that if you adopt this, the problem will go away. I am not nearly arrogant enough to believe that I’ve figured out the answer. But the one thing that we do know is that doing nothing is causing a lot of harm, and while every option has drawbacks, very few options will have as many drawbacks as allowing food insecurity and nutrition insecurity to continue impacting our residents unabated,” Duborg said. 
He continued, “Residents will get sicker, students will have a harder time learning, families will struggle at work, and all of these impacts come with major financial costs to the state. So, by investing in food security through these recommendations, we believe that Connecticut can not only support its residents and improve quality of life for years to come but also make good investments that will also make the state fiscally stronger going into the future.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/FOOD-PANTRY-0711-DE-047-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 15:57:11.947104

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)After the dissolution of the state’s third-largest political party, the Alaska Division of Elections is sending out notices to the 19,117 members of the former Alaskan Independence Party, warning them to update their voter information.
“In the coming weeks, the DOE will inform the voters registered as affiliated with the AIP that the party is no longer recognized,” the department said in a notice published Wednesday. “These voters will have the option to select a new party or group affiliation if they wish. If they do not update their registration — by phone, email, in person, or through the online form — within 30 days of receipt, the Division plans to change their registration status to ‘undeclared.’”
The Alaskan Independence Party’s leadership formally dissolved the organization in a vote on Dec. 7, then released a statement at the end of the year about the decision.
That statement said the party elected a new board of directors in April 2024, and that board analyzed the state of the party.
“The board carried out its work and found that the current party membership is either apathetic to the goals of the party, believes that the party is a branch of the Republican party, or is registered to the AIP by mistake,” the statement said in part.
“The party has for some time been legally alive yet spiritually dead,” the statement said.
The AIP’s origins date to the early 1970s, when interior Alaska gold miner Joe Vogler attempted to rally opposition to federal land control after statehood.
Vogler ran for governor as an independent in 1974, and the AIP developed out of his Libertarian-like vision for the state — local control, limited government, and a new statewide referendum on whether Alaska should be a state, commonwealth, territory or fully independent.
For decades, AIP members contended that Alaska’s 1958 statehood vote was not valid because it did not present Alaskans with a full set of options.
The party peaked in 1990, when conservative Republicans abandoned their support of Sen. Arliss Sturgulewski for governor, who they deemed too moderate on abortion and environmental issues.
Former Republican Gov. Wally Hickel replaced John Lindauer on the AIP’s gubernatorial ticket, and Sturgulewski’s lieutenant governor candidate, Jack Coghill, defected to serve as Hickel’s lieutenant governor candidate.
Hickel and Coghill won the three-way election with just under 39% of the vote, marking the AIP’s sole statewide electoral win. 
That was the party’s high-water mark; Hickel governed as a Republican in all but name and rejoined the Republican party before his term ended. 
Vogler was murdered in 1993, and the party became an annual also-ran in statewide races. In 2024, when John Wayne Howe ran as the party’s candidate for U.S. House, he received just 4% of Alaskans’ first-choice votes.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey will have some of the strictest regulations on electric bikes in the nation under a bill Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law Monday.
The new law will require registration, licensing, and insurance for electric bikes, and it also does away with the three-tier system the state formerly used to classify them.
The new law, which also bans online e-bike sales for one year, comes after a series of fatal crashes involving e-bikes, including one that left a 13-year-old boy in Scotch Plains dead last year. Murphy, who leaves office Tuesday, said in a statement that the increasing popularity of e-bikes “requires us to take action and update regulations that help prevent tragedies from occurring.”
Paid family leave expands to more workers under new law

Bill sponsor Senate President Nick Scutari (D-Union) said the “dramatic increase” in faster and more powerful e-bikes has become dangerous.
“Their popularity with young people, coupled with their inexperience as operators, puts them at greater risk. We are in a new era of e-bike use that requires updated safety standards to help prevent accidents, injuries, and fatalities,” he said. “Requiring registration and licensing will improve their safe use and having them insured will protect those injured in accidents.”
The bill was heavily opposed by transportation groups and bike advocates. They called the legislation too restrictive for everyday e-bike riders and said it would disproportionately harm immigrant and low-income riders who rely on them for work.
“New Jersey has ambitious climate goals and a dire need to reduce traffic fatalities. We should be encouraging the shift toward sustainable, lightweight electric transportation, not building barriers against it,” said Zoe Baldwin of the Regional Plan Association.
Under the new law, “low-speed electric bikes” refers to bikes with an electric motor that cease to assist once the rider reaches 20 miles per hour; “motorized bikes” means bikes with a throttle that max out at 28 miles per hour; and “electric motorized bicycles” includes two-wheel pedaled vehicles with an electric motor that can exceed 28 miles per hour. Low-speed e-bikes and motorized bikes will now require licensing, insurance, and registration (they were already required for electric motorized bicycles).
The bill moved quickly in recent weeks, advancing out of both houses of the Legislature during its final voting session last week.
E-bike owners will have six months to meet the new licensing, registration, and insurance requirements. Licensing and registration fees will be waived for one year.
Minors under the age of 15 will be banned from operating low-speed e-bikes or motorized bicycles, and a 17-year-old is required to have a basic driver’s license to drive an e-bike. The law allows 16-year-olds to rent low-speed electric bikes that are part of a contract with local governments, like CitiBike.
The law also bans the sale of modification kits to turn a low-speed e-bike into a motorized bicycle, and for one year, the sale of electric motorized bikes online.

Notes, quotes and an opinion or three:
The educated guess here is that Trinidad Chambliss will be the starting quarterback for Ole Miss when the Rebels open the 2026 season against Louisville at Nashville on either Sept. 5 or 6.
Rick Cleveland
Yes, I know, the NCAA has denied Chambliss’s initial request for a sixth year of eligibility. But Ole Miss has appealed that decision, and Chambliss has petitioned for both temporary and permanent restraining orders against the NCAA. That case will be heard in the Chancery Court of Lafayette County, about a mile from Vaught-Hemingway Stadium and a decided home field advantage for Chambliss and Ole Miss.
Lose there – as we presume the NCAA will – and the NCAA could appeal to the the Mississippi Supreme Court. Not exactly the most neutral of sites, either.
A decision on the temporary restraining order could come as early as this week.  Should the TRO be granted, the legal process to decide the permanent restraining order could take weeks or even months and possibly not be decided until 2027, by which time Chambliss will be preparing for the NFL Draft.
There is also a chance that the NCAA will regroup, consider the likelihood of losing in Mississippi courts (and the cost involved there) and grant the Ole Miss appeal in the near future. 
Either way, Chambliss and Ole Miss win.
•••
Should Chambliss be allowed to play another season of college football? Your answer depends on your allegiance. But consider this: Carson Beck was leading Miami into Monday night’s national championship game in his sixth year of college football. We don’t know if Beck, a multimillionaire at 23, will take the team bus to Hard Rock Stadium or make the short drive over in his Lamborghini.
We do know that Beck has made sort of a mockery of the education element of college football during the lead-up to the national championship game against Indiana. Beck graduated from the University of Georgia in 2023. Asked last week if he had attended classes at Miami in the week leading up to the game, Beck responded, “No class. I graduated two years ago.”
Meanwhile, Indiana will be quarterbacked by Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza, a mere 22-year-old who graduated from the University of California last year and has one year of college eligibility remaining. Mendoza is expected to forego that final year of eligibility to likely be the first pick of the upcoming NFL Draft.
You ask me, the best way to prevent these seemingly endless eligibility issues is to give college athletes five years to complete their careers. That would be five years to play as many as five seasons. You could solve other problems by allowing for only one transfer during those five years.

Don’t look now, but Ole Miss is starting to play basketball the way we have become accustomed to Chris Beard-coached teams playing. The Rebels won their third straight game Saturday night, edging Mississippi State 68-67 at Starkville. The victory lifted Ole Miss to 11-7 overall and 3-2 in the SEC, good for a seven-way tie for third place and only one game out of first. State dropped to 10-8, 2-3.
Just goes to show you how fast things can change in the SEC. Ten days ago Ole Miss was 0-2 and in last place. Ten days ago, Mississippi State was 2-0 and tied for first.
Ole Miss plays host to Auburn at 8 p.m. Tuesday. State plays at Texas A&M Wednesday night at 8. 
Five games into the SEC schedule, the league has never seemed more balanced. Thirteen of the 16 teams are within two games of first place.

Irrigators reject accusation of $1.6M “conflict of interest” payment for reservoir they say will allow profitable crops in Hyattville.
The post Mounting dam costs include moving private landing strip appeared first on WyoFile .","As debate over rising cost estimates for the proposed Alkali Creek Dam continues, one critic asserts that the sponsoring water district is entangled in a conflict of interest after paying a board member $1.6 million.
A neighbor to the proposed dam site is upset that the Nowood Watershed Improvement District paid the Paint Rock Angus Ranch — owned by the Martin Mercer family — the hefty sum for land and easements while Martin Mercer sat on the district board.
Tim Gardiner, owner of the Twisted Tippet Ranch that lies just below the proposed dam site, called the payment “a massive conflict of interest,” involving “good old boy” politicking.
“We’ve got the president and vice president [of the Nowood district] crafting their own deal,” Gardiner said. “It’s a lot of money without the light-of-day overview.”
Mercer and Nowood District President John Joyce rejected the allegation, saying the 35-member association is small, doesn’t have a lot of board candidates and is following its charter.
“Nobody has run against me,” Mercer said of board elections. He signed up for board duty because, “I always felt I could bring something to the table.”
“We followed all the rules”martin Mercer
Irrigators anticipated spending the state funds to buy reservoir property, and studies determined that Mercer’s land was the bestideal site.
“We followed all the rules,” Mercer said. “Everything was voted on by our peers. It’s been transparent. It’s been democratic.
“I don’t know there’s any conflict of interest.”
Joyce agreed with Mercer but said he realizes the optics are bad.
Despite public perception, he said, “it’s been done correctly and above board.”
Five times more
As Wyoming advances plans to construct the dam, lawmakers are increasingly alarmed by cost estimates that have climbed from $20 million to more than $100 million even before a spade of dirt has been turned.
The state of Wyoming would pay for all but about $2 million of the 100-foot-high, half-mile-long earth embankment. The dam would hold a 9,000-acre-foot reservoir to provide 6,000 acre-feet of supplemental irrigation to 35 irrigating families.

Some of the anticipated expenses are understandable for a reservoir that would cover 312 acres. A contract for just some of the required dirt carries a nearly $900,000 price tag.
As engineers worked on the project, they discovered the dirt, or fill, they had counted on for the structure would not meet the specifications. So they would need more, would have to truck it farther and would have to make the dam larger than originally planned.
Engineers also found another costly problem.
A porous geologic formation under the dam site proved to be an issue. It would require grouting — injection of cement underground — to seal off any potential leaks.
Another hiccup came when some neighbors questioned why they should provide easements for an undertaking they didn’t consider a benefit. To bring them on board, water developers may have to spend more than anticipated to upgrade a principal feeder canal, and even bury it in a pipeline.
Wyoming may also buy pivot irrigation systems for neighbors, a conservation expense that’s an exception to state policy.
Then there is inflation, supply-chain challenges and other unseen developments in a shifting economic environment.
And the expense of relocating a private airstrip.
A private airstrip
The dam and reservoir would make a private airstrip on Mercer’s ranch inoperable. So plans call for relocating it, along with “an existing metal building … used as an aircraft hangar.”

Water developers “will accommodate the proposed [replacement] airstrip in the Project design and construction, including performing rough grading for 1,200 feet of airstrip,” according to a legal agreement between the Mercer ranch and the Nowood district. The water district will also pay Mercer and the ranch $140,400 to build a replacement hangar and supply it with a water line.
The Wyoming Water Development Office looked at 41 sites before settling on the Mercer ranch. Developers believed that locating a new reservoir on the nearby Bighorn National Forest or even property managed by the Bureau of Land Management “is not something that would be successful,” Joyce told WyoFile.
Consultants compared the fees, delays and other aspects of dealing with federal agencies to buying Mercer property and easements, moving the airstrip and more, Joyce said.
“All that was put on paper,” he said. “It was just math at that point.”
Mercer added that the project “wound up landing here as far as being cost-effective.”
Gardiner is also upset because the Water Development Commission and the Nowood district paid for the Mercer property before they had all the necessary easements secured. Wyoming officials have said they would not condemn private property for the dam, only secure easements on a willing-seller basis.
But some landowners, Gardiner included, are holding out for assurances that will protect their property. Gardiner, for example, wants the reservoir flows moved away from his house, other design improvements and insurance against a potential flood.

Others want an enlarged Anita Ditch, which would feed the reservoir, buried in a pipe, a costly proposition. The Water Development Office would install pivot irrigation sprinklers to aid those who won’t directly benefit from reservoir flows.
The Mercer purchase was putting the cart before the horse and putting taxpayer funds at risk, Gardiner said. The proper course would have been to secure options — legal agreements for easements and land purchases that are contingent upon first securing all necessary project elements. Only then should money have been spent, he said.
Now, state funds are in danger of being stranded if the project collapses, Gardiner said.
He also accused the state of “poor financial management,” arguing that money that’s now sitting idle should instead have been accruing interest.
Over-adjudicated
A fifth-generation rancher, Mercer said the Nowood drainage has been “over-adjudicated” — that the state allocated rights to more water than was available. “We learned how to live being short of water,” he said.
“They always figured on a reservoir,” he said of area settlers. Instead, ranchers and farmers now watch spring runoff flow by, then scratch what they can out of Alkali, Paint Rock and Medicine Lodge creeks.

“As much water as goes by in the spring, you just dream of a chance like this,” Mercer said.
When first envisioned by a steering committee, a reservoir was estimated to cost as little as $15 million to $20 million, Joyce said. Now, legislators say a $100-million-plus price tag puts the acre-foot cost in the stratosphere.
It’s unfair to compare today’s dam projects with those in the heyday of water development decades ago, Water Development Office Director Jason Mead told water officials in November. Major on-channel dams that block rivers, “you just can’t build those anymore,” he said.
As a result, “you really don’t get the economy of scale … like you did back in the ’50s and earlier,” he said.
Also, storage projects now consider needs on a watershed scale, Mead said, which means addressing wildlife, irrigation efficiency, water quality, fisheries, recreation and other factors. The reservoir would always have at least a 132-acre pool for recreation.
The 6,000 acre-feet of stored water would be used as “supplemental irrigation” to ensure and boost crop yields, Joyce said.
“This area has very little rain — five to six inches [of] moisture all year,” he said. “Everything we grow is irrigated. When the snow melts, we’re done.”
That limits the types of crops that ranchers and farmers can grow. With more water, crops that are more valuable than livestock grass can be cultivated. “Corn, beets and alfalfa are more profitable,” Joyce said.
The dam fits with Wyoming’s overall plan to take earnings from the one-time extraction of resources like coal and invest them in renewable endeavors like water storage, ranching and farming, Joyce has said.
Heart of the ranch
For Mercer, the decision to sell part of his family ranch was wrenching. Homesteading family members in the late 1800s “sacrificed to own this piece of ground,” he said.
“It’s not easy to sell the heart of your operation,” he said. “Not everybody is excited in the Mercer family.”
The next generation of Mercers who are involved in the Paint Rock Ranch business gives him hope, he said.
“That sums up Wyoming,” he said. “Any kid you can keep in the state is a plus.”

While Securix cameras no longer record license plates to cite uninsured vehicle owners, the Mississippi Department of Transportation has a live traffic camera at the intersection and there's a Flock camera for public safety.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
A Chancery Court judge has agreed to dissolve a partnership formed to profit from uninsured motorists whose license plates were captured by traffic cameras in Ocean Springs, Biloxi and other Mississippi cities. 
A politically prominent trio of Mississippians formed QJR LLC to run the uninsured motorist program in Mississippi with Jonathan Miller, chairman of Georgia-based Securix LLC. Miller and his company have a proprietary system that randomly checks license plate numbers against state databases to identify uninsured vehicles and ticket their owners through law enforcement agencies.
Miller and Securix started the program in Ocean Springs, signing a contract in May 2021 with the city. Miller then teamed up with QJR, whose members are Quinton Dickerson and Josh Gregory of Frontier Strategies advertising firm in the metro Jackson area, plus attorney Robert Wilkinson of Pascagoula. 
Frontier manages high-profile state and local political campaigns, while Wilkinson was city attorney for Ocean Springs when the partners formed Securix Mississippi to spread the potentially profitable program to more cities and states. Miller was supposed to manage the technology, while an operating agreement between his company and QJR stipulated that only QJR would handle marketing and direct contact with Mississippi customers.
Motorist ticketing program unravels 
The partnership began to unravel within a month, Josh Gregory testified in Chancery Court before Judge Harris. Miller failed to show up for the trial. He was representing himself after Harris excused Miller’s attorney from the case in October, when the attorney-client relationship had completely broken down.
 QJR filed its lawsuit against Miller and Georgia Securix in September 2024, asking that Harris dissolve Securix Mississippi and order Miller to stop defaming QJR and its members and levy punitive damages against him. The lawsuit was sealed for more than a year, although Harris did not follow established procedure for removing the case from public view. He unsealed most, but not all, records in the case after statewide media company Mississippi Today, later joined by the Sun Herald, objected to the sealing. 
Harris decided that Securix Mississippi bank records would remain sealed — again without establishing a need to prevent public access to the entire bank record. 
By the time QJR filed its lawsuit, the state Department of Public Safety had cut off Securix Mississippi’s access to the database of uninsured motorists after receiving at least one complaint from Miller about how Securix Mississippi was operating. 
Gregory testified that Miller was not supposed to be communicating with public officials, according to their operating agreement. He said Securix Mississippi had ceased operations by 2025 and has no remaining assets. The company had previously pulled in $1.3 million in a year, according to records in a federal case that motorists filed in August 2023 against Georgia Securix.
MS partner testifies about Securix 
Gregory testified that Miller was spreading false rumors of criminal wrongdoing against him and QJR. Miller sent emails and letters to public officials, including Public Safety Commissioner Sean Tindell, and others. Miller claimed QJR was misusing sensitive personal information about vehicle owners that only law enforcement officers were supposed to access. 
“Pretty much everything he wrote, via email, letter or post, was untrue,” Gregory testified. “ . . . If he didn’t get his way, he would send email after email, to the point that we had to block his emails. They were excessive.”
 Gregory said that QJR had attempted to keep Miller out of day-to-day operations in Mississippi because the program Miller and Georgia Securix ran in Ocean Springs was “such a disaster.” One of Miller’s later allegations was that Wilkinson was involved in the Ocean Springs program and shared in its profits, which Gregory testified was “completely untrue.” 
Commissioner Tindell pulled Securix access to the uninsured motorist database in August 2023, court records show, after a letter from Miller alleged the program was being mismanaged. 
Gregory testified that Miller did not provide documentation of the wrongdoing that he alleged. 
Judge Harris has found Miller in contempt of court multiple times, but Miller has not returned to Mississippi and still owes more than $63,603 in attorney’s fees that Harris ordered the businessman to pay QJR’s attorney, Jaklyn Wrigley. Harris ordered the fees paid after finding that Miller had wrongly tried to move QJR’s case to federal court. The federal judge sent the case back to Harris.
In addition to dissolving Securix Mississippi, Harris also could consider QJR’s request for punitive damages against Miller and Georgia Securix, along with other relief QJR is seeking. 
“While the other side did not show up for court yet again, we continued to provide the facts about this matter and are glad to be moving toward the resolution we’ve been advocating for since the start of this process more than a year ago,” said Jaklyn Wrigley, attorney for QJR.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/18161106/Securix-traffic-intersection.jpg,,,2026-01-19 13:57:10.431154

But when she found out she’d need three separate permits — one to grow, one to ship plants in or out, and one to sell plants grown somewhere else — she was overwhelmed by the paperwork each permit required and the more than 150 pages of rules that came with them.

“We got enough together to buy our own property and build our own building. And we were so excited. We thought the sky was the limit,” Nicholls said. “The sky’s not the limit. The rules and regulations are the limit. You can only go as far as they let you go. There are license after license on the books.”
Wouldn’t it be easier, she thought, if state regulators combined them into a single certification.
“They dollar you to death,” Nicholls said. “Five here, five there, 10 here, 15 there.”
That’s why Nicholls and others are pushing for legislation to increase scrutiny of the state’s more than 80,000 regulations.
More oversight
State law already provides for oversight of the rules state agencies put on businesses operating in the Palmetto State. But the South Carolina chapter of Americans for Prosperity believes legislators should do more to ensure they actually review them.
Getting the bill, which passed the House unanimously last March, through the Senate and across the governor’s desk is the top priority of the political advocacy group founded in 2004 by libertarian billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.
At top of mind for the group is making sure legislators sign off on any costly regulations.
Legislators are supposed to give final approval to all agency regulations, minus those required by federal law. But there’s a loophole.
If the General Assembly neither approves nor denies a rule within 110 days, it takes effect automatically. That’s what happened in 2024 with the Department of Education’s regulation on age-appropriate books in schools. Senators were incensed it skipped their review entirely. Last year, legislators voted unanimously on a law to automatically pause the clock on regulatory reviews from mid-May to mid-January while they’re not in session. The law also shortened the total days, from 120 to 110.
Americans for Prosperity wants to stop automatic approvals altogether for any regulation that boosts business expenses. Under the bill, if the estimated cost to businesses across an industry exceeds $1 million over a five-year period, legislators would have to take an up-or-down vote.
Six of the 77 regulations automatically approved in the last seven years would have been subject to the $1 million threshold, according to the group’s state director, Matt Humm.
In Nicholls’ case, the annual cost of the permits she needed vary by the size of the business — ranging from free for small operations to $300 for a large one. The cost of shipping plants in and out varies based on the number of plants transported — $17 for a batch of 25 or $280 for 10,000 plants.
That doesn’t include costs she might face for things like pest or disease control. Stopping their spread is the primary concern of those regulations.
One in, two out
State law requires other layers of review before any proposed change to a regulation gets to the Legislature, including public hearings and a fiscal impact analysis.
And existing rules must go back before legislators for re-approval every five years. Still, Humm said, outdated regulations tend to linger and don’t always keep pace with modern technological advancements.
The legislation combats that with a pair of blanket requirements meant to cut the overall number of regulations. One calls for a 25% reduction in the number of regulations each type of small business faces.
The second is a two-for-one provision, forcing agencies to cut to rules for each new one they propose.

It’s a measure Kathleen Stevens supports.
“I’m not saying we don’t need them. I’m just saying we don’t need all of them,” she said. “There’s just garbage on the books.”
While raising her sons, Stevens ran a side business painting and restoring furniture. After her children graduated, she decided she wanted to open a space where other small craft and antique vendors like her could hawk their wares in downtown Chester.
She opened Rainbow Rooster Boutique four years ago with plans of operating a small cafe in the back of the store.
“I just wanted to serve a little coffee and pastries,” Stevens said.
The cafe space remains empty, she said, because she doesn’t have the money to install all the equipment regulators told her she needed. She pulled the application. 
“I was overwhelmed,” she said. 
‘Lose our entrepreneurship’
Business owners including Nicholls, Stevens and Zack Holt say they’re not opposed to regulations, but they want reassurances that they’re up to date and absolutely necessary.
When Holt purchased an existing restaurant space in Hartsville a couple of years ago for a new location of Holt Bros BBQ, state highway regulators told him the sign that had been in place under previous ownership was too close to the state road.
While Holt didn’t put it there, the state still required him to move it. That, along with permitting delays at the city level, held up his grand opening for nine months, he said.
“That’s nine months’ worth of lost revenue and income,” he said.
And he had to send the new employees he had hired to work at other locations.
Americans for Prosperity and the small business owners it’s representing argue small companies don’t have the same financial wherewithal as big ones to comply with these rules.
“We’re going to lose our entrepreneurship to large corporations,” Stevens said.
Still, state law has had carveouts in place since 2004 meant to address that as well.
When a new rule has a big impact on small businesses, it must go before a special, 11-member committee housed at the state Department of Commerce and made up of small business owners. Part of that process must include financial studies and plans by agencies to reduce the burden on those business owners or exempt them from the rule altogether.
The proposed law would require the same cost-benefit analyses for all new and re-approved regulations. It would also send that information to more people, including the small business panel, for review.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5C9F5BD9-47B0-47FC-AF5B-6742DE67478C_1_201_a.jpeg,,,2026-01-19 12:57:03.516501

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The prospective buyer of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital missed the final, court-ordered deadline to close the deal, leaving the fate of the two safety net hospitals in the hands of the state.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha confirmed in a statement on Saturday that The Centurion Foundation failed to meet the Jan. 15 deadline to cement its purchase of the two hospitals in Providence and North Providence. The due date was set under a Dec. 9 agreement between Neronha’s office and the attorneys representing the bankruptcy estate for their existing owner Prospect Medical Holdings. 
Buyer of Roger Williams, Fatima hospitals ‘will work like expletive deleted to get this done’

The missed deadline now puts the onus on the state to take over hospital operations — and pay for the costs associated with payroll, taxes and insurance — by Jan. 30, as laid out in the December agreement. Neronha hinted previously that a court-appointed state receivership was possible if the Centurion deal fell through, but provided little detail.
“Centurion is free to continue to try to close, but we now have work to do and a deadline by which to do it,” Neronha said in an email Saturday afternoon. “My Office is working hard in consultation with other state leaders and I expect you will hear more about that next week.”
Preserving the pair of hospitals — with 500 beds, 50,000 annual emergency room visits and nearly 2,500 employees between them — has been a top focus of Neronha’s office, and, as scrutiny over the sale intensifies, Rhode Island officials more broadly. But none have put a price tag — at least publicly — on what the state is willing to pay to keep the hospitals running.
Gov. Dan McKee’s proposed fiscal 2027 budget, unveiled on Thursday, one day before the Jan 15 deadline, did not include any money for the hospitals. 
Meanwhile, Centurion appears not to have given up, still courting the investor-backed bonds needed to finalize its purchase.
“We are keenly aware of the bankruptcy court timetable,” Ben Mingle, Centurion CEO and president, said in a statement Friday night. “Our financing team…has had daily interactions with potential investors over the last several weeks with significant progress. This includes site visits by new, industry-leading investment groups just this week with very encouraging results. At the same time, we have been briefing State leaders almost daily on the status of these efforts and our plans to meet the bond sale target. The Team remains optimistic and we hope to provide a formal update next week.”
It’s a familiar promise for those following the yearslong saga of the local hospitals, where operational and financial mismanagement under Prospect and its former majority stakeholder, private equity firm Leonard Green, were well-documented.
The Centurion Foundation appeared to be a way out. The Atlanta nonprofit pledged to return the cash-strapped health care facilities to local control while injecting $80 million into immediate operations under the terms of the state’s June 2024 conditional approval. 
But investors have been reluctant to back the bonds needed for Centurion to close, with credit rating agencies’ noting Centurion’s lack of experience in hospital ownership and the dismal outlook for health care facilities nationwide amid federal funding cuts.
The prolonged state of limbo frustrated hospital workers, health care advocates and public officials. But it proved most problematic for the more than 100,000 creditors owed up to $10 billion collectively from Prospect at the time it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2025. The bankruptcy estate initially signaled a desire to close the hospitals in October, but an interim agreement with funding partially provided by a state-controlled escrow account kept the doors open through Jan. 30.
But as of that date, the hospitals are coming off Prospect’s asset list, with all liabilities, costs and responsibilities transferred to the state of Rhode Island.
How the state will afford its new guardian duties is unclear.
Rhode Island officials have been on high alert for the pending sale, with Senate President Valarie Lawson calling it “the most pressing issue facing Rhode Island” in an interview after McKee’s State of the State address on Jan. 13. McKee briefly addressed the hospitals during the hourlong speech, pledging his administration will “do everything in our power” to keep the hospitals open.
Neronha and union leaders with the United Nurses and Allied Professionals, which represents more than 1,500 workers across both hospitals, have criticized McKee for failing to proactively take control of the uncertain situation, contrasting his leadership with Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey. 
Healey in 2024 offered a multimillion dollar state incentive package to entice buyers — including Brown University Health — after Steward Health Care filed for bankruptcy and sold its Massachusetts facilities. 
Brian Daniels, director for the Rhode Island Office of Management and Budget, said Thursday the governor’s administration was working closely with Neronha’s office and the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services on “contingency planning.”
“We are monitoring what happens,” Daniels said. “We have some ideas.”

(Photo courtesy of DNR nest monitoring volunteer, Randy Cook)Peregrine falcon reproduction in Iowa “likely remains stable” following successful reintroduction efforts in the 1990s, but the Iowa Department of Natural Resources said monitoring is still warranted due to the threat of the bird flu on the recovering bird population.
According to the 2025 peregrine falcon report, four peregrine falcons died from the highly pathogenic avian influenza outside of nesting season that year. 
“Overall, Iowa’s nesting population of Peregrine Falcons appears to be stable, with birds generally returning to historic nesting sites each year, but this recovering population continues to warrant annual monitoring,” the report reads. 
The highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has notably killed millions of commercial poultry and egg-laying birds, also spreads among wild migrating birds. The virus primarily infects waterfowl and shorebirds, but can also reach birds of prey like peregrine falcons, osprey and eagles that feast on the other birds.

Volunteers and trained surveyors monitored 20 nests in 2025, of which 13 were deemed successful, meaning the nests raised young birds to the fledgling stage. Volunteers, some of which are employees at power plants since the birds like to nest on energy plant towers, observe the nests several times throughout the year and record if the birds have mated and how many young are in the nest.
There were three more nests monitored in 2025 than in 2024, however the report said none of the 2025 nests were new nests. In 2024, DNR reported peregrine falcons had an above average year for reproduction with an average of 2.77 young per nest and a total of 36 young birds fledged, or surviving to the age of flying.
Reproduction statistics in 2025 were lower, with an average of 1.87 young per nest and a total of 28 fledged, but DNR said the 2025 statistics are similar to the three years prior, which indicates falcon reproduction is stable. Of the 20 monitored nests, one was inactive and four had an unknown outcome.

The birds of prey have dark colored caps, a stripe under their eye and slate blue colored backs with white, speckled chests. The crow-sized birds tend to be monogamous, according to DNR, and will reuse nest sites for several years. 
Many peregrine falcon nesting sites in Iowa have their own livestreams, like the nest on the Dubuque County Courthouse.
In Iowa, the birds tend to nest primarily in eastern Iowa on Mississippi River cliff faces, urban settings or on electrical towers. 
Peregrine falcons disappeared from Iowa in the 1950s as they – like many other birds – were impacted by pesticides like DDT. A total of 169 peregrine falcons were released in Iowa between 1989 and 2003 in an effort to reintroduce the bird to the state. 
Information on peregrine falcon and other wildlife monitoring programs can be found online.

However, Downing said he would not support […]","President Donald Trump poses with members of Montana's federal delegation — Sen. Tim Sheehy, Rep. Ryan Zinke, and Rep. Troy Downing, as well as Arkansas Rep. Bruce Westerman — after signing H.J.Res. 104, rolling back a BLM rule which prohibited future coal leasing in eastern Montana. In a telephone town hall last week, Montana Congressman Troy Downing told constituents he supported President Donald Trump’s toppling of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, blamed the domestic unrest over ICE raids on social media and biased reporting, and said Republicans want to fix a broken health care system.
However, Downing said he would not support any action that threatened the NATO alliance, while detailing Greenland’s importance to the United States.
The first-term Republican from Montana’s central-and-eastern Congressional District defended the Trump administration and claimed that wages were increasing faster than inflation, saying that was a sign that Republican policies were taking hold. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, inflation grew at 2.7% during 2025, while wage growth outpaced it at 3.8%.
  Venezuela 

Downing said that he supported Trump’s use of force to remove Maduro, calling him “a narco-terrorist.” He also told listeners that Maduro’s regime in Venezuela was supporting Cuba, China and Russia and was a threat to the “Monroe Doctrine,” which he referenced several times.
The Monroe Doctrine is a policy established by the Presidency of James Monroe that asserted that the United States of America should be in control of what happens in the western hemisphere.
“I personally believe the President had Article Two (of the U.S. Constitution) authority because there were exigent circumstances that were harming Americans and totally support that,” Downing said. “I don’t believe this was anything more than protecting American authority.”
Downing said what Americans have missed is that previously even the Biden administration had put a bounty for Maduro.
“I don’t see this as being an act of war. I see this as a Department of Justice action to bring a criminal to trial,” he said.
Downing also claimed by taking out Maduro, America had freed the Venezuela people who were grateful.
“I think we need to be more diligent about what happens in the Western Hemisphere. We need to start looking at other adversaries, starting to do this. I do believe that this has greatly increased the security in the Western Hemisphere,” Downing said.
  ICE, Renee Good and Minneapolis 

Downing said that he supports Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and the work the department is doing in U.S. cities. He also said that he believes the conflict in U.S. cities is happening for a number of reasons including social media and biased news reporting.
The Congressman vacillated between calling the shooting of resident Renee Good “tragic” and asserting protestors are interfering with federal law enforcement.
“Calmer heads should prevail,” Downing said. “Interfering with federal law enforcement is a crime. It appears there were big attempts at interfering with federal law enforcement and when that happens, you put everybody at risk — law enforcement, the people that they’re trying to interact with, the folks that are doing the interfering. And while we all understand that Americans have a First Amendment right to protest, we need to be really careful when that protest crosses the line with interference in law enforcement operations.”
No evidence has substantiated that Good was trying to interfere with law enforcement herself.
Several callers had questions about ICE and the possibility of government overreach. A caller identified as Caitlin from Billings asked, “My question specifically refers to the authoritarian federal overreach that seems to be existing in the organization of ICE and the way they are impacting citizen life.”
While she admitted that there are serious criminal problems, she questioned the cost, especially because of civil unrest in places like Minneapolis and Portland.
“First of all, I don’t subscribe to authoritarian overreach. I don’t agree with that at all,” Downing said. “Immigration, immigration enforcement and federal law enforcement is a tool that’s been around for a long time, used by presidents of both parties. This is not anything new. You look at the news cycles, you look at social media and you look at how they try to make you angry.”
The Congressman leveled the blame at both media and social media, saying that the combination is “blowing it out of proportion.”
“Because they’re angry, because they’re watching social media, they’re starting to say, ‘I’m going to take this beyond doing a demonstration, and I going to start block them from doing their job. And that’s a federal crime to keep them from doing their job,” he said. “This is not a partisan issue. I think that it has gotten as frosty as it has again because a lot of people have been angered because they’re getting one side of the story.”
  Federal reserve 

Last week, news broke of the U.S. Department of Justice investigating Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for allegedly making false claims to Congress about the renovation of the Washington, D.C., office.
The Federal Reserve system was established more than a century ago to maintain independent federal fiscal policy and make apolitical decisions in the best interests of the economy and U.S. monetary policy.
Downing, who serves on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, said he believes Powell is “an honorable person.” He also said he supports the Fed remaining independent.
“So, first of all, nobody — nobody’s above the law,” Downing said. “It is of paramount importance that we maintain an independent Fed. Without having an independent Fed, a lot of things that make this country great, that make the dollar the global trading currency that has really fostered innovation and growth and the American dream — a lot of that depends on an independent Fed.”
  Healthcare troubles 

Downing also heard from a number of constituents about the expiration of healthcare subsidies that were begun during the COVID-19 pandemic. While Downing said he sympathized with some of the callers and their lack of insurance, he told listeners he couldn’t support a broken system. Downing voted against renewing the subsidies and they expired at the end of 2025.
He blamed sky-rocketing costs of pharmaceuticals and a shrinking pool of healthy citizens contributing to the rising rates.
“What we’ve seen now is more than a decade of adverse selection, meaning healthy young people keep coming off the plan, and it’s concentrating that risk, which pushes the expenses up, which then gets repriced the following year, and causes the whole thing to circle again,” Downing explained.
He said the answer is reforming the law to by expanding Health Savings Accounts, increasing tax credits, and focusing on drug prices.
“It’s going to be completely unaffordable and collapse under its own weight if we don’t do something,” Downing said.
He said that concerns about healthcare and prices are among the highest volume of calls to his office.
“The subsidies only affected about 7% of the population,” Downing said. “What me and my colleagues want to do is start addressing the things that are causing healthcare to go up.”
He cited that 25% of all insurance costs related to prescription drug costs and he sees that as a way to bring the cost down.
“I don’t not believe if you have a broken system, the response should ever be write a bigger check to hide it. I think we need to actually roll up our sleeves and start dealing with some of the things that we’ve actually identified as contributing to the costs,” Downing said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/G77nYVkWgAAXcCZ-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-19 11:57:54.770503

Senate Republican leaders have declared the House school-choice bill -- at least the part about using tax dollars for private schools -- dead on arrival.,"The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Republican Speaker Jason White got his omnibus education overhaul/school-choice bill through the House last week, but it was a squeaker for the speaker. 
The vote was 61-59 with 17 of White’s GOP supermajority peeling off and voting no, and two either absent or “taking a walk” and not voting.
White put on a full-court press in whipping reluctant Republicans to vote for the measure, which would, notably, allow families to use state tax dollars for private schooling. 
Last week White invoked President Donald Trump and secured a social media endorsement for the bill from Trump Education Secretary Linda McMahon. White has touted letters of endorsement from the state’s Catholic dioceses and other religious groups supporting school choice that could garner their school systems public money. And famed football star Tim Tebow is coming to Mississippi this week to promote the “Tim Tebow Act” part of the House bill that would allow homeschooled kids to play public-school sports.
But opposition to the bill appears more grassroots, and lawmakers are getting calls from their school superintendents and teachers back home urging them to oppose it.
Can White keep his razor-thin vote together for what promises to be an uphill battle for House Bill 2? Senate Republican leaders have declared the House school-choice bill — at least the part about using tax dollars for private schools — dead on arrival.
A win-one-for-the-Gipper campaign, even with Trump as the Gipper, might not be enough to keep the bill alive through a battle with the Senate, especially if House supermajority votes are needed to do so later in the session.
When Trump says jump, Republican Mississippi politicians typically only ask “how high?”
But so far, this appears to be the odd occurrence where a majority of Republicans in the 174-member Legislature in ruby red, Trump-supporting Mississippi are prepared to buck a proposal from his White House.
Quote of the Week

“If little Johnny’s momma is on crystal meth, and little Johnny’s daddy is a pimp, can you tell me how they (are) gonna be able to choose that little Johnny is getting the right kind of education services when that’s not even on their plate?” — Rep. John Hines, during debate over accountability for private schools if the Legislature approves letting parents use tax dollars to pay tuition.

In Brief
Legislation would support nuclear expansion in MS
State officials have signaled they are open to expanding nuclear power development in the state. 
Bills to support this have been proposed in the House and Senate, driven in part by demand for power created by data centers popping up all over the South and Mississippi to support the artificial intelligence boom. 
A bill authored by Sen. Joel Carter, a Republican from Gulfport, would provide $10 million to the Mississippi Development Authority to spend on “future nuclear development” for the upcoming fiscal year. A House bill by Rep. Jody Steverson, a Republican from Ripley, would create a special fund for MDA to administer nuclear site development grants, including reimbursement for some expenses. – Katherine Lin
Antisemitism bill would exempt reporting from DEI ban
Mississippi captured international attention last week after a 19-year-old Madison man allegedly set fire to the state’s largest synagogue, allegedly for its “Jewish ties.”
In the Legislature, Rep. Lee Yancey, a Republican from Brandon, has introduced a bill to combat what he says is a “historic rise in antisemitic violence, harassment and discrimination targeting Jewish students” at K-12 schools and in the higher education system.
The bill would require public schools to prohibit and report antisemitic discrimination and use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance working definition of antisemitism, which has been adopted by several other state legislatures. Notably, the bill exempts all its provisions of a law the Legislature passed last year to ban DEI statements. This could mean that public school might be required to implement measures that might otherwise be considered DEI-related. – Michael Goldberg
Senate considering pieces of House ed plan
Senate leaders have started filing education bills that mirror portions of the massive education package the House passed Thursday. 
This includes a bill that would allow homeschooled children to play public school sports and another that would establish a math program modeled after the 2013 literacy act. It’s a sign that the Senate is going to kill the House bill — after they pick the sections that they like.
Another education issue showing up in both chambers: cellphone bans. Both the House and the Senate have filed multiple bills that restrict or prohibit the usage of cellphones in school.
Youth mental health concerns have resulted in similar bans in at least 11 other states. A bill that would have required Mississippi school boards to create cell phone policies died last year, but several Mississippi school districts have since passed their own policies, including Jackson Public Schools and Madison County. – Devna Bose
More money for career coaching proposed
Rep. Donnie Bell, a Republican from Fulton, has proposed a bill to provide $20 million to expand a career coaching program for middle- and high-school students. 
The career coaching program under Accelerate Mississippi, the state’s office of workforce development, helps students figure out their post graduation paths. 
In a Senate Appropriations Committee meeting last week week, Courtney Taylor, director of Accelerate Mississippi, said there are currently 204 career coaches that serve 209 schools. The office has identified healthcare, advanced manufacturing and construction as priority career fields. – Katherine Lin
Sales tax exemption for farmers considered
Farmers are being squeezed from both sides with high input costs and low crop prices. 
While there are larger economic forces at play, a bill authored by Sen. Neil Whaley, a Republican from Potts Camp and chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, would exempt commercial farmers from the 1.5% state sales tax on some agricultural and logging equipment. Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann has also championed this exemption. – Katherine Lin
Stand-alone tourism department considered again
A bill to create a Department of Tourism has once again passed the Senate. 
A bill authored by Sen. Lydia Chassaniol, a Republican from Winona and chair of the Tourism Committee, would remove tourism from the purview of the Mississippi Development Authority.
Last year, a similar bill was vetoed by Gov. Tate Reeves over funding issues, and the issue has been debated for years. In 2024, tourism contributed over $18 billion to the state’s economy and provided 136,094 jobs. – Katherine Lin
Bill would create Bobby Gentry Day
Rep. Sam Creekmore IV, a Republican from New Albany, has filed legislation to designate June 3 as Bobby Gentry Day in Mississippi — a nod to the date that Gentry once described in a song as “another sleepy, dusty Delta day.”The bill would honor Gentry, born Roberta Lee Streeter, a singer-songwriter from Woodland in northeastern Mississippi’s Chickasaw County.Gentry rose to national prominence in 1967 with her hit “Ode to Billie Joe,” a haunting song in which an unnamed narrator learns that Billie Joe McAllister has died after jumping from the Tallahatchie Bridge.Gentry has not made public appearances for decades and has largely avoided speaking with fans or the media, including in her home state. – Taylor Vance
Workers’ Compensation exemption proposed
A new exception to the workers’ compensation law would allow employers to not pay workers’ compensation for death or injury when an employee deliberately breaks a safety regulation.
The measure, authored by Rep. Donnie Bell, a Republican from Fulton, places the onus on the employer to prove that they had clearly communicated safety rules to the employee. – Katherine Lin
By the Numbers
$162 million
Estimated first-year cost of the House’s omnibus public education bill, including providing tax dollars for parents to use for private schooling or homeschooling.

Hammer, of Minot, said Republican incumbent Rep. Julie Fedorchak hasn’t delivered on campaign promises of addressing affordable housing and health care costs. He also said Fedorchak and Republicans in Congress have failed to provide a check on President Donald Trump’s power on tariffs and his perceived war powers.
“There’s a lot of disappointment going on in North Dakota,” Hammer said in an interview Monday with Joel Heitkamp on KFGO.
In 2024, Hammer received 30% of the statewide vote while Fedorchak received 70%.

Hammer said while affordability issues are not being addressed in Washington, actions in Venezuela and discussions on acquiring Greenland are instead taking center stage.
“We have wrecked ag markets,” Hammer said. “There’s a lot of consternation out there, and a lot of people aren’t getting what they voted for.”
One of the only ways to fix those problems is for Congress to take back its power, he said.
“By being so silent, by never being out there to criticize what the administration does, our delegation actually fails to help Trump be a better president,” Hammer said.
Hammer has diverse work and military experience, which included the Naval Academy where he became a Marine helicopter pilot, and a deployment to Iraq in 2003 as a platoon commander. Hammer also worked in the Bakken oil field and as a science teacher in Granville.
He also worked as a train conductor in Minot before taking leave to make his congressional run.
Hammer had unsuccessful runs for the North Dakota Public Service Commission in 2022 and the North Dakota Legislature in 2020.
Fedorchak previously announced plans to seek reelection. Trump endorsed Fedorchak’s reelection bid in a social media post last summer.

(Photo courtesy of Luann Dart/GS Publishing)The fate of a rural hospital, over 100 jobs and health care in southwest North Dakota communities might hinge on a bill lawmakers will consider this week.
The Jacobson Memorial Hospital Care Center in Elgin, North Dakota, could be forced to close its doors and the area’s only ambulance service if it doesn’t obtain immediate financial assistance, Chief Operating Officer Kristin Heid said. 
“We are in serious financial trouble,” said Heid, who has been serving as the hospital’s administrator since November. “We’re kind of payroll to payroll right now, just hoping that enough revenue comes in to make the next payroll.”

North Dakota Monitor special session coverage

Sen. Donald Schaible, R-Mott, has drafted a bill that would give the health care facility an out. He’s proposing legislation creating an emergency low-interest loan program for nonprofit hospitals and asking legislative leaders to allow the bill to be heard during this week’s special session.
Sen. Donald Schaible, R-Mott. (Photo provided by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly)
“This is a special caveat for somebody in dire trouble,” Schaible said. Without help, “They would fold. It’d be a very massive effect on the community. They’re the largest employer by far.”
The $10 million loan program would be administered by the state-owned Bank of North Dakota under an existing program that awards low-interest loans to support medical facility construction projects. The potential loan amount for any hospital would be capped at $5 million and would require the hospital to demonstrate a business plan to return to solvency. 
“It can’t be a gift,” Schaible said. “They have to have a decent business plan. They have to go through criteria that makes them prove that they’re sustainable and have a future going forward.”
The closure of the critical access hospital would force local residents to travel more than an hour to the nearest facilities in Dickinson, Hettinger or Bismarck. The closure would include health care clinics in Elgin, Richardton and Glen Ullin. The hospital also hosts 21 patients in long-term swing beds, akin to a long-term care facility, who would have to be transferred to nursing homes elsewhere if operations cease, according to the chief operating officer.
The community would also lose the ambulance the hospital leases, staffs and operates, Heid said. 
“We are in a health care desert,” Heid said. “The nearest ambulance would be 30 miles away.”
Assistance is not guaranteed. Legislative Management must agree to allow the bill to be introduced during the special session. Then the Legislature must hold a hearing and vote on the bill. If approved, eligible hospitals like Elgin’s would then have to apply for a loan through the Bank of North Dakota and provide documentation of the need and ability to repay the loan. 
The hospital’s financial crisis has been growing for years. Internal Revenue Service filings show the nonprofit reported deficits of $822,000 in 2022 and $1.5 million in 2023. Audit findings from 2023 identified “material weaknesses” in the hospital’s internal checks and balances necessary to detect and correct any errors in financial records. The weaknesses were attributed in part to the small size of the staff. 
Heid said the hospital is $3.8 million in debt, but the board was not alerted to the dire financial situation until August or September of last year. The CEO’s employment was terminated in November and the position will not be filled, said Heid, who now serves as the hospital’s lead administrator. 
The board has since initiated several internal reforms to get the hospital’s finances back on track. 
North Dakota lawmakers poised to act next week on federal rural health spending

The hospital is still operating on a thin margin despite those reforms, and used a line of credit from a local bank to make payroll around the holidays, Heid said. A low-interest loan from the state is key to keeping the hospital open, she said. 
“I’m not sure if we can continue forward without that money,” Heid said. “Our facility is just very important to the community and our service area. We hope that we can continue to be there to serve our community in the future.”
The hospital plans to host a community meeting in February to share information about the financial situation, a new strategic plan and how the Rural Health Transformation Program funding from the federal government could help the area. 
Tim Blasl, president of the North Dakota Hospital Association, supports the bill and said he believes it will serve as a good solution to help Jacobson Memorial Hospital Care Center return to safe operating margins. 
“It’s structured very well,” Blasl said. “They have to pay these dollars back. So it’s not like a handout or a grant.”
He said some rural hospitals in North Dakota are financially struggling, but they are not in the same degree of trouble Jacobson Memorial Hospital Care Center is. 
Schaible said if the program is successful in helping Elgin or other community hospitals, it could serve as a pilot program that could be expanded in the future.

(Brett Bowers via Getty Images)In recent weeks, the U.S. government punched a hole in Venezuela’s national defense and kidnapped its president, pirated an oil tanker and continued to threaten Greenland in a move that could destroy NATO, the only organization standing between an aggressive Russia and the European Union. 
This recent spate of colonialist jingoism feels like a wall in a byzantine maze crumbling and connecting a different but similar past to a present that follows tragic behavioral patterns. Recent events may feel different, but they carry echoes from generations past. 
Nearly 60 years ago, in a sermon entitled “The Drum-Major Instinct,” the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached on the mentality at the center of such violent international escapades. As he said in the sermon: “The parallels are frightening.” 
This instinct we all share — a desire for recognition, distinction and greatness — gets perverted in a most sinister way in the quest for international dominance. What troubled the world then, King said, stemmed from nations engaging in “a bitter, colossal contest for supremacy.”
He did not spare the United States in his critique.
“This is where we are drifting, and we are drifting there because nations are caught up with the drum-major instinct: I must be first, I must be supreme, our nation must rule the world. And I am sad to say that the nation in which we live is the supreme culprit,” he said. 
He continued: “And I’m going to continue to say it to America, because I love this country too much to see the drift that it has taken. God didn’t call America to do what she’s doing in the world now. God didn’t call America to engage in a senseless, unjust war as the war in Vietnam. And we are criminals in that war. We have committed more war crimes almost than any nation in the world, and I’m going to continue to say it. And we won’t stop it because of our pride and our arrogance as a nation.”
But King encouraged listeners to hold onto the desire for greatness, saying that “it’s a good instinct if you use it right.”
He continued: “Keep feeling the need for being important. Keep feeling the need for being first. But I want you to be first in love. I want you to be first in moral excellence. I want you to be first in generosity.”
His advice still rings true but has gone widely unheeded.
World events can feel linear, particularly to the historically uninitiated absorbing current events without context. Every development feeling like some fresh new outrage.
America’s colonial past spans continents and centuries. Current threats to Venezuela and to Greenland seem fresh. But the history and wisdom used to explain it can take on a circular shape or even an figure eight balanced on its side, a reflection of timeless complexity and timeless continuity.
I once had a younger — but in some ways wiser — boss who introduced me to a Lucile Clifton poem about the Mississippi River emptying into the Gulf and the Gulf entering the sea, “all of them carrying yesterday forever on their white-tipped backs, all of them dragging forward tomorrow.”
The past is always flowing Clifton said, and every water “is the same water coming round.” 
But as remains true today, “someone is standing on the edge of this river, staring into time, whispering mistakenly: only here. Only now.” 
Whispering “only here, only now” under current circumstances registers as a lack of alarm. It’s devoting more attention to symptoms rather than to core issues, issues that really should transcend conservative or progressive labels. 
President Trump has said his own morality “is the only thing that can stop me. … I don’t need international law.” He’s suggested that Renee Good’s “disrespectful” attitude justified her fatal shooting at the hands of an ICE officer. 
Insipid “news” reporting focused on the Seal Team’s precision in capturing the Venezuelan leader, rather than on what the shattering of norms means in a world where frayed cables sustain a fragile balance of power.  
They may as well have asked, “Where did Maduro and his wife have the couch?” at the time of the overnight raid. 
Not enough people evaluate events transpiring around us with the requisite alarm. As King said, the parallels to the past are frightening.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-19 15:28:19+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: CT towns weigh speed camera benefits with privacy concerns,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/19/podcast-ct-speed-cameras/,WSHU's Ebong Udoma and CT Mirror's Emilia Otte discuss her article about the increased prevalence of speed cameras in Connecticut towns.,"As Connecticut municipalities look for ways to promote safe driving, some are turning to speed cameras. However, some advocacy groups have privacy concerns.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Emilia Otte to discuss her article, “As CT speed cameras bring in millions and more towns sign up, concerns linger,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Emilia’s story here.
WSHU: Hello Emilia. Last July, Middletown, Connecticut became one of the first towns in the state to install speed cameras at some strategic locations. It raked in about $1.8 million in fines in six months. Is that what prompted you to do a deep dive into this?
EO: Yes, it was. I pass that speed camera on Route 66 on a regular basis, and slow down on my way.
WSHU: So basically, could you just tell us how the speed camera works?
EO: Essentially, towns have requested to place them in certain strategic locations where people tend to speed, and the cameras will capture when someone goes over 10 miles per hour, over the speed limit, or if they run a red light. And once the cameras have done that, a citation will go out to the person whose car has run the light or sped and then there’s a process for contesting that citation if the person feels they were unfairly given it, or they can simply pay the fine.
WSHU: Yes, for instance, in the situation with Middletown, it was $1.8 million collected, but they charged $2.8 million and this was just in six months.
EO: Yes, it’s true. It does take a little bit of time. There’s a delay between how long it takes to actually collect the fines versus when the citations go out.
WSHU: Okay, now you say that other towns are now looking into this. Initially, some people, especially the ACLU, expressed significant concern about privacy. How has that worked out now that cameras have been installed in certain towns?
EO: So the concerns about privacy, particularly with the ACLU, a lot of that came out of concerns about a particular company called Flock, which there was some concern about data sharing from license plate readers, which are sometimes in towns used by police departments. And there was some concern about that data being shared with federal law enforcement and then being used, particularly around immigration enforcement. That is different from speed or traffic cameras, but the ACLU is still concerned about the use of speed and traffic cameras just for privacy. I will say that Connecticut’s law is extremely strict regarding how the data from speed and red light cameras can be used. It can only be kept for 30 days. So even if say that the camera captures a crime being committed, that data cannot be used as evidence for that. So Connecticut’s law is very strict about how that can be done.
WSHU: Now you say other towns are now looking into setting up their own speed cameras. Which towns are looking at this? And is there a difference between urban communities and rural communities?
EO: There is a large mix of towns looking into this. 11 have been approved by the state so far, because the state has to approve any plan that a municipality makes. So far, I believe Beacon Falls, Fairfield, Stratford, Milford, Greenwich and New Haven have been just approved. Stamford was just approved. So it’s a real mix of small and large towns, and Hartford is still waiting on approval. But towns all over the state are looking into this. Many of them want the traffic cameras in areas around schools.
WSHU: Okay. And there’s also a situation here where you talk to some people in Litchfield County and how it’s working out over there. Could you just give us a little bit of what’s going on there? And they’re not bringing in as much money, but they feel very happy with the way it’s worked out, right?
EO: Yes, the first town to install traffic cameras was a little town called Washington in Litchfield County. They have three cameras. They brought in, you know, $662,000 they issued in fines. That’s pretty good for it’s a small town, but what is really key, they’re saying, is that people are actually slowing down, which was the only thing the first selectman told me that actually worked to get people to slow down.
WSHU: And a large city that’s looking at this right now is Bridgeport, but there’s still some hesitancy, right?
EO: So Bridgeport is in its very, very early stages. I went to a meeting of their public safety committee, where they were really just starting to discuss what would happen if we put some cameras in. And yes, there’s some concern in Bridgeport about, is this the place we want to put our money? Should we be investing in more policing rather than this? There are so many things we need. Why should we be doing this? And I think also in Bridgeport, there has been some concern, because they recently installed traffic cameras on school buses to monitor when cars do not stop for school buses. There’s also been a big controversy over the use of drones to alert emergency responders. So I think in Bridgeport, there’s a bigger context around the use of technology in general and whether or not that’s a good thing and whether or not it really works.
WSHU: But overall, it seems as if we’re going to have a lot more speed cameras in a lot more communities going forward.
EO: Indeed.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0115_SR_SpeedCamera_071-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 10:59:58.630679

(Photo via Google Earth) The Iowa Board of Pharmacy has sanctioned a pharmacist for dispensing drugs without a prescription, and lifted restrictions on a physician convicted of felony narcotics distribution.
The board alleges pharmacist Joshua Davis of Corydon self-reported dispensing a variety of prescription medications to a friend without any legitimate prescription from a health care provider. There were about 23 fraudulent prescriptions dispensed by Davis “over a period of a few years,” the board alleges — although the board has not disclosed when that was or where Davis was working.
The board also alleges that in pharmacy records that Davis altered the name and birthdate of his friend to conceal the fraudulent nature of the drug dispensing.
The board charged Davis with knowingly making misleading, deceptive or fraudulent representations in the practice of pharmacy or engaging in unethical conduct that is harmful or detrimental to the public; diverting prescription drugs from a pharmacy for personal use or distribution; forging or altering a prescription; and practicing outside the scope of his profession.
To resolve the case, Davis and the board agreed to a settlement that calls for his license to be placed on probationary status for two years, during which time he will be subject to some form of worksite monitoring. Davis also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and complete 10 hours of education on law or ethics.
State and federal records indicate that for the past several years, Davis has worked at Your Neighborhood Pharmacy, an affiliate of Wayne County Hospital, in Corydon.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Davis for comment Friday.
Other pharmacy board actions
Other Iowa health professionals whose disciplinary cases recently came before the Board of Pharmacy include:
— Dr. Troy Adolfson, 55, of Ankeny, a physician who sought reinstatement of his Controlled Substances Act registration allowing him to prescribe narcotics.
In 2019, Adolfson surrendered his South Dakota medical license, as well as his Drug Enforcement Administration license, after being criminally charged with felony narcotics distribution.
In that case, Adolfson admitted that between January 2017 and April 2017, he knowingly and intentionally distributed oxycodone by writing prescriptions for 60 to 140 pills to a co-worker and two other people, who then had the prescriptions filled at a pharmacy. Adolfson said the three individuals gave him the oxycodone in exchange for $50 each and a portion of the pills. “I estimate I prescribed approximately 1,400 pills of oxycodone in this manner,” Adolfson told the court.
Adolfson was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison and ordered to pay a $20,000, according to the court records. More than two years after Adolfson admitted his conduct, the Iowa Board of Medicine issued Adolfson a warning and placed his medical license on probation for five years, during which time he was barred from prescribing, administering or dispensing controlled substances for the treatment of chronic pain.
In 2024, Adolfson entered into a voluntary restriction of his CSA registration. In 2025, the Iowa Board of Medicine lifted its restrictions on Adolfson’s medical license, after which Adolfson sought reinstatement of his CSA registration without restriction.
After Adolfson provided the Board of Pharmacy with a letter explaining his past conduct and rehabilitation, the board concluded he had provided sufficient evidence of rehabilitation to warrant reinstatement of the registration. Adolfson, the board said, had “demonstrated he is committed to maintaining his sobriety and is passionate about continuing in his profession as a physician.”
The reinstatement requires Adolfson to participate in the Iowa Professional Health Program or, if he is deemed ineligible, he must submit to board monitoring for three years.
The board records make no mention of the fact that in February 2025, Adolfson was arrested and charged with drunken driving. Police alleged he was driving through a Costco parking lot when he collided with another vehicle. The other party to the accident summoned police, citing concerns that Adolfson appeared to be drunk.
Police alleged Adolfson admitted to drinking and had a blood-alcohol level of .270 — more than three times the legal limit for driving. He later pleaded guilty to first-offense drunken driving and sentenced to one year of probation. He was discharged from probation after six months, court records show.
— Alexander Goodwin, 32, of Camanche, who recently agreed to surrender his pharmacist’s license to the board. The board alleges Goodwin admitted stealing “two Adderall tablets” from a Walgreen’s store in Clinton where he was employed, as well as an unspecified amount of other drugs from the Clinton store and a Walgreen’s store in Dubuque.
The board charged Goodwin with knowingly making misleading, deceptive or fraudulent representations in the practice of pharmacy or engaging in unethical conduct that is harmful or detrimental to the public; diverting prescription drugs from a pharmacy for personal use or distribution; and habitual intoxication or addiction to the use of drugs.
As part of the recent settlement in which Goodwin agreed to surrender his pharmacist’s license, he also agreed he will not be eligible to seek reinstatement for at least one year.
Court records show that in June 2025, Goodwin was criminally charged with theft and prohibited acts for the alleged misappropriation of drugs from the Clinton store. Police alleged that an internal audit identified 60 missing oxycodone pills from the pharmacy’s inventory.
According to police, surveillance footage from the store indicated that on one occasion, Goodwin stole, and then swallowed, an oxycodone pill while on duty at the store, and that an inventory showed losses at the store involving 80 different types of medications.
Police also alleged Goodwin admitted that he had been previously caught on video attempting to steal medications while working at the Hartig Drug store in Savanna, Illinois.
The Iowa criminal charges were later dismissed when Clinton County prosecutors said they couldn’t locate the general manager of the Walgreen’s store to testify.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Your-Neighborhood-Pharmacy.jpg,,,2026-01-19 10:59:58.630679

(Staff and submitted photos)TOPEKA — Four candidates for Kansas governor loaned their campaigns at least $1 million to bolster the bottom line on year-end finance reports and support claims of political momentum eight months from the August primary election.
Former Gov. Jeff Colyer started his campaign with a $50,000 loan in May and followed with three loans in December to push his personal commitment to $1.05 million at the end of the reporting period Dec. 31. He raised an equivalent amount from donors, his report said, and had $1.8 million in cash after expenses.
“Matching that support personally shows I’m fully committed to winning this race and delivering results for Kansas again,” said Colyer, who was governor from 2018 to 2019 after resignation of Gov. Sam Brownback.
Businessman Philip Sarnecki, with no previous experience in electoral politics, personally loaned his campaign a jaw-dropping $2 million. That left $2.3 million in his account — the largest cash-on-hand total of any 2026 candidate for governor.
“Our campaign has raised the most money in Kansas gubernatorial history and we did it in far less time than every other Republican candidate in the field,” Sarnecki said. “There’s an incredible energy around our campaign. Kansans are tired of losing and they’re tired of career politicians.”
Scott Schwab, the Kansas secretary of state, loaned his campaign $1.045 million. Overall, Schwab raised $1.4 million, spent $365,000 and held $1.05 million cash-in-hand.
The million-dollar club included Joy Eakins, a former Wichita school board member who loaned herself an even $1 million. She raised $1.1 million overall and spent $116,000. Eakins said the United States was on the cusp of a “golden age” under President Donald Trump, but Kansas could miss out on that good fortune if it failed to elect a conservative governor.

Other borrowers
Former Johnson County Commission member Charlotte O’Hara approved a personal loan of $485,000 to her campaign. At year’s end, she had $510,000 in her gubernatorial account.
State Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt, a former Topeka state senator, loaned herself $81,500 and closed the year with $928,000 in cash. She said she was grateful for “confidence Kansans are placing in this campaign — and we’re just getting started.”
Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson of Andover didn’t make a loan to his campaign in 2025. He ended the year with $687,o00 in his account, which was less than five of his GOP competitors.
Masterson said nearly all of his donations arrived in the final three months of 2025 after he overhauled his campaign staff by dropping Axiom Strategies and hiring consultants more closely aligned with Trump. He said his nonprofit organization Take Back Kansas, which didn’t have to identify donors, entered 2026 with $700,000 in its account.
“We’re building a movement of everyday Kansans who are fed up with being taxed to death and watching their state fall behind,” Masterson said.
In the Democratic Party’s race for the gubernatorial nomination, neither Sen. Ethan Corson nor Sen. Cindy Holscher, both of Johnson County, made loans to their campaigns. Holscher raised $397,000 and had $179,000 at end of the year. Corson reported contributions of $902,000 during 2025, but had $526,000 in cash on Dec. 31.
“That’s one of the largest hauls for any non-incumbent Democrat running for governor in Kansas history,” Corson said in a fundraising appeal. “That’s why I am the only candidate in this race who has what it takes to go toe-to-toe with extremist Republicans and their large fundraising hauls.”

Attorney general contest
In the campaign for attorney general, incumbent Republican Kris Kobach of Lecompton began 2025 with $217,000 in his campaign account. He added $337,000, spent $52,000 and reported cash of $502,600 at the close of 2025. He said the previous high in terms of cash-on-hand at this juncture of a Kansas campaign for attorney general was $501,300 by Democratic Attorney General Steve Six in 2009.
Kobach said he didn’t make a personal loan to his campaign in 2025. He formally filed for reelection on Jan. 8.
“From day one, my focus has been on protecting Kansas families, upholding the rule of law and fighting for our Kansas values,” Kobach said.
Kobach’s likely Democratic opponent in the November election, Chris Mann of Lawrence, submitted a report showing he raised $536,000 last year. He spent more than half of the total and retained $257,000 in cash. In 2022, Mann lost the attorney general’s race to Kobach by less that 2 percentage points.
“Kansas families are anxious, frustrated and fed up. They deserve real change. Instead, they get Kris Kobach, an attorney general more focused on pushing his personal agenda than on helping the people of Kansas,” Mann said.
Three candidates for Kansas secretary of state — Schwab chose to seek the GOP nomination for governor — made loans to their campaigns. Rep. Pat Proctor, R-Leavenworth, loaned himself $134,000 to bring his campaign receipts to $312,000. By the end of 2025, he’d spent $102,000 on the race.
“This record-setting support is not about numbers on a spreadsheet,” Proctor said. “It  reflects a growing movement of conservatives who want secure elections, accountable government and leaders who put Kansas first.”
His primary opponent, Rep. Ken Rahjes, R-Agra, said he received $24,000 in contributions, including an $8,000 personal loan.
Democratic candidate Jennifer Day, a former Kansas House member from Overland Park, said she raised $84,000 from more than 700 donors. In addition, she loaned herself $43,000. During the period, she spent $69,000.
Day said the stakes were high in the election because Kansas Republicans were engaged in “backroom meetings to eliminate early voting and weaken longstanding mail ballot protections.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/millionairesGOP-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-19 10:59:58.630679

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
HERNANDO — Some DeSoto County School Board members want a legal process by which an elected peer — another school board member — can be ousted for concerns including malfeasance and abuse of power. They passed a resolution in November formally asking lawmakers to consider granting that authority in the current legislative session.
A new law “would give school boards more authority when situations arise that cause concern in the community,” school board President Jerald Wheeler said in a statement to Mississippi Today.
For now, there is no legal mechanism for a school board to remove one of its members, said Jim Keith, attorney for the DeSoto County School Board.
The board members may get their wish to change that, at least in terms of a bill.
Sen. Kevin Blackwell, a Republican from Southaven, has filed Senate Bill 2068, which would allow a school district’s local governing authority, by majority vote, to remove a school board member for breach of public trust, neglect of duty and abuse of authority. The school board would first have to vote on a recommendation. Rep. Kimberly Remak, a Republican from Olive Branch, is the primary author of House Bill 573, the House version of Blackwell’s bill. The bill now has multiple coauthors and bipartisan support. Remak did not respond to requests for comment.
On Dec. 30, Sen. Michael McLendon, a Republican from Hernando, announced on Facebook plans to introduce the Whiteside Accountability Act, a separate bill that, if passed into law, would provide “a statutory recall process for school board members who engage in conduct that undermines student safety, including actions that defend or minimize sexual crimes against minors.” The bill would give the power to school board members to remove other board members. 
McLendon introduced the Education Leadership Accountability Act on Jan. 14.
DeSoto County School Board members’ interest in ousting another elected board member stems from public calls for Michele Henley to resign after she wrote a letter and testified on behalf of Lindsey Whiteside, a former volunteer assistant girls’ basketball coach at DeSoto Central High School who had already pleaded guilty to sexual battery of a minor. At least nine other district employees wrote letters of support for Whiteside.
On Oct. 13, a judge sentenced Whiteside to three years of house arrest and seven years of probation — a much lighter sentence than the 30 years that prosecutors sought. The sentence divided the tranquil Memphis suburbs in Mississippi, where Whiteside was also a youth pastor.
Whiteside pleaded guilty earlier that day to committing sexual battery against a minor who attended her church. Some people, disturbed by Henley’s testimony and that some school district staff also wrote letters vouching for Whiteside’s character, began calling for Henley’s removal from the school board. They took to social media and spoke out at school board meetings. 
“Disappointment, outrage, neglect of power” are a few reactions McLendon has heard from constituents since the conclusion of the Whiteside trial.
“It’s one thing to write a letter on the character of a person that you know, but writing the letter on official letterhead and using your elected title carries weight as an authoritative figure,” McLendon said of Henley.
Henley did not respond to multiple requests for comment by Mississippi Today.

In a statement posted to Facebook on Oct. 15, Henley said the letter she wrote did not express support for Whiteside’s actions “or endorse her behavior.” The letter, shared in the post, describes Whiteside coaching and supporting Henley’s daughter in basketball.
As for her testimony, Henley wrote, “Contrary to what has been claimed, I did not testify for the defense. I was subpoenaed by the District Attorney to appear in court. While on the stand, I was asked whether I condoned Lindsey’s actions. My response was no. When asked about what her sentence should be, I stated that such a decision was for the judge to determine.”
‘A mechanism is necessary’
A half-dozen DeSoto County residents told Mississippi Today they believe Henley abused their trust when she wrote a letter of support on Whiteside’s behalf. The victim’s family said they felt Henley exercised poor judgment in supporting Whiteside over a district student.
The family members also said they felt Henley’s actions should be grounds for removal from the school board. After making a statement condemning Henley’s actions, the school board passed a resolution formally asking the legislature for legal recourse to grant them the power to oust one of their members, due in part to public outcry.
“The Board of Trustees of the DeSoto County School District firmly believes that a mechanism is necessary for the removal of school board members … to ensure a safe and supportive learning environment for students,” read the Nov. 20 resolution by the DeSoto County School Board.

Every board member save Henley, who abstained, voted in support of the recent motion.
Katie Sasso, the mother of a DeSoto County School District student, said Henley’s departure would allow for the community to heal. Aubrie Johnson, a concerned community member, said, “It was shocking to see (someone) support a real-life predator.”
DeSoto County District Attorney Matthew Barton wrote Henley in October that “when an elected official chooses to protect the abuser rather than the abused, she ceases to serve the public good.” Barton said he called for Henley’s resignation so integrity and confidence could be restored to the school board.
On Nov. 6, at Henley’s first school board meeting appearance since the hearing, two members of the victim’s family called for her resignation. Pam Pegram, the victim’s grandmother, asked that Henley look at her during their exchange, pausing for Henley’s response. Pegram was met with nearly two minutes of silence. 
“You heard the brave young girl read her victim statement and tell everyone in that courtroom about the vile and evil things that the predator had done. You heard the despair in the victim’s mother’s letter. You heard the frustration and the anger from the victim’s stepdad,” Pegram said. “You could have any time said, ‘I’m so sorry. I can no longer support this.’ But you cowardly refused to stand up for a child that attended school in your district.”
At that meeting, the school board voted to replace Henley as its president. Henley remains a board member. 
In conversation with the public
DeSoto County Parents for Accountability, a parent group that found a broad audience on Facebook, is also pushing for Henley’s resignation.
The effort included organizing a protest of the school board on Oct. 17. The group has also criticized the school board, saying it meets at times when parents can’t attend.
The parents’ rights group helped organize a boycott of the school district the week after the Whiteside verdict. They protested what they called a lack of transparency and response by district leadership.

Nancy Kemper, grandmother of a DeSoto County student, said during the public comments section of the meeting that she was unable to attend past meetings because they were scheduled during school pickup time. She said she felt the meeting schedule gave Henley the opportunity to dodge accountability.
“I know a lot of people that wanted to come here today and they feel like it was really convenient — especially for (Henley) — that they couldn’t come and speak because they are in line picking up their children.”
Seeking a legislative response
The bills introduced this legislative session aren’t the first attempts to extend school boards’ authority, including their power to remove other school board members.
In November, the DeSoto County School Board voted to support HB 817, which Remak introduced during the 2025 legislative session. HB 817 would have allowed school board members, by a majority vote and through the local governing agency, to remove a colleague for “malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance,” breach of public trust and abuse of authority.
The DeSoto board’s vote was symbolic; the bill had died in committee.
Another bill filed this session, authored by Kabir Karriem, a Democrat from Columbus, would also allow for the removal of a school board member for misconduct and “breach of public trust.” House Bill 521 would also limit a school board’s power to request a hike in property tax.
Karriem said he hoped to prevent school boards from triggering “irresponsible” property tax increases or other rash actions. He was inspired to reintroduce his bill from the 2025 legislative session because of his constituents’ concerns in Columbus.
“When you have school board members that feel like they have complete autonomy that creates problems for the community,” Karriem said. “And there always needs to be checks and balances.”
“There needs to be the opportunity to remove bad actors.”
If one of the bills to let school boards oust another board member becomes law, Mississippi will be one of the first state to grant that power. New York allows school board members to vote out their peers for “official misconduct.” Indiana allows removal by a circuit judge, while Virginia and Alabama give that right to governors. Illinois grants the power to a regional superintendent. In 24 states, excluding Mississippi, an elected school board member can be removed by a recall vote.
There is a lot of support for the bills before the Legislature this session, McLendon said. “It’s a nonpartisan bill that holds everyone accountable for their actions when it comes to protecting children.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10112358/3X0A2787.jpg,,,2026-01-19 10:59:58.630679

The headlines are making clear, big and important debates and actions – especially several controversial actions of the Trump administration and its allies — have continued to roil American policy and politics in the New Year. From the health care wars to the widespread immigration crackdowns to a bevy of contentious foreign policy moves, Americans are concerned about the present and future and, in many instances, deeply divided.
It’s the kind of moment that keeps political scientists and pollsters busy as they work to assess the state of public opinion and how it’s likely to impact voting patterns and upcoming elections, and one especially trustworthy monitor of the situation in North Carolina is Meredith College political science professor and pollster David McLennan. And recently, we caught up with McLennan for an extended interview in which we dug into several of these matters.
In Part One of our recent extended conversation with Meredith College political scientist and pollster David McLennan, we examined some of the top issues making political and policy news in the New Year and how they relate to the latest developments we’re seeing in American public opinion and voter registration numbers.
In Part Two of our chat, we continued this conversation, and looked more closely at some of the most controversial issues – including the Trump administration’s national crackdown on immigrants and its controversial foreign policy actions and statements — as well as how these controversies might impact the 2026 elections and, in particular, North Carolina’s highly anticipated U.S. Senate race between former Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican challenger Michael Whatley.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DavidMcLennan_calendar.jpg,,,2026-01-19 10:59:58.630679

(Photo by Lisa Hupp/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Two dog-walking Soldotna residents are fighting a pair of unusual federal fines after getting in an argument with a fur trapper in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge last year.
Laura McIndoe and Trafford Evanoff appeared in federal court Tuesday this week to enter “not guilty” pleas and formally challenge $280 per-person tickets issued by a refuge officer for interfering with an authorized trap line. Further hearings are scheduled for later in the spring.
McIndoe did not return a phone call Friday afternoon. 
Conflicts between dog walkers and fur trappers are not unusual in Alaska despite efforts to avoid them, but federal citations are rare, according to a search of online court records. 
The citations facing McIndoe and Evanoff do not identify the trapper, who was not fined. The injured dog also was not named.
According to the citations, the trapper called a Fish and Wildlife Service officer after McIndoe’s dog became caught in one of the trapper’s foothold traps and McIndoe became “very upset and cursed at him, telling him to stay away.”
“He said the woman told him that her sons were in their 30s and big men, and if they see him, they will kill him,” said the affidavit, signed by officer Shay Hurd. 
Two of the trapper’s other traps were destroyed, and the trap that snared the dog was lost. 
According to Hurd’s affidavit, McIndoe said “the dog was doing better” two weeks after the incident, “after a large vet bill.”
The trapper had a permit to work within the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, correctly marked their trap line with a warning sign, and placed the trap line in a valid area more than one mile away from the road, according to Hurd’s account.
McIndoe was cited for “interfering with persons engaged in authorized activities” in the refuge, as was Evanoff, who was identified as her son.

Commemorative services are planned across the state Monday as the nation pauses for a federal holiday in observance of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. MLK Day is a national day of service to encourage all Americans to volunteer and improve their communities.
Bishop William Barber – president of Repairers of the Breach and architect of the Forward Together Moral Movement – will mark the day with a series of speeches encouraging people of all backgrounds to come together and sound the alarm against unjust policies that have led to healthcare cuts, gerrymandered districts, reduced funding for public schools, and increased aggressive actions by ICE agents.
Barber and a coalition of North Carolina religious leaders and advocacy organizations recently announced plans for a memorial march in mid-February to speak out against regressive policies while highlighting what they believe is a better path forward for the nation. NC Newsline sat down with Bishop Barber to discuss the upcoming march and his thoughts as we mark the 2026 MLK Day.

(Photo courtesy of Sam Stukel/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Emails obtained by clean-water advocates show the state of South Dakota declined $290,000 of federal funding for zebra mussel decontamination stations at Pactola Reservoir, which the advocates say is evidence that the state isn’t taking the invasive threat seriously enough.
The state agency tasked with fighting aquatic invasive species said it declined the money because it was only for equipment, without additional ongoing funding needed for the equipment’s operation and maintenance. The agency defended its approach to zebra mussels, saying it’s focused on the most practical steps it can sustain with available staff, emphasizing boat inspections and education aimed at slowing the spread.
Zebra mussels are tiny invasive shellfish, originally found in Asia and Europe, that spread by clinging to boats. They clog pipes, water intakes and hydroelectric power equipment, cut swimmers’ feet, and change the native aquatic ecosystem.
The number of zebra mussel-infested lakes in South Dakota grew from one in 2014 to 32 now.


State Department of Game, Fish, and Parks Secretary Kevin Robling said while testifying to lawmakers last January that he was unaware of any missed zebra mussel funding opportunities.
“I am not familiar with any money that we reverted back or did not spend or did not use,” Robling said.
South Dakota Lakes and Streams Association board members had heard otherwise. They obtained emails, reviewed by South Dakota Searchlight, that show federal agencies and the state discussed Pactola Reservoir containment options in 2022 and 2023, and that the state ultimately declined U.S. Bureau of Reclamation funding for decontamination equipment at Pactola. The reservoir, a key Black Hills water source and recreation site, was confirmed to have zebra mussels in July 2022.
South Dakota Lakes and Streams Vice President Deb Soholt, a Republican former state senator from Sioux Falls, said the emails reflect a broader lack of urgency on the part of the state.
“We’ve made a policy decision that there’s nothing we can do to stop this, no matter how much money we pour at it,” Soholt said. “That’s a flawed premise. Other states are fighting. We should be, too.”
Game, Fish, and Parks spokesperson Nick Harrington said the agency is doing what it can.
“Our inspection numbers have continued to increase throughout the years,” he said. “If they want to say that between a certain year there was a funding lapse, well, inspections were increasing. The program was operating. The program was funded.”
He said there were 14,556 boat inspections in 2021, 18,582 in 2022, 18,642 in 2023, and 22,165 in 2024. Inspectors ensure boaters have cleaned off any plants, mud and debris, drained live wells or tanks that hold water, and dried everything completely before launching in another waterbody.  
Harrington said Robling did not recall the declined funding when he was asked about it last year during a legislative hearing.
What the emails show
At Pactola Reservoir, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation operates the dam, the U.S. Forest Service manages the surrounding land and recreation sites, and the state Department of Game, Fish, and Parks oversees fishing and boating regulations and invasive species control. 
The emails show the bureau, Forest Service, and Game, Fish and Parks convened multiple meetings in July 2022 to discuss management options “for preventing the spread of zebra mussels from Pactola Reservoir to surrounding waterbodies.”
On July 19, 2022, a state employee summarized the state’s approach to zebra mussels at Pactola.
“After reviewing our current resources and limitations that exist with staff and equipment, it is very evident that there is no way we can implement a comprehensive containment approach on Pactola Reservoir,” wrote GF&P Fisheries Supervisor Jake Davis.
Davis wrote that the state would “focus on outreach and education,” adding that “inspections will still occur.” 
The emails referenced decontamination units, which are hot water, high-pressure sprayers used to clean boats by killing and removing zebra mussels. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Davis said in the emails that there was already a decontamination unit at Pactola.
In February 2023, the bureau drafted Pactola Reservoir zebra mussel containment recommendations. They describe goals to educate the public and contain the spread. They also note that the bureau had secured funding “for two additional decontamination units at Pactola Reservoir.”
On March 7, 2023, the state’s fisheries program administrator informed the bureau that, “after discussion with Senior Administration,” the department did “not desire to enter into an agreement” for the $290,0000 of federal funding to purchase two additional decontamination units at Pactola.
The proposal included another $200,000 for the Forest Service to help pay for the equipment, according to emails obtained by Lakes and Streams. 
“These were one-time funds, and no additional funds were going to be made available for future operation and maintenance of these pieces of equipment,” Harrington said in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight. “As a result, we requested that the funds be used to help cover the costs of labor at current inspection stations, as that is where they could be used to best support” the state’s aquatic invasive species program.
“Unfortunately, due to the way the funds were requested, their purpose could not be altered,” Harrington said.
Game, Fish and Parks spent $4.65 million to combat aquatic invasive species in the state from 2021 to 2024, with $3.7 million coming from outside the department (predominantly from federal agencies).
Harrington said the department focuses its resources on public outreach and inspections.
“Our goal is to slow the spread of these species,” he said. “Our message is clean, drain, dry.”
Harrington said compliance at inspection stations is high. 
“People know the rules, and they’re following them for the most part,” he said. “Ninety-eight percent compliance is better than seat belts — and those save our lives.”
Advocates say ‘not enough’
Soholt said the compliance rate is less when no official is waiting at the shoreline to inspect a boat. She wants lawmakers to convene a public-private working group to develop a new statewide strategy, including options like seeking private donors or adding a small license fee per boat to help fund more zebra mussel containment.
“We could fiercely protect the remaining reservoirs and lakes if we acted now,” she said. “Instead, we’re saying, ‘It’s inevitable.’”
Dan Loveland, also with Lakes and Streams, said watercraft inspections are the most effective tool, and South Dakota’s inspection effort is weak and under-resourced. He said “clean, drain, dry” isn’t enough without enforcement to back it up.
Loveland, too, wants a statewide stakeholder process and a dedicated funding source to fight aquatic invasive species.
“Get all these stakeholders together and go through what is happening to our state, and let’s talk about different ways that we can approach this,” he said. “Let’s find a funding source that we can dedicate to fighting the aquatic invasive species all across South Dakota.”
Robling gave a presentation to lawmakers on Thursday that included information on zebra mussels. He showed lawmakers a time-lapse map of the species’ spread since the late 1980s to underscore that South Dakota is not alone.
Asked about research, Robling said genetic approaches aimed at reducing zebra mussel reproduction are still in early stages and have seen “very little success” so far, though Minnesota remains a research hub.
Rep. Tim Goodwin, R-Rapid City, said he plans to propose a legislative summer study on zebra mussels.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/52136145384_962964e6e4_k-e1768767999912-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-19 09:57:09.650315

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah lawmakers will be returning to Capitol Hill on Tuesday for their 45-day 2026 legislative session — and already the list of issues they plan to tackle is long, with the number of bills filed growing by the day. 
Because the Utah Legislature is controlled by a Republican supermajority, the state’s GOP legislative leaders often set the agenda while Democratic lawmakers try their best to fight against legislative efforts they oppose. 
Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders — Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper — told Utah News Dispatch in wide-ranging interviews last week what bills and issues are top of mind for them for 2026. 
Meanwhile, the state’s Democratic leaders — Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla and House Minority Leader Angela Romero, both Democrats from Salt Lake City — say they’re bracing for a legislative session that’s expected to be tough on many different fronts.
Not only is the state’s more than $30 billion budget expected to be tight due to federal tax cuts — along with pressure from Republican legislative leaders to continue their streak of income tax rate cuts. But also, 2026 is an election year for all 75 seats in the House and 15 in the Senate, likely to add an extra layer of political calculus and gamesmanship.

And already, bills are stacking up that target groups including undocumented immigrants and transgender people that Democrats and community advocates are gearing up to fight. 
It remains to be seen what legislative proposals survive both the House and Senate — but insights from Adams and Schultz help shed light on what they’re more likely to prioritize. 
Utah advocates, faith leaders call on lawmakers to take more action on homelessness

Here are some of their top priorities, along with issues that are expected to be among the most contentious this year: 

 More tax cuts:

	 A sixth year of an income tax rate cut — on top of more than $500 million already slashed in 2026 and 2027 from the state’s budget due to federal tax changes under the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act — and an effort to rein in property taxes. At the same time, legislative leaders have directed all state agencies to propose ways to cut 5% from their budgets as part of a statewide efficiency exercise. 


 Judiciary changes:
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, Schultz and Adams are all supportive of expanding the Utah Supreme Court from five justices to seven. They say it’s to bring Utah in line with other states and help speed up decision-making, but Democrats question the timing of the move and whether it’s in “retaliation” for several court rulings that Republicans have vehemently opposed, especially in the state’s redistricting court battle. Schultz is also supportive of increasing “transparency” on judges. Several other bills have also been filed, including SB57 which would increase the number of judges for the district court, juvenile court, and the Court of Appeals. HB262 would increase the threshold of votes needed for a judge to be retained. Additionally, lawmakers have filed at least three proposed constitutional amendments related to the judiciary. HJR5 would allow the governor to select any qualified candidate to fill a judicial vacancy, even if the candidate isn’t nominated by a nominating commission. And HJR13 would empower the Legislature to initiate a “special” retention election if the Legislature decides “that judge is unfit or incompetent.”

Utah lawmaker wants to cut off resources for undocumented immigrants to get them to ‘self-deport’


 Another attempt to solidify lawmakers’ ability to change ballot initiatives:

	Also tied to the state’s redistricting lawsuit — which traces back to a 2018 ballot initiative for an independent redistricting process known as Proposition 4 — Utah’s Republican leaders are expected to propose another constitutional amendment to ensure the Legislature has the ability to change laws enacted by voters. The language of what that proposed amendment would be, however, is unknown.


 Homelessness:

	Gov. Spencer Cox has proposed lawmakers set aside $25 million in one-time money and $20 million in ongoing funding for “homelessness and criminal justice high utilizers.” At the same time the governor has been supportive of a controversial proposal to build a 1,300-bed homeless campus in northwest Salt Lake City. Adams and Schultz have said they’re open to discussions around homelessness but they didn’t commit to fully funding Cox’s recommendations. Schultz said he wants cities and counties to do more to provide funding while also saying the state wants to remain a partner. 


 Immigration issues:

	Adams and Schultz did not name any specific immigration-related bills they’re supporting as of yet, but some of the most controversial proposals to surface so far ahead of the session look to cut off publicly-funded resources for undocumented immigrants, restrict their ability to legally drive, and criminalize providing housing for people without legal status.

Anti-transgender bill among ‘most harmful and outrageous’ Utah LGBTQ+ advocates have seen


 Anti-transgender legislation:
LGBTQ+ advocates are opposing a list of bills already filed, including one that would strike the word “gender” from Utah code, effectively erasing transgender anti-discrimination provisions for housing, employment and crime victims. That’s among the “most harmful and outrageous” bills advocates with Equality Utah have seen — but that bill may run into issues in the Senate. Adams said he’d be hesitant to make any changes to Utah’s 2015 law that enacted LGBTQ+ protections while balancing religious freedom. However, other bills are in play — including one to make permanent Utah’s indefinite moratorium on prescriptions for puberty blockers and hormone therapy to minors. Schultz said he’s supportive of turning that moratorium into a ban. 


 Elections: 

	Last year, the House and Senate clashed over a sweeping bill that originally would have drastically restricted voting by mail. The Legislature ultimately passed a watered-down version to slowly phase out automatic voting by mail in 2029, but Schultz said he wants to revisit that legislation — including enacting in-person ID requirements. Adams said he’s open to more changes, but he’s supportive of keeping voting by mail while reinstating vote-by-mail signature verification, which would under the current law phase out by 2029. Both Schultz and Adams also said they want to add additional requirements to ensure people without legal immigration status can’t vote (which is already illegal). Democrats question whether that’s needed, since instances of that happening are rare. 

That’s not an exhaustive list. Lawmakers are also expected to continue efforts to focus on issues including energy development, critical minerals, water, housing, artificial intelligence regulations and more. 
Almost half of Utah’s third graders don’t read at grade level, report says

The governor is also pushing a bell-to-bell ban on cellphones in schools, and improvements to the state’s lagging K-3 literacy, including encouraging a policy to hold back third graders unless they pass a reading test to advance to fourth grade. 
Here’s a full list of Senate Republicans’ priorities, and here’s the House GOP’s. Senate Democrats’ priorities, Escamilla said, are aimed at going “back to the basics” by focusing on unmet needs for education, health care, child care, housing and other issues while “defending democracy.” And House Democrats’ priorities, among other issues, promote inclusion and representation, education and environmental protections. 
Another income tax cut — plus an effort to limit property taxes
For a sixth year in a row, the Senate president and House speaker want to cut the state’s income tax rate, currently sitting at 4.5%, as part of an effort they say is to help keep Utah affordable, competitive with other states, and a place where people will want to live, work and do business. 
But the governor notably didn’t include an income tax rate cut in his 2026 budget recommendations, pointing out that Utah already won’t collect about $300 million of corporate and individual income tax in 2026 and $200 million in 2027 due to federal changes to tax policy in Congress’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act . 
That’s on top of the more than $1.4 billion in tax cuts lawmakers have approved over the past five years, much of which has come from income tax reductions. Under the Utah Constitution, income tax is largely required to fund the state’s public education system, which advocates and Democrats have argued continues to go underfunded. Despite significant increases in education funding in recent years, Utah is still among the lowest-ranking states for per-pupil education spending.
Utah Legislature OKs another round of tax cuts, totaling $1.4 billion in 5 years

Meanwhile, lawmakers on the powerful budgetary oversight body, the Executive Appropriations Committee, last month directed budget subcommittees to propose 5% cuts across state agencies as part of a statewide efficiency exercise. 
“You know, will those 5% cuts stick across the board? No. But I think it’s good for everybody to go in and look at their budgets,” Schultz said. 
The Legislature won’t put its finishing touches on the budget until the final days of the session, scheduled to end March 6, so it’s not yet clear what programs will or won’t get funded, but Democrats including Romero and Escamilla are concerned about Republicans prioritizing yet another tax cut while needs for child care, education, deeply affordable housing, homelessness and others continue to go unmet.
“I have major concerns about what’s going to be cut and how that is going to impact our most vulnerable,” Romero said.
In past years, the Executive Appropriations Committee has preemptively set aside a pot of money ahead of the session for a tax cut — but this year it didn’t. House Republicans, however, listed in their priorities $200 million for a tax cut. 
Adams said $200 million is the number needed to reduce the state’s income tax rate from 4.5% to 4.45% — but he acknowledged that whether lawmakers are able to do that depends on how the budgeting process goes. 
Under Trump tax cuts, Utah won’t collect $500 million in income taxes in 2026, 2027

“We’ll be scraping the top of the paint can lids to try to find a way,” Adams said, but he added it’s a “high priority.” 
“We want to do it smart. We want to be responsible. We want to make sure all the state needs are being met. That’s super important,” Schultz said, but he added that reducing “cost of living” is a top priority for House Republicans, and that includes lowering the income tax rate again. 
Escamilla argued Utah can’t keep up its streak of foregoing hundreds of millions of income tax revenue year after year. 
“We’ve been consistent in opposing any income tax cuts. That’s problematic,” Escamilla said. “I mean, I really do not know where they’re going to get the funds from.” 
Additionally, Schultz said he’s supportive of efforts to reign in property taxes at the local level and prevent the tax burden shifting away from commercial properties and on to Utah homeowners. 
He pointed to a proposed constitutional amendment and accompanying bill being sponsored by Rep. Jill Koford, R-Ogden, that would increase the percentage of the fair market value of a home that is exempt from property tax, from 45% to 60%. He said that’s expected to drop people’s property taxes “a couple hundred bucks a year.” 
While state agencies look for 5% cuts, Schultz said he also thinks local governments should go through a similar exercise, so he’s supportive of legislative efforts to limit their ability to enact property tax hikes. Sen. Dan McCay, R-Riverton, also has a bill to limit taxing entities from adopting a budget that exceeds 5% of the previous year’s property tax budgeted revenue, excluding new growth. 
Are Utah homeowners paying more than their fair share of property taxes? What an audit found

Pointing to Salt Lake County’s recent 14.65% property tax hike to address inflation and rising costs, Schultz said “people are losing their minds over that.” 
“If our local governments don’t recognize what’s happening and get their budgets in order instead of just increasing property taxes, they’re going to see more and more of these types of bills,” Schultz said, though he added he’s not sure what bills will pass. “But I’ll tell you, it’s widely popular, and it’s something that we absolutely need to consider.” 
Romero expressed concerns with limiting cities, counties and school districts’ ability to oversee property taxes, both as a matter of encroaching on local control but also how that could impact services and school districts. 
Moe Hickey, executive director of the advocacy group Voices for Utah Children, expressed similar concerns, but especially when thinking about pairing that with income tax reductions. 
“If you’re cutting income tax, which leads to cuts in services, which local communities want to keep, then they have to raise their property tax,” he said. “They don’t operate separately. There’s a relationship there … If you cut the income tax enough, you’re either going to lose services or you’re going to have to increase local tax, plain and simple.” 
Expanding the Utah Supreme Court and other courts
When asked why it’s a priority to expand the Utah Supreme Court from five justices to seven, Adams responded with a question: “When did Proposition 4 pass?”
That was in 2018, more than seven years ago. “Do I need to say any more? We’re in 2026,”  he said, arguing it’s taken far “too long” to litigate the state’s lawsuit over redistricting, which alleged lawmakers overstepped when they repealed and replaced the independent redistricting voter-approved law. 
So far, the courts have agreed, which led to a restoration of Proposition 4 as law, but also a new court-ordered map that included one Democratic-majority district and three heavily Republican districts — a ruling that Republicans including Adams have ardently opposed. 
Saying it’s not court packing, governor supports expanding Utah’s appeals courts  

Adams also said expanding the court may lead to more nuanced decisions. 
“I haven’t seen many split decisions come out of our court,” he said. “And the other side, even if you disagree with it, deserves at least a minority opinion. And I believe having an expanded court probably gives an opportunity to have maybe a little bit of diversity there.” 
The Senate president said also he thinks more justices will help speed up court decisions. That’s even though Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told The Salt Lake Tribune in October that adding more justices could lead to more deliberation, delaying timelines further. 
“I think it will actually help them,” Adams said. “I can’t imagine it’s going to bog it down.” 
Adams also said part of that conversation will include increasing funding for the Utah Supreme Court, as well as more money to expand the appellate courts, which he noted has been a “high priority” for the judiciary. 
Schultz is also supportive of expanding the courts, but he said he also wants to increase “transparency” on judges so it’s easier for Utahns to look up their rulings. 
“We want them to have the same type of transparency to the public that we as legislators have,” he said. “When we look at retention elections, the No. 1 thing I hear from constituents is ‘We have no idea who these judges are … we can’t find any information.”

Escamilla said she’s concerned about expanding the Utah Supreme Court in a time when Republican lawmakers have clashed with the courts on their redistricting rulings. 
“It’s an issue of timing. It feels like retaliation,” Escamilla said, adding that her constituents have said “they don’t want to see retaliation against the judiciary as they’re exercising their responsibilities and checks and balances of our government.”
Lawmakers’ power over ballot initiatives
While vowing to appeal Utah’s new court-ordered congressional map to the Utah Supreme Court, Adams and Schultz in November also said lawmakers would consider proposing another constitutional amendment — subject to Utah voter approval — that would “clarify” when lawmakers can change voter-approved laws enacted by ballot initiative. 
It won’t be the first time Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature has tried to do this — but the last attempt failed, voided by the courts. 
After a groundbreaking Utah Supreme Court ruling in 2024 made clear that the Legislature’s power over “government reform” ballot initiatives has limits, Utah lawmakers put a question known as Amendment D on the 2024 November ballot to sidestep that ruling and rewrite the Utah Constitution. 
Amendment D still void: Utah Supreme Court upholds district court decision

Had it been approved by voters, Amendment D would have enshrined in the Utah Constitution the Legislature’s unfettered power to repeal or alter any type of ballot initiative, including Proposition 4. 
However, the ballot language posing the question to voters — written by Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders — did not explain that in plain language, prompting critics to sue. They claimed Amendment D’s language was “false and misleading.” 
Third District Court Judge Dianna Gibson agreed, while also determining officials failed to meet constitutional publication requirements — so she voided the question. State attorneys appealed the decision to the Utah Supreme Court, which affirmed the district court’s decision.
Adams, however, balked at characterizing their new attempt as Amendment D 2.0.
He said the goal is to make clear that laws passed by the Legislature and enacted by ballot initiative are on a “level playing field” or “co-equal.” 
“We just want to reinstate the co-equal status,” he said. “It’s really important people understand that there’s no intent to do away with initiatives. It just needs to be co-equal status.” 
Adams argues that the Utah Supreme Court’s ruling that says the Legislature must satisfy “strict scrutiny” or assert a compelling government interest in order to change “government reform” ballot initiatives was too ambiguous and left the door open to a flood of ballot initiatives that lawmakers can’t change. That, he argues, could doom Utah’s future. 
“The Supreme Court ruling will destroy Utah. It’s basically changed our entire form of government,” he said. “We live in a republic. … (U.S.) Supreme Court (Thurgood) Marshall said the difference between a democracy and a republic is order and chaos. We have chaos right now.” 
5 key Utah redistricting issues to watch in 2026

Pressed on what the language of the proposed amendment will be, Adams said “we’re not anywhere close” to determining that, “but there will be a constitutional amendment.”
“And we will find a way,” he added, “to make sure that we put together language that our Supreme Court is happy with.” 
Escamilla said Senate Democrats will be on guard for any attempt to weaken voters’ ability to enact laws via ballot initiative. 
“That is a top priority,” Escamilla said. “Protecting citizens’ initiatives is critical.”
Escamilla argued the Utah Supreme Court’s interpretation of the existing Utah Constitution made clear that lawmakers can change “government reform” ballot initiatives — but they can’t undermine them. 
“It’s when it gets ridiculous, actually undermining the entire intent behind what the citizens of Utah voted for,” she said. 
She added that she’s concerned about any attempt to change the Utah Constitution in ways that could empower the Legislature to make changes to voter-approved laws in more ways than they already have the ability to do. 
“You’re either going to say we will change and undermine, or not,” she said. “If you’re going to allow that, I think there will be opposition. The public is exhausted and tired of being undermined by the government when it comes to citizen initiatives and decisions being made by the public.”

The American Cancer Society estimates that 5,400 men in Alabama will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year. It also estimates that about 10% of those will die from the disease. That is 400 less than the ACS’s 2025 estimation of diagnoses. 
Jane Adams, government relations director for ACS Cancer Action Network in Alabama, said in an interview Wednesday that early screenings help improve outcomes and eliminating cost-sharing allows more patients to get screened.
“We’ve been doing a lot of activity with survivors, making sure that lawmakers are hearing about how important the screening is and how important eliminating barriers is to getting the screening,” Adams said. “I think a lot of those efforts have led to it being a priority, and we’re always appreciative of that.”
The bill was the second passed by the Senate. 
According to the American Cancer Society, Black men are at higher risk for the disease. The mortality rate for prostate cancer was 18.7 per 100,000 men in 2022, half of what it was in 1993. The 5-year survival rate for the disease is 100% for the majority of men diagnosed with localized- or regional-stage prostate cancer, but drops to 37% for those diagnosed with distant-stage disease, according to the American Cancer Society. The 10-year survival rate for all stages combined is 98%.
The bill only applies the cost-sharing elimination to patients who have a father, brother or son with a prostate diagnosis or cause of death; Black men, and men over fifty.

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s workforce shortage and federal limitations on a $189.5 million infusion of cash are making some lawmakers worry about the feasibility and sustainability of the state’s plan to strengthen rural health care.
The funding comes from the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. Congress included it in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in response to concerns that the bill’s Medicaid cuts will hurt rural health providers. Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides health insurance for people with disabilities or low incomes.
Lawmakers aren’t able to amend the state’s approved spending plan to address their own concerns, they learned in a presentation Thursday in Pierre. Laura Ringling, senior policy adviser for Gov. Larry Rhoden, told lawmakers the state can only make “some minor budget shifting” going forward.

The role lawmakers play is to authorize the state to spend the $189.5 million. Lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee will be the first to consider a bill authorizing the funds.
Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, has questions and frustrations about the funding. She told South Dakota Searchlight she intends to ask more questions of state officials during what will be “a long process.”
“It’s a matter of if this is something taxpayer dollars should be spent on,” Howard said. “If it’s not, then it’s our job to deny authority.”
The problem, Howard added, is that if the Legislature doesn’t spend the money, another state will spend it instead. 
South Dakota’s plan outlines 10 initiatives, including creating a “data atlas” for providers and facilities to share local and state agency data, improving the rural health care workforce, improving chronic disease management, establishing regional maternal and infant health care hubs, and regionalizing behavioral health care, among other projects.
Ringling told lawmakers that one-time incentives will bolster the rural health care workforce so that it is sustainable and long-lived years after the one-time funding ends.
Federal government awards $189 million to South Dakota from new rural health fund

Incentives will include sign-on bonuses, relocation assistance and rural service stipends for health care professionals not already covered by the state’s rural assistance program, such as nurses, doctors and physician assistants. The federal government requires that people who are awarded workforce funding must commit to five years in the rural community.
“Nothing we do with these funds will matter if we don’t have the trained people in our communities to provide the care,” Ringling said.
Several lawmakers asked questions on Thursday about workforce needs and how those would be addressed outside of the incentives mentioned.
Howard told officials during the presentation that she’s skeptical about the proposal and its sustainability. The programs, especially the behavioral health and maternal and infant health care hubs, she said, could require more than one-time funding to operate in financially strapped rural communities.
Ringling said the programs, operated by non-state government organizations, must submit a sustainability plan to be considered for funding. Howard took that to mean taxes and fees could be raised at the local level.
“It doesn’t help the local citizens if the state says, ‘Well, the program is done. We wash our hands. We didn’t increase your taxes and fees,’ but then the sustainability model of the local entity increases our taxes and fees. They’re still feeling that pinch,” Howard said.
Regionalization, telehealth, data-sharing: SD applies for $1 billion from federal rural health fund

Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, told South Dakota Searchlight that the presentation didn’t address the consequences of the One Big Beautiful Bill’s changes to Medicaid, including work requirements. Muckey called the one-time funding “a Band-Aid over a bullet wound.”
“There is excitement to be had about rural communities receiving the investments they deserve,” Muckey said. “But this still doesn’t answer the question about how to sustain quality health care going forward because of massive cuts to Medicaid.”
South Dakota’s award was short about $4 million of the $193.3 million it requested for the first year of the program, and it was less than the amounts received by neighboring states. The state does not know why it received less funding.
Ringling said the state requested nearly $213 million for the next year. She expects to receive that amount if “we’re doing what we said we were going to do.”
“If for some reason we’re delayed, we’re not able to get going, we’re not able to show that we’re performing and meeting the things that we said we would do in our application,” Ringling said, “we risk a lower dollar amount and losing those funds.”
Once the authorizing bill is signed, departments will begin finding organizations to carry out the initiatives in the state’s Rural Health Transformation Program application. The money must be spent by October.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A new report says investors own 24.84% of Nevada’s single-family homes, equating to about 303,000 properties. That’s 6% higher than the national average and the seventh highest share in the nation behind Wyoming (30.9%), Maine (29.76%), Montana (26.78%), Alaska (26.65%), Hawaii (25.96%), and New Hampshire (25.04%).
“Like most of those other states, Nevada’s economy depends heavily on tourism, which suggests that many of the investor-owned homes are probably vacation homes and short-term rentals,” national analyst Rick Sharga said via email of the Q3 2025 Investor Pulse report from BatchData.  
Efforts abound at the local and federal levels to limit investor purchases of single-family homes. 
In 2023, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed a bill that would have limited corporations to buying no more than 1,000 homes a year. Last year, the governor enlisted a Republican ally to kill a similar measure.  
Now President Donald Trump wants to ban the largest institutional investors – those who own more than 1,000 homes. 
The report says such policies miss the mark. 
Small investors (those who own between one and five properties), hold nearly 92% of the investor-owned market, while large investors (those owning six to 10 properties) hold just under 4%. 
“Mega-investors with 1,000+ homes control just 2.1% of the inventory,” or about 0.4% of housing stock, the report says. “Wall Street isn’t the dominant force.” 
Some experts contend the effect of institutional investment on prices is negligible. By one estimate, prices increase 1.7% for every percentage point of housing stock owned by institutional investors, who currently hold less than 1%. 
Public dialogue about investor home purchases “is full of misconceptions,” says the report, which contends investors “aren’t necessarily competing with traditional homebuyers. …. They target lower-priced, older homes in need of work rather than the move-in ready houses most families buy.”  
Investors add inventory to the market, rather than competing with traditional homebuyers, the report suggests.
In the third quarter of last year, the report says, investors paid an average price of $449,981, “well below the national average of $512,800.” 
Investors buy and sell homes at below market prices, the report found, because they are concentrated in areas with prices lower than the national average, and because investors tend to buy older homes in need of work. 
The average price of a home sold by an investor In the third quarter of 2025 was $412,517— which is below the national average sales price of $512,800, the report says. 
Purchase and sales prices for investors “dipped slightly from the previous quarter, which had the highest average purchase price and sales price in the five plus years covered in the Analysis.”
Additionally, the report found 40% of investor sales are to other investors.
In Las Vegas, investors own 26.29% (about 172,000) of single family homes. Of those, about 6% (10,445) are owned by institutional investors. That’s 1.6% of all single-family homes.  
“These percentages are well above the national average of 2% and 0.4% respectively, and suggest that large investors view Las Vegas as an attractive market for single-family rental homes,” says Sharga. 
In Reno, investors own 23.17% of all single-family homes (about 43,000). Institutional investors own about 265 homes in the area, or just 0.6% of investor-owned homes, and 0.14% of all  single-family homes.
Investors own approximately 18% of the 86 million single-family homes in the U.S.
In five states – Texas, California, Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia – investors own 5 million properties, accounting for one-third of all investor-owned homes in the U.S., reflecting “strategic capital deployment in high-population, high-growth and high-yield markets,” the report says. 
The states with the lowest share of investor-owned homes are Minnesota (9.15%); Connecticut (10.16%); District of Columbia (11.1%); Wisconsin (11.43%); and Rhode Island (11.78%). 
“Low-share states typically feature strong local economies, high homeownership rates, or regulatory environments that discourage investor activity,” the report says. 
Investors were on the buying end of 34% of all single-family home purchases in the third quarter of 2025, marking the highest share in the last five years, according to the report. That’s up one percentage point from the second quarter and up nearly eight points from the third quarter of 2024, when investors purchased 25.5% of residential homes. 
“Q3 2025 was the seventh consecutive quarter where the largest investors sold more properties (5,798) than they bought (4,663),” the report says, calling it an indication that investors are divesting. 
The report reveals “two seemingly incongruous trends,” says BatchData president Ivo Draginov, who notes while the percentage of homes purchased by investors is at a five-year high, the number of homes sold in the third quarter last year plunged by 23,000 from a year earlier. 
“This suggests that the higher percentage of homes being purchased by investors is due at least in part to fewer home purchases by traditional homeowners rather than by overly aggressive investor activity,” Draginov said. 
Investors are “essential market stabilizers rather than speculative disruptors,” the report concludes. “At a time when traditional buyers are sidelined by financing constraints and limited inventory, investors provide critical liquidity in an otherwise constrained market.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2229115449-1024x714.jpg,,,2026-01-19 08:58:20.177931

Challenges remain,Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/19/house-legalize-mobile-sports-betting-mississippi-legislature/,"This year's proposal would direct state online gambling revenue to the government employees' retirement system, in an effort to win over the Senate.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The Mississippi House will try for the third year straight to legalize mobile sports betting with new provisions aimed at winning over Senate lawmakers who have opposed the measure, the House Gaming Committee Chairman said.
This year’s legislation — in a key change from last year’s proposal — would direct all state revenue from online betting to the state’s government pension system, Casey Eure, a Republican from Saucier who chairs House Gaming, told Mississippi Today.
The House and Senate are still at loggerheads over how to shore up the Public Employees’ Retirement System, which has unfunded liabilities of about $26 billion. 
The new proposal will also contain other “compromises” for those who have previously opposed legalization.
The persistence of a thriving black market in Mississippi and an estimated tens of millions a year in tax revenue that legal sports betting could generate has prompted a fierce push from some lawmakers to legalize the practice.
“By legalizing mobile sports betting, we can eliminate much of the illegal market — including protecting underage bettors — and provide real consumer safeguards in a regulated environment,” Eure said. “This legislation will also give our brick-and-mortar casinos a new revenue stream to ensure their continued success, while the state revenue generated will help close the gap in funding for our public employees’ retirement system.”
The effort also has a strong and well-funded lobby from sports betting companies. But the legalization effort could again face significant headwinds, from skeptical state lawmakers in both parties and federal regulatory changes since the election of President Donald Trump.
Senate Gaming Chairman David Blount, a Democrat from Jackson who has thus far opposed mobile sports betting legalization, told Mississippi Today he wouldn’t take a position on Eure’s bill until he read it. But he said directing the revenue to PERS wouldn’t be near enough to justify legalization. 
“These are the same people who abolished the income tax last year, which generates more than $2 billion a year to the state budget. If we legalized mobile sports betting tomorrow, it would take more than 1,000 years to pay off the unfunded liability in the retirement system,” Blount said. “The amount of money that we’re talking about is infinitesimal compared to the $26 billion unfunded liability of the retirement system.”
Eure has said legalizing online betting could generate as much as $80 million a year in tax revenue. Blount said the estimates he’s seen max out at about $30 million. Either way, the total would not pay off the system’s unfunded liabilities in the near term.
The Senate has already sent the House a bill to put half-a-billion dollars of the state’s current surplus into PERS, in addition to putting $50 million a year over the next decade. House leaders have proposed a recurring revenue stream for PERS, either from the state lottery or by legalizing mobile sports betting.
Blount also pointed to the rise of “prediction markets,” exchanges where people bet on the outcomes of future events. These markets, dominated by platforms such as Kalshi, are different from traditional sports betting because traders set prices. Also, prediction markets try to make money by letting people trade against each other to reveal how likely an event is, while sports betting companies make money by setting odds so the bookmaker always takes a cut.
Under the Trump administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has taken a lax approach to regulating prediction markets, allowing platforms to expand their offerings in states around the country, including states such as Mississippi, where mobile sports betting remains illegal.
“Predictions markets have essentially legalized nationwide mobile betting,” Blount said. “Whatever amount of money was promised last year, that number is reduced, maybe greatly reduced. Because due to the actions of the current administration, no state can tax or regulate prediction markets, which are effectively gambling.” 
Traditional sports betting giant DraftKings, which has lobbied Mississippi House Speaker Jason White to legalize online betting, launched its own prediction market product last month.
Two U.S. Senate committees could take up a bill later this month to establish new rules for the cryptocurrency industry, and some on Capitol Hill are pushing to include language that would tighten regulations on prediction markets. 
In addition to the role PERS and prediction markets might play in the debate over mobile sports betting legalization in Mississippi, a proposal this year would likely need to assuage the concerns of lawmakers from districts with casinos. Some brick-and-mortar casinos have feared the legalization of online betting could undercut their profits.
To protect smaller casinos from revenue losses, Eure’s bill last year would create a pot of money that establishments could draw from for the first five years after online sports betting becomes legal. It also included safeguards to prevent people from placing bets with credit cards. 
Eure still believes legalization would be an economic boon for Mississippi.

But I want to focus on a story King told about meeting a white man on a plane. This man, King said, claimed that Black Americans protested too much, saying “you aren’t doing anything for yourselves.” The white man, King said, noted that many groups of immigrants had managed to move from the margins into mainstream American society over generations. “Why don’t you teach your people to lift themselves by their own bootstraps?” the man said.
King reminded the man that white people took Black people to this country as property and denied them the opportunities other groups had.
“And I finally said to him that it’s a nice thing to say to people that you oughta lift yourself by your own bootstraps, but it is a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he oughta lift himself by his own bootstraps,” he said. “And the fact is that millions of Negroes, as a result of centuries of denial and neglect, have been left bootless.”
Correcting that wrong, King said, meant nothing less than rethinking American governance. The nation needed more than “a romantic or aesthetic something where you merely add color to a still predominantly white power structure.”
“Integration must be seen also in political terms where there is shared power, where Black men and white men share power together to build a new and a great nation,” he said.
This seems especially true in Alabama, a state with a terrible history of white people denying power to Black Alabamians and responding to those demanding it with violence. Like King, who survived a segregationist bombing of his Montgomery parsonage in 1956.
Today, the efforts of King and other brave Americans mean we have far more Black representation at the federal and state level than we did 70 years ago.
But we have a still-larger white leadership that all too often appears to consider Black political participation inherently illegitimate. That criminalizes attempts to help Black men and women vote. And fights tooth and nail to prevent Black Alabamians from having a meaningful voice in their governance.
This simulacrum of freedom means suffering and inequality. The median income of a white household in Alabama is $76,092. For a Black household, it’s $46,756.
In 2021 — in the middle of one of the best job markets in recent memory — the unemployment rate for white people in Alabama was 3%. For Black Alabamians, it was 5.6%. And for Black men, it was 7.1%.
The poverty rate for white people in Alabama in 2024 was 11.5%. For Black Alabamians, it was 23.4%.
I can go on. Infant mortality for Black Alabamians is more than double that for white people. Cervical cancer rates are higher for Black women, and survival rates are lower.
Would democracy — real democracy, reflective of people and not conservative propaganda — solve these problems? Probably not. But it would make it a lot easier to focus on solutions. Because our leaders would be responsible to the people living here, not a right-wing news channel or the shifting convictions of a White House occupant.
It’s trite on Martin Luther King Jr. Day to say that his work is not finished. It feels more precise to say that it’s barely gotten started. Until we secure genuine political power for Black Alabamians — not subject to the whims of white politicians — none of us will live in a democracy.
And all of us will pay the price.
We will continue to live under severe property tax caps — imposed by white planters who hated the idea of educating Black children — that kill our schools, sustain our poverty and benefit no one but the wealthiest landowners.
We will live with paranoid nonsense about election fraud that makes it harder for everyone to vote.
And we will continue getting lawmakers who feel no obligation to the people they represent. Who spend their time putting immigrants, Muslims and transgender people in danger.
Changing it, as King said, will be a decades-long process.
“Somewhere we must come to see that social progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability,” King said in that 1967 speech. “It comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated individuals.

Here's what to expect.","New Mexico senators rise to applaud the end of the first special legislative session Oct. 2, 2025, at the Roundhouse in Santa Fe. This year’s legislative session, which is Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s last in office, kicks off Jan. 20, 2026, amid signs of economic downturn. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s final regular legislative session starts at noon on Tuesday (don’t rule out the possibility of a special session before she leaves office at the end of the year, though—she’s called eight during her two terms in office).
While other lame-duck sessions have produced slugfests between the branches (see the 2010 food tax fight with Gov. Bill Richardson and the lawsuit over Gov. Susana Martínez’s 2017 vetoes), top lawmakers said they remain optimistic that the session will end on a high note. 
Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) told Source NM in a call Friday lawmakers “are going to start with something different” this session, and both chambers will push an expedited agenda of four bills to the governor’s desk within the first two weeks.
Those proposed bills include bipartisan legislation for the state to enter two medical compacts for doctors and social workers; a bill to provide $1.5 billion for the state’s roads; a bill to define the terms “harm to self” and “harm to others” to state laws for involuntary commitment; and finally legislation to ban New Mexico public entities from participating in immigration detention.
These are bills that “have agreements between the House, Senate and governor’s office,” Wirth said, and are similar to versions brought in the 2025 session.
“We said we were going to work on these bills for the 30-day session,” Wirth said. “We’ve done the work, we’re ready to go.”
On the House side, Democratic leaders gathered Friday at the First Choice Community Healthcare clinic in the South Valley, an institution House Speaker Rep. Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) said represented the culmination of years of work from local community organizers as well as local, state and federal elected officials. As a result, he said, the clinic exemplified functional government, a contrast with the dysfunction in Washington. 
He and other Democrats said how proud they were that New Mexico can backfill federal cuts to health care, Medicaid and other federal programs, even as they prepare to craft a budget that’s relatively tighter than years’ past. 
“As we go into the 2026 legislative session, we go in with a renewed sense of hope,” he said.
Five takeaways as the lawmaking begins

It’s all about the money
New Mexico’s Constitution limits even years to 30-day sessions focused on developing the state’s budget, along with bills sanctioned by the governor and ones that were vetoed in the prior session. 
Some of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s stated priorities for her last session include: health care, public safety and immigration issues, though full messages on those topics will not be available until the start of the session.
The governor can also issue messages throughout the session, in order to make a bill “germane” or relevant to the agenda. 
Competing budgets
While the governor sets out the priorities and puts out a budget recommendation, it’s the Legislature that doles out the dollars. 
The two proposals are pretty close to each other: Both seek to spend a little over $11 billion from the state’s general fund. 
By the #s: See where the New Mexico governor, Legislature disagree on $11B in budget priorities

But there are a few big differences, particularly around funding for the state New Mexico Early Childhood Education and Care Department.
Lujan Grisham asked for about $160 million more than the Legislature is seeking, funding she said is necessary to pay for free childcare for New Mexico families regardless of their income.
House leaders told Source that they are open to negotiating, but want to exercise fiscal restraint in light of tightening economic conditions while also ensuring childcare is free for those who most need it. 
Martínez said Friday the Legislature “will make sure that New Mexico delivers on its promise for a fully funded, affordable, high quality, universal child care system that puts the workers at the forefront.”

Crime and punishment
In recent years, Lujan Grisham has focused intently on public safety, urging legislative proposals in a 2024 special session on criminal competency, crime reporting, gun violence, drug overdoses and more. The special session adjourned after a matter of hours without lawmakers hearing any of the bills on her agenda.
On the final day of the 2025 session, Lujan Grisham lambasted lawmakers for what she called “appalling and unacceptable” inaction on juvenile crime after the March 21 shooting in Las Cruces that killed three people and injured 15.

In December, Republican lawmakers sent the governor a letter requesting she include issues such as creating minimum sentences for people with multiple felony convictions; expanding definitions of fentanyl in state law to include “fentanyl-related substances”; and increasing prison time for felons found to possess firearms.

Other topics

Other top priorities lawmakers and the administration have announced include creating regulations for AI and for  “microgrids.” The state is pushing for record investments into some state water programs. Legislators are expected to renew a push for increased alcohol taxes in the wake of high death rates from drinking. 
Martínez said Friday he expects debate and potential action on the issue of Legislature “modernization,” which could mean paying lawmakers, extending session lengths or other changes to avoid cramming so much important work into a 30-day session.
“I believe in the ability of my colleagues to get things done, but I don’t think 30 days is enough. And so we’ve got to modernize the Legislature,” he said. 
Constitutional amendments only require a simple majority in both Houses to pass, and do not require a message from the governor, nor a governor’s signature, according to the legislature’s rules and terms.

How to participate
The Roundhouse is open to the public, and New Mexicans can attend the 2026 session in-person and online. Each day, new calendars for the Senate, House of Representatives and committees will be posted to the “What’s Happening” section of the Legislature’s website, showing the bills up for vote or discussion. 
For people who want to attend in-person, calendars also show the time and room where a committee hearing will be held. New Mexicans can submit written public comments by email or sign up to speak on a bill virtually on video chat platform Zoom. The specific virtual attendance links are also on committee calendars. 
Members of the public can search for state representatives and senators by using the “Find My Legislator” page, clicking “search by address” and entering their address into the field. 
To watch live hearings of Senate or House floor proceedings or committees, visit the “webcast” page. To find recent recordings, click the “new recordings” tab. Find older recordings by clicking on a specific calendar date from the left side of the page. 
While lawmaking is the primary purpose of the legislative session, the Roundhouse also comes alive with protests (expect a big one on opening day), exhibitions and other types of events. For more information about special days and events, (such as Tourism and Outdoor Recreation Day on Jan. 26 or the legislative basketball game on Feb. 5) , check out the Legislature’s social calendar.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-19 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Still interested in solar despite expiring tax credits? What to know,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/19/solar-tax-credits/,"With tax credits worth up to 30% of the cost of a new solar residential system no longer being offered, companies predict a drop in sales.","Big changes are underway for Connecticut’s residential solar market as a result of recent policy shifts at both the state and federal level. What that means for homeowners interested in going solar depends on the type of system they’re interested in, household usage and personal finances.
As of Jan. 1, the federal government is no longer offering tax credits worth up to 30% of the cost of a new solar residential system. Those tax credits were enacted under President Joe Biden’s administration and eliminated under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald J. Trump in July.
With a typical rooftop solar setup in Connecticut costing upwards of $30,000, those credits were worth $9,000 or more on a system purchased up front by a homeowner.
Systems that are leased or subject to third-party power purchase agreements are still eligible for a separate, commercial tax credit until Dec. 31, 2027.
However, in order to qualify for those incentives, solar systems will have to comply with new rules put in place by the OBBA limiting the amount of foreign-manufactured parts from countries like China. Those rules are expected to increase the price of panels, in addition to the loss of any available tax credits.
How has the loss of the federal incentives impacted the solar market in Connecticut?
Jason Calabrese, the operations manager at Middlebury’s Ion Solar Pros, predicted that sales would drop between 20% and 25% in 2026 as a result of those changes and the uncertainty they have brought to the solar market. 
“A good portion of it’s based upon customer confusion,” Calabrese said. “Some people think that solar is ending altogether, that there’s no opportunity now to go solar. It’s created some uncertainty in the marketplace, which uncertainty in any marketplace is not good for sales.”
In the aftermath of the OBBA’s passage, several solar installers and financiers around the country shut down or filed for bankruptcy. In Connecticut, the fallout has been limited to two companies — PosiGen and Sunnova — according to Mike Trahan, the executive director of the Connecticut Solar and Storage Association.
Trahan noted that even before the law, more than two-thirds of new solar systems being deployed in Connecticut were owned by third parties. For those residents who still want to own their own systems, Trahan said the loss of the federal tax credits had forced developers to work with banks to create new financing options.
“It’s become an interesting time, I’ve been hearing from people and how they are trying to figure out new products, new lending, loan and sales products, to consumers,” Trahan said.
What state-level policies are changing?
In addition to the loss of federal tax credits, Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority in December approved several changes to its residential and commercial solar programs. One of the most notable changes was a 704% increase in the charge assessed on the output of residential solar systems, from half-a-cent per kilowatt hour to more than 4 cents a kWh.
That increase was dictated, in part, by state lawmakers in order to better align the cost of rooftop solar incentives with the state’s rising price of electricity. Their legislation, Senate Bill 4, was passed before the changes to the federal tax credits.
While PURA did consider offering additional incentives for individually-owned systems to offset the loss of the federal tax credits, the commissioners ultimately opted not do so due to the cost and administrative effort required to create those incentives for a limited time period. 
Trahan said that he is planning to ask PURA to reconsider its decision in early 2026.
If the new state charges go into effect along with the loss of federal tax credits, the result for system owners is that it could take another four or five years to recoup their initial investment, according to Sean Riel, the director of residential sales at Ellington’s Earthlight Technologies. Still, he said he remained optimistic that leasing would be seen as viable alternative for customers over the next two years.
“If you’re going with a lease, the pitch there remains the same: that you’re going to be locking in a lower rate for power through purchasing solar energy versus paying the utility,” Riel said. 
PURA did increase price caps and other incentives for non-residential solar systems in 2026 in order to account for the loss of the federal tax credits.
Another change taking effect on Jan. 1 is a new state law dictating that most condo complexes can no longer “prohibit or unreasonably restrict” owners of single-family, detached units from installing solar panels on their roofs. Complexes that wish to opt out of the new requirements must do so by Jan. 1, 2028 with a three-quarters vote of their board.
Andrew Belden, vice president for renewable programs and strategy at Eversource, said that it remains to be seen how customers and the solar industry react to the shifting state and federal policies.
“The industry hasn’t metabolized a change like this, ever,” Belden said. “So, 2026 will be a year when we’re going to find out a lot about how the market is going to react to changes. What we always suggest for customers is to treat solar installation as you would any other home improvement project: shop around, ask questions. There are likely good deals to be had, but there are also challenges.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP23349541550576-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Avery Ping had a knack for noticing who in a room might be having a bad day and checking in on them. He wanted to be a psychiatrist. 
But the Olympia teen was addicted to his screen, his father Aaron said. He wanted to get away from his phone, and Aaron was adamant about limiting his screen time. 
“For a developing teenage brain, it’s going to be training that brain for impulsive behavior,” Aaron Ping said. “Dopamine reward schedules, it has a really harmful effect on the developing mind.”
Aaron Ping feels that effect is what led Avery to seek out the hallucinogenic drug MDMA on Snapchat in late 2024, leading to his overdose death. He was 16.
Now his father is pushing for a measure in Washington state to set up safeguards for children online.  
House Bill 1834 aims to protect youth in multiple ways. 
It would block companies like Instagram, YouTube and TikTok from providing “addictive feeds” to minors. Youth consumers would still have access to the platforms to search for specific content and follow users they’re interested in.
Under the bill, companies also couldn’t send push notifications to minors overnight or during school hours without parental consent
“It’s really the first step that has to happen before we can start to make it safe online,” Ping said in an interview.
The Senate passed its version of the legislation last year with some bipartisan support, but it stalled in the House amid constitutionality and privacy concerns. The bill comes at the request of state Attorney General Nick Brown. It also had Gov. Bob Ferguson’s support last year.
As attorney general, Ferguson sued TikTok and Meta over the platforms trying to reel in youth users and get them hooked. Both cases are ongoing.
Lawmakers and advocates, including former tech executives, are renewing their push for the state guardrails this year. 
The tech industry isn’t happy.
Rose Feliciano, the executive director of TechNet in the Northwest, said in a statement that the organization “and its member companies are committed to providing safe, age-appropriate online experiences for young people.”
“But we are concerned that the bill, as currently drafted, would limit companies’ ability to offer the full range of parental controls needed to help keep children safe,” said Feliciano, whose organization is made up of a bipartisan network of tech executives. She also noted constitutionality concerns.

TechNet members include Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Meta and Google. 
In a letter to lawmakers Thursday, the tech lobbying group NetChoice said the issue should be left to parents, and that legislation like this replaces “parental judgment with state diktat.” 
Amy Bos, the group’s vice president of government affairs, argued the proposed regulations violate the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. NetChoice prefers focusing on digital literacy and helping parents guide their children’s internet use to address the problem.
Children’s Alliance Executive Director Soleil Boyd said advocates have worked hard to ensure the legislation is “legally defensible and really will make a difference.”
“You bring in these algorithms that really are targeting young people, children and kids to make sure that they stay online for as long as absolutely possible,” Boyd said. “It’s more than most parents can do to really fight and combat that.”
View from the inside
Kelly Stonelake worked at Meta for nearly 15 years, including leading the expansion of the company’s virtual reality software, Horizon Worlds, to kids and teenagers.
For much of her career, Stonelake, who also worked at Apple, believed that her company was going to do right by its consumers. She would’ve argued against overregulation.
But she said it was an open secret within Meta that with Horizon Worlds, children were using a product they weren’t allowed to without parental oversight, meaning the company was collecting their data in violation of federal law. The only concern was for how issues would affect the company, not the young users of the products, she said.
“The executive team got into the product to play test it and kind of understand it better ourselves, but we could not even hear one another over the sounds of screaming children,” Stonelake said.
Stonelake, who lives in Normandy Park, believes she was laid off from Meta in retaliation for raising concerns. She is suing the tech giant over the alleged retaliation and gender discrimination. (Meta didn’t respond to a request for comment.)
She’s now become passionate about working on bills like Washington’s, which she calls “common sense regulations that we need to protect kids.”
“Because I’ve seen firsthand that these companies won’t,” Stonelake said.
In 2023, about 70% of Washington 10th graders reported using social media several times a day. Those students were likely to have worse grades.
Nearly half of 10th graders were at risk of what is called “problematic internet use” that could be risky or impulsive and lead to bad consequences. Those students were likely to get less sleep than their peers. And 8% reported increased social anxiety due to internet use.
“If we can get way upstream and we can prevent it from happening in the first place, and this is exactly that,” said bill sponsor Rep. Lisa Callan, D-Issaquah. “Let’s prevent some anxiety and depression from happening in the first place.”
In 2023, the U.S. Surgeon General recommended policymakers limit social media access to keep youth safe and better protect their privacy online. 
Another bill under consideration in Olympia looks to protect young people online by requiring kids age 16 and younger to get parental consent to make social media accounts. Last year, Democratic lawmakers proposed a new tax on social media companies to fund youth behavioral health care.
The legal state of play
A number of states have enacted legislation tackling this issue, but such laws have faced legal challenges. 
Washington’s measure is modeled after a California ban on addictive feeds that has withstood court scrutiny. Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law’s requirement of parental consent for minors to access addictive feeds. Meta, Google and TikTok have since sued to block the California law. 
Tech groups like NetChoice argue regulating internet content and restricting what feeds minors can have is unconstitutional. 
Seann Colgan, a state assistant attorney general focused on consumer protection, argued the Washington bill doesn’t run afoul of freedom of speech protections. 
“It doesn’t restrict kids’ access to speech,” Colgan told a state Senate panel Thursday. “Kids can still access the speech, they just need to look for it themselves instead of having it fed to them in an addictive manner.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/instagram-concept-photo-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

In negotiations, Henry Ford has insisted on many concessions, but one is particularly painful on this Martin Luther King Jr. Day: eliminating recognition of the holiday for Rochester Hospital employees.
For me, as a Black woman in Metro Detroit, this is not just about a day off. It is about recognition.
Dr. King’s fight for dignity, justice, and economic fairness is the bedrock of the labor movement. To erase this holiday is to dismiss the profound connection between civil rights and workers’ rights.
But this is more than a symbolic insult; it’s a practical misstep that will hurt our hospital. Our Metro Detroit community is already facing a health care staffing crisis. We are struggling to recruit and retain nurses, technicians, and support staff. Telling staff and potential hires, especially in a region as diverse as ours, that we do not value this cornerstone holiday sends a clear message: your values are not our values. It tells my colleagues of color that their heritage and the community’s history are an afterthought.
Henry Ford is pushing for many other concessions that will strain an already stretched workforce. While MLK Day and Good Friday are on the chopping block entirely, hospital executives also want to reduce holiday pay when we work any other holiday, eliminate daily overtime, and reduce paid time off. While the affordability crisis continues to make it harder for hospital staff to make ends meet, Henry Ford has proposed wage increases that leave many behind and, for some, freezes wages for the next year.
Exhausted, undervalued staff cannot provide optimal patient outcomes. Dr. King said, “Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.” By devaluing the workers who are at the heart of this hospital, Henry Ford executives risk perpetuating the very inequalities we strive to heal.
This Martin Luther King Jr. Day, we call on Henry Ford to reconsider.
Show our community, your employees, and every patient who walks through these doors that you truly honor Dr. King’s legacy. Not with empty statements, but with just practices that attract and retain the dedicated staff our patients deserve.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hopsital-image-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

The marchers set out after the original, solo marcher, James Meredith was shot and wounded by a white gunman. Photo by Archive Photos/Getty Images. Your Majesty, your royal highness, Mr. president, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:
I accept the Nobel Prize for Peace at a moment when 22 million Negroes of the United States of America are engaged in a creative battle to end the long night of racial injustice. I accept this award on behalf of a Civil Rights Movement which is moving with determination and a majestic scorn for risk and danger to establish a reign of freedom and a rule of justice. I am mindful that only yesterday in Birmingham, Alabama, our children, crying out for brotherhood, were answered with fire hoses, snarling dogs and even death. I am mindful that only yesterday in Philadelphia, Mississippi, young people seeking to secure the right to vote were brutalized and murdered. And only yesterday more than 40 houses of worship in the state of Mississippi alone were bombed or burned because they offered a sanctuary to those who would not accept segregation. I am mindful that debilitating and grinding poverty afflicts my people and chains them to the lowest rung of the economic ladder.
Therefore, I must ask why this prize is awarded to a movement which is beleaguered and committed to unrelenting struggle; to a movement which has not won the very peace and brotherhood which is the essence of the Nobel Prize.
After contemplation, I conclude that this award which I receive on behalf of that movement is a profound recognition that nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral question of our time — the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to violence and oppression. Civilization and violence are antithetical concepts. Negroes of the United States, following the people of India, have demonstrated that nonviolence is not sterile passivity, but a powerful moral force which makes for social transformation. Sooner or later all the people of the world will have to discover a way to live together in peace, and thereby transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. If this is to be achieved, man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.
The tortuous road which has led from Montgomery, Alabama to Oslo bears witness to this truth. This is a road over which millions of Negroes are travelling to find a new sense of dignity. This same road has opened for all Americans a new era of progress and hope. It has led to a new Civil Rights Bill, and it will, I am convinced, be widened and lengthened into a super highway of justice as Negro and white men in increasing numbers create alliances to overcome their common problems.
I accept this award today with an abiding faith in America and an audacious faith in the future of mankind. I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history. I refuse to accept the idea that the “isness” of man’s present nature makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal “oughtness” that forever confronts him. I refuse to accept the idea that man is mere flotsam and jetsam in the river of life, unable to influence the unfolding events which surround him. I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality.
I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of thermonuclear destruction. I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right temporarily defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. I believe that even amid today’s mortar bursts and whining bullets, there is still hope for a brighter tomorrow. I believe that wounded justice, lying prostrate on the blood-flowing streets of our nations, can be lifted from this dust of shame to reign supreme among the children of men. I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits. I believe that what self-centered men have torn down men other-centered can build up. I still believe that one day mankind will bow before the altars of God and be crowned triumphant over war and bloodshed, and nonviolent redemptive good will proclaim the rule of the land. “And the lion and the lamb shall lie down together and every man shall sit under his own vine and fig tree and none shall be afraid.” I still believe that we shall overcome!
This faith can give us courage to face the uncertainties of the future. It will give our tired feet new strength as we continue our forward stride toward the city of freedom. When our days become dreary with low-hovering clouds and our nights become darker than a thousand midnights, we will know that we are living in the creative turmoil of a genuine civilization struggling to be born.
Today I come to Oslo as a trustee, inspired and with renewed dedication to humanity. I accept this prize on behalf of all men who love peace and brotherhood. I say I come as a trustee, for in the depths of my heart I am aware that this prize is much more than an honor to me personally.
Every time I take a flight, I am always mindful of the many people who make a successful journey possible — the known pilots and the unknown ground crew.
So you honor the dedicated pilots of our struggle who have sat at the controls as the freedom movement soared into orbit. You honor, once again, Chief Lutuli of South Africa, whose struggles with and for his people, are still met with the most brutal expression of man’s inhumanity to man. You honor the ground crew without whose labor and sacrifices the jet flights to freedom could never have left the earth. Most of these people will never make the headline and their names will not appear in Who’s Who. Yet when years have rolled past and when the blazing light of truth is focused on this marvellous age in which we live – men and women will know and children will be taught that we have a finer land, a better people, a more noble civilization – because these humble children of God were willing to suffer for righteousness’ sake.
I think Alfred Nobel would know what I mean when I say that I accept this award in the spirit of a curator of some precious heirloom which he holds in trust for its true owners – all those to whom beauty is truth and truth beauty – and in whose eyes the beauty of genuine brotherhood and peace is more precious than diamonds or silver or gold.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-800885663.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

Each year on the holiday that bears his name, Martin Luther King Jr. is remembered for his immense contributions to the struggle for racial equality. What is less often remembered but equally important is that King saw the fight for racial equality as deeply intertwined with economic justice.
To address inequality – and out of growing concern for how automation might displace workers – King became an early advocate for universal basic income. Under universal basic income, the government provides direct cash payments to all citizens to help them afford life’s expenses.
In recent years, more than a dozen U.S. cities have run universal basic income programs, often smaller or pilot programs that have offered guaranteed basic incomes to select groups of needy residents. As political scientists, we have followed these experiments closely.
One of us recently co-authored a study which found that universal basic income is generally popular. In two out of three surveys analyzed, majorities of white Americans supported a universal basic income proposal. Support is particularly high among those with low incomes.
King’s intuition was that white people with lower incomes would support this type of policy because they could also benefit from it. In 1967, King argued, “It seems to me that the Civil Rights Movement must now begin to organize for the guaranteed annual income … which I believe will go a long, long way toward dealing with the Negro’s economic problem and the economic problem with many other poor people confronting our nation.”
But there is one notable group that does not support universal basic income: those with higher levels of racial resentment. Racial resentment is a scale that social scientists have used to describe and measure anti-Black prejudice since the 1980s.
Notably, in our research, whites with higher levels of racial resentment and higher incomes are especially inclined to oppose universal basic income. As King well knew, this segment of Americans can create powerful opposition.

 Economic self-interest can trump resentment

At the same time, the results of the study also suggest that coalition building is possible, even among the racially resentful.
Economic status matters. Racially resentful whites with lower incomes tend to be supportive of universal basic income. In short, self-interest seems to trump racial resentment. This is consistent with King’s idea of how an economic coalition could be built and pave the way toward racial progress.
Income is not the only thing that shapes attitudes, however. Some of the strongest supporters of universal basic income are those who have higher incomes but low levels of racial resentment. This suggests an opportunity to build coalitions across economic lines, something King believed was necessary. “The rich must not ignore the poor,” he argued in his Nobel Peace Prize lecture, “because both rich and poor are tied in a single garment of destiny.” Our data shows that this is possible.
This approach to coalition building is also suggested by our earlier research. Using American National Election Studies surveys from 2004-2016, we found that for white Americans, racial resentment predicted lower support for social welfare policies. But we also found that economic position mattered, too.
Economic need can unite white Americans in support of more generous welfare policies, including among some who are racially prejudiced. At a minimum, this suggests that racial resentment does not necessarily prevent white Americans from supporting policies that would also benefit Black Americans.
 Building lasting coalitions

During his career as an activist in the 1950s and 1960s, King struggled with building long-term, multiracial coalitions. He understood that many forms of racial prejudice could undermine his work. He therefore sought strategies that could forge alliances across lines of difference. He helped build coalitions of poor and working-class Americans, including those who are white. He was not so naive as to think that shared economic progress would eliminate racial prejudice, but he saw it as a place to start.
Currently, the nation faces an affordability crisis, and artificial intelligence poses new threats to jobs. These factors have increased calls for universal basic income.
Racial prejudice continues to fuel opposition to universal basic income, as well as other forms of social welfare. But our research suggests that this is not insurmountable.
As King knew, progress toward economic equality is not inevitable. But, as his legacy reminds us, progress does remain possible through organizing around shared interests.

This story was originally reported by Ebony JJ Curry of The 19th.  Meet Ebony and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Detroit was the first place Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered an early version of what would become his “I Have a Dream” speech. He recited it on June 23, 1963, at the end of Detroit’s Walk to Freedom, a march that happened weeks before he spoke on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
This piece of Detroit-first history sharpens what Martin Luther King Jr. Day asks of the city. It’s harder to treat the holiday, celebrated on Monday, as a slogan when the dream was first spoken aloud in Detroit. It’s also harder to see it as a day off when a lot of people choose to mark it every year as a day on.
The Lambda Pi Omega (LPO) chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, is one of the Detroit institutions built around that belief.
Their members measure the weeks before Martin Luther King Jr. Day in labor. They assemble toiletry kits for Detroiters without stable housing, volunteer their time to youth programs focused on combating hunger and fostering leadership skills, and step into the gaps families are already navigating, like hunger and lack of resources. Crystal Sewell, the chapter’s president, said the work is rooted in service that isn’t just a once-a-year thing.
“Our work really is about uplifting our community; that is really at the heart of what we do,” Sewell said. “It is sisterhood and service for the betterment of our local community, that’s really the essence and the spirit of our chapter.”
This year, LPO will spend Martin Luther King Jr. Day at Third New Hope Baptist Church on Detroit’s west side for its annual “We Are One” AKA Day of Service. Sorority members plan to assemble 1,908 toiletry bags for Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, a local nonprofit that provides emergency shelter and support services, including housing programs for families and people working toward recovery. The specificity in the number of kits is intentional: 1,908 reflects AKA’s founding year, 1908. After the event, the bags will be delivered to the rescue mission’s family shelter and recovery housing sites.
The chapter’s service calendar stays full throughout the year, Sewell said.
“If I were to add it up, I would say we participate in at least 10 volunteer opportunities per month,” she said. “So, you’re talking 100 to 150 volunteer service opportunities per year. There are several hours that go into our volunteerism, over 2,000 hours per year.”
LPO is part of the Divine Nine — nine historically Black fraternities and sororities under the National Pan-Hellenic Council, founded when Black students, excluded from White Greek systems, created their own organizations around scholarship, leadership and service.
Dr. King was part of that tradition.
He was initiated into Boston’s Sigma chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha in June 1952. Alpha Phi Alpha (APA) was founded in 1906 as the first Black Greek-letter fraternity; AKA is the first Black Greek-letter sorority.
AKA’s purpose statement includes a directive members repeat as a standard: to be of “service to all mankind.”
Jacqueline Newman has spent decades living by that. She became an AKA member in 1970 at Wayne State University. When the sorority’s LPO chapter was chartered in Detroit in 1977, she became a founding charter member. She now serves as the chapter historian.
“What we do is we try to help, whenever we can, wherever we can,” Newman said. “We love children, so we are in different schools to help feed students. We’ve clothed students. We’ve given Thanksgiving baskets. We’ve given scholarships, and it was not only to women or girls. It has been to men also. And no matter your race. That’s what I look at as service to all mankind, to all people that are in need. That’s what we do.”
Newman’s own timeline begins in the South. She was 13 and living in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, when Dr. King spoke in Detroit in 1963.
“I was part of the South that he was trying to free from civil rights injustices,” she said.

She moved to Detroit in 1965 with her family. “My mom and my dad were teachers and the employment was better here in Detroit,” Newman said. Her mother became a member of AKA in 1962; Newman described her own membership as legacy. “So, it was mainly a legacy for me. I followed in my mom’s footsteps.”
Her history of service began before she joined AKA. In the South, she said, “I saw so many injustices done, especially to our people. I was marching and doing civil rights things when I was 11, 12, 13 years old before I came here to Michigan.”
Those experiences compelled her to action — “you don’t want anybody else to have to go through what you went through,” Newman said.
“When you have seen a man hung on a tree, it hits you a little more,” Newman said. “If you have lived through it, it’s different.”
Detroit remembers Dr. King’s dream speech because it heard it early. Lambda Pi Omega is betting its Martin Luther King Jr. Day on a simpler goal: what gets done, who gets served, and whether the work continues when the holiday ends.
As Sewell said, service is about direct support and long-term civic work.
“Service for me is about uplifting others within our community who are of greatest need,” she said. “It is advocating for social justice, making sure our community is informed and educated and registered to vote and getting out to vote, thinking about the whole of the individual, from cradle to senior.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AKA-service03-1024x683.webp,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Since 1983, when President Ronald Reagan signed Martin Luther King Jr. Day into law, many Americans have observed the federal holiday to commemorate the life and legacy of the civil rights leader, Baptist minister and theologian.

MLK Day volunteers typically perform community service that continues King’s fight to end racial discrimination and economic injustice – to build the “beloved community,” as he often said.
King does not fully explain the phrase’s meaning in his published writings, speeches and sermons. Scholars Rufus Burrow Jr. and Lewis V. Baldwin, however, argue that the beloved community is King’s principal ethical goal, guiding the struggle against what he called the “three evils of American society”: racism, economic exploitation and militarism.
As a Baptist minister and theologian myself, I believe it is important to understand the origins of the concept of the beloved community, how King understood it and how he worked to make it a reality.
Older origins
Although King popularized the beloved community, the phrase has roots in the thought of 19th-century American religious philosopher Josiah Royce.
In 1913, toward the end of his long career, Royce published “The Problem of Christianity.” The book compiles lectures on the Christian religion, including the idea of the church and its mission, and coined the term beloved community. Based on his readings of the biblical gospels, as well as the writings of the apostle Paul, Royce argued that the beloved community was one where individuals are transformed by God’s love.

In turn, members express that love as loyalty toward each other – for example, the devoted love a member of the church would have toward the church as a whole.
While Royce often identified the beloved community with the church, he extends the concept beyond the walls of Christianity. In any type of community, Royce argued, from clans to nations, there are individuals who express love and devotion not only to their own community, but who foster a sense of the community that includes all humankind.
According to Royce, the ideal or beloved community is a “universal community” – one to which all human beings belong or will eventually belong at the end of time.
‘Beloved’ diversity
Twentieth-century pastor, philosopher, mystic, theologian and civil rights leader Howard Thurman retrieved Royce’s idea of the beloved community and applied it to his life and work, most notably in his 1971 book “The Search for Common Ground.”
Thurman first used the term in an unpublished and undated article: Desegregation, Integration, and the Beloved Community. Here, he argued that the beloved community cannot be achieved by sheer will or commanded by force. Rather, it begins with transformation in each person’s “human spirit.” The seeds of the beloved community extend outward into society as each person assumes the responsibility of bringing it to pass.
Thurman envisioned the beloved community as one that exemplifies harmony – harmony enriched by members’ diversity. It is a community wherein people from all racial, national, religious and ethnic backgrounds are respected, and where their human dignity is affirmed. Thurman was convinced that beloved community was achievable because of the dedication he saw from activists during the struggle for racial integration.
During his lifetime, Thurman sought to build this beloved community through his activism for racial justice. For example, he co-founded the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples, an interracial and interfaith community in San Francisco, which he co-pastored from 1943 to 1953.
Thurman’s writings and activism deeply influenced King. Burrow argued that it is not entirely clear when and where King first learned the concept of beloved community. Yet King emphasized its importance in much of his writing and political action.
Love and action
In simplest terms, King defined the beloved community as a community transformed by love. Like Royce, he drew his understanding of love from the Bible’s New Testament. In the original Greek, the Gospels use the word “agape,” which suggests God’s self-giving, unconditional love for humanity – and, by extension, human beings’ self-giving, unconditional love for each other.

According to Baldwin, however, King’s understanding of the beloved community is better understood against the backdrop of the Black church tradition. Raised in the Ebenezer Baptist Church of Atlanta, King learned lessons on the meaning of love from his parents, Rev. Martin Luther King Sr. – Ebenezer’s pastor, who was also a leader in the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People – and Alberta Christine Williams King.
One of the distinctions in King’s thought is that he believed the beloved community could be achieved through nonviolent direct action, such as sit-ins, marches and boycotts. In part, he was inspired by Thurman, who had embraced the nonviolence at the heart of Mahatma Gandhi’s resistance against the British in India. For King, nonviolence was the only viable means for achieving the United States of America’s redemption from the sin of racial segregation and white supremacy.
For King, therefore, the beloved community was not merely a utopian vision of the future. He envisioned it as an obtainable ethical goal that all human beings must work collectively toward achieving.
“Only a refusal to hate or kill can put an end to the chain of violence in the world and lead us toward a community where men can live together without fear,” King wrote in 1966. “Our goal is to create a beloved community and this will require a qualitative change in our souls as well as a quantitative change in our lives.”
King’s idea of the beloved community has not only influenced people affiliated with the Christian tradition but also people from other faiths and none.
For instance, scholars Elizabeth A. Johnson, bell hooks and Joy James have reflected upon the meaning of the beloved community amid ongoing challenges such as global climate change, sexism, racism and other forms of structural violence.
People around the world continue to draw insight and inspiration from King’s thought, especially from his insistence that love is “the most durable power” to change the world for the better. Questions remain about whether his beloved community can be realized, or how. But I believe it is important to understand King’s ethical concept and its continuing influence on movements that seek an end to injustice.

(Photo by STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — With two months to go before candidates must file to be on this year’s ballots, the state Democratic Party made a plea.
“RUN FOR OFFICE in 2026,” reads the top of an email sent Jan. 7 from state Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain.
Democrats have announced bids for just two of the seven elected constitutional offices on the ballot this November: governor and state superintendent of education. The party is still talking with potential candidates, Spain told the SC Daily Gazette.
In her email, she pointed to that week’s slim margin of victory for Republican Greg Ford in a special election for a state House seat representing Dorchester County. He defeated Democrat Sonja Ogletree Satani by just 21 votes, as determined by an automatic recount.
Ogletree Satani “ran one heck of a race,” Spain wrote, noting that President Donald Trump won the district by over 6 percentage points in 2024. (Statewide, he won by 18 points.) “The lesson to all of us is that we can compete and win if we run!”
The email was successful, Spain told the Gazette on Wednesday.
In one week, more than a hundred people filled out the candidate interest form attached to that email. “Dozens” of them checked a box showing interest in seeking a statewide office, according to Jon Burton, a party spokesperson.


Upcoming deadlines
To compete in the June 9 party primaries, candidates must file the forms and pay the required fees between March 16 and March 30.
The fee is 1% of the job’s salary over the entire term.
For constitutional offices, that ranges from $4,243 for gubernatorial candidates to $8,560 to run for state superintendent.


It’s been 32 years since a Democrat competed for every statewide elected office in the South Carolina constitution. And back in 1994, there were two additional offices on the ballot.
The party has come close to having a candidate for every office since.
In 2006, a Democrat ran for every statewide office except attorney general. Then-Attorney General Henry McMaster ran unopposed for re-election that year.
In 2002, the only constitutional office without a Democrat running was adjutant general, the leader of the state’s military department. Maj. Gen. Stan Spears ran unopposed that year. He easily defeated a Democrat in 2006 for his fourth and final term before retiring. In 2014, voters approved taking that office off the ballot and making it a governor-appointed position.
Also in 2014, McMaster was the last lieutenant governor elected separately, as per a change voters approved two years earlier.
Asked about Spain’s email, state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick said Democrats’ problem “isn’t a lack of candidates.
“It’s that voters simply aren’t buying what they’re selling,” he said in a statement to the SC Daily Gazette.
Two races with both parties on the ballot
A Democrat last won a statewide office in 2006, when Jim Rex was elected state superintendent of education by fewer than 500 votes.
This year, two Democrats, Lisa Ellis and Sylvia Wright, are running for the job overseeing the state agency for K-12 public schools. Whoever wins the June 9 Democratic primary will likely face Superintendent Ellen Weaver, who’s running for her second term. So far, no Republican has announced a challenge.
In 2022, the race for superintendent was the most crowded: Six Republicans and three Democrats ran to replace outgoing Superintendent Molly Spearman.
Ellis was a first-time candidate then. The 25-year veteran teacher of Richland 2 high schools, who in 2018 founded the online teachers’ group SC for Ed, won a three-way primary outright without needing a runoff, then lost to Weaver by 16 percentage points. In 2023, SC for Ed announced an indefinite pause to its lobbying efforts, four years after organizing a teachers’ rally at the Statehouse attended by an estimated 10,000 people.
Wright, who has two decades of classroom and administrative experience, resigned from her job last fall as a district coordinator for Dorchester 4 in order to campaign full-time.
Among all the statewide races on the ballot this year, the wide-open governor’s race has by far gotten the most attention.
It’s been 16 years since no incumbent ran for governor. Five Republicans and two Democrats have announced bids to replace Gov. Henry McMaster, who first ascended to the job nine years ago when then-Gov. Nikki Haley joined President Donald Trump’s first administration. So, when voters first elected McMaster to the job in 2018, he’d already been governor almost two years.
In South Carolina, governors are limited to two elected terms. Other constitutional offices have no term limitations.
Two other offices are wide open
Two other statewide offices that have gotten little attention are wide open for the first time in over two decades.
Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers is not seeking a sixth full term. It’s been 16 years since a Democrat challenged him.
Voters first elected Weathers in 2006, two years after Gov. Mark Sanford appointed the Orangeburg County dairy farmer to the job following the indictment of Charlie Sharpe, who was eventually sentenced to two years in prison for taking a bribe to protect a cockfighting ring.
Weathers endorsed Republican Fred West to replace him, The State newspaper reported last March. West retired in 2023 after 24 years as an executive at the poultry processing company Amick Farms and his since become director of market development at the Department of Agriculture.
So far, West is the only candidate to announce a bid to lead the agency with duties that include promoting one of the state’s top industries, keeping the food supply safe, and — since 2024 — handling all inspections of places that sell food, such as restaurants and cafeterias.
The job of comptroller general is open for the first time in 28 years, when then-Sen. Jim Landers replaced the retiring Earle Morris Jr.
That 1998 election was also the last time a Democrat won the post as the state’s chief accountant. In 2002, Republican Richard Eckstrom ousted Landers and kept the job for 21 years. Eckstrom resigned in 2023 amid mounting pressure over his office’s $3.5 billion accounting error. (The error was strictly on paper. No money went missing. The office mistakenly double-counted some agencies’ revenue.)
McMaster made history in appointing his budget director, Brian Gaines, who by agreeing to run the office temporarily became South Carolina’s first Black constitutional officer since Reconstruction. Gaines said at the time he had no interest in running in 2026.
One Republican has announced a bid: Mike Burkhold, a Charleston County businessman who founded Equiscript, a health care technology company.
For two other statewide offices, Republicans are seeking re-election without any announced competition.
Secretary of State Mark Hammond, first elected in 2002, is seeking a seventh term leading the office that registers and helps regulate businesses and charities operating in South Carolina. (Unlike in other states, South Carolina’s secretary of state plays no role at all in overseeing elections.)
Treasurer Curtis Loftis, first elected in 2010, also came under fire recently for accounting problems. Senate investigations into the comptroller general’s office led to discovery of a $1.8 billion error in the treasurer’s office — also a blunder on paper that didn’t affect state revenues or the Legislature’s budgeting process. An outside accounting firm found that all but $200 million never existed. But senators were incensed, voting 33 to 8 last April to remove him. The House, however, never took up the case.
Amid a grilling from senators, Loftis initially pledged that he would not seek re-election in 2026. But he later reversed course and announced he’s seeking a fifth term. He maintains that he did nothing wrong.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Sahra Sharif, a mother of 16 and owner of an apparel shop at Madina Mall in Minneapolis, said her new routine is to open at 3 p.m. and stay open for about four hours, hoping to cover the month’s rent. 
Due to a fear of immigration agents, “The entire shopping mall is completely empty because people rarely come out of their homes,” she said. 
With the food, utility, and rent for both the shop and her flat looming, Sahra picked up a side job caring for a person with a disability. The job also went unpaid, however, after the state’s latest anti-fraud effort delayed payment to home care agencies.  
“I was hoping to get a few checks already, but I haven’t gotten even one yet,” she said.
She said she started her business 10 years ago and never thought she would go back to being an employee.
This is life for many Minnesota immigrants these days in President Donald Trump’s America. 
Since the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement stepped up raids and random stops last month, three of Sharif’s family members have been arrested. Her son was deported to Somalia; a cousin is a permanent resident who was released; and the other is still in custody, she said.  
“In my family, people rarely go outside unless it’s absolutely necessary; and if anyone does, it is considered a reckless thing to do,” she said.
Imam Yusuf Abdulle, executive director of the Islamic Association of North America, said fear of ICE has changed many immigrants’ daily routines.
Social gatherings have vanished, parents advise their young adult children to stay home, and short walks and unnecessary trips have become a thing of the past.

“The Somali community heavily depends on each other’s mutual support, so if people remain indoors, that will impact everyone,” Abdulle said. “That’s why we encourage people to come together and support each other.”
Moreover, most Somali Minnesotans are U.S. citizens, so Abdulle and other community leaders are encouraging people to resume their normal routines.
But because ICE’s approach seems to be “detain first, identify later,” no one wants to take a risk, even U.S. citizens.  
For many young Somali Americans, the stress caused by ICE has led to confusion and doubt about why they and their family are being stopped, questioned and at times detained.  
“Some of them worry if their parents will return home,” Abdulle said.
Many young people born and raised in the U.S. are forced to carry their passports, while white teens do not. The implicit racism takes a toll on them, Abdulle said.
Despite the confusion and fear, the immigrant community is finding strength by helping each other through ride-sharing, picking up groceries, paying rent, and running errands for those who lost their jobs due to fear of being detained, are afraid to go out or don’t have proper documentation. 
For the newly isolated, however, their struggles are unseen. Abdulle is urging them to contact their nearest mosque or community center for help.
‘Workers don’t come to work anymore’ 
The Latino community is also struggling under the federal glare, especially because their rate of citizenship is far lower. 
Jerardo Rivera, an owner of a painting company, said fear has rippled through the community. 
“Workers don’t come to work anymore,” he said. After ICE repeatedly showed up at construction and other job sites, many in his community are in hiding due to fear of being arrested and thrown out of the country overnight. 
“Everyone in my family is a U.S. citizen, but we are still scared. Because if ICE is killing a white U.S. citizen, do you think an immigrant would stand a chance?” he asked, referring to the recent killing of Renee Good by federal officer Jonathan Ross.
Rivera said he worries about his family and community given ICE’s near limitless power to detain and deport. 
A truck driver watches a city suffer under federal weight
Mohamed Ali, a truck driver, said he is not always in the cities, but in the past month or so, he was shocked by how Minneapolis went from a vibrant city with businesses, cafes and social gatherings to a place that now looks unfamiliar. 
“I went to Karmel Mall to get a haircut at 3 p.m., the busiest time in the mall, but I couldn’t find a single barbershop open,” he said.
Mohamud Abdi, a Minneapolis resident, said that the new community norm is to stay hidden because even those with documents are reluctant to interact with ICE for fear of something going terribly wrong. 
“They call it law enforcement, but there is nothing lawful about the things that they are enforcing,” Abdi said.
Abdi compared the current situation to the administration of former President Barack Obama, which deported 3 million people from the U.S., more than any other president in American history, but as Abdi noted, Obama did so without hurting so many innocent people or putting a city like Minneapolis under siege.
Voting for Trump — and regretting it
Sharif, the Madina Mall shop owner who fears she may have to return to the bad old days of having a boss, gave out an exasperated sigh. 
“Would you believe if I told you I voted for this man?” she said, referring to Trump.
Sharif is not politically active, but in 2024, some campaigners came to her shop and told her that Trump would be good for business and against the LGBTQ agenda. 
“I was immediately hooked,” she said. She voted Republican for the first time.
Now, chagrined, she said, “I never thought the man I put in office would come for my family, make me financially struggle and cause me so much fear that I carry my passport when I go to the bathroom,” she said, pointing at the mall’s bathrooms.
“I feel as though the weapon I built is coming to kill me and my people,” she said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NN251208_223-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

Lawyers for Planned Parenthood and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office are dissecting dozens of Missouri’s Targeted Regulation of Abortion, or TRAP laws, as a judge decides which, if any, should remain in place. The safety of abortion is at the heart of the debate.
As the trial enters its second week on Tuesday in Jackson County, the state is trying to make the case that the potential for complications justifies strict regulations on abortion providers. 
“The risks associated with abortion don’t just exist in the abstract,” said Assistant Solicitor General Alexandria Overcash. “Real women, Missouri women have suffered.”
Experts called by Planned Parenthood say that’s not the case. Abortion, they said, presents less risk than many medical procedures, including child birth.
“But there’s nothing like sitting in your patient’s pool of blood as she’s bleeding out four liters of blood to realize that a healthy term pregnancy has a whole hell of a lot of risk,” Dr. Jennifer Smith, an OB-GYN in St. Louis, testified Friday.
Jennifer Smith, an OBGYN, speaks about medical challenges without legal abortions in Missouri in 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2024 overturning the state’s abortion ban and enacting protections for reproductive health care. Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri quickly filed a lawsuit seeking to repeal abortion regulations it argues now violate the new constitutional amendment. The 10-day trial in the case began last week.
Among the laws being challenged is a requirement that only doctors provide abortions, a ban on prescribing medication abortion through telehealth, facility licensing requirements, admitting privileges and a written transfer agreement at a nearby hospital and a state-approved complication plan for medication abortions. 
These regulations eventually halted nearly all access to abortion in Missouri as more and more women seeking to terminate a pregnancy sought care in Illinois and Kansas. By the time Missouri’s abortion ban went into effect in 2022, thousands of Missourians were already leaving the state each year to end their pregnancies. 
The Missouri Attorney General’s Office is seeking to access records for patients who traveled to Planned Parenthood clinics in Illinois and Kansas for abortions and experienced a complication.
In December, the state tried to impose sanctions to force Planned Parenthood to turn over these patient complication reports. Planned Parenthood refused, saying the records would violate patient privacy. A separate judge intervened, ordering the clinics to only turn over a summary chart outlining the complications. The state is appealing this decision.
Over the past decade, nearly 29,000 Missourians had abortions at Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Kansas, Overland Park, and Pittsburg, Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, testified Tuesday. Of 28,764 who had abortions between 2015 and 2024, 248 had complications as defined by the state, bringing the complication rate to .86%, according to data later provided by Planned Parenthood to The Independent.  
“We are significantly better when it comes to complication rates than the national average,” Wales said, noting that the complication rate for Missouri women at each of the three clinics is regularly under 1% and has been for the past decade. 
Deputy Solicitor General Peter Donohue asked if some patients had to have follow-up procedures at local hospitals, and if Planned Parenthood Great Plains has advised patients to go to the ER? 
Yes, Wales said, but they’ve never had to transport a patient from a clinic to a hospital.
Abortion trial details how laws drove providers from Missouri Planned Parenthood clinics

Under state law, Planned Parenthood must report any abortion complications to the health department. But how the health department and how Planned Parenthood defines complications differs.  
In 2022, the most recent year Department of Health and Senior Services data is available, 115 complications were reported. Fifty-five involved procedural abortions, which happen in-clinic, and 60 were the result of medication abortions.
Gillian Wilcox, litigation director for the ACLU of Missouri, said state attorneys were misrepresenting the safety of abortions and said the practice doesn’t necessitate special regulations. 
“All medical care carries risk of complications. And when you look at it in isolation, you don’t get a full picture,” Wilcox said in an interview. “Because when you get the full picture it is that they are providing thousands of abortions. And the complication rate actually percentage-wise is very low.” 
Complications associated with abortion included hemorrhaging, fever, uterine perforation, pregnancy tissue left in the uterus, cervical lacerations, incomplete abortion and failed abortion. 
The latter, which is a circumstance where the abortion doesn’t work and the pregnancy continues, is not generally considered a complication, but rather a possible outcome, Dr. Daniel Grossman, director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health based at the University of California-San Francisco, testified Tuesday.
State-mandated complication reporting requirements “create the impression that abortion is riskier than it really is,” said Grossman, who is a liaison to Planned Parenthood’s National Medical Committee.
Missouri is one of 27 states that requires providers to submit complication reports.
Grossman pointed to a section on the complication report marked “death.”
Bleeding and cramping are expected side effects of both medication and procedural abortions. Hemorrhaging and infection are among the rare complications. 
Since mifepristone was approved for use in medication abortions 28 years ago, 32 deaths have been associated with its use, according to the Federal Drug Administration. The FDA evaluated data from 5.9 million women who took mifepristone between 2000 and 2022. Of the three dozen deaths, 11 were the result of sepsis, 20 were homicides and two were suicides.
Ingrid Skop, an OB-GYN in Texas and a board member at the anti-abortion Charlotte Lozier Institute, was called to testify Friday by the Attorney General’s Office. She has treated dozens of women for abortion complications, Skop said, and she believes national data is lacking.
“It appears safer than it actually is,” she said.
That’s because abortion clinics are not generally mandated to report complications, Skop said. 
Complications can happen after women leave clinics, and women presenting in hospital emergency rooms do not always tell doctors about their abortions. Skop said abortion providers do little follow up, unlike a routine doctor that has built a relationship with their patients. 
“The assumption seems to be no news is good news,” she said of abortion providers who may not hear from patients after procedural or medication abortions.
On cross examination, a plaintiff’s attorney noted that Skop has never performed abortions and disagrees with mainstream medical associations like the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists. Skop was also questioned about the fact that several of her articles were retracted for methodology issues from peer-reviewed journals, though she maintained those were politically motivated moves.

On Thursday, Overcash questioned Margot Riphagan, Planned Parenthood Great Rivers president and CEO, extensively about complications.
Overcash entered into evidence a spreadsheet summarizing complications reported among the nearly 24,000 Missourians who traveled to Planned Parenthood’s clinic in Fairview Heights for abortions in the last decade. Planned Parenthood later told The Independent there were 418 complications among 24,350 Missourians at the clinic between 2015 and 2024, or a 1.72% complication rate as defined by the state.
Overcash then highlighted nine instances of ectopic pregnancies, a dangerous condition in which a fertilized egg grows outside the uterus that, if left untreated, can lead to death. 
Doctors testifying on behalf of Planned Parenthood said taking mifepristone doesn’t increase a patient’s risk of dying from an ectopic pregnancy. The symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, including abdominal pain, would disqualify someone from being able to be prescribed medication abortion without first seeing a doctor in-person.
Two people over three decades have died from ruptured ectopic pregnancies after taking mifepristone, according to the FDA. The FDA reported an additional 95 cases of mifepristone taken during an ectopic pregnancy. The patients were hospitalized in a majority of those cases. 
Overcash also pointed to several cases documenting failed or incomplete abortions in which the patient later chose to stay pregnant. 
“So once again, a woman decided to continue her pregnancy?” she asked.
“It’s critical that women make decisions about their own bodies, yes” Riphagan responded.
Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, who was appointed to the job in September, made her first appearance at the trial Thursday afternoon. 
“There are real concerns about the safety for women if these treatments are not medically supervised in the appropriate way,” she told The Independent. 
Asked whether the state viewed abortion as unsafe Hanaway said: “Remember, we all have a job, which is to represent the state. And these are the laws that were adopted by the state, and we’re defending them.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0807-1024x596.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

A Highway Patrol trooper’s sexual abuse of a fellow officer at a work conference. A lawsuit between prominent St. Louis attorneys.
All of these cases were removed from Missouri’s public court database. Searching for them online, it appeared as if they never existed.
Cases assigned a high enough “security level” can’t be viewed by the public through Missouri’s online courts database or in person at courthouses. Judges who assign a security level of five, for example, have needed virtually no justification to make these cases disappear.
“Sometimes, the parties might request security level five as part of a settlement, or something like that,” said Dan Curry, an attorney for the Missouri Press Association. “Because one or both, plaintiff and the defendant, don’t want to have whatever happened in the court be easily found.”
Curry said unless the news media or members of the public are following a security level five case, it’s a “whole lot harder” to see what’s happening.
A case can also be removed for days before trial to prevent jurors from accessing documents. While people involved with the cases can still get access, a lack of clarity surrounding how the system works leads to reports of people missing hearings and wrongly thinking charges were dropped.
When cases are sealed at a certain security level, members of the public and journalists can’t even verify their existence. Some unsealed examples identified by the Columbia Missourian contain information pertaining to public servants and officials. The mere existence of these cases — and any related allegations — was previously hidden.
This can conflict with the idea of open courts that Curry said is important to democracy.
“Especially if you read through some of the case law in Missouri and what’s in the constitution about open courts and open records, then I think (lawyers) would know … not only is it a good idea for a democracy, but also legally in Missouri, these things should be open as a default setting,” he said.
 What are security levels?

Missouri court cases are given a security level ranging from one to nine. A level one means the case or document is fully open to the public, whereas a level nine is reserved for cases made confidential after expungement.
The meaning of each security level is specified on The Missouri Bar’s website. Cases might be confidential because they involve juvenile matters. Or maybe they were entered in error. Many levels have a list of three possible scenarios they could be used for.
Security level five is an exception. The only explanation written for level five is “cases under court order.”
When a case is assigned a security level of five, it disappears completely from Missouri’s public court database. That includes information such as the name of the case, scheduling for future hearings and the final judgment.
In an order published Dec. 16, the Supreme Court of Missouri outlined new requirements for sealing cases set to take effect July 1. The standards state sealing records should “overcome a presumption that judicial records should be open for public inspection.”
Curry outlined his thoughts on the order in a column for the Missouri Press Association. He wrote certain changes could make it easier to access records by specifying rules that were previously open-ended.
However, one rule change may make access harder. The order lists 19 types of records that are automatically confidential. Curry wrote the first 18 items are specific and consistent with state law, but the last is a “catch-all” that appears to not require judges to find compelling justification for closure.
The specific wording of record type 19 is: “Any other record sealed, expunged, or closed by statute, Supreme Court rule, or order of a court of record.”
“The worry is this — in some ways the new rules make it easier for a court to close files than before,” Curry wrote. “If a judge desires to make case records confidential, the rules place no conditions or constraints on that decision. This could lead to case files continuing to disappear.”
In a news release, court officials said “over the coming months, the Court plans to provide additional information to help ensure consistent and successful implementation of the rule revisions.”
Under the current rules, if one tries to search using a level five case’s number online, a red error pops up reading, “Your query returned no matches to be viewed at this site. Please try another search or contact the court directly.”
Contacting the court directly yields similar results. On a phone call attempting to get information and documents, court staff repeatedly told Columbia Missourian reporters they couldn’t know anything as the cases were under security level five.
One employee said to a reporter, “I’m not even sure how you got the case number.”
Cases under security level five are hidden unless a judge unseals them. Sometimes, this happens as a situation draws media attention.
One example involved a 2023 lawsuit between political candidates. Former state Rep. Justin Hicks sued Max Calfo, who was running for his seat, for publishing images from a 2010 case in which Hicks was accused of grabbing a woman by the neck and choking her.
Judge Christopher McDonough sealed the politician’s lawsuit at a security level of five, according to court documents. The judge’s order contained the reasoning that “permitting public access to this cause would invariably reveal the existence of the confidential records.”
The case was later unsealed after garnering significant media attention.
Years ago, one of Curry’s clients was offered money in a settlement agreement. A condition of the agreement was raising the security level. Curry said especially if someone has hospital bills, they can be incentivized to accept conditions like raising the security level despite being proponents for open courts.
“If it’s a big enough money, a big enough amount of money for the plaintiffs, for the victim or the injured party, you know, maybe they need that money for medical care,” he said. “Maybe they need that money for housing. There’s real life consequences.”
 Upcoming jury trials

Judges sometimes raise the security level on cases shortly before a jury trial is scheduled. The reasoning is often that if public, jurors could look up information before the trial.
One example from Boone County involves a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper found guilty of sexually abusing a police officer and preventing her from leaving a hotel room during a work conference.
According to the Missouri courts database, this case was put under a security level of three for 10 days around the time of the trial.
While different from level five, William Hux, court administrator for Missouri’s 13th judicial circuit, wrote in an email level three also prevents the public from viewing cases. Involved parties retain access, he wrote.
People involved with cases can still be negatively impacted by a lack of clarity around the security level process. Finding specific information can be difficult when the mere existence of cases disappears from public searches online.
Amanda Mendez, editor-in-chief of the Howell County News in rural, southern Missouri, said she’s had several community members reach out after cases disappeared from the public courts database.
One woman told Mendez she missed her divorce hearing because her case’s security level was upgraded. The woman, Mendez said, was unable to view her case online and didn’t know how to find information on scheduling.
In another instance, Mendez said the family of a victim of child sex abuse was spun into panic, thinking charges were suddenly dropped.
As for cases disappearing before trial, Doug Thomson was previously a trial judge in Nodaway County, which has roughly 12% the population of Boone County. He said jurors accessing cases or even driving to crime scenes is an elevated concern in rural counties.
Much of that is due to the fact rural counties simply have fewer cases, so jurors are either told or can figure out the specific cases they’re being summoned for ahead of time.
“You simply have to understand that if we’ve got a jury trial coming up, and it’s a small county, it’s kind of a big deal,” Thomson said.
When jurors looked up cases ahead of time, Thomson said they were questioned by the court during the selection process to decide if they should be allowed to stay in the jury.
Thomson sits on the Missouri Press-Bar Commission, a group intended to “foster better communications between the media and the bench and bar,” according to its website. He said through that work, the disappearing cases were recently brought to his attention.
“All of a sudden, there’s just simply nothing there,” Thomson said. “But there is a reason sometimes, you know, at least in my experience in a small county.”
In the Dec. 16 order, the Missouri Supreme Court updated rules to say future cases will not be restricted ahead of jury trials without a “court order setting forth specific written findings supporting a compelling justification to restrict access.”
 Inconsistent labeling

Identifying what security level a case was set at can be difficult due to inconsistent documentation. In the example of the former Highway Patrol trooper, Missouri’s public court database lists in plain text the case would be at security level three and on what specific days.
Finding the security level of the politician’s lawsuit is a little harder. It’s not written anywhere on the case’s online profile. Instead, the case level is listed in the judge’s order to seal, which ends with, “This Cause is to remain under seal, at level five.”
Those are both situations in which the security level could be identified by the public after the case was unsealed. Many times, it can’t.
In a suspected security level five or three case from St. Charles County involving a murder, no level was listed online or in any available documents. Columbia Missourian reporters got access to both the motion to increase the security level and the judge’s order granting it.
However, neither document mentioned the specific level — just that it was raised. The court employee who provided the documents wrote in an email there was no way to determine the level.
A similar situation exists in a 2022 lawsuit against prominent St. Louis attorney Jerome Schlichter.
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, all traces of the lawsuit were completely removed from the Missouri public courts database. Even so, no documents related to the sealing or unsealing are linked online, such as was the case with the politician’s lawsuit.
Paper copies of the motion to seal, order to seal and order to unseal received from the Civil Courts Building in St. Louis once again do not list the specific security level, only that it was raised and dropped back down.
Because of the freedom judges have to assign these levels, Curry said their use can vary greatly court-to-court. Some judges do not seal cases ahead of upcoming jury trials, like Thomson did.
Whether the newly revised court rules will make a significant difference in the sealing of records won’t be known until they go into effect in July and could depend on what additional guidance is provided.
“Throughout the extensive analysis we have undertaken, our ultimate goal has been to clarify the nature of confidential information and to simplify the redaction process,” Chief Justice W. Brent Powell said in a news release. “We believe today’s order will result in better access to public court records while protecting any truly confidential information they may contain.”
Under the current use of the guidelines, sometimes judges ordered security levels to drop after attracting media attention. Sometimes, the cases unsealed after a trial concluded. And in some cases, they still remain closed to the public.
“Judges are such a wide array of personalities and perspectives and thoughts on the matter,” Curry said. “I’m sure there’ll be some judges who would say, ‘Hey, if this gets this case resolved and the parties are all agreement, then no skin off my back to give you guys what you want.’”

Obstructing the commemoration or MLK Day is just one more step in mitigating, minimizing or outright undoing the place and role of Black Americans.
Targeting and removing diversity, equity and inclusion programs and initiatives in both the public and private sectors has been a high priority during the second term of the Trump administration.
Trump’s most recent declaration is that the Civil Rights Act hurt white people, resulting in “white people being treated very badly.” What will be next?
Will there be ongoing efforts to bury, erase and recast all of the Black experience — the inhumane and inequitable treatment across generations, as well as the contributions to this country despite it?
Is the desire to bury everything about Black people in a time capsule, never to be found.
As we pause to commemorate the life and work of Martin Luther King Jr., we should take notice of the stark and diabolical efforts to undue everything he worked and paid the ultimate price for: equal treatment, access and opportunities, not only for Blacks but poor whites and all the down-trodden among us.
Clearly, the work is not done.
There are concerted efforts in every aspect of American life to undue the progress made so far and stop the march toward equality.
Martin Luther King Jr. believed in America’s promise — the ideals, principles and laws on which this country was founded and promoted. He mobilized others and appealed to elected officials and policymakers at every level of government to ensure that laws, rights and privileges of the land applied equally to all citizens, irrespective of skin color, gender or station in life.
That was his dream. His life’s work. His ultimate sacrifice.
When remembering King the famous “I Have a Dream” speech, which he delivered during the march on Washington, D.C. in 1963, is often referenced.
But the fire that burned within King’s soul, that led him to dedicate his life toward eradicating social evil and injustice, started long before — nearly 20 years earlier when he traveled to Dublin, Georgia as a senior in high school to deliver “The Negro and the Constitution” in an oratory contest.
Perhaps, King’s dream was just a flicker back then. But as you follow King’s life through college and the seminary, you see that flicker grows into a flame. The more he saw and heard, the more he could not turn a blind eye or a deaf ear. He set out on a life-long journey to eradicate human injustice.
What issues or conditions tug at your heart and soul deeply enough to spend time to change them, make things better for the disenfranchised among us?
It is never too early or too late to do something.
America needs dreamers today like Martin Luther King, Jr. to fix some of its greatest social, racial challenges and inequities.
Many we thought were behind us, only to realize the resurgence of many anew.
While besieged by the current hyperbolic and unpredictable political environment perpetuated by the Trump administration and his state and local cohorts, we could easily lose sight of the ground we have lost in recent years in the quest for equality and equal opportunity — many of the things King fought and died for.
Schools across America are still segregated, some more than ever.
Voting rights continue to be challenged in many states, making it more difficult for Blacks and other minorities to exercise their right to vote.
There is still discrimination occurring in the job market, access to housing, and access to higher education whether it involves admission to colleges, universities of technical vocational institutions.
Discrimination is still rampant in the justice system when it comes to racial profiling, traffic stops, or issuing the same punishments for the same crime. There are injustices even among how schools discipline Black children and white children for the same misconduct.
The pronouncement, executive orders and other actions of the Trump administration have only fueled racial inequity and discord, bringing it front and center in almost every aspect of our daily lives.
Is this your dream for America?
Doing something, continuing to root out inequality and injustice where we encounter it, is the greatest tribute we can pay to Martin Luther King Jr.
When King took up the fight to realize America’s promise for all of her citizens, he knew  change would not come overnight.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Democratic candidates for Michigan secretary of state clashed at a Sunday night forum that included Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist apologizing for past comments on the war in Gaza, as rivals questioned his judgment and focus after he ended his gubernatorial campaign to enter the race.
Gilchrist announced last week that he would be suspending his campaign for governor, saying in a video that “the time for me to serve in that role may come, but now is not that time.”
Former Michigan Lottery Commissioner Suzanna Shkreli took aim at Gilchrist during Wednesday night’s candidate forum, saying the next secretary of state will need to be “laser focused” on elections.
“This office is too important to be treated as a consolation prize or a steppingstone for anybody,” Shkreli said. “I’ve known the lieutenant governor for the past seven years. Having worked with him, we really can’t risk this office landing in the hands of somebody that’s going to use it to elevate their political future. There’s just too much on the line.”
But Gilchrist said he has experience making it easier to access government services, pointing to an automatic criminal record expungement program he championed and an app that allows Detroit residents to report issues to the city from their phone.
“Now more than ever, we need that kind of problem-solving approach as the energy of the secretary of state’s office,” Gilchrist said. “To be efficient, to be responsive and to be a 21st Century office that’s going to protect and strengthen democratic process from the dangers and threats, both rhetorically, legally and physically, of the Trump administration.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie dropped out of the race to be the Democratic nominee for secretary of state after Gilchrist announced his campaign, saying that for the sake of party unity, he was endorsing the lieutenant governor.
That leaves Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum as the only candidate with experience administering elections, and she was quick to note voters have gone to the polls 42 times since she took office.
“I run tough elections, and I win tough elections,” Byrum said.
Former state Sen. Adam Hollier, a paratrooper who ended his campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives to run for secretary of state, said threats to the election process motivated him to seek the office.
“I jump out of perfectly good airplanes and run into burning buildings as a volunteer firefighter,” Hollier said. “I have always opted into an opportunity to serve where this stuff is happening the most. And as everyone here recognizes, secretary of state is a space where, that’s where the fight is.”
Democrats will use an April 19 endorsement convention in Detroit to rally support around one candidate before officially selecting a nominee in the fall.
Gilchrist apologizes for Gaza comments
Gilchrist started the forum, which was hosted by the Michigan Democratic Party’s Jewish Caucus, by apologizing for saying in the fall that the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was committing a genocide of Palestinian people and that he would not accept campaign contributions from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, the largest pro-Israel lobbying group in the United States.
“I heard you loud and clear that the nature of some of my comments and campaign rhetoric has been taken as antisemitic. I want to apologize for that,” Gilchrist said.
Gilchrist said he has met with the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee.
“I firmly stand against antisemitism, and I vow to continue an open dialogue with this community,” Gilchrist said. “I also believe in my heart that there is a place in the Democratic Party for the entire spectrum of the Jewish people and Jewish community, and I’ll make sure that that door remains wide open to them.”
Michigan has both the largest Arab American community and one of the largest Jewish populations in the country.
Divisions within the Democratic Party over the war in Gaza erupted during the 2024 election, and Gilchrist’s comments last fall were met with raucous applause from the audience members in Dearborn.
Shkreli, without naming Gilchrist, said statewide leaders must consider the impact of their words.
“I think that elected officials need to be very mindful about, you know, what they say,” Shkreli said. “And in times of antisemitism and a rise in what we’ve seen, strong leadership is needed so people feel supported and know that the communities have their back.”

Byrum also stopped short of naming Gilchrist, but said it is important for Democrats to have a ticket that can unite the party.
“I think it’s the responsibility of the secretary of state, and any statewide office holder, to push back against hate, and to continue to be supportive of all constituencies and unite the party,” Byrum said. “You will never have to worry about my words or actions being used as a reason for certain constituencies not to feel loved and welcomed in the Michigan Democratic Party.”
Hollier said “the Black community and the Jewish community have always stood together, because no one else would stand with us.”
“That’s what you should expect from me as your secretary of state,” Hollier said. “You should expect not an ally, not a friend, but somebody who understands that we share in their struggle, that we rise together, that we are fighting this fight together, because we always have been.”
Preparing for election challenges
Byrum said the possibility of attempts to overturn the results of upcoming elections is one reason why the next secretary of state should have experience walking the line between being elected politically but serving in a largely nonpartisan way as an election administrator.
“We need to make sure that we are mitigating any risk,” Byrum said. “One of the ways we can mitigate risk is by having an election official as the Secretary of State.”
She said other candidates, who may not be as familiar with election processes, could be more prone to saying something in error that could have legal consequences down the road.
“Anything a candidate for Secretary of State says today or on the campaign trail can very well show up in pleadings claiming that the elections were rigged,” Byrum said. “If someone misstates an election process, that can be used in court later against them.”
Gilchrist said the Trump administration is leading “the creative destruction of our democracy” and said having “robust” legal teams to challenge the administration in court is “one of the most aggressive and important functions” that the next secretary of state will need to prioritize.
Shkreli said the state must “have a posture of legal preparedness,” including building a “litigation playbook.”

“We’ve got to work with relevant stakeholders, such as the attorney general and the Bureau of Elections, to ensure that we have the best litigation strategy possible to fight any unconstitutional attacks on our electoral process,” Shkreli said.
Hollier said reducing ambiguity in election law could help eliminate some challenges.
“There are too many spaces for people to fight over the details that are not being adequately enforced, and, most importantly, too many spaces for people to make mistakes,” Hollier said.
Gilchrist said state and local leaders are already running tabletop exercises to predict possible lines of attack ahead of the 2026 midterms.
“That preparation work is already underway for this election, and we’re going to have to start it almost immediately after this election in preparation for the elections that are going to happen in 2027 and 2028 across Michigan,” Gilchrist said.
Digital IDs, data privacy and other priorities
Overseeing elections is only half of the secretary of state’s job, with branch offices throughout the state handling things like vehicle registrations and state IDs also falling under their purview.
Hollier said the process of going to a Secretary of State office, only to find out you brought the wrong paperwork to prove your identity, can be frustrating.
That’s why he said the Department of State should be able to collaborate with other departments, like the Department of Health and Human Services, to retrieve the documents they need.
“State employees want to be able to say yes and be as helpful as they possibly can, and too often, our systems do not allow them to do so,” Hollier said.

The proposal highlights the amount of personal data the state has about each resident.
Gilchrist said he would make it a priority to protect the privacy of that personal data “from big tech companies that are hungry to mine it and the Trump administration that is thirsty to surveil it.”
“The Trump administration has been suing state after state after state to try to get access to that information so they could use it to attack people, to weaponize it against communities, against minorities, to make them less safe, to feed it to ICE so they can go in with Gestapo tactics and threaten and kill people, as we’ve seen in other parts of this country,” Gilchrist said.
“I’m deeply concerned about that, but I’m also concerned about what the tech companies want to do with this information, to feed it into an AI model without your permission, to run it through a data center that we don’t want to see here in the state of Michigan,” Gilchrist continued.
Hollier said the Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations being carried out in states like Minnesota highlight the need for every resident to have access to a state ID.
“Especially at a time within a country where people can ask you for your papers, we have to make sure that every single Michigander has a valid ID,” Hollier said.
He said formerly incarcerated individuals can face challenges in obtaining a state ID with just their prison documents, but a pilot program with the Department of Corrections that he advocated for makes the process easier.
Shkreli said she wants to make it possible for Michigan drivers to add their licenses to digital wallets on iOS and Android devices.
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said when Apple announced the feature in 2021 that she wanted Michigan to be among the first states to enroll. So far, 20 states and Puerto Rico have some form of digital ID available. Michigan legislators introduced a bill in 2023 to allow digital state IDs, but it stalled in the Legislature.
Byrum said kiosks allowing some business to be conducted without ever stepping foot in a branch office should be expanded, noting that some areas of the state do not have Kroger or Meijer locations nearby, making it just as inconvenient to find a kiosk as it would be to go to the branch office.
Gilchrist said the secretary of state’s customer service role makes the branch offices throughout the state “the front door to people’s interactions with state government.”
“Too many times when people are interacting with state government, they’re doing so at a time when they need something, and they need it fast. It gets frustrating when it doesn’t happen, or it’s not easy, or it’s cumbersome,” Gilchrist said. “It’s imperative that we make sure that is not the experience people have. Because people who lose trust in government processes are ones who lose faith in democracy, and ones who check out from democratic processes and, ultimately, may end up less likely to vote.”

(Getty Images)I’ve been watching with considerable interest as hundreds of Broken Arrow residents fight against a plan that would rezone a parcel of agricultural land to make way for a proposed mosque and retail development in their community.
It’s not the project itself that’s captured my interest. It’s the fact that this is the second such high profile fight pitting developers against residents in just a few months.
Late last year, Edmond residents were fighting against a developer who wanted to build a Walmart on a piece of undeveloped land in the north part of the city. The Walmart developer plans to erect a neighborhood market on a busy two-lane road that already suffers from traffic congestion and flooding. The store would sit alarmingly close to an existing housing development and is not far from a major natural gas junction.
It was during that Edmond fight that I learned about Senate Bill 647, which would weaken a city’s ability to deny developments, neuter the input of residents and voters and empower developers to get their way regardless of whether their project is welcome or a good fit.
The Republican-led measure was one of those bills that flew under the radar during the 2025 session, but alarmingly cleared both legislative chambers. It would have made it to Gov. Kevin Stitt’s desk but for the fact that, thankfully, the House and the Senate could not agree on the final language.
Insultingly, the measure contains a clause that “decisions on land use application shall not be based solely upon the presence, numbers or magnitude of opposition or protests in the absence of objective and relevant facts.”
It seeks to deem municipal zoning decisions as a done deal unless the challenging party proves the ordinance lacks a substantial relation to public health, safety or general welfare or if a zoning decision “constitutes an unreasonable, arbitrary exercise of police power.”
And it would require planning commissions and governing boards to approve plats as long as they’re in compliance with a city’s subdivision regulations. Compliance with a city’s comprehensive development plan would not be required for approval under the measure.
Had this been law, the concerns of residents in both cities and of those elsewhere across the state fighting developers probably wouldn’t have mattered. The developers probably would have won the day.
Residents at the Broken Arrow City Council meeting last week expressed reasonable concerns about increased traffic congestion, and the impact of the development on storm water runoff and septic tanks if a 42,000-square-foot Islamic center and a 20,000-square-foot retail space and a parking lot were built.
The Tulsa World reported that last month much of the opposition initially “was voiced in anti-Islamic terms,” but in recent days those who opposed the development and city leaders have shifted the conversation to more practical issues.
Edmond residents, meanwhile, who live in the area told their planning and zoning commission and city council that even though the area is technically zoned commercial, they didn’t believe the acreage and infrastructure at the corner of Coltrane and Covell can support a 43,000-square-foot development on 9.7 acres.
And as someone who drives through that congested Edmond intersection, who has sat in 40-car traffic jams at the traffic light, and who has witnessed a semi-truck get stuck trying to make a turn onto a two-lane road, they’re probably right.
The problem is under the proposed law they’d have to prove that objectively. Their lived experiences wouldn’t count. And how does a resident objectively prove traffic congestion without a traffic counter or cooperation from a city?
And how can someone objectively prove that storm water won’t drain in an undeveloped flood plane without a parking lot there?
The city councils in both cities ultimately rejected the developers’ plans. In Edmond, Walmart’s developer is appealing. The Islamic Society of Tulsa, which is backing the mosque, is also expected to appeal.
Watching both fights play out, I’ve learned there is a lot of gray area when it comes to planning, zoning and platting. There is subjectivity to approving plats and developers’ plans. Local residents don’t pay attention to platting and zoning until the time comes to develop property.
Other times, designations no longer fit the land as communities evolve or grow or our environment or weather patterns change. Bureaucracy can be slow, and it takes time for things to catch up. And just because land is zoned or platted a certain way doesn’t mean every sort of business or development belongs there.
Until last session, lawmakers have been smart enough to realize that, and they’ve given municipalities broader discretion to act in the best interests of their residents and communities. 
To even consider passing a law that indicates city leaders are making decisions solely on the size of crowds or opposition is insulting not only to those officials, but also the voters who elect them. It also indicates that our legislators don’t understand how this works.
And it’s astounding that lawmakers are seemingly trying to strip their constituents’ rights at the expense of developers, who do have a lot of lobbying power at our Capitol.
Last I checked Republicans were supposed to champion local control and believed that residents generally know what’s best for their local communities.
I don’t know if we’ll see this bill — or a similar iteration — rise from the dead when lawmakers reconvene in February. But heaven help us all if we do. 
Because it will signal the death knell to citizen input in proposed developments impacting our families and the rise in power of developers. And it will harm everyone’s ability to work together to make their communities better.

Now a bipartisan group of Nebraska state senators wants to write into law that new members of the officially nonpartisan Legislature take a 20-question civics test — and publicly post the scores.
A passing grade would not be required, and individual answers would remain confidential. But the “raw scores” would be listed on the Legislature’s official website and also on the lawmaker’s official public biography.
Results would not affect the ability of any lawmaker to hold or continue to serve in a public role, according to Legislative Bill 1066, which should not “be construed to add to or alter the qualifications for office established in the Constitution of Nebraska.”

The introducer of LB 1066, State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha, said the effort was inspired by conservative and progressive constituents alike who have questioned the level of understanding and appreciation lawmakers have of U.S. government and responsibility to steward institutions that protect them.
With the country’s 250th birthday approaching, Fredrickson thought it was a good time for the civics test law. The measure is co-sponsored by lawmakers from diverse political backgrounds: State Sens. Stan Clouse of Kearney, Tanya Storer of Whitman and Paul Strommen of Sidney are Republicans; State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha is a progressive independent. Fredrickson is a Democrat.
“We have a very serious job,” Fredrickson said of all 49 state senators. “We create, we amend, and we repeal laws. So ensuring that folks who are in that position are continually educating themselves on our responsibility to uphold the Constitution … felt like an important step to take.”
Fredrickson said he has at times heard colleagues say things like, “Well the governor is the boss.” He recalled a couple of recent situations when the Legislature voted to approve a bill then, following the governor’s veto, certain senators flipped their votes and buried the proposal.

One such occasion came last year when, despite three consecutive bipartisan votes to lift a lifetime ban on public food aid for some Nebraskans with past drug felonies, the Legislature did an about face. The only change was Gov. Jim Pillen’s veto.
That prompted Fredrickson’s debate remark: “We were elected to lead, not to follow, and certainly not to flinch.”
He reminded colleagues that the Legislature is a separate and coequal branch of government to the executive and judicial arms. Such occasions gave rise to his thought: “How do we refresh our memories of the basic principles of how our country works and how our role as legislators should be exercised.”
Storer said she was encouraged to back a bill she believes should get universal support.
She said that while lawmakers come to the Legislature with different experiences, political backgrounds and home districts that represent rural, urban and suburban neighborhoods, a common ground should be a foundational grasp and appreciation of civics and the country’s road to democracy.
State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman. April 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
“It’s not a partisan issue. It’s an American issue,” she said. “We don’t know where we’re going if we don’t know where we’ve come from, right?”
Admittedly, not everybody loves test-taking, Storer said. She chuckled and said her palms even got a bit sweaty thinking about the process, though not to the point of doubting its value. She said public posting of raw scores might be a deterrent for some, but underscored that a failed grade won’t get anyone removed from office.
“If anything, it would prompt us all to be more intentional about studying civics and basic principles of government,” Storer said.
Fredrickson said he is unaware of any past efforts to require a civics test of Nebraska lawmakers, and believes the law would be a first for a state. A public hearing will be scheduled for LB 1066. 
Exam questions could be pulled from the civics portion of the test administered to naturalization candidates by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or an equivalent designed by the Nebraska Secretary of State or Nebraska Department of Education.
The Clerk of the Legislature would provide the test, within 90 days of a state senator taking office, that would include 20 randomly selected questions about U.S. history and civics. A lawmaker who doesn’t reach a passing score would be invited, not required, to attend a voluntary civic literacy seminar conducted by the Nebraska State Historical Society or Legislative Research Office.

For Nebraska students, answering questions from the civics portion of the federal citizenship and naturalization test is one of three options Nebraska school boards have to fulfill the state legal requirement aimed at ensuring students are prepared “to be competent and responsible citizens who engage in public debate knowledgeably and in a civil manner.” Other suggested options for students include a project on an important American figure or attendance at a public meeting. 



 How’s your grasp of civics?

Test your own civics knowledge with some questions from the U.S. citizenship and naturalization test. During that exam, a federal officer asks an applicant up to 10 questions from a list of 100. Six correct answers are needed to pass.

Martin Luther King Jr. delivers a speech to a crowd of approximately 7,000 people on May 17, 1967, at UC Berkeley’s Sproul Plaza in Berkeley, California. (Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s words from his “Beyond Vietnam” speech still ring true.
“When machines and computers, profit motives, and property rights are considered more important than people,” he warned, “the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.”
Those words, delivered in 1967, still summarize today’s political moment. Instead of putting the lives of workingAmericans first, our leaders in Congress and the WhiteHouse have prioritized advancing corporate profits and wealth concentration, slashing government programs meant to advance upward mobility, and deploying military forces across the country, increasing distrust and tension.
This historic regression corresponds with a recessionary environment for Black America in particular. That’s what my organization, the Joint Center, found in our report, “State of the Dream 2026: From Regression to Signs of a Black Recession.”
The economic landscape for Black Americans in 2026 is troubling, with unemployment rates signaling a potential recession. By December 2025, Black unemployment had reached 7.5 percent — a stark contrast to the national rate of 4.4 percent. This disparity highlights the persistent economic inequalities faced by Black communities, which have only been exacerbated by policy shifts that have weakened the labor market. The volatility in Black youth unemployment, which fluctuated dramatically in the latter months of 2025, underscores the precariousness of the situation.
The Trump administration’s executive orders have systematically dismantled structures aimed at promoting racial equality. By targeting programs such as Lyndon Johnson’s 1965 Equal Employment Opportunity executive order and defunding agencies like the Minority Business
Development Agency, the administration has shifted federal support away from disadvantaged businesses. As a result, Black-owned firms risk losing contracts and resources tied to federal programs, potentially resulting in job losses and reduced economic growth. These changes threaten billions in federal revenue for Black-owned firms and undermine efforts to move beyond racial inequality in the workforce.
The GOP’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in 2025, further entrenches inequality by providing tax cuts that disproportionately benefit high-income households and corporations — while simultaneously slashing investments in programs like Medicaid and SNAP, limiting access to essential services for low-income households. The technology sector, a critical component of the American economy, is also affected by this disregard for civil rights. Executive orders like “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” have stripped away protections that could advance inclusion in this rapidly growing field. As a result, the future of the American economy risks reinforcing past inequalities.
Dr. King’s call for strong, aggressive federal leadership in addressing racial inequality remains highly relevant. However, instead of eradicating structures of inequality, our current leadership is implementing policies that destroy government jobs and dismantle agencies responsible for preventing predatory economic practices. These choices undermine longstanding efforts to combat racial and economic disparities — and exemplify the regressive economic policies that coincide with rising Black unemployment.
As Dr. King stated, “we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.” But urgent action is required. Unless we act deliberately, economic and racial inequalities will become entrenched, resulting in generational loss. The core question is whether we will move beyond our nation’s history of racism, materialism, and militarism, and — as Dr. King urged — embrace “the fierce urgency now” to advance equity.

Phil Murphy signed the family leave expansion bill just days before he leaves office after two terms as governor. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill over the weekend that will expand family leave benefits to workers at smaller companies, just days before he leaves office after two terms.
Murphy, a Democrat, called the legislation “historic.” It allows workers at firms with as few as 15 employees to take job-protected paid family leave, down from 30 workers in the state’s prior family leave law.
“By amending the eligibility requirements for job-protected leave, we are ensuring newer employees and employees of small businesses are not excluded from the protections of the New Jersey Family Leave Act. Now, employees will not have to work as long before being able to utilize their leave with the assurance that they can return to their job once the leave concludes,” he said.
Murphy leaves office at noon on Tuesday when his successor, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D), becomes governor.
As new legislative session begins, some major bills go back to starting line

Existing New Jersey law permits workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid family leave to bond with new children or care for a sick or injured loved one. Workers on family leave can earn up to 85% of their weekly pay, to a cap of $1,119 in 2026.
To be eligible under current law, an employee must have worked at a given employer for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,000 hours in the preceding 12 months. The bill Murphy signed cuts those qualifications in half, requiring workers to be with their employer for at least six months and slashing the hours requirement to 500.
Bill sponsor Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) called the legislation “good for the workforce, good for babies and families, and good for our state as a whole.”
“By reducing the amount of time someone has to be on the job before becoming eligible for family leave, this legislation recognizes the realities of today’s workforce and makes sure more parents can care for and bond with their newborn without fearing they’ll lose their job. No one should be penalized for needing time to care, and this bill helps make sure the vast majority of workers never will,” he said.
Existing law bars employers from retaliating against workers for using family leave benefits. The legislation Murphy signed says workers are entitled to be restored to their previous position or one with equivalent pay, benefits, and seniority upon returning from family leave. It also explicitly allows workers to use family leave, temporary disability benefits, and earned sick leave in the order of their choosing.
Business groups had opposed the bill, warning that expanding family leave eligibility could make New Jersey small businesses less competitive.

Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Juliet Charron’s response to Rep. Josh Tanner and Sen. Brian Lenney, both Republicans, suggested the state had found few instances of fraud in 1,000 random audits in recent years.

Idaho’s $14 million in federal funds — approved by the Legislature in 2025 as an addition to the Idaho Child Care Program — hadn’t even been spent yet, because the state didn’t dole out the money to providers, Charron wrote in a Jan. 12 letter. But she told the lawmakers that the agency “shares your unwavering commitment to rooting out any potential fraud, waste, and abuse in all public programs (that the agency) administers.”
Idaho’s efforts come weeks after a conservative social media influencer made viral fraud allegations about Minnesota’s child care programs. The video’s claims — which spurred the Trump administration to crack down on child care funding — were largely misleading, according to a fact check by national news outlet The 19th. 
Fraud hasn’t recently been alleged in Idaho’s program, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Welfare said. And Idaho’s governor defended the state’s track record of running public assistance programs.

 After Idaho didn’t promise to pause spending, Idaho lawmaker mulls next steps

Idaho lawmakers ask state to freeze child care grants program

But the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare director’s letter didn’t explicitly say if the state would do what the lawmakers asked: Freeze the new child care expansion funds until more safeguards are in place. It also came two days after a deadline the lawmakers had requested.
Tanner, one of the lawmakers who asked for Idaho’s pause and who is the new co-chair of the Legislature’s powerful budget committee, said he didn’t feel like the agency fully addressed his concerns, and he’s mulling what comes next.
“We just want to make sure that any funds going out … that we are making sure that we have things in place to prevent fraud, as much as we possibly can,” he told the Sun in an interview Thursday. “We don’t want to be a Minnesota. We do not want to be any other state. We want to make sure that  we learn from other people’s mistakes, and make sure that we have things in place that prevent that.”
Asked if the Department of Health and Welfare would comply with the lawmakers request, agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter said in a statement Wednesday that the agency is “working with the Governor’s office to determine the next steps.”
 Governor says Idaho has strong track record of running public assistance programs

Early this month Gov. Brad Little called what’s happening in Minnesota “abominable.” But asked about concerns about Idaho’s program to-be, Little touted Idaho’s management of public assistance programs.
“I’m always concerned about fraud. I mean, but if you look at our programs, you look at SNAP, you look at Medicaid, you look at all the programs … Idaho’s compliance rates are one of the highest,” Little told reporters on Jan. 8.

Last week, McWhorter told the Sun there had not been complaints about fraud, waste or abuse in Idaho’s program to expand child care availability. But he said in the coming months, the agency is planning unannounced visits to child care facilities and other investigative actions. 
Tanner said he isn’t sure if there is fraud in Idaho’s program.
“I really don’t know,” he said. “I mean, I’ve not seen blatant fraud, but I think there’s always question(s), because there is a system — there was a gaming system that was going on — that was not necessarily being looked at from, I would say, pretty much most states, and I think that’s that’s something to go back and revisit and relook at.”
 What grant oversight work is the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare planning?

In her letter to Tanner and Lenney, Charron pledged to shore up more safeguards — including to review all past providers in the program within the next two months to ensure that additional funding does “meet our rigorous standards of compliance.”
 
But in more than 1,000 random audits of a quarter of the state’s providers, only 45 resulted in providers being removed from the program, or having their licenses suspended or revoked, Charron wrote.
“Safeguarding taxpayer dollars that support working families and vulnerable children is critical and an issue of public confidence we do not take lightly,” Charron said in a written statement included in a news release last week. “Every effort devoted to proactive prevention and detection efforts saves in recovery costs, ensures program integrity, and preserves vital services for those who truly need them. Any bad actors will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Prosecutor pushes back on defense assertion that state law allows the capture, hunting and destruction of predatory animals in ""any manner whatsoever.""
The post Wolf torment defendant Cody Roberts wants animal cruelty case tossed appeared first on WyoFile .","Cody Roberts has doubled down on his push to have his felony animal cruelty case dismissed.
Robert Piper, Roberts’ attorney, on Tuesday filed a second motion arguing that Roberts’ case should be tossed. Sublette County Prosecutor Clayton Melinkovich’s case rests on ignoring the plain language of a state law allowing wildlife to be hunted, captured, killed or destroyed “in any manner not otherwise prohibited by law,” he said.
The case relies on an “unconstitutionally broad reading” of the law, Piper said.
In February 2024, Roberts captured a wolf and brought it into the Green River Bar in Daniel on a leash and with its mouth duct-taped. The incident ignited global outrage. In the aftermath, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department cited Roberts for illegally possessing the wolf, and issued him a $250 fine, but declined to pursue further charges. In August, Melinkovich convened a grand jury, which indicted Roberts for felony animal cruelty.
Roberts has pleaded not guilty.
Piper’s motion filed this week was the third in a back-and-forth between Piper and Melinkovich over the legitimacy of the case. Piper filed a motion to dismiss in mid-December, arguing that state statute creates a “blanket license” to capture, hunt and destroy predatory animals in “any manner whatsoever.”
Melinkovich responded in late December, writing that the statute in question is only relevant to how animals can be captured and killed. The case, however, is not about how the animal was captured or killed, but what happened to it in between, Melinkovich said.
In the warring motions, the attorneys have argued over the Wyoming Legislature’s intentions in drafting the statute.
Melinkovich argued that lawmakers obviously didn’t intend to permit wildlife to be treated in any way. That would permit torture and bestiality, which is “absurd” and not the intention, Melinkovich said.
In the most recent filing, Piper said the Legislature’s decision to pass a law last year prohibiting people from causing living wildlife, including predators, “undue suffering” demonstrates that was not the intent of the earlier statute.
A pretrial hearing to consider the motions is set for Jan. 28. The trial is set to begin on March 9.
Melinkovich also filed a rebuttal of his own this week, in response to filings by Piper seeking to exclude some evidence.
Piper asked Sweetwater County District Court Judge Richard Lavery to prohibit including as evidence of prior acts of wrongdoing, hearsay and expert testimony from Ken Mills, a Game and Fish large carnivore biologist. Piper said Mills would unscientifically analyze a video of the wolf and tell the jury what to think about it.
Melinkovich responded that he intended to follow the rules of the court vis-a-vis hearsay and prior acts of wrongdoing.
The state does not intend to “engage in prosecutorial misconduct,” Melinkovich said.
Mills’ testimony would use his specialized knowledge of wolves to help the jury make a determination about whether Roberts “maliciously allowed the undue suffering” of the wolf to continue, Melinkovich said. Mills will help determine whether the animal was suffering, Melinkovich said.

Legislators took a first crack at a measure that will establish major components of Wyoming’s $205M plans. Representatives of facilities like Riverton's new hospital are encouraged by proposed funding opportunities. 
The post Rural health care dollars buoy Wyoming hospitals, providers as lawmakers get on board appeared first on WyoFile .","RIVERTON—Clad in a hard hat and neon safety vest, Corte McGuffey walked across floors coated in drywall dust, pointing out what’s to come in this unfinished building. A radiology lab here, clinical exam rooms over there, a walk-up pharmacy near the back and on the second floor, hospital beds and two labor and delivery bays. 
McGuffey was leading a tour of Riverton’s new hospital, which is the result of a seven-year effort to fundraise, design, build and staff a community-owned health facility in this western Wyoming town of roughly 11,000. 
Construction broke ground in late 2024. Over the past year, a 70,000-square-foot building has risen on a plot of land on the north edge of town. Crews recently installed exterior walls and most of the windows. The hope is to finish construction by September, and begin accepting patients before year’s end. 
The hospital spawned from local displeasure with consolidation and loss of services under SageWest, which operates its own hospital in Riverton. It represents a rare area of growth in Wyoming’s health care landscape, which has experienced widening service gaps in recent years as hospitals and clinics struggle to retain workers and maintain financial stability. 
The Riverton Medical District Board still needs to complete construction, hire staff and implement billing and record systems — and would like to raise additional money. Once open, the facility will face financial realities that make hospital viability so challenging in Wyoming. Things like low volume and high fixed costs.
Overcoming those challenges may become more feasible for Riverton’s and other health care facilities now that Wyoming will receive $205 million in federal Rural Health Transformation Funds in 2026 — and up to $800 million beyond that over the consecutive five years.

As part of its plans to deploy the funds, Wyoming proposes to spend a big chunk on supporting hospitals. The Riverton Medical District Board pooled its own rural health recommendations with fellow Billings Clinic affiliates in Wyoming and submitted them to the state, and has been closely following the process. Though there are few details at this early stage about fund deployment, Riverton hospital officials see promise not only for their facility to benefit, but also the broader state health care network. 
“Wyoming has a real opportunity to use these funds, and hopefully not just a one-time shot, hopefully to create a way to use the money for a long period of time,” McGuffey, who chairs the Riverton Medical District board, said amid the din of construction. 
Rapidly unfolding 
The Rural Health Transformation Program is a new federal initiative created by President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The program will funnel $50 billion to states over five years to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. 
The application and award process unfolded rapidly this fall. Wyoming Department of Health staff gathered input through stakeholder conferences and public meetings starting in September. The state received 1,300 responses to an online survey. Staff prepared an 84-page application and submitted it in early November.
The application proposed an array of initiatives to bolster health care. Those include incentives for small rural hospitals to provide basic services and cut extraneous ones that can be performed at regional facilities; grants for clinical workforce training programs and five-year commitments from grads; a state-run insurance plan for catastrophic events; and permanent, investment-generated revenue to boost the industry. There were also programs designed to promote healthy habits, expand technology like telehealth and bolster EMS services.
Wyoming applied for an initial budget of $200 million. When awards were announced Dec. 29, the state was given $5 million more than it requested and received the second-largest award per capita, behind Alaska. 
Now, the work begins. It will entail drafting contracts, hiring staff, crafting bills and gaining legislative approval. The vision is that initiatives will be available to an array of health care services, providers and programs. 
Staying inside the lines
On Thursday, the Joint Appropriations Committee considered a draft bill to establish the perpetuity investment fund, create an advisory panel and launch programs for implementing many of the state’s Rural Health proposals. 
Though many of Wyoming’s state lawmakers are small-government conservatives wary of growing agencies, appropriations members appeared to support the bill — a necessary step in receiving the Trump administration funds. 
One notable initiative not in the bill is the state-run insurance plan, which appropriations committee members previously frowned upon. 
Wyoming does anticipate some amount of flexibility to opt out of the application’s approved initiatives, Wyoming Health Department Director Stefan Johansson told the board. However, “adding programming to this effort is likely not allowable at the federal level.”
Anything outside of the approved purposes in the application risks clawback from the federal government, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. 
“I don’t want it to be a situation where we color outside the lines, to the point where we find ourselves without lines and maybe without a fund,” said Rep. Jeremy Haroldson, R-Wheatland.

The bill will play a key role in the rollout of the rural health fund proposals.
“This is, in my view, a generational opportunity to make some very smart, conservative, but practical investments in our rural and frontier communities when it comes to their health and their health care,” Johansson said. “I think this is a very good opportunity for us to take full advantage of the Trump administration’s program in this area.”
The committee did not vote on the draft, which it tabled until February. 
Obstacles 
Back in Riverton, McGuffey reflected on nearly eight years of efforts, like feasibility studies and fundraising, to get to the current hospital construction phase.  
“The amount of work that goes into pulling something like this off is … crazy,” he said. 
That included securing a $37.1 million USDA Rural Development loan, $15 million in federal grant funding facilitated by the state and the 4-acre building site. The district is partnering with the Billings Clinic to be an affiliate of the larger health care company, which it hopes will help leverage resources.
“We worked for so long just looking at a lot,” McGuffey said from a second-floor balcony in the new building. “To see [the building] actually go up is really exciting.”
The hospital will provide more than 100 local jobs and present the kind of essential health care that draws families to communities, Riverton Medical District Board members say. That will include, eventually, limited labor and delivery — a service that SageWest Riverton and several other state hospitals have closed down in recent years.

Once the doors open, the facility will have to navigate the unique challenges of operating a hospital in the largely frontier state. 
The infusion of federal funds and Wyoming’s plan will help overcome those challenges, Gov. Mark Gordon said during a press conference last week. 
“The bottom line is, this program will protect hospitals, strengthen emergency care, grow our rural health care workforce and bring care closer to home,” Gordon said. 
The governor also acknowledged the Legislature’s role in securing the federal funds. 
“I think we have the opportunity here with the Legislature to be able to really move forward in a way that’s going to help their constituents,” Gordon said. “I think all of Wyoming is looking very carefully at what this plan means.”

Wisdom from a dying woman inspired guest columnist John Freeman to rethink patriotism in the new year. 
The post Healing the political virus infecting our state and local communities appeared first on WyoFile .","Death is clarifying, not just for the dying, but for the living. As a hospice volunteer, I have the privilege of spending time with dying patients. Recently, I asked a patient, ‘Mabel,’ for her thoughts on how we might overcome the nastiness, anger and cruelty that has infected our beloved state and local communities.    

Opinion

Mabel began by telling me about her late husband, a World War II veteran. Missing today, she suggested, is the kind of patriotism rooted in America’s core value of liberty and justice for all, and that all are created equal. These were shared values that made the American experiment so exceptional, the American people so optimistic and the United States the envy of the world.   
After the war, thanks to the GI Bill, Mabel’s husband and millions of other veterans were able to pursue and pay for ongoing education, get help obtaining jobs, purchase starter homes, and invest in stocks, bonds and other assets. Because the U.S. was still segregated when the GI Bill became law, many Black veterans were excluded. For the veterans who did access the benefits, this led to historic prosperity — today’s baby boomers are the wealthiest generation in history.  
But we of the postwar era have taken for granted what the veterans of a prior generation bequeathed to us. Over the past 80 years, liberty and justice for all has morphed into liberty and justice for a few. 
Mabel minced no words. We who proudly called ourselves liberals — teachers in schools and colleges, policy experts in think-tanks and government — have failed to recognize that the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few is incompatible with liberty and justice for all. 
How right she is. The possibility of America isn’t just a political framework; it’s rooted in ideals that our nation’s founders, most wealthy landowners and slaveholders themselves, bravely enshrined despite the reality of their time. It isn’t surprising that, without exception, the founders were men of faith, trusting in each other and in something far greater than themselves. Whether religious or not, they held a shared belief in the dignity and goodness of humankind “created in God’s image.”  
But our better angels retreat amidst fear, insecurity and isolation, and that is where we are today. In a world of rapid change, misinformation and rampant loneliness, we are forgetting the moral underpinning of who we are and the very goodness that makes us human. 
Wyoming has yet to build immunity to this virus. From her hospital bed, Mabel remains a keen observer of current events. She acknowledges that with our low population, the ease of getting elected and our pathological dislike of government, Wyoming is an ideal place for agents of the wealthy and powerful to influence more than state and local government, but national politics as well. We are willing pawns in the scheme.
And so the infection spreads. Fear mongers capitalize on the legitimate grievances of hardworking, values-driven Wyomingites to advance their own agendas, leaving those furthest from opportunity even further behind.  
Sounds too simple, but it is not. It all might cast a dark shadow on the start of 2026, were it not for Mabel’s additional wisdom: The remedy is one another. The virus spreads in the distance between us, in the unkindness, distrust and nastiness that advance the interests of the powerful few. Likewise, we each have power to prioritize our neighbors over news headlines, to make patriotism about liberty and justice for all, to find ourselves in service of others and the urgent needs of our nation. In sum, we can commit this year to being human in all our goodness. We can build better communities and a better state by taking to heart the wisdom of a dying woman.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)LINCOLN — A new bill would require Nebraska’s K-12 schools to teach lessons about the ills of communism. 
Legislative Bill 1024 from State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenville would require each Nebraska school district, starting next school year, to make time to teach the history of communism — worldwide and in the U.S. 
The proposed curriculum would range from covering what the bill describes as “the increasing threat of communism in the United States and its allies through the 20th century” to “mass killings that have occurred under communist regimes.” 
Similar state laws have passed in Florida and Texas. Florida Republican U.S. Rep. María Elvira Salazar has a federal bill that passed the U.S. House that would require the creation of a civics education program to teach high schoolers nationwide about “the dangers of communism.” 
“There’s a lot of students, especially in college, and kids that are out of the K-12 school system, who seem to support socialism and even communism nowadays,” Murman said. “I think we just have to be diligent that the risks and dangers, bad things that happen under communism, are taught in our schools.”

Murman, who chairs the Legislature’s Education Committee, said he hasn’t decided whether the bill will be a priority for the committee during the short session. The bill was cosponsored by five of his fellow Republicans in the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature: State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, Loren Lippincott of Central City, ​​State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings and State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman.

The proposal also would require students to take a written test “identical to the entire civics portion” of the U.S. citizenship test before completing eighth grade and before graduating from high school.
Tim Royers, president of the Nebraska State Education Association, the biggest teachers union in the state, said the union is “obviously opposed.” He noted that the subject was already required to be covered.
“These aren’t good standards,” Royers told the Examiner. “This isn’t the right way to teach history.” 
Royers also said the way the proposal is written steps on the toes of local boards of education. He said Murman should “let teachers write the social studies standards.”
Murman said lawmakers have the authority to offer guidance on education, and he wanted legal assurance that it would be taught.

Gov. Brad Little in his budget proposal called for $22 million in cuts to Medicaid, offering options for service cuts, such as dental coverage and home-and-community-based care for people with disabilities, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. Little also included in his budget about $23 million in reductions to Medicaid through an extension of the 4% doctor reimbursement cuts first approved in August in response to the projected state budget shortfall. 
JFAC Co-Chair Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, said that the budget committee will hear from the chairs of the House and Senate Health and Welfare committees, which hold public hearings on bills. Budget bills are not brought through those committees. 
Rep. Elaine Price, R-Coeur d’Alene, recommended “reaching out to your constituents, reading those emails. Responding to those emails will get you that picture as well.”
“That’s part of our job as a Legislature, we’re supposed to be representing our constituents,” Price said, “and if we’re not reaching out to them and reading their emails, then we’re not getting that information.” 
A budget hearing in JFAC for the Division of Medicaid is scheduled for Jan. 22, and the budget will be set later in the session.

The grizzly bear, which is listed as a threatened species under the federal Endangered Species Act, was shot in late October north of Perkins Lake in Boundary County, near the Idaho-Montana border, state and federal officials said. 
On Jan. 13, officials with the Center for Biological Diversity announced they are increasing the financial reward they are offering to $7,300, which brings the total reward up to $15,000. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Idaho’s Citizens Against Poaching previously announced they are offering rewards for information that leads to the arrest and conviction for the illegal killing. 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife staff received a mortality signal from the electronic collar the grizzly bear was wearing on Oct. 28. Following an investigation with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, officials determined that the bear was not a threat to the shooter, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a press release issued Dec. 10.
In a separate press release issued Jan. 13, officials with the Center for Biological Diversity said the female grizzly that was killed was from the Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem, which they described as the most imperiled grizzly bear population in the continental United States.
The conservation organization said that the death of even one or two female grizzly bears could be devastating for a recovering bear population. 
“This was a tragic, completely preventable loss and the consequences to grizzly recovery are enormous,” Kristine Akland, Northern Rockies director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a written statement. “In a population this small and fragile, every female is critical to survival. Losing even one can tip the balance toward the decline of the entire population. We’re increasing the reward because the person responsible for killing this bear needs to be held accountable.”

Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 2018. (Photo: Nashville.gov)Across the country, streets named for Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. don’t need explaining in Black communities. 
They are known by feel. Among long corridors where beauty supply stores sit beside corner stores, where barbershops outlast boarded-up buildings, where potholes crowd the pavement and front-porch conversations stretch past sundown. These are not symbolic roads. They are places where Black life continues, day after day, despite decades of disinvestment, living in the shadow of a name that promised justice long before cities were ready to deliver it.
In Tennessee, King’s legacy is etched into the geography of the state itself. His name appears on green street signs and stretches of asphalt that carry daily life: commuters heading to work, children walking to school, and churches opening their doors on Sunday mornings.
But those streets did not come easily.
The fight to name roads after King in the Volunteer state unfolded over decades, shaped by local politics, racial resistance and a persistent question about where, and how, Black history is allowed to exist in public space: Is naming a street after King an act of honor, or a substitute for the economic and political investment his work demanded?
There are now more than 1,000 streets named for King; globally, including at least 955 in the United States, according to University of Tennessee geographer Derek Alderman, whose extensive research over the last two decades has examined the geography of King streets nationwide. Those streets span 41 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, many emerging after King’s assassination in 1968 and again following the establishment of the federal holiday in 1983.
More than 1,000 streets across the world are named for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., says Derek Alderman, Ph.D., professor of geography at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. (Photo: University of Tennessee)
Tennessee has at least 17 streets bearing King’s name, stretching across the state’s largest cities and extending into smaller rural communities, such as Bolivar, New Market and Rockwood, sometimes no more than narrow back roads, absent from Google Maps and quietly maintained by residents determined to ensure King’s name remains visible.
“There’s been a fairly typical pattern across the United States,” Alderman said. “None of this happens without Black activism. Black communities, Black clergy, and those who have pushed very hard to get King’s name on a prominent road, one that doesn’t just serve the Black community, but transcends it.”
What often results, he said, is a compromise shaped by resistance: King’s name confined to a short stretch of roadway, frequently within historically Black neighborhoods, a form of symbolic recognition that mirrors the very segregation King spent his life challenging.
“That’s what makes street naming so controversial,” Alderman said. “It’s not really a question of whether we will remember Dr. King. It’s a question of where we will remember him. Where we choose to remember King plays a major role in shaping the meaning of that commemoration.”
 Unfinished symbols and the cost of commemoration

For all their visibility, Martin Luther King, Jr. streets carry a deep contradiction. They are meant to honor a man who preached economic justice and structural change, yet many of the corridors that bear his name remain sites of concentrated poverty and neglect.
That pattern, Alderman said, is not accidental.
“MLK streets are often placed in historically Black neighborhoods that have already experienced redlining, urban renewal and disinvestment,” he said. “So what you get is this uncomfortable reality where we symbolically honor Dr. King, but materially fail to address the inequalities that his work was fundamentally about.”
Research has repeatedly shown that the symbolism of MLK street-naming is rarely matched by economic investment. A 2020 study found that areas surrounding MLK-named streets are, on average, more segregated and significantly poorer than the national norm, with property values that consistently lag behind the rest of their cities. In majority-Black neighborhoods, homes are routinely appraised 20 to 23%lower than comparable properties in white neighborhoods, limiting wealth-building while increasing financial burden. Property values shape everyday life, influencing whether families can build wealth, access credit, fund public schools and pass stability to the next generation.










None of this happens without Black activism. Black communities, Black clergy, and those who have pushed very hard to get King’s name on a prominent road, one that doesn’t just serve the Black community, but transcends it.


– Derek Alderman, Ph.D., University of Tennessee 


On Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue in East Knoxville, longtime business owner Tanika Harper said the street’s name has always carried weight but not protection. Her family, through the generations, has held on to property on the road for decades, and she says it’s intentional.
“I’m proud to be on MLK, ” Harper said, speaking of the commercial building space her father originally operated his long standing lawncare company out for decades. “We’ve always found ways to thrive. I want to see this become a corridor that truly reflects Dr. King’s vision, where people can live, work, heal and build generational wealth. The potential is here. What’s needed now is the will to invest in people, not just property.”
Alderman argues that street naming should be understood not as a finish line, but as a starting point, one that forces cities to confront whether they are willing to back symbolism with policy, resources, and sustained investment, particularly at a moment when public commitments to racial equity and diversity initiatives are being openly dismantled.
“The name should come with a commitment,” Alderman said. “Otherwise, it becomes a reminder of what cities are willing to say, and what they’re unwilling to do.”
 Nashville: Putting King in the path of power

Nashville’s connection to King predates nearly every other Tennessee city. Long before street signs bore his name, the city served as a proving ground for the modern civil rights movement. In 1960, Black college students launched sit-ins that dismantled segregation at downtown lunch counters, drawing King to the city that spring, where he praised Nashville’s campaign as among the most disciplined in the South.
Yet despite that legacy, Nashville waited nearly six decades to place King’s name on a street tied to political power.

That changed in 2018, when the Metro Council approved renaming a portion of Charlotte Avenue, a major corridor adjacent to the Tennessee State Capitol, as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard. The decision came during the 50th anniversary year of King’s assassination, sharpening questions of how, and where, his legacy should be honored.
The legislation was led by then Metro Councilmember Sharon Hurt, a Memphis native who said the idea had stayed with her long before she held public office.
“I had seen Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevards all over the country,” Hurt said. “And typically, those streets reside in the African American community. Considering the contributions he made and how he brought so many people together, I felt his legacy deserved recognition beyond that.”
Once elected, Hurt said she became intentional not just about whether King should be honored, but where.
“I find it poetic justice that he was assassinated in the state of Tennessee,” she said. “With the Capitol on Charlotte Avenue, even naming a portion of that street mattered. I wanted something that could actually succeed.”
As she researched the corridor’s past, Hurt uncovered deeper layers of meaning. Charlotte Avenue was once Cedar Street, an area tied to Black residency, the slave trade and even the construction of the Capitol itself.
“There was an African American man who fell into a hole during the building of the state capitol and was never recovered,” Hurt said. “He’s actually buried there. All of that history is part of that street.”
The ordinance moved swiftly and was signed on April 4, 2018, the anniversary of King’s death.
“It was probably one of the most significant pieces of legislation that I passed,” Hurt said. “I’m very proud of it.”
Still, she is clear-eyed about what symbolism alone can and cannot do.
“A lot of what cities do around civil rights is performative,” Hurt said. “There’s no real equity if you’re not addressing the economic divide, the lack of investment in Black businesses, and the systems that still disadvantage Black communities.”
 Memphis: Still reckoning with the mountaintop

If Nashville’s debate centered on proximity to power, Memphis’s struggle was shaped by its grief.
In 1968, King came to Memphis to stand with striking sanitation workers demanding dignity, fair wages, and recognition of their humanity. On April 3, he delivered his final public address, the “Mountaintop” speech, at Mason Temple. He was assassinated the following day at the Lorraine Motel.
Few cities are as permanently linked to King’s final days as Memphis, a reality that weighed heavily on former City Councilmember Berlin Boyd.
“Being in Memphis, the city where Dr. King was assassinated, I was appalled that there were over 900 cities across the country with streets honoring his legacy, but here, where he lost his life, we didn’t have one,” Boyd said.
The delay was not for lack of effort. As early as the 1970s, Rev. James Netters pushed Memphis leaders to rename a street for King in an attempt that failed.
In 2012, Boyd introduced legislation to rename a downtown stretch of Linden Avenue as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue. The location was deliberate.
“You’re talking about Clayborn Temple, the sanitation workers’ march toward City Hall, and then his assassination at the Lorraine Motel,” Boyd said. “That’s the significance behind Linden Avenue.”
For Boyd, the decades-long delay reflected Memphis’s complicated relationship with its past.

“When something is painful, people tend to brush it under the rug and think it will go away,” he said. “But nobody ever really stopped to say, ‘Let’s honor him here because this is where it happened.’”
Unlike many MLK corridors nationwide, Linden Avenue now sits amid visible investment. Boyd pointed to redevelopment in the downtown core as evidence that the street may finally begin to reflect King’s legacy.
“You see economic growth in the area where we placed our street,” Boyd said. “But just naming a street after Dr. King doesn’t define what he stood for. There’s still a lot of work that needs to be done.”
 Chattanooga: From the big nine to the river

Chattanooga became one of Tennessee’s earliest testing grounds for King street-naming, not only because of when it happened, but because of where city leaders initially tried to draw the line.
“It was one of the first cases I ever encountered,” Alderman said. “A colleague sent me newspaper clippings years ago, and what struck me was that this was a city where activists actually pulled this off politically. They started the process before the King holiday was even established. That’s a real testament to Chattanooga’s traditions of protest and moral clarity.”
In the years following King’s assassination, Black ministers and community leaders pushed to rename Ninth Street, a historically Black commercial corridor known as “The Big Nine.” Once a thriving hub of Black-owned businesses, music, and nightlife, the street’s decline mirrored broader patterns of segregation, urban renewal, and disinvestment.










9th Street was where African Americans were. But the rest of Martin Luther King Boulevard runs to the river, right into prime downtown real estate. And they were very vocal about not wanting to name that portion.


– Rev, William Terry Wood


In 1981, the Chattanooga City Commission initially rejected the proposal, signaling a willingness to rename only East Ninth Street, the portion running through the historically Black neighborhood, while leaving West Ninth, which extended into downtown and prime commercial real estate, untouched.
“Typically, streets are easy to name because they’re already in the Black community,” said Rev.  William Terry Ladd, whose church sits merely blocks away. “That’s usually where the compromise happens.”
Organizers refused to accept it.
“9th Street was where African Americans were. But the rest of Martin Luther King Boulevard runs to the river, right into prime downtown real estate. And they were very vocal about not wanting to name that portion,” Ladd said.
Instead, Black clergy mobilized. In April 1981, hundreds of residents marched up and down Ninth Street, taping bumper stickers reading “Martin Luther King” over existing street signs, symbolically renaming the corridor themselves.
“They unofficially, but defiantly, renamed the street,” said Alderman. “They were repeating the tactics of the civil rights movement to make a claim about public space.”
Ladd said he was not surprised Chattanooga moved early.
“You had pastors who weren’t originally from Chattanooga,” he said. “Many of them went to places like Morehouse (College). They were exposed to a broader theology of justice.”
Later that year, the City Commission reversed course, officially renaming all of Ninth Street as Martin Luther King Boulevard.
“Location shapes meaning,” Alderman said. “And Chattanooga understood that early.”

 Knoxville: A door-to-door commitment on East Vine

In Knoxville, the fight unfolded a block at a time.
Charles Mathes, a longtime teacher at Austin High School, spent more than two decades advocating for East Vine and McCalla avenues to be renamed for King. But it was in 1988 that the effort took on new urgency.
That year, Charlene Lewis, Anna Dirl, and a small group of community leaders began walking door to door along East Vine Avenue, carrying a petition asking the city to rename the corridor for King. Lewis had been a sixth grader when King was assassinated, too young to fully grasp the moment but old enough to absorb the stories passed down through her family.
“As I heard these stories, it became more important to me to see us not just get along, but actually make a difference,” Lewis later recalled.
“We knew this wasn’t going to happen unless we did something,” said Rev. Harold Middlebrook of a campaign to name a Knoxville street for Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. (Photo: Screengrab, Knoxville.tn.gov.)
The effort was deeply grassroots, rooted in churches and neighborhood networks, and grounded in a shared understanding of Vine Avenue’s role as the heart of Black Knoxville before urban renewal hollowed it out.
Rev. Harold Middlebrook, a civil rights leader with personal ties to King through Morehouse College, helped lead what he called a commitment to “walking the walk.”
“We had to do more than sit around talking about it,” Middlebrook said. “We knew this wasn’t going to happen unless we did something.”
Not everyone welcomed the change. Lewis recalled at least one business owner using a racist slur in opposition to King’s name. Still, organizers pressed forward, delivering a petition with hundreds of signatures to city officials in January 1989.
That spring, Knoxville unanimously approved the request, creating a three-mile stretch of Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue through East Knoxville.
For Middlebrook, the street would come to represent both progress and unfinished work.
“We had no idea at that time this would become part of history,” he said. “But we knew it mattered.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson made his name in the U.S. House as the “TikTok Congressman.” Now, he’s again staking out real estate at the technological forefront by heading up a nationwide task force on AI.
Stepping into the attorney general’s office in a year where Trump has sought to halt funding for everything from SNAP benefits to hurricane resilience grants to public school funding — all blocked after court battles that Jackson’s N.C. Department of Justice helped win — the former Congressman has come to view his office as a last line of defense for North Carolinians, both from the executive branch and from the threats of tomorrow.
To lead that defense, he has stressed a united front across party lines. “We are stronger when we speak with one voice,” he told dozens of attorneys general at the AI Task Force’s inaugural meeting last week.
But in his own state, Republicans are vying to strip him of one of his most potent tools: the ability to challenge Trump’s executive orders. The state Senate passed a bill last March that would require the General Assembly to authorize any such lawsuits, and the state House could do the same as it returns for the short session this month.
A term defined by Trump
More than anything else, Jackson’s first year in office has been defined by its lawsuits in defiance of the Trump administration.
Most notably, they won an October court battle that required the Trump administration to disburse $230 million in SNAP benefits to 1.4 million North Carolinians during last fall’s government shutdown. Other successful lawsuits challenged the revocation of more than $165 million in public education funding and $200 million in FEMA resilience dollars.

In Jackson’s view, his office has undertaken a principled approach on executive orders. Whereas some Democratic attorney generals have joined more than 60 lawsuits challenging the Trump administration, his office was only part of 18 in 2025.
“I use an objective formula for when I file a lawsuit against the administration or anyone else,” Jackson told NC Newsline. “Did someone break the law? Did it hurt the state? And can I prove both of those things?”
He has repeatedly stressed that North Carolina’s participation in these lawsuits is often key to recovering blocked funds through court injunctions that only apply to the parties to the lawsuit. Jackson announced in January that his office had recovered a total of $1.5 billion in stalled funds in 2025.
Jackson’s office declined to join some lawsuits against the Trump administration on more divisive issues, particularly around social issues. He did not join, for example, a lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services earlier this month challenging an executive order mandating health and education institutions to abide by its definition of biological sex rather than gender identity.
In the view of Western Carolina University political scientist Chris Cooper, “it doesn’t appear that he’s just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.”
“I think he’s choosing cases where he thinks they have a chance to win, and that are going to present as, yes, partisan, but not hyperpartisan and not leaning into the negative,” Cooper said. “What he’s chosen to shoot, he’s been hitting.”
‘AG TikTok’
As the gears began moving on Senate Bill 58, the proposal that would strip Jackson of autonomy on challenges to executive orders, North Carolina Republicans issued a stark warning: Comply or else.
Asked by Sen. Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe) in February what lawmakers would do if the Attorney General defies a new mandate on executive orders, Sen. Tim Moffitt (R-Henderson) suggested his role could be obliterated by repealing every power granted to it by state law.
“That way, the Attorney General is a feckless, empty shell of a position that has no authority to do anything,” Moffitt said.
Jackson has seemed to draw more ire from Republicans in a single year from Republican state lawmakers than his predecessor, Gov. Josh Stein, did in eight. But he’s also maintained a higher profile than any attorney general before him.
The TikToks that made him famous in Congress have continued — churning out 11 since he entered the attorney general’s office and sharing them across X, Bluesky, Reddit, and Instragram among other platforms.
While they have shifted from the political news dominating Congress to the lawsuits his office is taking on, they have at times retained an adversarial tone — directed at those his office is probing.
“Hi. This message is for WeChat,” he said in a video in May. “You are the second-largest texting platform in the world. You’re also heavily implicated in the money laundering that is tied to trafficking fentanyl.”
In a TikTok post on Jan. 15, 2026, Jackson touted his office’s win against the Trump administration over withheld FEMA funding. (Photo: TikTok)
“The pattern is clear, and your app is at the center of it. So I reached out to some other attorneys general in both parties and asked them to join me in confronting you,” he said. “You’ve known about your role in this for years, and now, so does everyone else.”
In another video, he addressed 37 companies he accused of facilitating robocalls by name. His office has sought to crack down on robocalls routed through North Carolina, winning a court order fining an AI voice provider $5 million for enabling them.
Opponents see moves like these as evidence of showmanship, rather than statesmanship. And it’s made him an outsized target for the animus of North Carolina Republicans.
Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger, in comments on social media in October, linked S58 to Jackson’s social media stardom directly — retweeting a radio host who derided Jackson as “AG TikTok.”
“This is exactly why Senate Republicans passed a bill to restrict Jeff Jackson from filing frivolous lawsuits against @POTUS,” Berger wrote. “The AG should be focused on working for the people of NC, not his social media followers.”
In his meetings with Republicans, Jackson has stressed that he wants to lead the state DOJ without partisanship.
“I think it deserves to be done in a nonpartisan way. That was how I campaigned,” Jackson said in an interview with NC Newsline. “I told people that this job has to be about the protection of people and not a political party, and that’s what I believe, that’s how I’ve tried to lead the office.”
But many in the state GOP see his broadsides against the Trump administration as evidence that his lawsuits are driven by political animus.
North Carolina Republican Party spokesman Matt Mercer said he sees little evidence of Jackson leading in a nonpartisan way. “He seems like he’s chosen to take on that partisan mantle versus trying to find areas of agreement with the Trump administration to enforce the law,” Mercer said.
“He’s not leading on these things. He’s signing on to what attorneys general in California and New York and Illinois are doing,” Mercer said. “He’s just falling in line.”
What Jackson touts as a signature achievement, recovering SNAP benefits for North Carolinians, Mercer argued was unnecessary. “Whose fault was it that we had the shutdown to begin with? It was Jeff Jackson’s party.”
‘Refreshingly bipartisan’
Despite battles with Republicans in his own state, Jackson is set to meet his biggest task of the coming year alongside a member of the GOP: Utah Attorney General Derek Brown, with whom he’s co-chairing the AI task force.
Launching the task force in November capped off a first year in office in which Jackson sought to position himself at the forefront of emerging technological challenges without regulatory answers at a time when, in his view, the federal government has abdicated responsibility.

The Trump administration has not only declined to issue regulations on AI, Jackson noted, but it has also sought to prevent the states from enacting their own. A December order from Trump’s White House promises to “check the most onerous and excessive laws emerging from the States that threaten to stymie innovation,” warning it will  revoke funding from states that do not comply.
“In my conversations with state legislators, there’s a general understanding that it would be bad if there was executive action that obsoleted all of the AI-related laws that the state has passed.” Jackson said in the interview. “So far, I will say, the response has been refreshingly bipartisan.”
The task force, which formed just a month before that order, has said its work will continue nonetheless.
“This is a perfect demonstration of why, frankly, the Tenth Amendment matters. States really are laboratories of democracy, and I think we’re faster, we are more nimble,” said Brown, the Utah Attorney General.
Jackson said he believes the risks of leaving AI up to Congress far exceed any downsides of a patchwork approach between the states.
“You really don’t want to end up in a situation where the state safeguards have been swept away and then the federal government does nothing, which is the most likely outcome here, as we saw with social media, as we’ve seen with the internet privacy, even for kids,” he said.“The most likely outcome for congressional response to massive new technology is to do virtually nothing.”
He said he hopes to focus on digital hazards like voice cloning, deep fakes, and AI robocalls. His office has also paid special focus to e-commerce. In 2025, his office made inquiries into leading “buy now, pay later” platforms as well as the online commerce giant Shopify. Jackson also called out fraudulent websites and Instagram ads that go to fake companies as sources of concern for his office in the interview with NC Newsline.
‘The leader of an institution’
Jackson’s stint as attorney general is his first time engaging with the public in an executive, rather than legislative, role. It’s also the first time North Carolinians have seen him attempt to shed partisan colors after years of viral TikToks condemning state Senate and U.S. House Republicans.
In a November leadership talk to Duke students and faculty named for former Gov. Terry Sanford, Jackson stressed the importance of reaching out to Republican attorneys general and state lawmakers. Those conversations, he said, are crucial in a time of stark polarization.
“If all I did was diminish some antagonism, that’s worth it. If I took someone from 100% opposed to 70%, y’all, that’s a win,” Jackson said at the Duke forum. “We get out of a lot of meetings being like, I don’t think he hates me. I think he dislikes me!”

His military background has informed his executive leadership style, leading him to seek out “mission-driven” team members and taking a person-to-person approach with as many members of his staff as possible. “You’ve got to give them a sense of who you are.”
That experience, he said, led him to post up at the NCDOJ entrance with his 10-year-old son on his first day and shake hands with every employee who walked in. He also joined a sunrise workout of basic law enforcement training cadets in Asheville, which he also saw as an effort to better understand criminal justice in the state at the ground level.
“What is Jeff Jackson really trying to do in all of this? Is he trying to position himself to run for U.S. Senate in 2028, or for governor in 2028 or 2032, or is he trying to do his job?” asked Mercer, the GOP spokesman.
For his part, Jackson said he does not wish to leave his current role any time soon. When asked in an interview with NC Newsline whether he was considering a Senate run, he said, “Nope.”
“This job is wonderful in what you can actually accomplish. And in that respect, it’s very different than serving in Congress,” he said. “As attorney general, you can make a big difference every day.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB124952-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-19 06:57:16.821947

Every January, 100 people elected to the Colorado General Assembly gather in Denver for 120 days and make decisions that affect students and teachers in the classroom, university administrators trying to balance their budgets, and parents and students having to make tuition payments.
There are only two bills that legislators have to pass before they adjourn in May: a balanced budget and the school finance act. Both have profound implications for educational opportunity.
Lawmakers also tackle many more education issues, from school meals to school safety, from what students should learn in the classroom to workforce training.
But it can be hard for ordinary citizens to understand how ideas turn into laws.
To explain the lawmaking process and the opportunities for public input, Chalkbeat has prepared this guide to the legislative session, which start last week, and how you can get involved:
How a bill becomes a law
Think Schoolhouse Rock’s “I’m Just a Bill.”
Legislators get ideas for bills from a lot of places. A legislator might have a passion for a particular topic. The governor’s office or leaders of state agencies might request a policy change. An interest group or ordinary citizens might ask a lawmaker to help solve a problem.
Lawmakers work with bill drafters — nonpartisan legislative staff — to write a bill. Once a lawmaker introduces it, leaders in either the House or the Senate assign it to a committee, usually one with relevant expertise.
Most education bills go to a chamber’s education committee, but a bill on youth mental health might land first in the health committee, or one on police in schools might be heard by the judiciary committee.
A few committees — most infamously the State Affairs committees — are known as “kill” committees, where leadership can send controversial bills, especially those from the opposing parties, to ensure they don’t reach the floor.
A bill must win committee approval to proceed to the full House or Senate. Some bills might need to go through more than one committee.
Bills must get approved twice in the first chamber, before heading to the next chamber, where they go through the process all over again. Bills can be amended at any point in the process, and both chambers must sign off on the same final form of a bill for it to clear the legislature.
Then the governor decides whether to sign it into law.
Who has a vote on the Colorado education committees
For this session, the House Education Committee has 13 members — eight Democrats and five Republicans:

Chair Rep. Meghan Lukens, a Steamboat Springs Democrat
Vice Chair Rep. Matthew Martinez, a Monte Vista Democrat
Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat
Rep. Mary Bradfield, a Colorado Springs Republican
Rep. Ava Flanell, a Colorado Springs Republican
Rep. Lori Garcia Sander, an Eaton Republican
Rep. Lindsay Gilchrist, a Denver Democrat
Rep. Eliza Hamrick, a Centennial Democrat
Rep. Anthony Hartsook, a Parker Republican
Rep. Dusty Johnson, a Fort Morgan Republican
Rep. Jacque Phillips, a Thornton Democrat
Rep. Katie Stewart, a Durango Democrat
Rep. Tammy Story, a Conifer Democrat

Find the committee schedule, documents, and live and archived audio of its meetings at the committee website.
The Senate Education Committee has seven members — four Democrats and three Republicans:

Chair Sen. Chris Kolker, a Centennial Democrat
Vice Chair Sen. Janice Marchman, a Loveland Democrat
Sen. Scott Bright, a Platteville Republican
Sen. Lisa Frizel, a Castle Rock Republican
Sen. Cathy Kipp, a Fort Collins Democrat
Sen. Dafna Michaelson Jenet, a Commerce City Democrat
Sen. Janice Rich, a Grand Junction Republican

Can you speak on a bill or submit testimony?
If you’re interested in having your perspective heard, there are a few ways to get involved.
You can speak on the bill in person or remotely, or submit a written statement to the committee. The sign-up process is not difficult. Just fill out this online form.
Speakers are generally limited to two to three minutes, so think about how to make your point quickly and clearly.
Want to know the schedule?
The full schedule of the House and Senate can typically be found online on the Colorado General Assembly website’s landing page.
The session schedule should be posted daily and gets updated as bills move through the process.
How to look up Colorado General Assembly bills
Looking for a bill online? Go to the Colorado General Assembly’s bill search page. There you can search by a bill number, the sponsor, or a topic.
When you click on a bill, you’ll see a summary of what the bill does, the full text of the bill, and other relevant information, such as a fiscal note that explains how much passing the law would cost the state. Often the description of a bill in the fiscal note is easier to understand than the bill language itself.
You can also search through tabs near the bottom of the page that include the bill’s history, when it’s scheduled to be heard again, any amendments, and a summary of the committee votes.
What’s the Joint Budget Committee, and why is it so important?
The six-member Joint Budget Committee is the most influential committee in the Colorado General Assembly. Why? Because it writes the budget that guides the state’s priorities. The committee members this year are four Democrats and two Republicans, with Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, as chair.
Yes, Gov. Jared Polis does submit a budget every November. And the governor’s priorities guide the Joint Budget Committee’s work. But the committee ultimately writes the budget that gets submitted to the General Assembly for approval.
Other lawmakers also have a chance to submit budget amendments that reflect their own spending priorities — but lawmakers need to pass a balanced budget, and the Joint Budget Committee will strip out amendments that endanger that goal.
The budget shapes every facet of state government, including K-12 and higher education spending.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The new year has barely begun, but the 2026 campaign season is well underway.
This month’s special primaries for a pair of legislative seats kicked off the year’s elections, and more key dates for voters are on the way.
Arkansas’ midterm elections include several high-profile races, including the reelection bids of Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton.
To prepare for the elections, voters will need to know the rules and how to register. Here’s what to know about voter registration in Arkansas:
 To vote in the March 3 primary, when do I need to be registered to vote? 
In Arkansas, voters need to register at least 30 days before the election they want to vote in. For the 2026 regular primary, that falls on Feb. 1, a Sunday, so potential voters will need to register by Feb. 2, according to Chris Powell, the director of public affairs for the Arkansas Secretary of State’s office.
Those who moved within the state and need to register in a new county must register at least four days prior to the election.
 Can I register to vote online? 
No.
According to the secretary of state’s website, those who wish to vote in Arkansas must fill out a paper registration form.
The form can be downloaded from the secretary of state’s website and printed, obtained from state revenue or motor vehicle offices, public libraries or local county clerks. Forms can be mailed to the secretary of state’s office, or completed in-person at a local county clerk’s office. If the form is mailed, it must be postmarked at least 30 days prior to the election.
 Who is eligible to vote? 
Any U.S. citizen over the age of 18 who lives in Arkansas. If someone turns 18 before the next election, then they are also able to register. People convicted of a felony who have not had their sentence discharged or pardoned are not eligible to vote.
 What kind of documentation do I need to register? 
Arkansans will need to provide either their Arkansas drivers license, or, if they don’t have a drivers license, the last four digits of their social security number in order to register. However, on election day, Arkansans may use passports, identification issued by accredited postsecondary educational institutions, a military ID or other forms of photo ID if they wish. The full list, and more information about voter registration, can be found at the Arkansas Secretary of State’s website.

(COURTESY AKA LAMBDA PI OMEGA CHAPTER)
This story was originally reported by Ebony JJ Curry of The 19th.  Meet Ebony and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Detroit was the first place Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered an early version of what would become his “I Have a Dream” speech. He recited it on June 23, 1963, at the end of Detroit’s Walk to Freedom, a march that happened weeks before he spoke on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
This piece of Detroit-first history sharpens what Martin Luther King Jr. Day asks of the city. It’s harder to treat the holiday, celebrated on Monday, as a slogan when the dream was first spoken aloud in Detroit. It’s also harder to see it as a day off when a lot of people choose to mark it every year as a day on.
The Lambda Pi Omega chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, is one of the Detroit institutions built around that belief.
Their members measure the weeks before Martin Luther King Jr. Day in labor. They assemble toiletry kits for Detroiters without stable housing, volunteer their time to youth programs focused on combating hunger and fostering leadership skills, and step into the gaps families are already navigating, like hunger and lack of resources. Crystal Sewell, the chapter’s president, said the work is rooted in service that isn’t just a once-a-year thing.
“Our work really is about uplifting our community; that is really at the heart of what we do,” Sewell said. “It is sisterhood and service for the betterment of our local community, that’s really the essence and the spirit of our chapter.”
This year, LPO will spend Martin Luther King Jr. Day at Third New Hope Baptist Church on Detroit’s west side for its annual “We Are One” AKA Day of Service. Sorority members plan to assemble 1,908 toiletry bags for Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, a local nonprofit that provides emergency shelter and support services, including housing programs for families and people working toward recovery. The specificity in the number of kits is intentional: 1,908 reflects AKA’s founding year, 1908. After the event, the bags will be delivered to the rescue mission’s family shelter and recovery housing sites.
The chapter’s service calendar stays full throughout the year, Sewell said.
“If I were to add it up, I would say we participate in at least 10 volunteer opportunities per month,” she said. “So, you’re talking 100 to 150 volunteer service opportunities per year. There are several hours that go into our volunteerism, over 2,000 hours per year.”
LPO is part of the Divine Nine — nine historically Black fraternities and sororities under the National Pan-Hellenic Council, founded when Black students, excluded from White Greek systems, created their own organizations around scholarship, leadership and service.
Dr. King was part of that tradition.
He was initiated into Boston’s Sigma chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha in June 1952. Alpha Phi Alpha (APA) was founded in 1906 as the first Black Greek-letter fraternity; AKA is the first Black Greek-letter sorority.
AKA’s purpose statement includes a directive members repeat as a standard: to be of “service to all mankind.”
Jacqueline Newman has spent decades living by that. She became an AKA member in 1970 at Wayne State University. When the sorority’s LPO chapter was chartered in Detroit in 1977, she became a founding charter member. She now serves as the chapter historian.
“What we do is we try to help, whenever we can, wherever we can,” Newman said. “We love children, so we are in different schools to help feed students. We’ve clothed students. We’ve given Thanksgiving baskets. We’ve given scholarships, and it was not only to women or girls. It has been to men also. And no matter your race. That’s what I look at as service to all mankind, to all people that are in need. That’s what we do.”
Newman’s own timeline begins in the South. She was 13 and living in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, when Dr. King spoke in Detroit in 1963.
“I was part of the South that he was trying to free from civil rights injustices,” she said.

She moved to Detroit in 1965 with her family. “My mom and my dad were teachers and the employment was better here in Detroit,” Newman said. Her mother became a member of AKA in 1962; Newman described her own membership as legacy. “So, it was mainly a legacy for me. I followed in my mom’s footsteps.”
Her history of service began before she joined AKA. In the South, she said, “I saw so many injustices done, especially to our people. I was marching and doing civil rights things when I was 11, 12, 13 years old before I came here to Michigan.”
Those experiences compelled her to action — “you don’t want anybody else to have to go through what you went through,” Newman said.
“When you have seen a man hung on a tree, it hits you a little more,” Newman said. “If you have lived through it, it’s different.”
Detroit remembers Dr. King’s dream speech because it heard it early. Lambda Pi Omega is betting its Martin Luther King Jr. Day on a simpler goal: what gets done, who gets served, and whether the work continues when the holiday ends.
As Sewell said, service is about direct support and long-term civic work.
“Service for me is about uplifting others within our community who are of greatest need,” she said. “It is advocating for social justice, making sure our community is informed and educated and registered to vote and getting out to vote, thinking about the whole of the individual, from cradle to senior.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AKA-service03.jpg-1024x683.webp,,,2026-01-19 06:57:16.821947

(Photo by Brett Bowers/Getty Images)Today we celebrate the life, work and enduring legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a leader whose vision of a beloved community calls us to build a society rooted in dignity, strengthened by diversity, guided by equality, and sustained by joy. 
In Idaho, this day also marks Idaho Human Rights Day — a distinction that reflects both our aspirations and our complicated history. Across the country, MLK Day is widely observed with marches, speeches and reflections on the American promise of liberty and justice for all. But in Idaho, that recognition did not come easily. 
This struggle to be seen and honored reminds us why Dr. King’s vision of a beloved community matters now more than ever. He challenged us to confront injustice, tell hard truths and dedicate ourselves to collective care. 
At a moment when legislation increasingly threatens to roll back hard-won progress, and when efforts to erase difficult chapters of our national story are gaining traction, his vision is more vital than ever. Today is not only a day of remembrance. It is a day of responsibility. 
In Idaho and beyond, we are called to reexamine whether our actions truly align with our values. Are we living up to the ideals we claim to hold? 
MLK Day became a federal holiday in 1983, but Idaho was slow to adopt it. Some lawmakers objected to a day dedicated to one person, particularly a person of color they characterized as having “communist tendencies.” 
After years of public advocacy in support of the holiday, a pivotal moment came in 1989 when Boise State University student Eric Love organized a peaceful march to the Idaho Capitol. More than 700 students and community members gathered to demand recognition of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s legacy.

Bill Wassmuth, the Wassmuth Center for Human Rights‘ namesake, spoke that day about the deep connection between civil and human rights and joined the crowd in singing “We Shall Overcome.” It was a powerful expression of what a beloved community looks like in action: people coming together across differences to insist on the dignity of all. 
In 1990, a compromise finally led Gov. Cecil Andrus to establish Martin Luther King Jr. – Idaho Human Rights Day, making Idaho the 47th state to recognize the holiday. The dual designation was intentional, affirming that civil rights and human rights are inseparable and that both belong to everyone. Idaho remains unique in this combined observance. 
Today, however, we are witnessing a troubling reversal of those historic efforts. Laws dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; policies restricting bodily autonomy and health care; attacks on public education; and attempts to rewrite history all undermine the very freedoms Dr. King and countless others worked to secure. 
Threats and violence toward people based on race, ethnicity or immigration status violate not only our shared humanity, but the fundamental rights promised by our Constitution. These actions stand in direct opposition to the legacies of Dr. King, Bill Wassmuth, Eric Love and so many others who worked to advance civil and human rights. 
We often hear appeals to “Idaho values” and “American values,” but this moment requires us to be specific: which values, and toward what kind of community? Dr. King’s vision of a beloved community provides a clear answer — one defined by dignity, safety, opportunity and shared responsibility for one another. 
These principles reflect the best of who we are as Idahoans and Americans. As we reflect on that vision today, we must ask whether our words and actions are actively shaping a community that embodies these values. Living out this vision requires more than reflection. It demands intentional action in our everyday choices. 
One way is to hold fast to your values and align your actions accordingly. 
If you value community, find ways to connect and care for others. If you value dignity, let your words and actions reflect the shared humanity of every person you encounter. If you value inclusion, be intentional about creating spaces of belonging at home, at work and in your neighborhood.
When we pause, reflect and live into our values through our actions, we carry forward the work of those who came before us. Together, we can continue building a beloved community where human and civil rights are honored, protected and shared by all.

Haley Stevens is continuing to raise concerns about private equity deals in college sports, reaching out to the President of the National College Athletics Association ahead of Monday’s college football playoff national  championship game for information on how to prevent college athletics programs from being sold to the highest bidder. 
The Birmingham Democrat joined U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner (R-Wash.) in penning a letter to NCAA President Charlie Baker, expressing their concern following several reports of NCAA member universities exploring deals with private equity firms, or companies whose stocks are not publicly traded. 
As part of their letter, Stevens and Baumgartner submitted a list of questions about the NCAA’s decision-making and enforcement mechanisms to prevent profit-seeking firms from buying up stakes in university athletics, requesting a response by Feb. 15. 
“College sports are a uniquely American tradition that have provided invaluable experiences for generations of college athletes, students, and fans,” Stevens and Baumgartner wrote. “As the people’s representatives, we have a responsibility to ensure that the integrity of universities and college sports is preserved for future generations of Americans, not sacrificed for short-term financial gain – especially where outside investors may gain leverage over decisions that should remain accountable to university communities.”
In November, Stevens sent a letter to Big Ten Conference Commissioner Tony Petitti following reports that the Big Ten was mulling selling 10% of its media rights to UC Investments, a group affiliated with the University of California system pension fund, for $2.4 billion.
The Big 12 Conference and the University of Utah are also reportedly looking at selling portions of their athletics revenue streams to outside investors, while the Southeastern Conference, the University of Notre Dame, and Florida State University have also reported outreach from private equity investors.
“Ceding control or meaningful governance rights tied to athletics revenues to entities that do not have to answer to students, faculty, staff, alumni, or local communities would erode the public-serving mission of universities and encourage increasingly profit-driven decision-making,” Stevens and Baumgartner wrote. “Private equity firms, principally concerned with maximizing their return on investment, have little incentive to protect or promote non-revenue sports, including those required under Title IX, that have provided a path to college and life-changing experiences for generations of college athletes.

The Fargo City Commission voted 3-2 earlier this month to dissolve the Human Rights Commission in its current advisory role. City commissioners gave the board two months to come up with a plan to restructure in a way that taps fewer city resources, both financial and staffing.
Last week, the human rights group began discussing its options at a working session.
“The best thing we can do is come together so marginalized people in Fargo have a voice,” said Sekou Sirleaf, chairman of the advisory board.

But while much of the conversation focused on next steps, several members of the board and the public who attended the meeting voiced frustrations about recent actions of the City Commission.
“It’s a strong, horrible message from our city leaders,” said Barry Nelson, who among many other roles has served on the city’s Human Rights Commission in the past. “It shows where this city’s priorities are.”
Moving the commission to a community-based or nonprofit model could lessen its impact, said Nelson.
After the meeting, Sirleaf said the city of Fargo has a pattern of not supporting diverse, marginalized community members. The dismantling of the Human Rights Commission is the latest example, he said.
He observed that city commissioners voted on the board’s future less than a month after the Human Rights Commission accused city leaders of failing to support the Somali community when President Donald Trump made disparaging remarks about the immigrant group in neighboring Minnesota.
He pointed to the city commission’s decision to eliminate a three-year-old Diversity, Equity and Inclusion department in September 2024. 
In addition, this year commissioners did not approve funds to sponsor community events that honor Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth. Those costs were $17,886 and $12,500 respectively. Martin Luther King Jr. Day has been a longstanding event reaching back to at least 2002.
“Fargo is the most diverse city in North Dakota, but our city government and its decisions don’t reflect that,” Sirleaf said.  
Fargo administrators referred a request for comment to the city’s spokesperson, who emailed a statement from Brenda Derrig, the assistant city administrator:
“While the City is no longer sponsoring MLK or Juneteenth events, the City continues to recognize the significance of both observances. On MLK Day and Juneteenth, community members are encouraged to take time to honor these observances, whether that is through service, learning or engagement within the community,” she wrote.
Derrig said funding was pulled because the city was prioritizing core services and evaluating how social services and arts funding is allocated.

Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney did not respond to an email requesting comment on the issue. Mahoney drafted a memo to the Fargo Commission for its Jan. 5 meeting saying that the city had spent the past year identifying ways to streamline the city’s volunteer boards and commissions, including the Human Rights Commission. The intent, he wrote, is that community members could continue these efforts “as independent community organizations without reliance on city staff or resources, but with continued city partnerships.”
The Fargo Human Relations Commission was founded in 2000 to promote acceptance and respect for diversity and discourage all forms of discrimination. In 2021, it was renamed the Human Rights Commission, according to the city website. 
Fargo City Commissioner John Strand was among those who voted to disband the commission, but supported giving the group two months to come up with a different structure. He said there’s value in government hearing from diverse voices, but city advisory boards are limited by finances and governmental procedures. He said the board could be more effective if it doesn’t fall entirely under city jurisdiction.
He would like to see the Human Rights Commission morph into an entity that has appeal to the broader community.
“My hope is we can develop something that is connected to others in the state,” he said. “I would still like to see a city liaison appointed to the entity.”
Human rights commissions act as a local safeguard for civil rights and to promote inclusion. But these types of groups are not often established by local governments in North Dakota. 
The Minot City Council discussed restoring a human relations committee in 2023, but ultimately voted to dissolve it, according to meeting minutes.
Grand Forks has not had a human rights committee associated with city government in the past two decades, according to John Bernstrom, the city’s public information officer.
Sargianna Wutzke is chair of the Bismarck Human Relations Committee. She said a couple years ago, a Bismarck city commissioner observed there wasn’t a place for community members to talk about important issues. In response, the committee started a quarterly forum on topics of importance. 
Over the past year, the committee has hosted open conversations on issues like housing, accessibility and transportation. The format starts with presentations from experts and people with lived experience. Then the public is invited to share concerns and possible solutions.
A recent event on addressing homelessness drew a standing-room-only crowd, Wutzke said.
“We celebrate all the citizens and diverse populations we have here,” Wutzke said. “People want engagement on issues that matter.”

Engagement is key to building connections and empathy that can lead to stronger communities, said Dalton Erickson, executive director of the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition, a statewide, member-based organization that has no direct connection to the Fargo group.
In a perfect world, local human rights groups would hold the local governments accountable, he said. They would ensure that all community members are heard and seen and able to exercise their human rights, he said.
“But local governments often don’t want to take on the tough civil rights issues like housing and accessible health care and federal over-reach,” Erickson said.
The loss of the Fargo Human Rights Commission should be concerning, Erickson said. But he’s also optimistic that a change after 25 years could provide some new ways of thinking and acting.
“They also could look at this as an opportunity to restructure and empower people,” Erickson said.

“I have to depart,” he said, adding that his community was “being terrorized.”
Piecing together information and constituent calls, he left the Omaha-Douglas County Civic Center that June 10 believing that at least two raids were happening. It turned out to be one. “So I have to go. I have to try and help.”
Garcia, a Douglas County Board member since 2021, provided updates about the Glenn Valley Foods worksite enforcement operation to the public using social media. The federal raid initially arrested roughly 80 alleged undocumented workers. He’s continued serving in a watchdog role in the ramp up of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in the Omaha area.
Garcia was one of three people recognized this weekend by Douglas County and the City of Omaha with a 2026 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Aspire to Inspire award. The awards are presented annually to people who, according to a joint county-city statement, exemplify the slain civil rights leader’s vision of diversity, inclusivity and equality.

A nominator called Garcia a “caring and courageous fighter and defender of social and political freedoms.”
“I know he will always show up, fight and stand up for what’s right and for what’s good, just like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.”
Two recipients are public servants. Among the honored was Lt. Antwone Finch of the Omaha Police Department, who, according to the statement, “gives back to the community that shaped him.” 
Born and raised in North Omaha, Finch is a longtime member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity who has supported numerous charitable initiatives. With a focus on guiding youth, he has participated in Shop With a Cop, a program that annually connects kids from homeless shelters with Christmas gifts, and founded the “Before the Casket” gun violence prevention program.
The committee of county and city representatives that reviewed nominations also selected mixed martial artist Houston Alexander as the MLK community recipient — for his commitment to helping youth. 
In 2018, Alexander founded a foundation that provides free mentoring, education, fitness and cultural programs that promote positive lifestyles. The awards committee said Alexander’s “Culture Shock Tour” has reached more than 450 Nebraska schools, teaching the history of hip-hop while promoting self-expression, anti-bullying and nonviolent conflict resolution.

The three award winners were celebrated during an event Friday at the Omaha-Douglas County Civic Center that featured music and remarks, including from Mayor John Ewing Jr. and Omaha Human Rights and Relations Director Cailin Daly Dejillas.
Also in recognition of MLK, the Omaha Human Rights and Relations Department on Jan. 19 is hosting a “Living the Dream” eighth annual high school talent competition.
The 5:30 p.m. event at the Holland Performing Arts Center spotlights music, dance, social justice speeches and art by Omaha-area students in grades 7-12, and is free and open to the public.
Local and state government offices are closed Jan. 19 in recognition of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.

Lawyers for Attorney General Lynn Fitch and State Auditor Shad White will argue before the Mississippi Supreme Court on Tuesday over which of them has the right to claw back state money they believe was illegally spent.

Fitch believes she has the exclusive right to file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state. White contends state law gives him the authority to file a suit to recoup funds in some instances.

The issue is over a section of Mississippi law stating that the state auditor is “to institute suit, and the attorney general shall prosecute the same in any court of the state,” when recovering misspent tax dollars.

Fitch first took White to court when the auditor attempted to sue Pro Football Hall of Fame athlete Brett Favre to recoup allegedly misspent welfare money. A Hinds County chancery judge disagreed with Fitch, so the attorney general appealed to the state’s highest court.

The two officials have said they’re considering running for governor and have clashed in recent years over the handling of Mississippi’s massive welfare scandal, which has seen multiple people plead guilty to state and federal crimes.

(Photo: Memphis Public Libraries)As Memphis pauses to honor Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, let us not forget that he gave his life in this city while standing with sanitation workers demanding dignity, respect, and a voice on the job.
Honoring Dr. King requires more than ceremony. It requires action.
Dr. King came to Memphis in 1968 because city workers were being denied basic rights and protections. He understood that economic justice is inseparable from racial justice and that workers must have the freedom to organize and bargain collectively in order to live with dignity. As he said, “The labor movement was the principal force that transformed misery and despair into hope and progress.”
More than 50 years later, many of us city workers here in Memphis are still fighting for that same dignity. Fifty years later and there is still so much work left to do.
We are Memphis library workers. Every day, we serve this city by keeping public libraries safe, welcoming spaces for learning, connection, and opportunity. We help students with homework, job seekers with applications, families with access to technology, and neighbors seeking information and support. Libraries are one of the few truly public spaces left in our city, and the people who staff them are essential public servants. 



People don’t come to the library just for the books—they come because of the library workers. Yet despite the vital role we play, Memphis library workers are denied the rights and protections afforded to other city employees. 


The work we do is hard but I wouldn’t trade it. At my library I’ve been able to give out lunches to kids, I’ve helped people apply for jobs and had them come back and tell me they got a job offer, I’ve had students in my fiber arts class begin to be able to teach the basics to newer attendees, and though sometimes I have to look a person in the eye and tell them we don’t have what they need, I have witnessed how quick a library worker is with an inventive solution. People don’t come to the library just for the books—they come because of the library workers.
Yet despite the vital role we play, library workers are denied the rights and protections afforded to other city employees.
Library workers are not classified as civil service employees. That means fewer job protections, less stability, and no guaranteed voice in decisions that affect our wages, staffing levels safety, or working conditions. On top of that, a 1984 executive order still denies many city workers the right to collectively bargain, silencing some of the very voices that keep Memphis running.
The consequences of these policies show up in understaffed libraries, high turnover, burnout and workers struggling to keep up with a rising cost of living. When workers lack protections and a meaningful voice, public services suffer, and so do the communities that rely on them.
This is not what Dr. King fought for. When he stood with sanitation workers in Memphis, he was clear that public workers deserved respect, fair treatment and the power to negotiate collectively. He believed unions and collective bargaining were essential tools for democracy and economic fairness, especially for Black and working-class workers.
Memphis, of all cities, should understand these basic rights.
That is why, on this MLK Day, we have two demands.
First, Memphis City Council must reclassify library workers as civil service employees. Civil service status would provide basic protections, fairness and stability for workers who dedicate their careers to serving the public. It would also strengthen our libraries by improving retention and morale, ensuring that Memphians can continue to rely on high-quality public services. 
Second, Mayor Paul Young must amend the 1984 executive order that denies city workers the right to collectively bargain. No worker should be silenced for wanting a seat at the table. Collective bargaining is not radical, it is a common-sense way for workers and city leadership to solve problems together. 
On January 27, library workers and supporters will be gathering at Memphis City Hall for a press conference before the third reading of the referendum to reclassify the library division as civil service. 
If Memphis truly wants to honor Dr. King, we must do more than remember his sacrifice. We must continue his work. That means respecting city workers, listening to their voices, and ensuring that those who serve the public have dignity and protections. Show that Memphis has learned from its past and is committed to a more just future for all.
Words alone do not preserve Dr. King’s legacy. Policies do.

Gillis is among the Perryman residents concerned by proposals from Constellation Energy for a new natural gas power plant close to the community. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Since moving to her home in Harford County’s Perryman neighborhood in 2017, Tamie Wainwright has replaced her mailbox three times, after it was destroyed by traffic crashes.
She watches tractor trailers rush past at all hours of the day, heading toward nearby warehouses for companies like Wayfair and Sephora.
“It’s 24/7,” said Wainwright, a lifelong county resident.
And she’s seen pileups quickly trap traffic in her suburban neighborhood, which has only a few exits because it is bounded on one side by the Bush River and on the other by the sprawling military base at Aberdeen Proving Grounds.
“Our roads can’t handle it. My yard can’t handle it anymore,” Wainwright said.
It’s one reason a group of residents, called 3P Protect Perryman Peninsula, formed a public campaign to stop additional warehouse developments, promote infrastructure improvements and protect the local environment.

Now, they’re facing a new potential foe.
In November, Constellation Energy unveiled plans for a new natural gas-fired power plant in Perryman, on the same site as an existing plant that the company runs.
It’s not clear the proposal will advance. For one thing, Constellation has said that routing a new gas pipeline to the site could cost some $800 million, and the company is seeking financial help from an already cash-strapped state government. But the idea has stirred frustration in a small community already beset by industrial activity.
“For me, it was shock,” said Stacy Stone, who said her family has lived in the community for the last 50 years. “It was just shock that they would have such disrespect for our community after we’ve been vocal all this time.”
Constellation spokesman Paul Adams said the company “has a long history of operating safely and responsibly at our Perryman Generating Station in Aberdeen, Md., and that includes regularly engaging with community leaders and other stakeholders.”
“Nothing about that will change as we potentially develop additional natural gas and battery storage generating capacity at that location,” Adams wrote.
Constellation’s proposal came under a new state law that opened a “fast-track” permitting process for new energy generation in Maryland, a response to high electric bills.
The Public Service Commission determined last month that the company’s proposals —  a smaller 150-megawatt plant or a larger 564-megawatt facility — had met all of the legislature’s requirements to move through the fast-track, which would grant them a permit decision within 295 days after they file a complete application. That has yet to be filed.
Constellation’s proposal for 800 megawatts of battery storage on the Perryman site did not meet the fast-track requirements, but the company could still pursue it.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The state’s rush to bolster new power infrastructure could come into conflict with its own ambitious climate change mandates, which give Maryland until 2031 to reduce its globe-warming emissions 60% from 2006 levels. Achieving those reductions already presents a challenge. Building a new emissions-generating power plant would essentially render it impossible.
Meanwhile, residents worry about what a new power plant could mean for their health, the health of the river and the infrastructure of a neighborhood that they already consider overburdened by industry. They also worry that their concerns could fall by the wayside amid the expedited process.
“I’m not at all opposed to growth,” resident Glenn Gillis said. “You’ve got to do it with a sense of balance. And what we’ve seen here has been that the balance has been completely out of sync.”
‘They don’t know until it slaps them in the face’
In many ways, Perryman is a place where the urban and rural collide.
The drive in from bustling Route 40 passes a truck stop and a warehouse, but also grassy fields and the folksy Perryman Grocery — advertising cold cut sandwiches, beer and liquor.
To get to Perryman Grocery, the only grocery within walking distance, residents need to walk along busy, two-lane Perryman Road, which has no sidewalks to protect them. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)
To Glenn Dudderar, a 25-year neighborhood, that spot has come to represent the ways Perryman’s infrastructure isn’t keeping up with its rapid development into a Harford County shipping hub.
As cars, trucks and tractor trailers whizz past on two-lane Perryman Road,  Dudderar constantly notices pedestrians walking toward Perryman Grocery — the only shop within walking distance — without sidewalks or crosswalks to protect them.
As a former vice president of the Perryman Community Association, Dudderar says he pushed the county to build sidewalks along Perryman Road beginning in the early 2000s. Only recently has the idea seemed to gain momentum, though no construction has begun.
“We were going to bring trucks through that area,” Dudderar said. “And now we’re talking about a generation plant. We still haven’t solved the sidewalk problem.”
The neighborhood includes a mixture of riverfront homes small and large, but also a mobile home community and a series of squat three-story apartment buildings that include some low-income residents receiving government assistance.
“You have some very affluent people that live on the water there, but then you have some people that are living day-to-day,” said Del. Andre V. Johnson Jr. (D- Harford) who represents the area. “They’re working. They don’t know what’s really happening as far as these — whether it’s the Constellation [proposal], or whether it’s these warehouses — they don’t know until it slaps them in the face.”
Johnson says he isn’t necessarily opposed to the idea of another power plant in Perryman, but believes that residents ought to have plenty of say — starting with a public meeting in the community to air their concerns.
Constellation’s site, directly across the railroad tracks from many homes in Perryman, already includes a five-unit, 404-megawatt electric generation facility. Four of the units are oil-fueled combustion turbines, which can start quickly to supply the grid during times of peak demand. The fifth, added in 1995, is fueled by natural gas.
The Maryland Department of the Environment considers the area both overburdened by pollution and underserved, with high percentages of low-income, nonwhite and non-English-speaking individuals. The Perryman Census tract got an “environmental justice” score of 81.8 out of 100, placing it among the most-burdened tracts in the state.
Johnson argues that efforts to maintain agricultural lands in the northern portion of Harford County, while still encouraging development, has come at a cost to his more suburban district.

“In the upper end of the county, which they would consider to be God’s country, if they don’t want something, like solar or building a new gas plant … they’ll just shove it down into my district,” Johnson said. “And I don’t think that that’s right for my constituents.”
A resistance is born
Back in 2021, Perryman resident Leigh Maddox only found out about the warehouse proposal because of a small advertisement buried in a newspaper.
Developers were aiming to transform the corn fields near the entrance to the neighborhood into a sprawling freight terminal, complete with warehouses and thousands of parking spaces for cars and tractor trailers.
Perhaps best known for its locally canned white “shoe-peg” corn, Mitchell Farm had been operating since the 1800s. Wainwright can trace her family history back to ancestors who were enslaved on the farm.
For a community already surrounded by warehouses, train tracks and industrial sites, the proposal for the Mitchell site was a step too far.
“That galvanized us,” Gillis said.
In early 2022, residents formed 3P and began appearing in force at public meetings to oppose the project. Later, they would even file suit against the developers.
And they may have won that battle. In 2023, the Harford County Council amended zoning rules so that only 250,000 square feet of warehouse space could go on the property, a dramatic reduction from the 5 million square feet originally planned.
The next battlefront
The two plants proposed by Constellation would each generate about 1,000 pounds of globe-warming carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour, according to the company’s proposals.
But burning fossil fuels also means elevated concentrations of ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter, which can aggravate heart and lung disease, and lead to heart attacks, asthma attacks and strokes.

The proposals from Constellation also come as President Donald Trump’s (R) administration is proposing to roll back some air pollution rules for power plants.
“If this gets built at its current state of environmental protections, it appears more conscious to the community members, right? But I don’t think that that will necessarily stick around,” said Debbie Patton, a Perryman homeowner for the last 15 years. “That concerns me for my own personal health, for all of my neighbors’ health and all of the wildlife in this area.”
All the while, some experts aren’t convinced that new power generation even needs to be built in Maryland, including David Lapp, Maryland’s people’s counsel, who is charged with representing utility ratepayers.
Lapp said that a transmission line currently under construction by Baltimore Gas & Electric to address the retirement of the Brandon Shores and Wagner power plants in Anne Arundel County will solve congestion problems that forced Baltimore-area residents to pay more for power than others on the same electric grid.
“To build a power plant to serve the same purpose would be forcing ratepayers to double-pay for the same reliability benefit” Lapp said. “We can benefit from the generation that is built in the place where it is cheapest to build that generation, which may not be Maryland.”
That may be in Pennsylvania, home to substantial stores of natural gas, Lapp says.
It’s the prospect of pipeline construction, possibly from Pennsylvania, that truly worries Gunpowder Riverkeeper Theaux Le Gardeur, who also focuses on Perryman’s Bush River.
“The footprint of the gas plant is not the issue,” he said. “The issue is how the gas plant is fed.”
To build a pipeline, construction crews would have to clear foliage along the route. Even with some replanting, mature trees and other plant life would be lost, critical bulwarks against rushing rainwater that carries all the pollutants of human development, from lawn fertilizers to car exhaust fumes.

“The first thing that goes are the trees, and then the scrub wetlands go, and then we go back to, like, grass,” Le Gardeur said. “We’re losing that idea of forest and wetlands in providing natural stormwater controls.”
Controlling urban and suburban stormwater is among the greatest challenges facing the Chesapeake Bay. Stormwater pollution has increased since bay restoration efforts started in 1985, while pollution from other major sources, such as farm fields and sewage treatment plants, has declined.
Adams, of Constellation, said that “environmental and economic justice” is a “bedrock principle” for the company.
“Any new gas generation at our Perryman site would require significant new gas pipeline expansion. As Maryland policymakers consider proposals for new gas generation and related infrastructure, we encourage community members to take part in that conversation,” Adams wrote.
As he sat at his neighbor’s kitchen table among other community leaders during a recent meeting, Greg LaCour couldn’t help but gaze out the window toward the Bush River, which was dappled with ice.
And then, he saw them. A pair of bald eagles, soaring through the gray January sky. He interrupted the meeting to point them out.
“They’ve got a young one, and right now they’re teaching the young one how to fish,” LaCour said.
“I’m not kidding,” he said. “That’s part of our community.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC09894-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-19 08:58:20.177931

Deborah Fellela, a Johnston Democrat. Her bill aims to eliminate any potential surprises for customers. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Johnston Democratic Rep. Deborah Fellela wants businesses to be up-front about their surcharges for customers who pay with credit cards.  
Fellela’s bill, H7022, introduced Jan. 9 in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, would amend the state’s Unfair Sales Practices law to require businesses to clearly disclose any fees or surcharges that are added when customers pay by credit card.
Fellela wrote in a statement Friday morning that surcharges are “a popular option for small businesses who need to offset the costs of accepting those cards.” Merchants typically pay around 2% to 3% of a purchase when a customer pays with a credit card, and they can pay more on reward cards, which is why proprietors try to recoup these fees through surcharges. According to a March 2025 issue of the Nilson Report, in 2024 U.S. merchants paid $187.20 billion in fees to accept card payments for $11.902 trillion worth of goods and services.
“However, since those surcharges can vary from business to business, there is often confusion on the part of the consumer, who may not understand that these charges even exist,” Fellela wrote. “This bill would require an explanation that is clearly visible, rather than one that’s disguised by fine print.”
Surcharges passed on to customers are usually a comparable percentage to what the retailer pays. Card networks often cap the additional cost a merchant can charge, with Visa permitting a maximum of 3% while Mastercard maxes out at 4%.  
Under Fellela’s bill, which sports three other Democratic sponsors, surcharge notices would have to be posted in a conspicuous, clearly visible spot where customers pay for their purchases. At restaurants, the notice would have to be included on all menus. The surcharge amount or percentage would need to be included as well.
“Failure to provide the required notice shall be considered an unfair or deceptive trade practice and subject to enforcement under this chapter,” the legislation reads.
If the bill were to become law this legislative session, it would take effect Jan. 1, 2027.
Fellela’s bill now waits to be scheduled for a hearing in the House Committee on Corporations.
Similar legislation and guidelines have emerged in other states. Minnesota requires signage and oral notification of surcharges. A law passed in 2021 in Colorado caps surcharges at 2% and requires clear disclosure as well. And New York Governor Kathy Hochul instituted similar disclosure requirements in 2024.
A 2025 report by market research firm J.D. Power found that 34% of the 3,841 small businesses it surveyed said they added retail surcharges for credit-swiping customers. The same survey found that 41% of credit card users said they’ve decided not to use a card at a business because of a surcharge. Another J.D. Power survey from later in 2025 noted a drop in customer satisfaction when people are forced to pay a surcharge.    
Similarly, in a November 2025 survey by Lendingtree, 62% of cardholders reported they paid extra to use their credit card. About one-third said they weren’t aware of surcharges beforehand. Still, 46% of cardholders said they did not realize card networks made money off transactions.
Although some merchants will charge a fee for any card payment, debit cards are supposed to be exempt from surcharges. Both Visa and Mastercard have rules prohibiting surcharges on debit or prepaid cards, even if a customer opts to process their card as credit.

(Louis Edward Nollau Nitrate Photographic Print Collection, University of Kentucky Libraries, Special Collections Research Center)When e-commerce billionaire Marc Lore announced his plans in 2021 to build a city called Telosa — a 150,000-acre metropolis for 5 million people, designed from scratch with autonomous vehicles, renewable energy, and a new economic model he calls “Equitism” — most observers imagined a desert setting. The architectural renderings from Bjarke Ingels Group showed gleaming towers rising from arid landscapes dotted with cacti and sagebrush.
But buried in the project’s early announcements was a surprise: Appalachia was listed as one of six potential locations, alongside Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Arizona and Texas. A two-decade Western drought that has lowered the Colorado River to emergency levels may well turn the planners to the mountains as the best alternative.
Marc Lore (LinkedIn)
By 2022, the Telosa team had narrowed their search to three western states. Yet the Appalachian option has never been formally ruled out, and the region continues to surface in discussions about the project. For those of us who have spent decades studying how outsiders have tried to remake the mountains — and how those efforts have fared — the prospect of an e-commerce billionaire dropping a futuristic city into the coalfields or another part of the region raises questions that go far deeper than site selection.
We have been here before. The mountains have served as a laboratory for planned communities, model towns and social engineering experiments for more than a century. From the company towns built by U.S. Steel to Eleanor Roosevelt’s beloved Arthurdale to the TVA’s showcase community at Norris, outsiders with grand visions have repeatedly seen Appalachia as a blank slate waiting to be filled with their dreams.
The results have been decidedly mixed. Before anyone plants Telosa in our hills, they should understand this history — and grapple with a fundamental question that has defined Appalachian development for generations: Who owns the land, and who gets to decide what happens on it?
What Lore wants to build
Lore made his fortune in e-commerce, not Silicon Valley tech. A native of Staten Island who grew up in New Jersey, he founded Jet.com (sold to Walmart for $3.3 billion) and Quidsi, parent company of Diapers.com (sold to Amazon for $545 million). After serving as Walmart’s e-commerce chief, he turned his attention to what he describes as reinventing how cities work.
The project has attracted notable supporters. Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and a childhood friend of Lore’s, has been actively involved in planning. At a 2022 town hall covered by Smart Cities Dive, Bharara spoke about the opportunity to build better civic institutions from scratch: “You don’t have to have a police department that has been marred by scandal and excessive use of force. You don’t have to have a local prison system like Rikers Island.” Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, whose firm designed Copenhagen’s innovative Copenhill waste-to-energy plant, serves as lead architect. Lore’s business partner Alex Rodriguez, the former baseball star with whom he purchased the Minnesota Timberwolves, has also been involved.
The Telosa project, named from the Greek word telos meaning “highest purpose,” promises to be “the most open, most fair and most inclusive city in the world.” The design calls for 36 mixed-use districts, each organized around the “15-minute city” concept where residents can reach work, schools, health care and recreation within a short walk or bike ride. Fossil-fuel vehicles would be banned. Renewable energy would power everything. Autonomous vehicles and even flying cars would move people and goods.
At the heart of the project is “Equitism,” Lore’s economic model based loosely on the ideas of 19th-century economist Henry George. Under this system, the land would be owned by a community foundation rather than individual property owners. As the city grows and land values rise, the foundation would capture that appreciation and use it to fund social services — health care, education, small business development — without burdening residents with high taxes.
“There’s a finite amount of land and that land was claimed generations ago,” Lore has written on the Telosa project website. “Land could essentially go from a barren piece of desert to a modern-day city worth billions, or even trillions. What if that land had been owned by a community endowment?”
It’s an intriguing question. But it’s not a new one in Appalachia.
Why Appalachia made the list
When Cardinal News editor Dwayne Yancey examined the Telosa proposal in 2021, he noted something that other commentators had missed: Despite all the desert imagery, the Appalachian region remained officially in play.
“Virtually all the news coverage of Telosa described it as a desert oasis,” Yancey wrote. “‘Former Walmart president reveals plan for $400 billion Utopian city in the US desert,’ headlined USA Today. And, sure enough, all the artists’ conceptions by the architectural firm show a desert backdrop with cacti and sagebrush. And yet … there’s still that sixth Appalachian option.”
Yancey explored what an Appalachian Telosa might mean for Southwest Virginia. The region, he noted, is “arguably underpopulated” — Buchanan County has lost nearly half its population since 1980, declining from 37,989 to around 20,000 today. “There’s plenty of room for more people.”
The practical advantages are considerable. Unlike the desert Southwest, Appalachia has abundant water — rivers, aquifers and reliable rainfall that could sustain a large population without the massive infrastructure investments required for desert living. Land costs are far lower than in the growth corridors of Nevada or Arizona. The region sits within reasonable distance of major metropolitan areas: Knoxville, Lexington, Roanoke and Charleston are all within a few hours’ drive.
But Yancey also raised the harder questions. A city of 50,000 — the initial phase of Telosa — would dwarf the existing population of most Appalachian localities. “That wouldn’t just change the culture of a county,” he observed. “It would create a new one. Is that desirable?”
That question cuts to the heart of Appalachian development debates that have raged for more than a century.
The company town model: Lynch, Kentucky

In 1917, U.S. Coal and Coke Company, a subsidiary of U.S. Steel, began building what would become the largest coal camp in the world on 19,000 acres in Harlan County. They named it Lynch, after company president Thomas Lynch.
By the 1940s, Lynch had a population of 10,000 and employed more than 4,000 workers. The company provided amenities that were remarkable for the time and place: quality housing built of local stone, a hospital, schools, a movie theater, churches, and recreational facilities. Housing was subsidized; no worker paid more than 25 percent of their salary for rent. The company store offered goods at competitive prices.
Lynch was considered one of the model coal camps in Appalachia because of its relatively high quality of life compared to the typical coal camp. The town attracted workers from across the globe — by 1926, it was described as “the new melting pot,” home to immigrants from Germany, Hungary, Austria, Serbia, Poland, Greece, Italy, Russia and dozens of other countries, alongside African Americans from the Deep South and local mountaineers. As historian William Turner documents in “The Harlan Renaissance,” the African American community in Lynch created a vibrant cultural life despite the constraints of segregation, building institutions that would shape generations.
But Lynch was also a closed community where the company controlled every aspect of political and economic life. U.S. Coal and Coke maintained its own police force, used not only to keep order but to intimidate workers who showed interest in unionization and to keep organizers out of town. The battles between coal operators and miners in Harlan County during this period earned the region the name “Bloody Harlan.”
When the company no longer needed Lynch, it simply walked away. U.S. Steel began tearing down buildings in the 1960s and sold what remained to residents. Today, Lynch has fewer than 700 people — a 93% decline from its peak. The rails that once carried millions of tons of coal to steel mills in Gary, Indiana, were abandoned in 1996.
The lesson of Lynch is sobering: Even a “model” company town serves the interests of its corporate owner first. When those interests change, the community is left to fend for itself with whatever infrastructure remains.
 TVA’s social laboratory: Norris, Tennessee

When Franklin Roosevelt appointed Arthur Morgan to chair the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933, he got more than a flood-control engineer. Morgan had spent the previous decade as president of Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, where he pioneered a cooperative education model combining work and study. He was a utopian who saw TVA as “little less than a means of reinventing civilization.” His grand vision went far beyond dams and power lines — he wanted to transform how people in the Tennessee Valley lived.
His fellow TVA director David Lilienthal would later call the agency “democracy on the march” — a phrase that carried considerable irony given that three appointed directors held total control over a seven-state utility with no meaningful accountability to the people whose lives they were transforming. What began as America’s boldest experiment in public planning would end up, as I wrote in American Heritage magazine in 1977, as the nation’s first flirtation with socialism that devolved into little more than a gigantic federally owned utility.
The human cost was staggering. TVA displaced approximately 125,000 people to create its dams and generating stations — families who had lived on that land for generations, removed with minimal compensation and little say in the matter. And the agency’s appetite for cheap electricity led directly to one of Appalachia’s greatest environmental catastrophes: TVA promoted and enabled the introduction of strip mining to Eastern Kentucky and the broader region, devastating mountaintops and hollows that had sustained communities for centuries.
Norris, Tennessee, was Morgan’s showcase. Built to house workers constructing Norris Dam, the town was designed as a permanent demonstration of cooperative living. Working with landscape architect Earle Draper, Morgan created a community that emphasized walkability, natural materials and communal facilities. Houses were modest but modern, built with native stone and cedar, each equipped with electric heating and refrigerators — luxuries in Depression-era Appalachia. A greenbelt of protected forest surrounded the residential areas.
Morgan dreamed that Norris would become economically self-sustaining through local industry — particularly ceramics, using native materials and traditional skills. It never worked out as he hoped. The ceramics venture failed, and Norris never developed an independent economic base.
More troubling was the town’s racial policy. TVA excluded Black families from Norris, claiming they were simply following local customs. Black leaders pointed out that this was false — the races had lived and worked together in the local mountains and valleys for generations. The policy was federal discrimination imposed on a region that, for all its problems, had more racial integration than the planned community that was supposed to represent the future.
Morgan clashed repeatedly with his fellow TVA directors over his ambitious social engineering and was fired by Roosevelt in 1938. The federal government sold Norris at auction in 1948; a Philadelphia consortium bought the entire town for just over $2 million and resold individual homes to residents.
Today, Norris survives as a pleasant bedroom community for Knoxville and Oak Ridge. Its design still wins admirers among urban planners. But Morgan’s dream of a self-sustaining model community that would “reinvent civilization” never materialized. Even TVA’s own institutional history acknowledges that Morgan “proved far more adept at technical engineering than at social engineering.”
Eleanor Roosevelt’s heartbreak: Arthurdale

No New Deal project was more personal to Eleanor Roosevelt than Arthurdale, a subsistence homestead community in Preston County, West Virginia.
In 1933, the first lady visited the Scotts Run mining camps near Morgantown and was devastated by what she found: families living in filthy, crowded housing without sanitation, children going hungry, a community hollowed out by the collapse of the coal industry. She threw herself into creating something better.
Arthurdale was the first of what would eventually be about 100 homestead communities built by the federal government during the Depression. The vision was to move struggling families out of failed industrial communities and onto small farms where they could achieve a measure of self-sufficiency while working in nearby industries.
On roughly 1,200 acres, the government built 165 homes with indoor plumbing, modern appliances and furniture — amenities that seemed miraculous to families coming from Scotts Run. An experimental school operated on progressive educational principles developed by John Dewey’s disciple Elsie Ripley Clapp. The community operated cooperatively, with residents working together to support the town.
Construction on the first 50 houses in Arthurdale started in 1933. The prefabricated homes were made by the E.F. Hodgson Company in New England. In keeping with the plan that Arthurdale be a self-sufficient farming community, each home came with a barn and hen and hog houses. The homes had a complete basement mostly used to preserve farm produce. The federal government additionally provided each house with electricity, indoor plumbing, refrigerators and coal-fired furnaces. (Arthurdale Heritage)
But Arthurdale struggled from the start. The government had difficulty attracting industry to the remote location — a problem that would doom many of the “stranded community” homesteads. Cost overruns drew fierce criticism in Congress. The selection process for residents was criticized as arbitrary and paternalistic, favoring applicants who “seem likely to welcome supervision and guidance from project administrators.”
Most damaging, the program required that applicants be white, native-born, Christian and part of a “standard nuclear family” — federal discrimination that excluded many of those most in need.
The federal government closed down Arthurdale in 1947, selling the land and buildings to private owners. The community survives today, with many original structures preserved in a museum complex. Historians still debate whether it was a noble experiment that failed for lack of sustained support, or a cautionary tale about the limits of social planning.
What’s beyond dispute is that the model didn’t scale. The subsistence homesteads that succeeded were those closest to cities with industrial employment. The isolated communities — the ones most like Appalachian coalfield towns — could not create self-sustaining economies.
Oak Ridge: The exception that proves the rule

If you want to see what unlimited federal resources and a singular mission can accomplish, look at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
In 1942, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers forcibly purchased nearly 60,000 acres of farmland along the Clinch River, evicted about 4,000 residents, and built a secret city from scratch. Designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Oak Ridge was intended to house workers for the Manhattan Project’s uranium enrichment facilities.
Original plans called for 13,000 residents. By war’s end, Oak Ridge was Tennessee’s fifth-largest city, with 75,000 people. The government built 300 miles of roads, 55 miles of railroad track, 10 schools, seven theaters, 17 restaurants and 13 supermarkets. A library, symphony orchestra and churches for 17 denominations served the community. Housing ranged from single-family homes to dormitories to the infamous “hutments” — one-room shacks assigned primarily to Black workers, who were segregated by race and generally relegated to lower-status jobs.

Oak Ridge succeeded as a production facility because it had what no other planned community in Appalachia has ever had: essentially unlimited funding (60% of the Manhattan Project’s $2 billion budget flowed through Oak Ridge), an existential national purpose, and total government control over every aspect of the operation.
When the war ended, Oak Ridge had to reinvent itself. The government retained control until the 1950s, then gradually opened the city. Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Y-12 National Security Complex continue to operate, providing an economic anchor that most planned communities never achieve.
The lesson is not encouraging for Telosa’s prospects: Oak Ridge worked because the federal government was willing to spend virtually any amount of money to achieve a wartime objective. When the mission ended, the community survived because major federal facilities remained. No private-sector project, however well-funded, can replicate those conditions.
The central question: Who owns the land?
In 1973, I wrote in the Mountain Eagle of Whitesburg in Southeastern Kentucky: “If Appalachia is to survive, land reform is a must.” Fifty-two years later, I stand by that assessment.
The fundamental problem with every outside-imposed development scheme in Appalachia — whether company town, New Deal homestead or billionaire’s utopia — is that it leaves the basic structure of land ownership intact. The mountains have been owned by outside interests since the late 19th century, when land agents acquired vast holdings from families who didn’t understand what they were signing away. Coal and timber companies accumulated millions of acres, extracted the wealth, and left behind devastation.
Today, the situation is largely unchanged. A 2013 study by the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy found that six West Virginia counties have 50% or more of their land owned by just 25 landowners. Five of those six are in the southern coalfields. Not one of the state’s top 10 private landowners is headquartered in West Virginia.
After every flood, more families ask whether it makes sense to rebuild at the bottom of a hollow when idle corporate land sits unused on the ridgelines above. In Eastern Kentucky, a former strip mine on the Knott-Perry line is the planned site of the Olive Branch development. (Governor’s office)
Lore’s “Equitism” model at least grapples with land ownership — he proposes that a community foundation would own all the land and capture rising values for public benefit. But there’s a crucial difference between a foundation controlled by residents and one established by a billionaire who selects the initial governance structure.
A more promising model already exists in Appalachia, though it has never achieved the scale it deserves. In 1977, Marie Cirillo and her neighbors in the Clearfork Valley of northeastern Tennessee established the Woodland Community Land Trust. Working with land trust pioneers Robert Swann and Susan Witt, they created a structure where the community owns the land collectively and leases it to residents for housing, small business and agriculture.
The community land trust model keeps land affordable permanently through resale restrictions, prevents outside speculation and ensures that decisions about land use are made democratically by the people who live there. It’s the opposite of both the company town model and the billionaire-imposed utopia: Control flows from the bottom up, not the top down.
I’ve proposed a modern Homestead Act for Central Appalachia built on these principles. The plan would use existing legal frameworks — Virginia’s Land Bank Entities Act, federal brownfields protections, Appalachian Regional Commission programs — to acquire tax-delinquent and abandoned corporate land and redistribute it through community land trusts. Homesteaders would own their homes and improvements while the trust retains ownership of the underlying land, preventing speculation and ensuring permanent affordability.
This approach addresses what outside planners have consistently gotten wrong. It doesn’t try to “modernize the mountaineer” or impose someone else’s vision of the good life. It puts land and decision-making power in the hands of the people who will live with the consequences.
Would Telosa be different?
To be fair, Lore’s vision differs from the company towns and New Deal homesteads in important ways. He explicitly rejects the paternalism of corporate-controlled communities. The Telosa governance structure, as currently described, would involve resident participation in decision-making. The economic model, whatever its flaws, at least attempts to share rising land values with the community rather than concentrating them in private hands.
And the region could certainly use investment. The coalfields face projected population losses of 26% to 48% by 2050 according to university demographic studies. Schools and clinics are closing. Volunteer fire departments can’t replace aging equipment. After every flood, more families ask whether it makes sense to rebuild at the bottom of a hollow when idle corporate land sits unused on the ridgelines above.
A project that brought 50,000 new residents — let alone 5 million — would transform the economic calculus overnight. New tax base, new businesses, new opportunities for young people who currently see no future in the mountains.
But that transformation comes with risks that Telosa’s planners have not seriously addressed.
First, who would these new residents be? The Telosa vision seems oriented toward attracting outsiders rather than providing opportunities for current Appalachian residents. The project emphasizes high-tech employment, advanced education and “diverse” demographics — admirable goals, but ones that could easily result in displacement of existing communities rather than their revitalization.
Second, what happens when the billionaire’s interest wanes or the project falls short of its astronomical ambitions? Lynch declined because U.S. Steel no longer needed its coal. Arthurdale struggled because the federal government couldn’t sustain interest in an expensive experiment. The history of planned communities is littered with projects that thrived during their founders’ enthusiasm and collapsed afterward.
Third, who makes the decisions? Lore talks about resident participation, but the initial governance structure would be established by his team. The community land trust model puts democratic control first, from the very beginning. Equitism puts democratic participation second, after the foundation has been established on terms set by outside investors.
A different path

Central Appalachia stands at a genuine inflection point. The coal economy that defined the region for more than a century is ending. Climate change brings floods that devastate communities built in hollows and valleys. Population decline threatens the critical mass needed to sustain basic services.
The question is not whether change is coming — it’s who will control that change and who will benefit from it.
One path leads through outside control: billionaires with visions, corporations seeking opportunities, investors looking for returns. This path has been well-traveled in Appalachia, and the results speak for themselves. Even the best-intentioned outside interventions have foundered on the basic problem of absentee ownership and control.
Another path leads through community ownership and democratic decision-making. This path is harder — it requires building institutions from the ground up, developing local leadership and insisting that the people who live with the consequences have the primary voice in shaping the future. But it’s the path that has proven durable in places like the Clearfork Valley, where Woodland Community Land Trust has now operated for nearly half a century.
If Marc Lore is serious about building a community that embodies equity and sustainability, he could do worse than to study what Appalachians have already built for themselves. The community land trust model demonstrates that you don’t need a billionaire’s money to create lasting, affordable, democratically-controlled development. What you need is land that belongs to the people who live on it, and the freedom to shape their own future.
That’s not a lesson that translates easily to a $400 billion megaproject. But it might be the most important lesson the mountains have to teach.

Virginia Senate Democrats advance mid-decade redistricting amendment

Unlike two other civil rights-related constitutional amendments that passed with bipartisan support over the past year, Virginia’s reproductive rights measure has faced intense debate at every stage, with every Republican in the legislature opposing it. 
In defending her amendment for the final time, Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, emphasized that advancing the proposal would ultimately leave the decision to voters across the state. 
Ranging from fertility treatments to contraception access to the ability to obtain an abortion, “this amendment protects families’ entire scope of reproductive needs,” she said. 
Boysko and several other Democratic lawmakers have described how women in states with abortion bans have died amid pregnancy complications. Those states have also seen an exodus of OB-GYN physicians amid uncertainty of treating patients who need abortions or miscarriage management.  
Boysko grew tearful as she recounted stories and advocacy shared by constituents and people around the state. 
Relatedly, Sen. Emily Jordan, R-Isle of Wight, struck a somber tone as she noted that “this is a difficult topic for a lot of people.”
On the opposite side of the chamber’s aisle — and in opposition to the amendment — Jordan unsuccessfully attempted to modify the proposal to explicitly spell out care for babies when born. 
A sticking point for some Republicans has been concern that the amendment could be interpreted to allow abortion up to the “moment of birth,”  though infanticide remains illegal under both state code and federal law. 
Sen. Tara Durant, R-Stafford, also attempted for the second legislative session in a row, to reiterate existing parental consent laws. Democrats and legal experts said it is unnecessary. Under Virginia law, minors are required to have parental or guardian consent for an abortion unless they petition a judge for authorization. 
On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, accused Republicans of employing delay tactics by pressing for their amendments to the amendment. 
“It is a delay tactic,” Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Rockbridge, said on Friday, as he urged lawmakers to re-draft the amendment. Doing so, however, would restart the two-year process.
 A sense of urgency

While not entirely a partisan issue at the national level, the issue has increasingly fallen along party lines in states. That dynamic, Virginia Wesleyan University professor Leslie Caughell said, helps explain why Democrats are moving quickly while they hold legislative majorities. 
Though placing language in the Constitution is difficult, it is also harder to undo. With every other Southern state imposing deep restrictions or near-total bans, bolstering Virginia’s protections has become a priority for Democrats. Providers and abortion funds in Virginia have also seen a surge in out-of-state patients seeking care.
“I think everything that happened in North Carolina made activists on this really uncomfortable,” Caughell said. 
In 2023, a member of the neighboring state’s legislature switched from Democrat to Republican, giving the GOP a veto-proof majority and paving the way for enactment of North Carolina’s current 12-week abortion limit. 
In Virginia, Republicans have also put forward a range of abortion restrictions, from near-total bans to a 15-week cap that lacked exceptions for fetal anomalies — which are often not detected until around or after 15 weeks. 
On other reproductive health issues, a right-to-contraception bill has twice been vetoed by former Gov. Glenn Youngkin — a point Boysko reiterated as the amendment advanced last week. 
 ‘Yes’ and “No’ campaigns on the horizon

Reproductive rights groups in Virginia, along with physicians and volunteers, have coordinated as part the national Reproductive Freedom for All effort. Last year, a $5 million investment supported targeted initiatives ranging from canvassing to digital advertising in states such as Virginia, where Abigail Spanberger was elected governor.
Spanberger campaigned in part on supporting the amendment, though governors do not formally factor into its success or failure. 
“I look forward to spending ample time in advance of the 2026 elections campaigning to make sure that people understand the importance of this constitutional amendment,” she told The Mercury last summer. 
On the other side, SBA Pro-Life America supported Virginia-based anti-abortion groups last year through door-knocking efforts in key House of Delegates districts that were up for election. 
Democrats ultimately grew their majority by flipping additional seats. 
The abortion-opposing group “doesn’t have anything to share on the Virginia front at this time,” Communications Director Kelsey Pritchard said in an email, but the organization is monitoring Virginia among other states as it prepares to engage voters. 
Virginians for Reproductive Freedom — which includes organizations like Repro Rising and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia —  will likely ramp up public engagement events and advertising as the November elections approach. 
Caughell said she is watching closely to see how Virginia’s constitutional amendment campaigns intersect with this year’s congressional midterm elections. 
The measures — which include redistricting, reproductive rights, same-sex marriage rights and voting rights — arrive at a moment when Democrats may have an advantage, she noted. 
Midterm elections are often a referendum on the party that controls the White House, Caughell said. 
With Republican President Donald Trump in the White House, GOP majorities in Congress, and federal funding fallouts affecting states, the amendments championed by Democrats could also help drive down-ballot votes. 
She also noted that abortion, as a distinct health care need, has become a more salient argument in recent years, alongside economic considerations and support for personal choice. 
“We’ve expanded the parameters of our understanding of who this issue directly affects,” Caughell said. 
Speaking with reporters outside the Senate chamber Friday, Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, emphasized that the work is not finished. 
“It’s our responsibility to go out there and tell the voters this is what this means and help everybody understand what they’re voting for,” she said.

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)As Virginia grapples with an energy crisis fueled by the proliferation of data centers and growing local concern about permitting for the facilities, lawmakers are mulling how to manage the industry. 
Over the next two months of the General Assembly session, they will debate a slew of legislative proposals to streamline regulations, balance environmental priorities and address community concerns about the industry. 
A recent poll by the Chesapeake Climate Action Network found that three quarters of voters blame data centers for rising utility costs and 9 in 10 believe that lawmakers need to take action.
“There’s no option to do nothing,” said Del. Michelle Maldonado, D-Manassas, who represents the region of the state where most data centers are concentrated and who has put forward a measure that would have state regulators determine if ratepayers are being required to “unreasonably subsidize” data center transmission costs.
One of the challenges in regulating an industry like data centers is that Virginia holds local control in high regard. But with more counties giving approval to data centers to reap the rewards of increasing business and tax revenue, there is more pressure on the utilities to meet the power demands – the cost of which ultimately comes out of ratepayers’ pockets.
Lawmakers will debate how  the state can get the most out of the data center tax exemptions, expand on ratepayer protections following the new rate classes approved to the State Corporation Commission and get enough power on the grid to keep the lights on for everyone.
Here are the top data center bills of the 2026 legislative session so far. 
State Corporation Commission oversight
A controversial method of regulation Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, is exploring through House Bill 155 looks to put additional reviews onto high load users over 25 megawatts, which describes most data centers and manufacturers. 
The SCC would examine if proposed data centers and other high-load companies made sufficient contracts with renewable energy production and storage or have proper demand response measures. The bill also requires the SCC to make sure there is enough energy and transmission capacity on the grid to support the new project. A similar bill did not make it through the legislative process in 2025.
Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said in a press conference ahead of the legislative session that there are many ways to address the energy demands that data centers present. He pointed to a number of recommendations by the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation that are steps towards increased transparency and guardrails.
Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, has filed HB906 to direct the SCC to form a work group tasked with finding ways to address energy load flexibility for the high load users. This is meant to help with grid strain and reliability and find other methods to ease grid demand. 
Recovery cost
The SCC recently approved a new rate class for high-load users under Dominion. They will now be locked into 14-year agreements and  minimum demand charges for these users would be 85% for transmission, 85% for distribution, and 60% for generation. Some environmental advocates believe it is a good first step in ensuring that data center companies are paying a fair share of the transmission and generation costs for power. 
Now lawmakers want to find more ways to relieve ratepayers from covering the cost of infrastructure that is primarily used by the data center industry.
Del. John McAuliff, D-Fauquier, has pitched HB 503, which would prevent utilities from putting the cost of transmission lines and energy generation that mostly serve data centers onto residential ratepayers. He hopes this will make the high load users chip in more for the infrastructure that is not providing power to homes and businesses.
“Right now the data centers are getting a pretty nice tax credit and we are paying for a lot of that infrastructure,” McAuliff said.
It’s in the same vein as Maldonado’s bill. She said that while the new rate class for high-load users will help keep rates fair, there is still concern about the cost recovery being added to bills through the individual riders. 
“Without this legislation, families and small businesses can still end up subsidizing the infrastructure, the line substations and transmission projects needed for data centers, even if data centers are in a new rate class,” Sen. Russet Perry, D-Loudoun, said in a press conference.
Water use, putting waste heat to use
Public questions about how much local water is being used by data centers have bubbled to the surface.
The servers inside of the warehouse-style buildings generate a lot of heat and need water to cool them down. Closed-loop hyperscale data centers are reported to use less water than the open loop systems. HB 589 by Del. Shelly Simonds, D-Newport News, would require water providers to report to the State Water Control Board monthly on the volume of water that the centers use.   
HB 496 by Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, would require data centers that are permitted by-right to report how much water the anticipated project would be using at the time of development. 
There are also some ideas on how to use the heat that is generated by the data centers. Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, is bringing HB 323 to direct the Department of Energy to find ways to use the heat to either push it to surrounding buildings to the data centers as seen in other countries. 
Tax exemption requirements
Senate democrats said in a pre-session press conference the state misses out on an estimated $1 billion from the data center industry through tax exemptions. 
Surrovell said the state needs to benefit more from the industry utilizing the exemptions, either through potential energy efficiencies or other requirements. Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, is expected to file a bill this session on that issue similar to his bill from last year that did not pass out of committee.
Environmental impacts
Thomas, the delegate representing Prince William, said his constituents told him that there needs to be a minimum standard for data center locations, sound profile, and other environmental concerns. In response, he filed HB 153, which would allow localities to require high energy users to complete a site assessment when they apply for permits for proposed projects. 
Thomas said this would be a way for county boards to get the full picture of how data centers or other projects may impact the surrounding community. 
“We can look in some localities like my own in Prince William County, where there are clear mistakes in siting. The Village Place Technology Park is a clear example, right next to the Village Place housing development that was there first,” Thomas said. “One vote ends up putting an industrial site way too close,” Thomas said, adding that one could throw a baseball from one of the homes’ back decks and hit the nearby data center. “And so that’s clearly inappropriate.”
A similar bill was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin last year. At the time, the governor said it would create too much red tape for the industry.
There have been growing worries over the emissions from data centers’ diesel backup generators. Usually, they only run for a few minutes a month to test them unless there is an emergency situation. As the regional transmission managed by PJM is strained during hot and cold days – the grid operator is exploring whether data centers should hop off the grid to relieve some of the pressure. But that means the generators would run for hours at a time – releasing fumes into surrounding neighborhoods. 
Thomas’ HB 154 would require the facility to report publicly when the use of the emergency generators will be in use.
“I find that very dangerous and concerning for those of us that have high concentrations of data centers near our children and near our schools. So all the bill does is create more transparency,” Thomas said.
Senate Bill 130, HB 607 and HB 507 also zoom in on the diesel backup generators, offering limitations on how much they can be used and pushing the industry towards energy storage options as their backup method of power. 
Many lawmakers believe it will take more than one session to work out the regulations around the multi-billion dollar industry. 
“It’s probably going to take a year, or two, or three to fully flesh out because there’s billions and billions and billions of dollars of assets and land investment out there, and we have to make sure we’re prudent about how we do it. But there’s no question, (the data center industry) is part of the problem, and we have to take it head on,” Surovell said.

Abigail Spanberger gives her first speech after being sworn in on Jan. 17, 2026. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury) I’ve watched every Virginia governor’s inauguration for the past 30 years. For most of those, I covered them on-site as a reporter or editor. They’ve ranged from perfectly serviceable to pretty doggone good.
But what Abigail Davis Spanberger did Saturday in the first minutes of her term as governor soared past them all.
Spanberger sworn in as Virginia’s first woman governor, moves swiftly to set agenda

Not since the inauguration of L. Douglas Wilder as the nation’s first elected Black governor 36 years ago has the day been as heavily freighted with history as it was for Spanberger — the first woman to govern Virginia in more than four centuries as a colony or a commonwealth. Never had Virginians heard their leader speak as a daughter, a wife, a sister, a mother.
In content, tone and delivery, she comfortably and confidently rendered an address for the ages — one that rose to the importance of the occasion, rich in lines that will be quoted for generations to come.
For Virginians, it blended the sweet optimism of President Ronald Reagan’s “Shining city on a hill” valedictory and President John Kennedy’s stirring “Ask not” exhortation to Americans’ collective and individual commitment to country.
Under leaden skies against a damp winter chill, her sunny 25-minute address took in the vast sweep of Virginia’s history — for better and for worse — and paired it seamlessly to today’s divisive strife and tomorrow’s daunting challenges for her and her government.
She noted the commonwealth’s first two governors, Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson, and cited Henry’s 1799 admonition in his final public speech — “United we stand, divided we fall” — that is as urgent now as it was at our republic’s birth.
Dressed in suffragette white and standing as the ultimate triumph of their cause, Spanberger saluted women who risked harassment and arrest on the same Capitol steps a century earlier advocating for women’s right to vote.
On the eve of the holiday celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King’s birthday, she noted King’s daring 1960 speech in Richmond urging Gov. Lindsay Almond to end Massive Resistance, Virginia’s disgraceful and futile effort to defy the Supreme Court’s 1954 ruling to desegregate public schools.
In attendance on his 95th birthday, Spanberger recognized Wilder, descended from enslaved grandparents, whose 1990 inauguration packed Capitol Square — a realization of King’s dream.

And she honored the memory of Linwood Holton, Virginia’s first Republican governor, who served notice in his 1970 inaugural speech that Virginia would, at last, embrace racial equality, not just as the law but as a value. Seated nearby, Holton’s daughter, former First Lady Anne Holton, fought back tears as her husband, U.S. Sen and former Gov. Tim Kaine, comforted her.
When she shifted to the present, Spanberger confronted the administration of President Donald Trump and the “recklessness coming out of Washington” without once uttering his name. She addressed Virginians’ concerns head on.
“You are worried about policies that are hurting our communities, cutting health care access, imperiling rural hospitals, and driving up costs,” she said. Affordability was the centerpiece of her campaign and is now the focus of her term.
“You are worried about Washington policies that are closing off markets, hurting innovation and private industry, and attacking those who have devoted their lives to public service,” she said, referring to Trump’s schedule of punitive tariffs and federal job cuts in a state that is home to 330,000 federal government workers.
“You are worried about an administration that is gilding buildings while schools crumble, breaking the social safety net and sowing fear across our communities, betraying the values of who we are as Americans, the very values that we celebrate here on these steps,” she said. No elaboration is necessary.
Then she spoke without equivocation to the dispute roiling the nation, causing massive midwinter protests in cities across America, knowing her words might escalate the vindictive president’s reprisals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were spotted operating last week in Petersburg and Henrico County.
“And in Virginia,” Spanberger said, “our hard-working, law-abiding immigrant neighbors will know that when we say that we will focus on the security and safety of all of our neighbors, we mean them, too.”
Does such a powerful oratorical start presage a successful term? Oh, were it so easy.
She has staked out an ambitious agenda, and she’s got 1,454 days and nights to achieve it. Many will be difficult, frustrating and thankless. There are unknown crises that, as often as not, hijack a governor’s term and define his — now her — legacy.
But at least for the moment, Abigail Spanberger has pointed Virginia toward a new destination, and she has inspired us to follow her there.

(Photo by Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images) Less than a year after it was enacted, lawmakers will revisit a proposal that brought major changes to Virginia’s K-12 public school testing system, with the main debate centering on whether to keep or repeal a provision passed last year that requires assessments to count for 10% of students’ final grades.
Overhauling the testing system aims to raise student performance, strengthen outcomes and make the Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments in core subjects (math, reading, history and social science) more meaningful. 
The changes made to SOL testing to tie test scores to final grades, shift test timing, and give parents clearer results garnered widespread support in the General Assembly. However, some lawmakers, like Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler, D-Virginia Beach, who opposed certain portions, argued the education community did not entirely support the revamp.
“Overall, it is meant to be an assessment of how these SOLs are being taught, if it’s working, and so it shouldn’t be a part of their grade,” said Convirs-Fowler, a retired educator, last week.
She added that “Standards of Learning are standards and the testing is what we’re using to assess that we’ve done what we’re supposed to do … and if we do that, then that’s the goal.”
Last year, the legislation carried by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, took different measures to improve how the SOLs are administered and used to evaluate what students should know at the end of each grade or course. 
VanValkenburg, a History and US Government teacher at Glen Allen High School, said he is aware of the Convirs-Fowler’s view, but had not spoken to her at the start of the session. He said the provision was intended to alleviate end-of-year testing and improve testing.
He said the primary goal is to reduce overtesting by replacing separate teacher-led finals with standardized end-of-course exams, ensuring students face only one major cumulative test. 
VanValkenburg said adding these scores to the final grades motivates students and gives them a clearer reason to take the exams seriously. He also said this provision reduces the burden on educators. Currently, teachers lose weeks of instructional time to repeated testing cycles.
“As a teacher, it’s incredibly frustrating when the last five weeks of your school year are bogged down in repeated final exams,” VanValkenburg said. “It doesn’t make any sense to me.”
State Department of Education data showed modest gains in 2023-2024 reading and math pass rates. These gains followed targeted recovery efforts led by Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the General Assembly. Performance in other subjects stayed below 2022-2023 levels.
Convirs-Fowler was one of the few who voted against the legislation. This year, she is carrying House Bill 189, which aims to repeal a law requiring students in grades 7-12 to have at least 10% of their final grade in a course determined by their SOL or local alternative assessment scores.
Virginia recently overhauled its accountability system, splitting its accreditation model into two systems: one to determine whether schools meet legal and regulatory requirements, and another to provide clear data on student and school performance.
Scott Brabrand, executive director of the Virginia Association of School Superintendents, said that with revisions to the state’s accountability system, Virginia now has multiple ways to track accountability without having to make the SOLs count for 10% of the student’s final grade.
“The Standards of Learning are an important part of accountability, but they’re not the only part of accountability, especially in this new performance and support framework,” Brabrand said. “Additionally, SOLs are tied to a student’s graduation. Students have to get a certain number of verified credits to pass the SOLs. So really, this 10% final grade is adding an additional layer of accountability that really isn’t necessary.”
The future of Convirs-Fowler’s bill is uncertain, as Helmer and VanValkenburg have filed companion bills to refine their previous legislation. These changes focus on grading integrity, student eligibility for alternate assessments, test timing, and the public release of assessment materials.
Some of the highlights of the proposal include adding specific exemptions for students with significant cognitive disabilities and clarifying that parents and teachers are part of the team that decides whether a student should use an alternate test. 
Exceptions to the test timing were added for high school seniors in the final semester, students retaking tests and student transfers.
National exams, such as Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and College Level Examination Program (CLEP), would be exempt from the general limit of one assessment per academic quarter under the measure. 
The proposal would allow school boards to request a case-by-case exemption to give a standard SOL test to an individual student, even if the rest of the class is taking a local alternative assessment, provided that the exemption does not exceed five percent of the students in that subject. 
To protect the security of future exams, the proposal allows the board to release representative sample questions instead of a full past exam, if releasing the full exam would leave less than 70% of the question bank available. 
Changes to the legislation are likely to affect the Board of Education’s efforts to revise how the state measures students’ performance in history and social science in the state’s Consolidated State Plan. 
Social studies leaders have advocated for flexible, performance-based local assessments that allow educators to measure student learning in meaningful, varied ways while maintaining alignment with state standards. Such assessments balance accountability with recognition that students learn and demonstrate knowledge differently.
The proposed legislation would add safeguards for both mandatory and permissive local alternative assessments, including requiring permissive assessments to be graded in alignment with the “best practices” established by the Board of Education, which are slated to be made available to schools by Sept. 1, 2026.
The proposal also creates stricter rules for grading local alternative assessments, such as preventing teachers from grading their own students’ work and ensuring students have no prior access to the test prompts.
There are other bills that might impact testing on the docket. A measure being carried by Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke County, and Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, would give Virginia school districts more time and flexibility in how they test students.
Currently, the commonwealth is rolling out a new testing system that measures student growth throughout the year. Sutterlein and Rasoul’s bill would allow schools to fully switch to the new system and continue using alternative tests until the 2027-2028 school year.
Under House Bill 1243 sponsored by Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, if a student fails an SOL test but quickly retakes it and passes, the school would count only the passing retake score when the student’s performance and the school’s overall rating and accreditation are considered.
Currently, a failing score can impact a school’s rating.

(Photo by Nathan King/ National Park Service)Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s words from his “Beyond Vietnam” speech still ring true.
“When machines and computers, profit motives, and property rights are considered more important than people,” he warned, “the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.”
Those words, delivered in 1967, still summarize today’s political moment. Instead of putting the lives of working Americans first, our leaders in Congress and the White House have prioritized advancing corporate profits and wealth concentration, slashing government programs meant to advance upward mobility, and deploying military forces across the country, increasing distrust and tension.
This historic regression corresponds with a recessionary environment for Black America in particular. That’s what my organization, the Joint Center, found in our report, “State of the Dream 2026: From Regression to Signs of a Black Recession.”
The economic landscape for Black Americans in 2026 is troubling, with unemployment rates signaling a potential recession. By December 2025, Black unemployment had reached 7.5 percent — a stark contrast to the national rate of 4.4 percent. This disparity highlights the persistent economic inequalities faced by Black communities, which have only been exacerbated by policy shifts that have weakened the labor market. The volatility in Black youth unemployment, which fluctuated dramatically in the latter months of 2025, underscores the precariousness of the situation.
The Trump administration’s executive orders have systematically dismantled structures aimed at promoting racial equality. By targeting programs such as Lyndon Johnson’s 1965 Equal Employment Opportunity executive order and defunding agencies like the Minority Business Development Agency, the administration has shifted federal support away from disadvantaged businesses.
As a result, Black-owned firms risk losing contracts and resources tied to federal programs, potentially resulting in job losses and reduced economic growth. These changes threaten billions in federal revenue for Black-owned firms and undermine efforts to move beyond racial inequality in the workforce.
The GOP’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in 2025, further entrenches inequality by providing tax cuts that disproportionately benefit high-income households and corporations — while simultaneously slashing investments in programs like Medicaid and SNAP, limiting access to essential services for low-income households.
The technology sector, a critical component of the American economy, is also affected by this disregard for civil rights. Executive orders like “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” have stripped away protections that could advance inclusion in this rapidly growing field. As a result, the future of the American economy risks reinforcing past inequalities.
Dr. King’s call for strong, aggressive federal leadership in addressing racial inequality remains highly relevant. However, instead of eradicating structures of inequality, our current leadership is implementing policies that destroy government jobs and dismantle agencies responsible for preventing predatory economic practices. These choices undermine longstanding efforts to combat racial and economic disparities — and exemplify the regressive economic policies that coincide with rising Black unemployment.
As Dr. King stated, “we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.” But urgent action is required. Unless we act deliberately, economic and racial inequalities will become entrenched, resulting in generational loss. The core question is whether we will move beyond our nation’s history of racism, materialism, and militarism, and — as Dr. King urged — embrace “the fierce urgency now” to advance equity.

When one of Adam Burkhammer’s foster children struggled with hyperactivity, the West Virginia legislator and his wife decided to alter their diet and remove any foods that contained synthetic dyes.
“We saw a turnaround in his behavior, and our other children,” said Burkhammer, who has adopted or fostered 10 kids with his wife. “There are real impacts on real kids.”
The Republican turned his experience into legislation, sponsoring a bill to ban seven dyes from food sold in the state. It became law in March, making West Virginia the first state to institute such a ban from all food products.
The bill was among a slew of state efforts to regulate synthetic dyes. In 2025, roughly 75 bills aimed at food dyes were introduced in 37 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Chemical dyes and nutrition are just part of the broader “Make America Healthy Again” agenda. Promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., MAHA ideas have made their deepest inroads at the state level, with strong support from Republicans — and in some places, from Democrats. The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program — created last year as part of the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act to expand health care access in rural areas — offers incentives to states that implement MAHA policies.
Federal and state officials are seeking a broad swath of health policy changes, including rolling back routine vaccinations and expanding the use of drugs such as ivermectin for treatments beyond their approved use. State lawmakers have introduced dozens of bills targeting vaccines, fluoridated water and PFAS, a group of compounds known as “forever chemicals” that have been linked to cancer and other health problems.
As Republicans spar over IVF, some turn to obscure MAHA-backed alternative

In addition to West Virginia, six other states have targeted food dyes with new laws or executive orders, requiring warning labels on food with certain dyes or banning the sale of such products in schools. California has had a law regulating food dyes since 2023.
Most synthetic dyes used to color food have been around for decades. Some clinical studies have found a link between their use and hyperactivity in children. And in early 2025, in the last days of President Joe Biden’s term, the Food and Drug Administration outlawed the use of a dye known as Red No. 3.
Major food companies including Nestle, Hershey  and PepsiCo have gotten on board, pledging to eliminate at least some color additives from food products over the next year or two.
“We anticipate that the momentum we saw in 2025 will continue into 2026, with a particular focus on ingredient safety and transparency,” said John Hewitt, the senior vice president of state affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group for food manufacturers.
This past summer, the group called on its members to voluntarily eliminate federally certified artificial dyes from their products by the end of 2027.
“The state laws are really what’s motivating companies to get rid of dyes,” said Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit health advocacy group.
Andy Baker-White, the senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the bipartisan support for bills targeting food dyes and ultraprocessed food struck him as unusual. Several red states have proposed legislation modeled on California’s 2023 law, which bans four food additives.
“It’s not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,” Baker-White said.
State lawmakers embrace RFK Jr.’s health policies

Although Democrats have joined Republicans in some of these efforts, Kennedy continues to drive the agenda. He appeared with Texas officials when the state enacted a package of food-related laws, including one that bars individuals who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — SNAP or food stamps — from using their benefits to buy candy or sugary drinks. In December, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved similar waivers sought by six states. Eighteen states will block SNAP purchases of those items in 2026.
There are bound to be more. The Rural Health Transformation Program also offers incentives to states that implemented restrictions on SNAP.
“There are real and concrete effects where the rural health money gives points for changes in SNAP eligibility or the SNAP definitions,” Baker-White said.
In October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that sets a legal definition for ultraprocessed foods and will phase them out of schools. It’s a move that may be copied in other states in 2026, while also providing fodder for legal battles. In December, San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu sued major food companies, accusing them of selling “harmful and addictive” products. The lawsuit names specific brands — including cereals, pizzas, sodas and potato chips — linking them to serious health problems.
Kennedy has also blamed ultraprocessed foods for chronic diseases. But even proponents of the efforts to tackle nutrition concerns don’t agree on which foods to target. MAHA adherents on the right haven’t focused on sugar and sodium as much as policymakers on the left. The parties have also butted heads over some Republicans’ championing of raw milk, which can spread harmful germs, and the consumption of saturated fat, which contributes to heart disease.
Policymakers expect other flash points. Moves by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are making vaccine access more difficult have led blue states to find ways to set their own standards apart from federal recommendations, with 15 Democratic governors announcing a new public health alliance in October. Meanwhile, more red states may eliminate vaccine mandates for employees; Idaho made them illegal. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing to eliminate school vaccine mandates.
Even as Kennedy advocates eliminating artificial dyes, the Environmental Protection Agency has loosened restrictions on chemicals and pesticides, leading MAHA activists to circulate an online petition calling on President Donald Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.
Congress has yet to act on most MAHA proposals. But state lawmakers are poised to tackle many of them.
“If we’re honest, the American people have lost faith in some of our federal institutions, whether FDA or CDC,” said Burkhammer, the West Virginia lawmaker. “We’re going to step up as states and do the right thing.”

Republish photo only with original story.)A federal judge in the Southern District of Ohio issued a preliminary injunction in favor of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio in a lawsuit challenging Ohio State University’s decision to expel a student who posted videos on social media about the Israel-Palestine conflict. 
Ohio State disenrolled Guy Christensen without a hearing in May and on Wednesday U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Sargus, Jr. of the Southern District of Ohio ordered Ohio State to expunge “any mention of involuntary disenrollment” from Christensen’s academic transcript, according to the lawsuit. ACLU of Ohio filed the lawsuit in September and the case remains open.

“The Court concludes that Mr. Christensen has demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of his First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment claims,” according to the lawsuit. 
Christensen is a pro-Palestinian social media influencer with more than 3 million TikTok followers. He finished his freshman year at Ohio State in April. 
His social media videos attracted attention back in May when, in response to two Israeli embassy staff members being killed in Washington, D.C., Christensen urged his followers to “support” Elias Rodriguez, the accused killer, in a video that has since been taken down. Christensen originally condemned the killings, but took back his condemnation. 
In another video around that time, Christensen condemned U.S. Congressman Ritchie Torres, D-NY, for his “support for Zionism and associations with pro-Israel political entities,” according to the lawsuit. Torres then urged the U.S. Capitol Police to investigate Christensen and the alleged threats he made. That video has also since been taken down. 
Christensen claimed Ohio State “violated his First Amendment right to free speech by expelling him for engaging in protected political speech and his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process by expelling him summarily, without an opportunity to be heard,” according to the lawsuit.
The court held a hearing on Christensen’s motion for preliminary injunction on Monday and Christensen argued both videos are political speech protected by the First Amendment, according to the lawsuit. 
Sargus found the videos “did not explicitly encourage violence or lawlessness and are unlikely to be an implicit endorsement of such action … there is no evidence that violence or lawlessness occurred as a result of Mr. Christensen’s speech,” according to the lawsuit. 
The court also found no evidence to suggest Christensen’s video disrupted any classes, according to the lawsuit. 
When it comes to due process, the court found Christensen received notice of his disenrollment at the same time the disenrollment took effect on May 30 — meaning he did not have an opportunity to be heard before his dismissal, according to the lawsuit. 
“We’re disappointed in the ruling,” Ohio State spokesperson Ben Johnson said in an email. 
ACLU of Ohio Managing Legal Director David Carey said the ruling underscores a foundation concept of the U.S. Constitution. 
“Political opinions may not be silenced or punished merely because they may give offense,” Carey said in a statement. “We applaud the court’s ruling not only for its vindication of a student’s right to free expression, but also as a critical reminder to our institutions of higher education.”

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)Friday was bright and bitter at the foot of Mount Washington. The sun was shining, but howling wind dropped the feels-like temperature well below zero and whipped up a sharp spray of ice from the forest floor. At higher elevations, snow was flying as wind gusts clocked in at 50 to 100 miles per hour. 
These conditions can be perilous, but for some, and with careful precautions, they’re also a coveted treat. But for all the joy the outdoors can offer, the ability to feel safe and comfortable in the wilderness can be elusive. That’s one reason Hannah Kothari said she had convened a group of nearly 20 other women at Pinkham Notch on Jan. 16 — and why, through her rapidly growing club, Kothari has dedicated much of her free time over the past several months to bringing groups of women out into the wilderness of New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont.
“It’s been very empowering for me to be outside with other women for the first time, really, in my life,” said Kothari, who founded her club, Chicks on Cliffs, in November. Her mission, she said, is to create the safe, empowering, and beginner-friendly community she had wished for during her own introduction to outdoor recreation.
“I feel like I can finally kind of pay it forward,” she said, “and be the person I wish I had when I was starting out.”

The Instagram account for Chicks on Cliffs has already grown to nearly 6,000 followers. Through it, Kothari, a college senior, marshals groups of women and a network of trip leaders on excursions in the White Mountains and beyond nearly every weekend. But the endeavor, she said, started humbly, and not very long ago.
Early in her college career, after years of struggling to keep up with her peers despite her active lifestyle, doctors discovered that one of Kothari’s heart valves was leaking. The realization explained why strenuous activities felt difficult, and made many of Kothari’s past experiences suddenly make sense, she said, like falling behind during group activities and hikes — and the frustration, disappointment, and even embarrassment she felt at those times.
At first, doctors told Kothari there was nothing to be done. But reading a nursing textbook over a friend’s shoulder, Kothari learned that certain kinds of birth control, including the one she took, could significantly worsen heart valve problems. Inspired, Kothari switched her prescription, and almost immediately her ability to exercise was transformed.
Kothari immediately took to the trails, logging more than 100 miles on hikes between October and December 2025. She was mostly hiking alone, and posting about her adventures on social media. Soon, her posts were resonating with other women.
“All these girls started reaching out to me, asking me questions,” Kothari said, about things like feeling safe hiking alone as a woman and traveling solo in the backcountry. Kothari gladly answered them, and soon, online connections turned into real-world hiking meetups; then, Chicks on Cliffs was born.

The first official Chicks on Cliffs meetup had two attendees, in addition to Kothari, she said. But lately, trips have been fully booked.
The communities around hiking and skiing can be hard to break into, and sometimes feel gatekept or male dominated, Kothari said. Chicks on Cliffs, she hopes, can serve as an antidote to that, allowing women to share knowledge and tips in a judgment-free environment. 
Kothari takes pride in sharing the knowledge she’s gained over the course of her own introduction to outdoor exploration, which was largely self-taught and trial-and-error, she said. Armed with extra layers, snacks, water, and a first aid kit, she hopes to teach newcomers about safety in the outdoors while empowering them to eventually feel comfortable outside on their own.
Kothari carries her own experience being frustrated, and feeling like the outdoors weren’t a place for her, in her role as trip leader, she said. 
The goal, she said, is to take “that experience of feeling that way, and giving that to others, and helping other people through that. … Being patient, and being kind, and being everything that I wish I would have had in those moments earlier in my academic career.”

Most Chicks on Cliffs gatherings take the form of hikes or casual ski meetups, Kothari said. But Jan. 16 was different, featuring an introductory course on safety in the backcountry. The course was led by two avalanche experts: Caitlin Kelly and Ashley Murray of East Coast Avalanche Education, which partnered with Chicks on Cliffs to offer the course. 
Some in attendance said they’d been to other Chicks on Cliffs meetups before; others were joining for the first time. All were glad to have a welcoming group in which they could lean into the experience of being a backcountry beginner.
“My only friends that backcountry ski are a group of guys that have been doing it for a while. It kind of felt intimidating to go with them and be kind of left in the dust, or rely on them to teach me,” said Maddie Castle, who drove from Maine to Pinkham Notch Friday to attend the Chicks on Cliffs meetup. 
There was something “automatically comfortable” about a group like Chicks on Cliffs, where everyone comes as they are, said attendee Caroline Eaton.
Kothari said she was thrilled to offer a place for women to try new things and experience the joy of the outdoors together. In the future, she hopes to continue growing the club, and offer a wider range of activities to capture people at more levels of experience and comfort.
“Everybody is on their own journey, and I really want to support folks in whatever phase of that journey they may be on,” she said.

State Reps. Phil Plummer, R-Dayton, and Tom Young, R-Washington Twp., emphasized the strength of Ohio’s verification and investigative process when it comes to child care facilities in a press conference where they also announced a new bill to increase the investigative power available to state authorities.
Ohio House Bill 647 would give the Ohio Attorney General’s Office the authority to investigate “any publicly funded child care program suspected of fraud.”
The Ohio Department of Children and Youth, which leads oversight of licensed child care providers and currently investigates allegations, would be allowed to immediately suspend the license and provider agreement for a facility “under the suspicion of fraud.”
The sponsors of the bill also promoted money the bill would allow to go to “enhanced data analytics” for attendance reviews. Young said the bill would include $5 million in appropriations over the next two years.
Following the allegations of child care fraud in Minnesota originated by a right-wing social media influencer and taken up by the Trump administration, states like Ohio have felt the need to respond to public questions, and were told by federal leaders that they would need to prove the federal money for Publicly Funded Child Care was being used properly.
Plummer said the bill is not only an effort to maintain an already strong system, but also a response to public opinions that the child care system in Ohio is in need of more scrutiny.
“We can’t gaslight this and freak out the federal administration, and they pull our funding,” Plummer said. “Because then we lose child care centers.”
As a parent of children who have benefitted from Ohio’s child care system, Young said he’s glad to see facility workers keeping members of the public attempting to do their own investigations out of child care buildings. He said it further proves the protections at work in the sector.
“There’s no way, (even) as a parent, I can walk through that door and just walk back to a classroom,” Young said. “There are protocols, and they are tight and there’s a reason for that: for their safety.”
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine released a statement after the Minnesota allegations began to make headlines, and held a press conference with Ohio Department of Children and Youth Director Kara Wente soon after.
They said Ohio’s system is diligent in addressing allegations of fraud should they come about, and maintaining high standards in child care facilities.
In 2025, Wente and DeWine said there were 124 referrals from the public about facilities, and of those, 61 overpayments were identified, and 12 facilities were closed.
So far this year, Wente said “with all of the statements, and press conferences, and social media,” the agency has received more than 60 referrals.
Referrals are allegations, and haven’t necessarily been investigated or proven any wrongdoing.
Wente attended the press conference introducing Plummer and Young’s bill, urging support for the added protection, and increased authority for the department to keep funds from facilities until an investigation is complete.
“What we know is there are times when we need to turn the spigot off to the public funds, and then continue the investigation and have the ability to work with the provider and come back,” Wente said.
She said the bill also helps the department continue work they’ve already done, creating new avenues for data.
The department just started a “random sample” of 400 child care programs “to collect data and to see what was happening in the program itself,” according to Wente.
“We can’t be at 5,200 programs every day, we are reliant on our data and we are reliant on our analytics, which this bill will help improve,” Wente said.
The director also said “program integrity reviews” were happening at child care facilities in Ohio “well before the headlines started” about Minnesota.
The federal government seems satisfied with Ohio’s program, though. Wente said the department received approval for Child Care Development Block Grant funds on Jan. 13, another federal approval on Jan. 14, and approval for federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funding last week.
“We depend on these federal dollars,” Plummer said. “We’re doing the best job we can do to protect those federal dollars.”
Child care supporters and organizations in the state have also said oversight is solid, but early childhood advocacy group Groundwork Ohio said they appreciated state leaders and the bill’s sponsors for “responding quickly and seriously to concerns of fraud in the child care system by putting forth a reasonable proposal.”

Before Martin Luther King Jr. was killed, he asked several of his friends to continue his life’s work building what he called “beloved community.” One of the people he invited was the Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk, poet and mindfulness teacher Thich Nhat Hanh.
My new book, “On Mindful Democracy: A Declaration of Interdependence to Mend a Fractured World,” is inspired by King and Hanh’s friendship. These two men bonded over the shared insight that how we show up for each other matters, as does how we advocate for social change. In his sermon “Loving Your Enemies” King announced, “Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.” Hanh taught: There is no way to peace, peace is the way.“
At the heart of beloved community is true democracy. To be agents of change who do not add to the suffering of the world, people must learn to become more loving and peaceful people.
 ‘The real enemies of man’

Hanh was born in 1926 in central Vietnam. As a young Buddhist monk living in a nation confronted by colonialism, conflict and war, he developed the doctrine of ”engaged Buddhism,“ premised on the belief that working to relieve suffering in the world is enlightenment.
During the mid-1960s, amid the Vietnam War – Vietnamese call it the “American War” – Hanh founded the School of Youth for Social Services to practice engaged Buddhism and help those affected by the bombs raining down on their homes.
On June 1, 1965, Hanh wrote a letter to King to raise awareness of the suffering of the Vietnamese people. He also hoped to correct some common misconceptions about Buddhism.
His overarching point was that Buddhists in Vietnam did not hate Americans. In fact, they did not hate anyone. Their goal was simply to bring an end to war – and an end to the delusions that led to war. “Their enemies are not man. They are intolerance, fanaticism, dictatorship, cupidity, hatred and discrimination which lie within the heart of man,” he wrote. “These are the real enemies of man – not man himself.”
Hanh refused to take a side during the war. He stood for peace. His peace activism earned him a 39-year banishment from his homeland.
 Continuing King’s dream

Marc Andrus, author of the 2021 book “Brothers in the Beloved Community,” notes that King and Hanh met in person twice: once in Chicago, on May 31, 1966, and a second time in May 1967, at the World Council of Churches Peace on Earth Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. In Geneva, King shared his understanding of the beloved community with Hanh, inviting him to participate in its construction.
In between these two meetings, King nominated Hanh for the 1967 Nobel Peace Prize, writing in his nomination letter, “I know Thich Nhat Hanh, and am privileged to call him my friend.” No award was given that year, however, perhaps to protest King’s choice to make his nomination letter public. Nominations were typically private, but King used his to call out the injustice of the Vietnam War.
Hanh was crushed when he learned of King’s death in 1968. “I was in New York when I heard the news of his assassination; I was devastated. I could not eat; I could not sleep,” he later recalled. “I made a deep vow to continue building what he called ‘the beloved community’ not only for myself but for him also. I have done what I promised Martin Luther King Jr. And I think that I have always felt his support.”
 Building ‘beloved community’

In the years after King’s murder, part of Hanh’s life work was devoted to fulfilling King’s dream and building the “beloved community.”
Beloved community is not an abstraction. It is a loose-knit global community composed of a multitude of smaller, local communities committed to practicing peace, nonviolence, freedom, love and justice. Emerging from King’s activism and Hanh’s engaged Buddhism, these communities are also committed to social change.
In 1982, Hanh and his student Sister Chan Khong established the Plum Village monastery in southern France. In the years since, the Plum Village community has founded dozens of monasteries around the world, including three in the United States: Blue Cliff in upstate New York, Deer Park outside San Diego, and Magnolia Grove in Mississippi.
Hanh’s lay students have established thousands of smaller Plum Village sanghas – communities – in North America and Europe. These monasteries and sanghas serve as practice centers where people learn to embody the ideals of beloved community in their mindfulness practice and daily lives.
Since the time of the Buddha, people committed to the path of mindfulness have agreed to live by a number of “precepts.” These precepts, typically numbering five, provide a moral foundation for action. Hundreds of thousands of people attending Plum Village retreats have agreed to live by the updated, secular version of the precepts that Hanh and his community wrote called the Five Mindfulness Trainings. These include: reverence for life, true happiness, true love, loving speech and deep listening, and nourishment and healing.
The Five Mindfulness Trainings are written to provide people with a practical path to building a shared life based in love, compassion, joy and peace: the type of life that both King and Hanh envisioned for all.
As Hanh told the global Plum Village community in a 2020 letter titled Climbing Together the Hill of the Century: “We have continued that aspiration of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and every day, our practice is to generate brotherhood and sisterhood, to cultivate joy and the capacity to help people. This is a concrete way to realize and continue that dream.”
On MLK Day, their friendship and writings are a reminder that democracy rests on the ability of citizens to be present for each other, to recognize their interconnectedness, to embody loving kindness and to disagree without resorting to violence.

The government of this state works for you.
You know who has the best claim to that glorious Statehouse building in downtown Topeka? You do. Not lawmakers or lobbyists or associated special interests. That building exists to make your life and the lives of your friends and neighbors better. However bizarre or dark the news that flows from that place, never forget your ownership of its marble halls.


Statehouse scraps
Opinion editor Clay Wirestone’s weekly roundup of Kansas legislative exploits. Read the archive.


You can visit. You should visit. Anyone can come into the building and watch the House or Senate in session. You can chat with those lawmakers or lobbyists or associated special interests. You can just watch and make fun of them in your mind.
You don’t need to have to a reason to go. Drop by anytime during business hours. That’s the power of living in a representative democracy. Your elected officials answer to you. If they don’t, they will shortly be replaced by other elected officials. Any Kansan has the right, even the obligation, to check up on those paid to govern on their behalf.
I had already planned to kick off my inaugural Statehouse Scraps column of 2026 with this little sermon. But it turns out that someone else had similar thoughts last week.
This would be AFL-CIO executive secretary-treasurer Jake Lowen, who told a labor rally Wednesday that the Statehouse can feel like it’s built for “other people, fancy people, people in suits.”
“But you know what? This is your house. This is your state,” he proclaimed.


 

 Opinion editor Clay Wirestone and editor in chief Sherman Smith sum up the Kansas Legislature’s week in the first installment of Statehouse Chats.
He’s right.
One of the reasons that I write about legislators the way I do — irreverently, including comparisons to tipsy raccoons — is that we treat people in power with far too much reverence. They work for us. Sure, people might badmouth lawmakers on Facebook, but they don’t want to make waves in public.
That good-natured civility makes sense while avoiding conflict in your daily life. But it doesn’t work if it keeps you from voicing what you believe and demanding the people who serve you do their jobs.
So get in the car and visit the Statehouse. I know that folks in western Kansas face more of a challenge than those of us in the northeast. But you owe it to yourself to see where policy is made that affects all 3 million Kansas. All the lawmakers and public officials who work in the building must be reminded that they don’t do it for themselves or positive headlines.
They do it for you.

Their usual villains
The Legislature replayed one of its greatest hits last week. One of 2026’s first committee hearings tackled favorite Republican villains: transgender people.
You might think that trans folks just live among us out in the world, going to work and raising families and drinking Diet Coke. As people do. But no, because trans folks express their true gender identity, Kansas officials have targeted them repeatedly in recent years. Remember kids, elected officials believe that being different is bad.
The latest bill was touted by Secretary of State Kris Kobach as a way to supposedly reduce confusion with driver’s licenses and birth certificates. It would  ultimately require that these documents list a person’s sex at birth.
This justification didn’t make any sense with earlier bills. It doesn’t make any sense now.
If someone is a transgender woman, the vast majority of the time they’re going to look like a woman. You’re going to identify that person as a woman if you see them out and about. If someone is a transgender man, the vast majority of the time they’re going to look like a man. You’re going to identify that person as a man if you see them out and about.
Forcing these people to carry identification documents that don’t align with their public presentation is a recipe for the exact confusion that Kobach decries. It also opens the door for law enforcement and officials to abuse transgender people.
Hundreds of pieces of testimony from those opposing House Bill 2426 were submitted on a laughably short timeframe. Advocates turned out in droves to oppose the bill — as they always have and always will.
Will the Republican leaders who direct their caucus listen? Count me skeptical.

Speedy session
For the second year in a row, word in the hallways of the Statehouse is that Senate President Ty Masterson, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins want to keep the session short and tight. Last year, the motivation appeared unclear — it did give both chambers the excuse to bypass traditional debate and discussion — but this year it’s no mystery.
Elections draw near.
Lawmakers won’t be able to raise money or campaign until the session ends. With primaries in August and the general in November, you better believe that Kansas politicians want to hit the road rather than sit in boring committee meetings.
This cuts both ways. On one hand, lawmakers will have less opportunity to pass hateful or harmful legislation (see above). On the other, leaders use tight deadlines to their advantage by rushing through legislation without appropriate vetting. This gets especially touchy when it comes to budgets and various line items, which can be fiddled with up until the last minute.

Closed GOP caucus
You might remember that House Republicans closed their daily caucus meetings to members of the news media last session. I wrote a whole column about the break with longstanding practice.
From the evidence of last week, they’re doing it again. I showed up at a caucus meeting Tuesday morning along with Reflector reporter Anna Kaminski. She checked and was told the gathering was off-limits for reporters. I’m going to monitor the situation as the session continues, and you’ll be hearing more in the weeks that come.
Meanwhile, Senate and House leadership continue to restrict press access to the floors of their respective chambers. (And not inviting us to their press conferences.) Don’t worry; we’ll cover them anyway.

Scraps on board
Welcome to the 2026 edition of Statehouse Scraps. I started writing this roundup column back in 2023. For three sessions, it appeared on Saturdays and collected tidbits from the week before.
For this 2026 session, I’m treating it somewhat differently. You’ll still see bits and bobs from the week that was, but I’ve decided to run it on Mondays. That allows us to talk more about the week that’s coming up and give you a sense of the big storylines in Topeka.
Press corps shifts at the Statehouse and continued pullback from publishers in covering state government news means that Kansas Reflector has a bigger role than ever in informing Kansas about the session. I want to respond to that, and I want to make sure you know we’re looking out for you.
As part of that effort, we’re also unveiling a weekly video podcast with editor-in-chief Sherman Smith and myself talking about the big stories and offering our own observations about what’s going on. Please let us know what you think.

(Photo nu Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s words from his “Beyond Vietnam” speech still ring true.
“When machines and computers, profit motives, and property rights are considered more important than people,” he warned, “the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.”
Those words, delivered in 1967, still summarize today’s political moment. Instead of putting the lives of working Americans first, our leaders in Congress and the White House have prioritized advancing corporate profits and wealth concentration, slashing government programs meant to advance upward mobility, and deploying military forces across the country, increasing distrust and tension.
This historic regression corresponds with a recessionary environment for Black America in particular. That’s what my organization, the Joint Center, found in our report, “State of the Dream 2026: From Regression to Signs of a Black Recession.”
The economic landscape for Black Americans in 2026 is troubling, with unemployment rates signaling a potential recession. By December 2025, Black unemployment had reached 7.5% — a stark contrast to the national rate of 4.4%. This disparity highlights the persistent economic inequalities faced by Black communities, which have only been exacerbated by policy shifts that have weakened the labor market. The volatility in Black youth unemployment, which fluctuated dramatically in the latter months of 2025, underscores the precariousness of the situation.
The Trump administration’s executive orders have systematically dismantled structures aimed at promoting racial equality. By targeting programs such as Lyndon Johnson’s 1965 Equal Employment Opportunity executive order and defunding agencies like the Minority Business Development Agency, the administration has shifted federal support away from disadvantaged businesses.
As a result, Black-owned firms risk losing contracts and resources tied to federal programs, potentially resulting in job losses and reduced economic growth. These changes threaten billions in federal revenue for Black-owned firms and undermine efforts to move beyond racial inequality in the workforce.
The GOP’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in 2025, further entrenches inequality by providing tax cuts that disproportionately benefit high-income households and corporations — while simultaneously slashing investments in programs like Medicaid and SNAP, limiting access to essential services for low-income households.
The technology sector, a critical component of the American economy, is also affected by this disregard for civil rights. Executive orders like “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” have stripped away protections that could advance inclusion in this rapidly growing field. As a result, the future of the American economy risks reinforcing past inequalities.
Dr. King’s call for strong, aggressive federal leadership in addressing racial inequality remains highly relevant. However, instead of eradicating structures of inequality, our current leadership is implementing policies that destroy government jobs and dismantle agencies responsible for preventing predatory economic practices. These choices undermine longstanding efforts to combat racial and economic disparities — and exemplify the regressive economic policies that coincide with rising Black unemployment.
As Dr. King stated, “we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.” But urgent action is required. Unless we act deliberately, economic and racial inequalities will become entrenched, resulting in generational loss. The core question is whether we will move beyond our nation’s history of racism, materialism, and militarism, and — as Dr. King urged — embrace “the fierce urgency now” to advance equity.

Connecticut needs a regional approach to housing

A bill was passed by the legislature (HB 5002), and then the governor vetoed it.
In a special session over the summer, the legislature passed another housing bill, (HB 8002) which the governor signed and is now law. There are some things about it to admire, especially the provisions that seek to help our neighbors who are hardest hit by the housing crisis — people who have no housing at all, or whose housing is threatened by eviction.
It brings the language of “smart growth” into the conversation, encouraging the adoption of transit-oriented development districts, priority development housing zones, and the like. 
But it does not address in a serious way the housing crisis.
For decades now, many of Connecticut’s towns have successfully thwarted the creation of new housing within their borders that would help address the need. And under this new law these towns will unfortunately be able to continue to do so. (I refer to towns alone, and not cities, as the handful of actual cities in Connecticut have historically encouraged housing production.)
Last January, I argued that a more regional approach to land-use planning, guided by the state’s nine councils of governments “COGs” (which are composed of the cities and towns within their jurisdictions) might be a way to navigate between: a.) the statewide goal of producing more housing and b.) the desire of towns to control development within their borders without regard to the statewide housing crisis.
The new law does, in fact, lean heavily on the data-based, regional, land-use plans that the COGs have produced for years, and which the cities in towns within each COG’s region participate in drafting. These plans consider all the factors that good land-use planning requires, like the availability of infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and water and sewer facilities, as well as environmental conditions like wetlands and the protection of other fragile resources. But they have been, historically, basically advisory.
Now, provisions in this new law encourage towns to align their town-wide zoning to the regional plan for their COG jurisdiction. It lays out a lengthy and iterative process whereby the Secretary of the Office of Policy & Management reviews town zoning codes for compliance with the regional plans’ housing goals. But — and this is a big but — if a town’s housing goals do not meet the law’s goals for alignment with the regional plan, there are no real consequences. Essentially, the secretary may deny state funding to assist that town in planning for new housing, as well as state funding to plan and construct the infrastructure related to new housing.
But if the town’s leadership doesn’t want the new housing, denying them state funds to assist them in planning for new housing is hardly much of an incentive for each town to plan for new housing that they don’t want to begin with. Gov. Ned Lamont likes to describe this approach as “towns lead the way.” But towns leading the way is precisely what got us to where we are now – at least 110,000 homes short of the need.
The new law comes close to imagining a way forward, of bridging the gap between the statewide need for more housing and the so-called “local control” advocates who rail at “interference from Hartford.” It is important to remember that the 169 cities and towns in Connecticut are not independent entities but rather political subdivisions of the state, and have only the powers that the General Assembly grants them. Local control of zoning is conducted solely by the authority granted, and the rules laid out, in Chapter 124 of the Connecticut General Statues.
What this law still needs, if we are serious about addressing the housing shortage, is a bit more than holding back planning grants from recalcitrant towns. What I suggested a year ago, and I advocate now, is that the regional plans be activated as enforceable documents. If a developer is denied permits to build new housing in a town, but the regional plan envisions it, the law should provide the developer with a cause of action against the town on that basis.
This would operate along the lines of Chapter 8-30(g), which gives a developer a cause of action against a town that denies permits for any housing development that proposes some amount of affordable housing, if the town’s housing stock does not meet a 10 percent minimum affordable housing standard. But Section 8-30(g) is almost an anti-planning approach. It doesn’t matter if the proposed housing is located where it doesn’t make sense from a planning standpoint. What I am advocating is a pro-planning approach. If the regional plan envisions housing for a location, but the town says “No,” then the onus should be on the town to explain their denial to a judge.
Local control advocates can’t moan about “We don’t want Hartford telling us what to do” under this approach, because every city and town within each COG would have participated in the drafting of the regional plan. These regional plans are a far better way of guiding rational growth than arbitrary, one size fits all, standards for all 169 cities and towns. And we should use them, and let developers rely on them, and stop letting local control advocates, and the town governments they hold sway over, thwart us from meeting our housing goals as a state.

It is a present-day crisis affecting tens of thousands of families and straining our health care system in ways we can no longer afford to ignore.
  More than 80,000 Connecticut residents aged 65 and older are currently living with Alzheimer’s or other dementias. An estimated 130,000 family members provide unpaid care, contributing over 200 million hours annually – labor valued at more than $5 billion. At the same time, Medicaid spending related to Alzheimer’s exceeds $1.2 billion each year. These figures represent not only an economic burden, but countless households quietly navigating exhaustion, financial strain, and grief.
I know this reality personally. I am a Connecticut resident and a constituent of Rep. Jahana Hayes in the 5th District. Through sustained advocacy with her office, I was proud to see her cosponsor two bipartisan bills in 2025: the AADAPT Act and the ASAP Act. These bills focus on earlier diagnosis, improved access to care planning, and a stronger national response to dementia – all critical steps for families facing this disease.
  Early detection matters. New treatments and clinical trials are most effective in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s, yet too many people in Connecticut still receive diagnoses late, after years of missed or minimized symptoms. By then, options are limited, caregivers are already overwhelmed, and the trajectory of the disease is far harder to alter.
Connecticut has an opportunity to lead, but leadership requires urgency. It means supporting federal legislation that prioritizes early diagnosis and equitable access to care. It means strengthening caregiver supports and ensuring our health and social services systems are prepared for the realities of an aging population.
  CT Mirror published my letter on Alzheimer’s advocacy last summer. I’m writing again because the crisis has not eased – it has intensified. Families are still absorbing the burden largely alone, and the costs – human and economic – continue to rise.
  Alzheimer’s is not just a personal tragedy. It is a public health emergency. Connecticut can, and must, respond accordingly.

(Photo by STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — With two months to go before candidates must file to be on this year’s ballots, the state Democratic Party made a plea.
“RUN FOR OFFICE in 2026,” reads the top of an email sent Jan. 7 from state Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain.
Democrats have announced bids for just two of the seven constitutional offices on the ballot this November: governor and state superintendent of education. The party is still talking with potential candidates, Spain told the SC Daily Gazette.
In her email, she pointed to that week’s slim margin of victory for Republican Greg Ford in a special election for a state House seat representing Dorchester County. He defeated Democrat Sonja Ogletree Satani by just 21 votes, as determined by an automatic recount.
Ogletree Satani “ran one heck of a race,” Spain wrote, noting that President Donald Trump won the district by over 6 percentage points in 2024. (Statewide, he won by 18 points.) “The lesson to all of us is that we can compete and win if we run!”
The email was successful, Spain told the Gazette on Wednesday.
In one week, more than a hundred people filled out the candidate interest form attached to that email. “Dozens” of them checked a box showing interest in seeking a statewide office, according to Jon Burton, a party spokesperson.


Upcoming deadlines
To compete in the June 9 party primaries, candidates must file the forms and pay the required fees between March 16 and March 30.
The fee is 1% of the job’s salary over the entire term.
For statewide offices, that ranges from $4,243 for gubernatorial candidates to $8,560 to run for state superintendent.


It’s been 32 years since a Democrat competed for every statewide elected office in the South Carolina constitution. And back in 1994, there were two additional offices on the ballot.
The party has come close to having a candidate for every office since.
In 2006, a Democrat ran for every statewide office except attorney general. Then-Attorney General Henry McMaster ran unopposed for re-election that year. In 2002, the only constitutional office without a Democrat running was adjutant general, the leader of the state’s military department. Maj. Gen. Stan Spears ran unopposed that year for his fourth and final term before retiring. In 2014, voters approved taking that office off the ballot and making it a governor-appointed position.
Asked about Spain’s email, state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick said Democrats’ problem “isn’t a lack of candidates.
“It’s that voters simply aren’t buying what they’re selling,” he said in a statement to the SC Daily Gazette.
Two races with both parties on the ballot
A Democrat last won a statewide office in 2006, when Jim Rex was elected state superintendent of education by fewer than 500 votes.
This year, two Democrats, Lisa Ellis and Sylvia Wright, are running for the job overseeing the state agency for K-12 public schools. Whoever wins the June 9 Democratic primary will likely face Superintendent Ellen Weaver, who’s running for her second term. So far, no Republican has announced a challenge.
In 2022, the race for superintendent was the most crowded: Six Republicans and three Democrats ran to replace outgoing Superintendent Molly Spearman.
Ellis was a first-time candidate then. The 25-year veteran teacher of Richland 2 high schools, who in 2018 founded the online teachers’ group SC for Ed, won a three-way primary outright without needing a runoff, then lost to Weaver by 16 percentage points. In 2023, SC for Ed announced an indefinite pause to its lobbying efforts, four years after organizing a teachers’ rally at the Statehouse attended by an estimated 10,000 people.
Wright, who has two decades of classroom and administrative experience in rural South Carolina, resigned from her job last fall as a district coordinator for Dorchester 4 in order to campaign full-time.
Among all the statewide races on the ballot this year, the wide-open governor’s race has by far gotten the most attention.
It’s been 16 years since no incumbent ran for governor. Five Republicans and two Democrats have announced bids to replace Gov. Henry McMaster, who first ascended to the job nine years ago when then-Gov. Nikki Haley joined President Donald Trump’s first administration. So, when voters first elected McMaster to the job in 2018, he’d already been governor almost two years.
In South Carolina, governors are limited to two elected terms. Other constitutional offices have no term limitations.
Two other offices are wide open
Two other statewide offices that have gotten little attention are wide open for the first time in over two decades.
Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers is not seeking a sixth full term. It’s been 16 years since a Democrat challenged him.
Voters first elected Weathers in 2006, two years after Gov. Mark Sanford appointed the Orangeburg County dairy farmer to the job following the indictment of Charlie Sharpe, who was eventually sentenced to two years in prison for taking a bribe to protect a cockfighting ring.
Weathers endorsed Republican Fred West to replace him, The State newspaper reported last March. West retired in 2023 after 24 years as an executive at the poultry processing company Amick Farms and his since become director of market development at the Department of Agriculture.
So far, West is the only candidate to announce a bid to lead the agency with duties that include promoting one of the state’s top industries, keeping the food supply safe, and — since 2024 — handling all inspections of places that sell food, such as restaurants and cafeterias.
The job of comptroller general is open for the first time in 28 years, when then-Sen. Jim Landers replaced the retiring Earle Morris Jr.
That 1998 election was also the last time a Democrat won the post as the state’s chief accountant. In 2002, Republican Richard Eckstrom ousted Landers and kept the job for 21 years. Eckstrom resigned in 2023 amid mounting pressure over his office’s $3.5 billion accounting error. (The error was strictly on paper. No money went missing due. The office mistakenly double-counted some agencies’ revenue.)
McMaster made history in appointing his budget director, Brian Gaines, who by agreeing to run the office temporarily became South Carolina’s first Black constitutional officer since Reconstruction. Gaines said at the time he had no interest in running in 2026.
One Republican has announced a bid: Mike Burkhold, a Charleston businessman who founded Equiscript, a health care technology company.
For two other statewide offices, Republicans are seeking re-election without any announced competition.
Secretary of State Mark Hammond, first elected in 2002, is seeking a seventh term leading the office that registers and helps regulate businesses and charities operating in South Carolina. (Unlike in other states, South Carolina’s secretary of state plays no role at all in overseeing elections.)
Treasurer Curtis Loftis, first elected in 2010, also got came under fire recently for accounting problems. Senate investigations into the comptroller general’s office led to discovery of a $1.8 billion error in the treasurer’s office — also a blunder on paper that didn’t affect state revenues or the Legislature’s budgeting process. An outside accounting firm found that all but $200 million never existed. But senators were incensed, voting 33 to 8 last April to remove him. The House, however, never took up the case.
Amid a grilling from senators, Loftis initially pledged that he would not seek re-election in 2026. But he later reversed course and announced he’s seeking a fifth term. He maintains that he did nothing wrong.

Delaware Legislative Hall, Dover, Delaware, USA
convened in the second half of the 153rd Session of the General Assembly, this week.  The normal, more relaxed tone to the opening session was tempered by recent events, including the murder of Cpl. Matthew “Ty” Snook at the Delaware DMV offices two weeks ago.  Tensions seemed to be running high, leading to an outburst on the Senate floor, as Senate Concurrent Resolution 114 was introduced.  This is a measure, introduced by Sen. Bryant Richardson, that would add Delaware to the list of states authorizing an Article V “Convention of the States” resolution to introduce a slate of U.S. Constitutional amendments.  Heated exchanges led to a call for greater civility in these floor discussions, with a resolution (SCR124) by Sen. Kyra Hoffner passing unanimously in the Senate and echoed by a voice vote in the House, shortly after.  Sen. Brian Pettyjohn reinforced the unanimous call for civility in legislator discourse.  The resolution for the Convention of States, failed to pass with a vote of 7-7, with 7 senators choosing not to vote.  Senator Hansen joined the Republican members in voting for the resolution.
The session opened with a resolution recognizing “Law Enforcement Appreciation Day” as January 9th.  Comments we made by Sen. Nicole Poore, a close friend of the Snook family, and Secretary of the Senate, Ryan Dunphy, Snook’s brother-in-law.
There were a handful of other bills addressed in the opening days.  These included:
SB213 – “Amend Code Related to Hospital Review Board” 

This controversial law from 2025 was amended according to an agreement that followed legal challenges by hospital associations. The bill would still require hospitals to submit financial data to the Diamond State Hospital Cost Review Board to increase transparency around costs and spending trends, however it removes the authority of the board to approve or modify future budgets.  The bill was released from the Senate Executive Committee, with all 7 members approving (2 “Favorable”, 5 “On the Merits”) and sent to the Senate Floor for a vote.  There is an end of January deadline in the agreement related to the legal challenges.

SB222 – “Term Limits for Legislators, Attorney General, State Treasurer, State Auditor and State Insurance Commissioner” 

Senators would be limited to 5 terms, Representatives would be limited to 8 terms and others would be limited to 2 terms each.

SB106 – “Cell Phone Use Policies for Schools” 
Did not dictate policy, but laid out areas that must be addressed by the school policy.  This passed the Senate unanimously in 2025 and was passed by the House unanimously at the start of the 2026 session.
SB27 – “Establishing the Office of New Americans”

Codifies the executive actions of Gov. Meyer to establish this office “to help improve the lives and economic prosperity of new Americans who come to Delaware.” There does not appear to be a distinction between legal and illegal immigrants in this bill.  A sunset provision was added by Sen. Bryant Richardson.  The measure passed the Senate, as amended, unanimously and was sent to the House.

SB188 “Expand Permit to Purchase Handgun Exemptions to Law Enforcement Procurement”

The “Permit to Purchase” law (SB2) had not excluded the purchasing function of law enforcement agencies to supply their officers and candidates. This passed unanimously in the Senate and was sent to the House.  In a related article, we will explore the impact of SB2, as Delaware handgun purchases are down by 80%, as the processes for obtaining and exercising permits are not fully in place.  This is placing an incredible financial burden on firearms dealers in the state.

A number of other bills are expected to receive attention in this current session, including:
HS2 for HB13 “Added/Revised Tax Brackets”

Creates added brackets for $150K (amended from $125K), $250K & $500K, as the state faces concerns over decreasing revenue. This bill was deferred, as revenue estimates for 2026 were increased.  There is long term concern over the pace of budget increases.

HB72, HB73 & HB108 “Property and Income Tax Relief for Seniors”

Republican-sponsored bills to increase the Senior property tax deduction, reduce the residency period back to 3 years and increase the pension exclusion were not allowed to progress.

SB2 & SB3 Constitutional Amendments Affecting “Early, In-Person” and “No Excuse Absentee” Voting have progressed  to House vote.  HB65 “Moving Primary Election Date to April” is also pending Senate vote.

These CA’s will require 2027-2028 votes, if passed. HB65 will align primary dates with Presidential Primary and provide for longer General Election campaign.  These were all deferred to 2026 and will not affect the 2026 elections.

Protections for Illegal Immigration are progressing – HB58, HB60, HB93, HB94 , HB95, HB96, HB150 & HB151

Limiting schools and State/local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement agencies or providing information from state files and resources. These were not yet passed in 2025.

Expanding protected classes under the umbrella of anti-discrimination continues – HB115 & SB78

(Photo: Izzy Ross/IPR News)This story is made possible through a partnership between Interlochen Public Radio and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
Students at Traverse City West Senior High School are raising money to install solar panels on their campus so they can learn about renewable energy.
Srinergy, a Michigan-based solar company, donated 14 ground panels to the school and students need to fundraise money to cover installation costs. They aim to raise more than $11,000 by the end of this school year.
The school’s Environmental Club is leading the effort. Lucy Jones, the club’s president and senior at TC West, said clean energy like solar will only become more common as students get older. That makes this project important for their education, she said.
“It’s good for students to learn about it now and learn about how it works, so then in the future, they’re able to know about it and use renewable energy in their lives,” Jones said.
The goal of the project is to teach students, but the 14 panels would generate about 7,000 kilowatt hours of electricity for the building. That’s an estimated 5% of the school’s electricity use, according to the project proposal from Srinergy.
Mary Brisbois, a science teacher at TC West, said data from these solar panels could help teach students in her environmental science class about how renewable energy works. Other science and math teachers have expressed interest to Brisbois in using data for their classes, too.
Students are also responsible for fundraising, she said. That way, students can learn that “money is something to figure out” and not always “a complete roadblock,” Brisbois said.
Lyla Hollis is a clean energy specialist at the nonprofit Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities and a partner in the school solar project. She said just seeing the installation of the panels could be beneficial to students.
“Getting the solar panels installed into the electric system is not that hard, but it is a process, and to learn how to do that on a small scale is pretty cool to see,” Hollis said. “The actual steps, you can implement it in different classes and learn how the chemistry works and all that stuff, which is more than I learned in school.”
Jones said she’s optimistic her classmates will raise enough money by the end of the year, with the help of the local community. And she’s excited for future students to benefit, long after she graduates.
“It’ll be something that the whole school will get to see and experience and gain information and knowledge from and then on to future generations,” she said. “It’s kind of like giving something to the school and giving back to our community.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/m-72-solar-panels-8.2.23-1024x768.png,,,2026-01-18 13:56:44.118578

For years, both Democrats and Republicans in Michigan have advocated expanding FOIA to include the two branches of government, but no deal has been reached.
Currently, two bills aiming to expand Michigan’s FOIA laws (Senate Bills 1 and 2) are sitting in the House’s Governmental Operations Committee awaiting discussion. However, Michigan Speaker of the House Matt Hall stated that he wasn’t interested in putting the bills on the agenda.
“We’re just not going to do FOIA,” Hall told reporters during a Nov. 6 press conference.
Michigan’s Democratic-led Senate started 2025 by quickly introducing and passing the bills, with 33 yeas and two nays. After moving off the Senate floor, SB 1 and 2 were read by the House and have remained in committee since January.
‘Let’s get it done,’ Moss says as Michigan FOIA reform clears Senate again

“If this were put up for a vote in the House, it would pass,” said Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township), co-author of the bills. “There’s no doubt. It has the votes.
“The question is, why won’t the speaker put it up for a vote?”
Hall recently celebrated the passing of two earmark reform bills (Public Acts 32 and 33 of 2025), which require legislators to disclose spending on individual projects before a final budget is put up for a vote. The passing of these bills completes part of Hall’s Ethics, Accountability and Transparency, or HEAT, plan, which he believes will be more beneficial to the public than expanding FOIA.
“We ask people all the time, they know HEAT will have a much better benefit than  FOIA,” Hall said during the conference.
Michigan Press Association Public Policy Manager Lisa McGraw said that the reform bill is a step in the right direction, but that the state government could, and should, do more.
“I think until the governor and the legislature in the state are subject to FOIA, we really have no transparency at the state level,” said McGraw, who has been working to expand FOIA since 2015.
Hall did not provide comment for this story.
Senators Moss and McBroom’s mission for FOIA
SB 1 and 2 are in the same position as other FOIA expansion bills that have been introduced in recent years.
Since joining the State Senate in 2019, Moss and Sen. Ed McBroom (R-Vulcan) have co-authored four bills in an attempt to expand FOIA:

Senate Bill 1 of 2025
Senate Bill 2 of 2025
Senate Bill 669 of 2023
Senate Bill 670 of 2023

While serving as the state representative for Michigan’s 35th District, Moss introduced House Bill 4149 of 2017, which would have made the legislature and the governor subject to FOIA. Just like his and McBroom’s Senate bills, the House bill was referred to committee and wasn’t put on the agenda for a vote.
“It was the first bipartisan package that got out of the House that term, and the Senate Leader (Arlan Meekhof) said, ‘I’m not taking this up,’” Moss said.
According to a 2017 story by the Detroit Free Press, Meekhof told journalists, “You guys are the only people who care about this” referencing Moss and McBroom’s bill.
Both senators will be term limited at the end of 2026. Both stated they will continue to push for expanding the public’s right to know.
“We would really like to see this project through,” Moss said. “It’s not fun to work on something for 10 years, and make progress on it, and not get past the finish line. But we’re working really, really hard to achieve this.”
The campaign on FOIA expansion
In 2018, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer stated that she would work to expand FOIA laws to include the governor’s office and legislature.
“I mean, unilaterally we could open up the executive branch to FOIA and ensure that there is real notice and real searchable capabilities online,” Whitmer said in an interview on PBS Detroit in July of 2018. “The public and the press need tools so they can get information.”
Whitmer signed Public Acts 32 and 33 of 2025 into law and praised the bills.
“Since I took office, I’ve been committed to increasing transparency in our government, so Michiganders know exactly where their hard-earned dollars are going,” Whitmer stated in a press release. “I made a promise to increase transparency on legislative earmarks in my most recent State of the State. Less than a year later, I’m proud to sign these two bills that require lawmakers to put their names on any projects they propose.”
“I’ll keep working with anyone to serve Michiganders and increase transparency in our government.”

Whitmer made the calendars for her office and the office of Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist open to the public – as well as her federal income tax returns and personal financial information.
However, her promise to extend FOIA to her office has not yet been met.
Whitmer did not provide comment for this story.
“Since the (Whitmer) administration started, we have not gone anywhere despite an entire campaign called the Sunshine Report, when she was running the first time,” said McGraw.
In 2018, Whitmer released an eight-page document titled “Get it Done: Michigan Sunshine Plan,” highlighting issues with Michigan’s transparency and ethics laws and what she wanted to change if elected governor.
“If the legislature won’t act, I will use the governor’s authority under the Michigan State Constitution to extend FOIA to the Lieutenant Governor and Governor’s Offices,” Whitmer stated in the report. “ Michiganders should know when and what their governor is working on.”
While discussing the history of politicians advocating for expanding FOIA, Attorney General Dana Nessel told Central Michigan Life that false promises are often made during campaigns.
“No one runs for governor being like, ‘absolutely not, I don’t agree with that,” Nessel said. “Everyone says what they think everyone wants to hear, and maybe they really think that, until they get (into office).’’
As Whitmer’s term comes to an end in 2026, candidates in the gubernatorial race have started to make promises on expanding FOIA.
“On day one, I will voluntarily comply with FOIA,” said Democratic candidate Jocelyn Benson, who has served as Secretary of State since 2019. “Every job I’ve had, whether it’s been running a law school or running the Department of State, I’ve complied with FOIA proudly.”
Republican candidate and Former House Speaker Tom Leonard shared a similar commitment during an interview with Central Michigan Life in October.
“Michigan is only one of two states in the entire country whose executive branch and legislature is not subject to open records and FOIA. That needs to change,” Leonard said. “People of this state deserve to know what’s going on in their executive branch and legislature.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_9944-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-18 11:56:26.353815

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s second most populous county has agreed it will no longer jail people who can’t afford to pay the daily fees attached to the state’s signature sobriety program.
Pennington County’s settlement in a federal class action lawsuit could impact the way counties operate the 24-7 program, which originated in South Dakota and has since spread to other states. 
People accused of crimes involving drugs or alcohol can be assigned to the program and released as they await trial, or as part of their sentence, on the condition they submit to sobriety monitoring and pay for it.
The participation price varies based on the type of monitoring involved and how long a person takes part. Some people pay $2 a day for breath testing, while others pay $30-$42 a week for urinalysis drug testing or alcohol monitoring bracelets. Judges also permit participants to shift from one method to another along the way to better suit their financial or life circumstances. 
Some people remain on the program for weeks or months, and occasionally for a year or more, depending on how long it takes for their case to work its way through the court system. 
Drunken driving courts prepare for more action from minimum-sentence law

The Pennington County settlement comes in a lawsuit filed in 2023 by a Rapid City man named Ricky Lookingback, who’d been ordered to participate in drug testing. 
He was jailed for failure to pay a 24-7 fee, which he argued was a violation of constitutional prohibitions on jailing people for debt. He also alleged that he belonged to a class of individuals who’d been jailed for the same reason in Pennington County, and asked for a judgment on behalf of all class members.
Under the terms of the agreement, Lookingback and 37 others jailed for inability to pay program fees are members of the class and are each eligible for cash payments, with Lookingback in line for $10,000 and the others for $1,000 each. The settlement also dictates that no one can be jailed or threatened with jail time for their inability to pay program fees.
Class members will have the opportunity to object to the terms of the settlement at a hearing in February. A federal judge can then accept or reject the agreement, which has been signed by Lookingback and county officials.
Jim Leach, Lookingback’s Rapid City lawyer, said the settlement should put all South Dakota counties on notice that jailing the indigent is a civil rights violation and could draw a legal challenge.
“I’ve got nothing against the 24-7 program,” Leach said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight. “From everything I can gather, it’s a really good program that has helped a lot of people. But nonetheless, the basic constitutional law in this country is that we cannot jail people for poverty.”
24-7 built on frequent testing, participant fees
Under the 24-7 program, testing fees are due at the time of testing or in advance.
In the cheapest and most common form of 24-7, people appear twice daily at a local jail to take breath tests for alcohol, at a cost of $1 per test. Those who fail a test or fail to show up can be put in jail, after which a judge decides whether to release them again.
More than 90,000 people have been on some version of the program since its launch, and hundreds participate every day. Its rollout began as a three-county pilot project in 2005 under the guidance of former Attorney General Larry Long, who’d tried it decades earlier as Bennett County’s state’s attorney.
In testimony before the Legislature in 2022, Long called it “the most efficient tool to reduce DUIs ever enacted in South Dakota.”
Driving under the influence arrests have not dropped dramatically since the program launched, but they also haven’t grown in line with the state’s population, which is 20% higher today than in 2005. 
DUI arrests hit 11,612 in 2024, the last full year reported in the Department of Public Safety’s annual summary. That was the highest tally since 2007, the year the 24-7 program went statewide, when there were 11,756 DUI arrests. 
Long stepped down as attorney general in 2009 to become a circuit court judge. In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, he said DUIs holding more or less steady is a sign that the program works. 
The bigger impact, Long said, has been on felony drunken driving charges and alcohol-related traffic crashes. 
In 2007, when the program went statewide, there were 1,092 felony DUI charges, each representing a third or subsequent offense. By 2017, the year he retired as a judge, that number had fallen to 699. In the last fiscal year, there were 468 charges for such repeat offenses, according to the Unified Judicial System.
Alcohol-related crashes, meanwhile, hit a record high of 630 in 2006, according to the Department of Public Safety. The highest tally since then was 535, recorded in 2021. In 2024, there were 458 such crashes.
Since its start in South Dakota, versions of the 24-7 program have spread to other states, including North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Wisconsin and Utah.
Constitutional concerns about jailing the program’s poorest participants have always been a sticking point, Long said, even for people who’ve generally supported the concept. 
The price point for breath tests was set low intentionally, he said, in hopes of making the program accessible to the widest range of people.
From the start, Long advised the county sheriffs who run the programs that an inability to pay shouldn’t be enough to draw immediate sanctions. 
“What I used to say during my presentations was ‘if you skip or if you fail, you go to jail,’” said Long. “You don’t go to jail for not paying.”
Long acknowledged, however, that local officials may not have always followed that guidance.
There are no statewide statistics on how many people may have been jailed for failure to pay 24-7 fees, according to the Attorney’s General’s Office, since counties manage their own programs. During debate on a bill to alter the program in 2022, administrators said punishment for failure to pay alone is a rarity, based on reports from counties.
Fees still too much for some
The 24-7 fees may be fairly low, but they’re still more than some people have, said Leach. 
Lookingback was and remains homeless, Leach said, and he was placed in a version of 24-7 that required him to take three drug tests each week, at a cost of $10 per test. 
Court documents in the case, filed by Pennington County, say Lookingback was released from jail and ordered to sign in to the program and did not on multiple occasions in 2023. On those occasions, the county said, he was sanctioned for failure to appear for testing.
In the fall of that year, he was again ordered into the program. On Sept. 23, 2023, he showed up but didn’t have the $10 needed to pay the fees. As a result, Leach said, Lookingback found himself again incarcerated at the Pennington County Jail.
If a judge accepts the settlement agreement, Pennington County will pay Lookingback $10,000 for that incarceration, and will set aside another $37,000 for the 37 other people who were found to have been jailed for their inability to pay. 
Leach will be required to “make reasonable efforts” to contact the 37 people, who were identified in county records obtained over the course of the lawsuit. Any money that goes uncollected, the settlement says, will be given to a nonprofit organization called the Public Justice Debtor’s Project. The New York-based nonprofit works to address issues related to the jailing of defendants for unpaid court fees across multiple jurisdictions. 
Leach can ask the judge to order Pennington County to pay attorney’s fees, but the settlement says he’s entitled to none of the money the county’s already promised to pay through the agreement.
Helene Duhamel, spokeswoman for the Pennington County Sheriff’s Department, said in a statement the settlement “clarifies that 24-7 Sobriety Program participants who have not paid the court-ordered fees” won’t be incarcerated.
“Instead, individuals who have not paid the 24-7 Program fees may be reported to the courts or supervising authority,” Duhamel said. “Any sanction decisions for nonpayment would be set by the court.”
A judge can look at each case individually to determine if the person who didn’t pay on a given day truly could not afford to, or if they were able to pay and didn’t. Participants can be sanctioned under the latter circumstance, under the terms of the settlement, but not for a legitimate lack of funds. 
The settlement applies to the 37 known members of the class, Leach said, but the class also includes any people who “have been or will in the future be incarcerated in Pennington County, threatened with incarceration or sanctions, based in whole or in part on inability to pay the fees required to participate in the 24-7 Program.” 
The county currently has 352 people in the program.
Other counties, statewide impacts
Lucas Oyler, the program’s former state coordinator, told lawmakers in 2022 that an inability to threaten jail for failure to pay might cause county sheriffs, who administer 24-7 tests, to opt out of participating in the program.
Leach said he doubts that. He said the majority of people who wind up involved in the criminal justice system, even those deemed income-eligible for a court-appointed lawyer, are able to pay $2 a day. 
“But at the same time, there’s a certain group of people who are just poor,” Leach said, in ways that are “far beyond anything” most people have experienced.
‘Treated like a criminal’: Native woman’s death sparks questions

Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead was among the first sheriffs to use 24-7, and he’s been following the Pennington County lawsuit closely. 
The policy for 24-7 participants in Minnehaha County, he said, is built around an understanding that an inability to pay doesn’t justify an immediate jail stay.
“If a person has been released from jail and ordered by a judge to comply with the 24-7 program as a condition of release but cannot pay,” Milstead wrote in an email to South Dakota Searchlight, “then it is up to the judge to decide whether bond should be revoked, modified, or remain.”
In response to questions from South Dakota Searchlight on how counties ought to proceed in the face of the successful class action lawsuit, Attorney General Marty Jackley issued a statement saying his office intends to let counties decide the right approach.
“While we cannot dictate how an agency operates its program,” Jackley wrote, “we are committed to supporting them in ensuring compliance with state statutes and administrative rules.”
Long, the former attorney general who launched the program, said a case can be made that counties — or even community organizations — would benefit in the long run if they decide to pay 24-7 fees for the indigent, who might be “among the ones who’d most benefit from it.”
Keeping habitual drinkers or drug users sober can reduce visits to the emergency room, Long said, as well as business losses from theft.
“There is some community benefit to keeping these folks sober,” Long said.

Wisconsin lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers rushed to finish the state budget in July, ahead of federal legislation making it to President Donald Trump’s desk, to ensure the state draw down additional federal funds. Whether the state will be able to benefit from that funding is now uncertain. 
The 2025-27 state budget included a provision to increase its Medicaid hospital assessment from 1.8% to 6% as a way to supplement the state’s Medicaid resources with matching contributions from the federal government. The change was meant to increase payments to hospitals and to offset the state’s funding for the Medical Assistance program. It was estimated to result in over $1 billion in additional revenue for Wisconsin hospitals. 
A Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis this week found that “preliminary federal guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has created some uncertainty about the allowability of changes to Wisconsin’s hospital assessment.”
29 Marklein Born Revenue Estimates
The analysis said that if the increase is disallowed then it would lead to a general purpose revenue shortfall of $396 million annually — or $792 million in the 2025-27 biennium.
“CMS indicated that this matter will be addressed through formal rule making procedures, and thus will be subject to provisions of notice and public comment. Pending additional information from the federal government, the allowability of the Act 15 changes is not currently known,” the LFB analysis stated. 
A group of eight Democratic state lawmakers, including state Rep. Steve Doyle and Sen. Brad Pfaff, both from Onalaska, sent a letter to U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden urging him to take action to help ensure Wisconsin receives the funds. Following the state budget, Van Orden claimed credit for helping secure the extra funds for the state.
“Our hospitals, and especially our rural hospitals were counting on that funding to keep their
doors open… At a time when our medical institutions are facing unprecedented financial challenges, we must do everything we can to ensure their ability to continue to operate. Our state budget was counting on it, and our constituents’ lives literally depend on it. We implore you to do everything in your power to reverse these catastrophic decisions,” the lawmakers wrote.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Department of Energy/Bechtel)Congress this week approved a $3.2 billion budget for the Hanford nuclear reservation’s cleanup in fiscal 2026 — a more than $200 million increase from the prior two years.
That is more than what the Trump administration originally requested for Hanford, but almost $3 billion less than what Washington officials believe is needed this year to keep the site’s cleanup on its legally mandated timetable. This is also the biggest cleanup budget in Hanford’s history.
President Donald Trump’s budget request allocated slightly less than $400 million to operate Hanford’s biggest project — the new plant to convert the site’s radioactive waste into glass, which began operating in October. 
Congress bumped that budget up to $480 million, according to the office of Washington U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
Murray said in a statement that Thursday’s Senate approval was “a rejection of the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine the Hanford cleanup mission.” 
“We cannot do nuclear waste cleanup on the cheap,” she said. 
The House passed the same budget earlier this month.
Washington’s Department of Ecology calculates that Hanford needs a budget of $6.15 billion to meet all of its legal cleanup obligations for fiscal 2026, and $6.76 billion for fiscal 2027. 
Hanford’s cleanup is governed by an often-litigated and often-changed 35-year-old legal agreement between the state, the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
“The federal government has a big job to do cleaning up Hanford,” Gov. Bob Ferguson,  a Democrat, said in a statement. “This budget is a positive step forward in ensuring they live up to their responsibilities.”
“We have made important progress this year. Let’s keep up the momentum,” he added.
Casey Sixkiller, director of the state ecology department, also acknowledged progress with the cleanup in the past year.
“We need to keep funding at a level where we can accelerate the pace of cleanup and reduce the risk of a catastrophic infrastructure collapse or contamination release,” Sixkiller said. “Now is the time for the federal government to double down and not back away from its legal and moral obligations to the people of Washington state. ”
Hanford is arguably the most radioactively contaminated spot in the Western Hemisphere.
The U.S. government set up Hanford in 1943 to create plutonium for the nation’s atomic bombs, including those exploded in New Mexico and over Nagasaki in 1945. That work created many billions of gallons of chemical and radioactive waste.
The worst 56 million gallons of that waste were pumped into 177 underground tanks. About a third of those tanks leak. At least a million gallons of radioactive liquid have leaked into the ground, seeping into the aquifer 200 feet below and then into the Columbia River, roughly seven miles away.
Hanford has just begun converting lesser radioactive wastes in the tanks into a benign glass to be eventually stored at an underground storage site at a still undetermined location. 
A second plant to tackle more radioactive waste could be operating in the 2030s. 
Since the low-activity waste plant will handle only 40-50% of the less radioactive wastes, Hanford recently decided to look into encasing the remaining low-activity materials in a cement-like substance, which would be theoretically faster and cheaper than building a second low-level glassification plant. 
Originally, the legal deadline to finish glassifying all 56 million gallons of tank wastes was 2019. 
Right now, Hanford’s legal target is removing all the waste from 149 single-shell tanks and closing those tanks by 2043, and closing the 28 newer and safer double-shell tanks by 2052. 
The Energy Department has moved those targets back to 2069, a date not reflected in its current cleanup agreements with the state of Washington, according to a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Hanford-low-activity-waste-facility-containers-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-18 07:56:11.365376

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota must spend $106 million in remaining pandemic relief by the end of the year, or it has to be returned to the federal government.
Most of the funds left to spend are for water and wastewater infrastructure projects, housing, broadband, ambulance upgrades and telemedicine upgrades in nursing homes, according to a Wednesday presentation from the Bureau of Finance and Management at the Capitol in Pierre.
Bureau Commissioner Jim Terwilliger told lawmakers on the budget committee that the state will meet the deadline to “maximize those dollars.”
“We feel like we’re in a good place,” Terwilliger said.
Federal relief and stimulus funding for South Dakota in response to the COVID-19 pandemic included about $974 million from the State Fiscal Recovery Funds authorized by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The unspent balance represents about 10% of that funding.


The funding has been transformative in some sectors of the state. South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources Secretary Hunter Roberts said during the last legislative session the influx of cash sparked an overdue “water renaissance.”
Roberts’ department has $75 million left to spend on water and sewer projects. Some projects that have used ARPA funding so far include upgrades for the Mni Waste Water Company in western South Dakota, a regional waterline upgrade for the Randall Community Water District in eastern South Dakota, and funding for the Western Dakota Regional Water System study.
The bureau receives quarterly department reports for how funding is spent. As the end of 2026 approaches, any unspent funds will be reallocated to water projects.
About $14 million for workforce housing projects, which is roughly a quarter of that program’s ARPA funding, has not been spent. A mix of federal and state funding was approved by lawmakers in 2022 to help increase South Dakota’s housing stock as the state’s population grows. Roughly $64 million in state-funded loans for workforce housing also remain unobligated, with Gov. Larry Rhoden proposing those state funds be shifted to airport improvement projects, and a legislative task force recommending the money be used for property tax credits.
About $4 million, which is nearly half of the ARPA funding meant to improve emergency medical services across the state, has not been spent, according to the presentation. About $2 million, which is three-quarters of the ARPA funding promised to nursing home telemedicine upgrades, hasn’t been spent yet either. Both grant programs are under the state Department of Health.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The effort of Mississippi House leaders and others to expand programs providing public funds to private schools validates the oft-repeated quote that “history may not repeat itself, but it often rhymes.”
Efforts by Mississippi legislators to send public funds to private schools go back to at least the 1960s.
The current effort, led by House Speaker Jason White and buttressed by President Donald Trump and Gov. Tate Reeves, would provide funds to parents to allow them to help pay for the children’s education at a private school.
The argument is made that such a scheme, sending the money to parents to help pay for their child’s private school education, will not violate Section 208 of the Mississippi Constitution, which states definitively that public money may not go to schools not operating as “free schools.”
The argument is being made that it would be constitutional because the public money is going to the parent instead of the private school. Some would argue that the process is simply trying to achieve through deception what the Mississippi Constitution says is prohibited and, who knows, maybe that is the definition of lawyering.
There have been limited state court cases involving Section 208, and none of those addressed directly the issue of whether providing public funds to a family to be spent on a private school education is constitutional.
It is almost certain that many of the nine members of the Mississippi Supreme Court would prefer not to have to take up the explosive issue. But if the bill passes the Legislature, it is almost certain that it will land in justices’ laps at the state’s highest court.
While it does not appear there has been a state case addressing the particulars that will be in front of the Mississippi Supreme Court if the bill becomes law, in 1969 there was a federal case with similar facts. The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a state law sending public funds, called tuition grants, to families to be spent on a private school education.
As the number of Mississippi private schools exploded in the 1960s to provide white students an escape from attending classes with Black students, the Mississippi Legislature passed a bill to provide funds to white students to be used to attend segregationist academies.
Many of those academies still exist today and could benefit if the new effort to provide public funds to private schools becomes law.
The 5th Circuit did not address Section 208 of the Mississippi Constitution, but instead said the law was discriminatory. The 5th Circuit found that the law “encourages, facilitates and supports the establishment of a system of private schools operated on a racially segregated basis as an alternative available to white students seeking to avoid desegregated public schools.”
Granted, 2026 is much different than the 1960s. There are many private schools that enroll and do a good job educating Black students.
But there are still private schools that take great pride in being the sole overseer of their enrollment criteria. The private schools told legislators during a hearing on the issue last year that they would not relinquish their authority to decide who they enroll.
There are, no doubt, private schools that deny enrollment to certain disabled students because of the high cost of providing those children an education.
And, no doubt, there would be private schools that would balk at enrolling gay or trans students. Some private schools also might deny enrollment to students who openly embrace certain religious practices.
Are those forms of discrimination?
In 1969, like today, the executive branch of the federal government got involved in the issue of sending public funds to private schools. The Trump administration has endorsed the bill pending in the Mississippi Legislature.
In 1969 the Justice Department of then-president Richard Nixon opposed the effort to provide “tuition grants” for students to attend private schools.
The opposing positions taken by the two presidents perhaps proves that sometimes history does not repeat itself and doesn’t even rhyme.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/07022545/IMG-3225.jpg,,,2026-01-18 07:56:11.365376

The brave
Marga Camarinta, 15, Manchester Center

I am 4,
and a self-proclaimed 
hero of bravery.

The plane whirs in my ears,
loud and incessant and monstrous,
but I sit as calmly as I can.
Solemn and stoic
is this sugar-stuffed knight.

In this dark, blue light,
in this hollow, titanium titan,
I am illuminated by wonder.

Questions…
questions about a foreign land,
one shrouded in mystery,
with unfamiliar faces.
Like a faraway fantasy,

but tangible to the tips of my small, sticky fingers.

The United States of America:
the land of the free,
and apparently, 
the home of the brave.

Yet so unlike the home I am accustomed to,
and so far away from the ones I love.

But just as this hero feels herself falter
and fall into the mouth of the monster that is her fears,
she is swept up by a warm, wooly embrace,
rescued by her own hero of bravery:
her dazzling, fearless Mom.

The contract lays out a pay schedule that starts with a base wage of $34 an hour, putting the Hinesburg department relatively in line with other Chittenden County police forces.

This story by Briana Brady was first published in The Citizen on Jan. 15, 2026.
The Hinesburg police union, recognized by the town last June, has officially inked a contract with the town of Hinesburg.
The contract, which will go into effect in July, is set to last until June 2029 and outlines a slew of worker protections and benefits along with a step system for annual pay raises. The contract also comes at a time when Hinesburg is oriented toward building back up its police department, both by hiring a chief and filling out its vacant officer positions.
The Hinesburg officers had previously unionized under the Fraternal Order of Police in 2021, but never successfully negotiated a contract. Last year, they organized under the New England Police Benevolent Association and quickly began negotiations, which have been ongoing since the summer.
While contract negotiations inevitably lend some question as to whether pay raises or changes in benefits may impact a budget, according to town manager Todd Odit, the contract signed by the selectboard and union representatives will not change any of the calculations for the police budget as it is currently drafted. The selectboard has been debating increasing the number of budgeted officers from five to six, but the calculation for what each officer might cost will not change.
The contract lays out a pay schedule that starts with a base wage of $34 an hour. This puts the Hinesburg department fairly in line with other Chittenden County towns and their own police forces. According to various job postings, towns range in starting pay from around $30 in Winooski to over $37 in Burlington. That includes a $34 starting wage in Williston and just over $31 an hour in South Burlington.
For departments across Vermont, successful contract negotiations can represent a renewed ability to vie for officers. The state is currently in a police shortage, with active postings in communities across the county that have been open for months or longer. If an officer isn’t happy with their position, it’s not difficult to find another.
Right now, Hinesburg only has three officers, including interim police chief Frank Bryan, of the five it has budgeted. In October, in outlining a departmental case for an increased budget, Bryan advocated to increase the base pay to $36 an hour as well as for additional officers.
“The more we overwork these guys, the more likely they are to say, ‘hey, I can probably make just as much money, if not more money in another town,’” Bryan said. He added that increases to the budget and base pay would not only help the town retain officers, but hire new ones.
There are other elements to the new contract that might be appealing to an incoming officer. For one, there is the possibility for a sign-on bonus of up to $10,000. Additionally, come July, Hinesburg’s officers will have four hours of flexible unpaid leave every month which can be used for things such as attending a child’s parent-teacher conference or bringing an elder to a doctor’s appointment. The officers will also have a labor-management committee to address workplace issues outside of union negotiations.
Along with the budget discussions, this contract is also coming into effect as Hinesburg searches for a new police chief. The town hired consultants to conduct a search for applicants and brought on two community members to give feedback on the process. As of Jan. 7, Odit said the town had entered the second round of interviews with candidates.
Odit has long contended that stable leadership is imperative to attracting and retaining officers. Should a new chief soon be found, in conjunction with the new union contract, the town may be well positioned to start trying to fill out its roster — whether or not the selectboard approves a budget decision that increases the town’s total officer count from five to six.

Many teenagers wallpaper their bedrooms with pinups of hot celebrities. Jessie Diggins, the most-awarded U.S. cross-country skier in history, instead tacked up an “Endless Winter” poster of a less-recognized hero: Vermonter Bill Koch, the first American Nordic racer to win an Olympic medal.
“He looked like he was having fun,” Diggins, who grew up in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburb of Afton, Minnesota, recently recalled of the athlete-in-action shot. “It was the pure joy of life. That for me is what it’s all about.”
Moving to the Green Mountain State in 2012, a 20-year-old Diggins joined Stratton’s SMS T2 elite training team in hopes of following in Koch’s footsteps.

“I took a blind leap of faith as this young, naive total nobody when I moved out here,” she said in an interview.
Fourteen years later, Diggins — currently ranked the globe’s No. 1 female cross-country skier, with Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals and three overall-season World Cups — is set to wrap up her racing career this March after her fourth and final Winter Games.
“Her world-class engine, her unique combination of fearlessness and vulnerability, and her willingness to tell the world about her frailties is what has made Diggins an icon to plenty of people,” the New York Times wrote in its report on her pending retirement.
For all her stratospheric success, Diggins remains down-to-earth. Take her turn as a de facto cater-waiter when she crushed bags of ice into a beverage tub at a recent $100-a-plate Stratton dinner in her honor.
“This community really took me in,” the 34-year-old said. “I honestly believe this is the best place in the world to train. You feel really supported, and I’m able to get all the things that I need to learn and grow.”
It’s why Diggins keeps finding ways to give back.
‘A whole different story’
Diggins, born in the pre-digital days of 1991, doesn’t have a trope childhood memory of skiing before walking. Instead, she first saw Nordic racing on a VHS tape.
“I’m not going to lie,” she wrote in her 2020 memoir “Brave Enough.” “I wasn’t all that into it.”
Diggins changed her mind when she learned that winners left with a prize.
Joining the Minnesota Youth Ski League at age 3, Diggins ran out of levels to compete in by 10. Worried about juggling homework with practice six days a week, she almost didn’t join the cross-country team in seventh-grade, only to train with the varsity girls and, by her senior year of high school, score straight As and a state championship.
“On the outside, school and sports and dating were going great,” she wrote. “But on the inside, it was a whole different story.”
While classmates saw her as an all-American free spirit and picture of fitness, Diggins — watching her body morph from a girl to a woman — began to eye what she thought was fat. Her memoir recounts her struggle with eating disorders before a family intervention led her to the national Emily Program nonprofit treatment network.
“I’m so lucky to be here and be alive,” she wrote. “This secret, left to its own devices, might have killed me.”

Diggins earned entrance to the U.S. ski team and World Cup racing circuit in 2011, spurring her move to Vermont the next year. Training with Stratton’s SMS T2 crew, she soon found herself alongside one of its founders: Koch, who acquiesced to autographing her childhood poster.
Diggins would compete in the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, then win U.S. cross-country’s first-ever Olympic gold medal in 2018 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and a silver (after a bout of food poisoning) and bronze in 2022 in Beijing, China.
In World Cup racing, Diggins became the first American woman to score the season Nordic title in 2021 (Koch became the first U.S. man to do so in 1982) and repeated the feat in 2023 and 2025.
Headed back to the Olympics, Diggins is plugging into social media to connect with fans in her home state of Minnesota, training site in Vermont and Boston suburb where she lives with her husband, financial analyst Wade Poplawski, in Massachusetts.
The skier happily lays claim to them all.
“I’ve been welcomed and adopted by all these different states,” she said. “It’s triple the love.”
‘I have a much bigger platform’
Diggins has yet to announce what she’ll do upon retiring after this March’s World Cup finals in Lake Placid, New York, although she’s noted a desire to start a family and already has after-hours partnerships with the Emily Program, the climate-advocating Protect Our Winters and the ski-instructing Share Winter Foundation.
For several summers, Diggins has joined the Bill Koch Youth Ski League for a fundraising hike up Stratton Mountain. Asked this past August for her biggest challenge, she told students about the 50-kilometer skate at last year’s world championship in Trondheim, Norway.
“I came in as a heavy medal favorite,” she recalled. “There were a lot of cameras and lights and pressure on me.”
Three minutes into the long race, she lagged behind a large field of competitors and realized she wasn’t going to win.
“I had to make a difficult decision. Do I drop out? Do I make some sort of excuse? Or do I finish because I love what I do?”
Determined to continue, Diggins pushed forward for the next two hours and 40 minutes.
“It was the hardest thing I’d ever done, but it was a really good experience,” she said of her 22nd-place finish. “When you win a race, you don’t really learn a whole lot, but when you lose, you get a chance to reexamine: Is this still fun? Do I still love training?”
In that moment, Diggins answered affirmatively, propelling her into this current end-on-a-high-note season.
“Sometimes,” she told students, “having a really, really bad day is what you need to continue to have good days.”

After Covid limited crowds at the 2022 Olympics, Diggins is set to travel with her family, friends and trademark face glitter to next month’s Winter Games in Italy. But she’s less interested in the destination than the journey there.
“You really have to enjoy the process of what you’re doing every day, because even if you win, the award ceremony will last 10 minutes — and it’ll be the best 10 minutes of your life — and then it will be over,” she said. “If you don’t love working hard, improving, and everything else that goes into it and you get out of it, then winning isn’t going to change your life.”
That’s why Diggins focuses on the present rather than the future.
“In racing, I want to cross the finish line and look back and say, ‘I used this chance and I gave it my all. That’s the approach I have with advocacy, too. I have a much bigger platform, and I’ve found myself thinking, ‘I have to do something with this.’ If there’s a way I can make a difference, then I want to try.”

Although overall town populations in Stowe, Morristown and Elmore have increased over the last decade, school enrollment has declined by 10% since 2017, according to a new study.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in News & Citizen on Jan. 15, 2026.
A study commissioned by the Lamoille South Supervisory Union predicts that school enrollments in Stowe, Morristown and Elmore will decline 10% by the 2030 school year, reflecting trends in rural towns throughout Vermont as the state ages and grows increasingly expensive.
At recent Stowe and Elmore-Morristown school board meetings, Lamoille South Supervisory Union Superintendent Ryan Heraty introduced the study to school board members and explained how the supervisory union might react to a slow enrollment decline over the next four years.
The study was produced by the Boston firm Statistical Forecasting LLC. In 2021, the supervisory union hired the New England Development Council to conduct a similar study, but the results were largely rejected due to controversial options for utilizing Lamoille South’s eight buildings, including shuttering some of them and rerouting students to different locations.
Heraty said the new report is focused more narrowly on student population and doesn’t make recommendations. Enrollment trends in local schools are frequently referenced in housing and affordability discussions throughout Lamoille County, particularly in Stowe, and the Stowe School board wanted a study that dovetails with the Town of Stowe’s Housing Needs Assessment.
“With all of the statewide discussion around consolidation and thinking about Vermont’s overall demographic trends, leaning towards an aging population, declining student enrollments — all of that — we want to think more local,” Heraty said. “How is this going to impact our schools here? And what do we see around housing trends that are going to impact our kindergarten, first and second grade enrollments so that we can start preparing for the future?”
Although overall town populations in Stowe, Morristown and Elmore have increased over the last decade, and are expected to increase in the future, according to the study, school enrollments in those towns have declined by 10%, from 1,592 in 2016 to 1,406 this year, after peaking at 1,694 students in 2017.
Throughout the Lamoille South Supervisory Union, kindergarten through fifth-grade classrooms have experienced the largest decline over the last eight years. Enrollment for that age group is currently at 544, a decrease of 132 students since 2016. According to the study, school enrollment for that age group is expected to dip over the next three years before leveling out at this year’s figure by 2030.
Enrollment for grades 6-8 has held relatively steady, declining by just 48 students over the last eight years, but that figure is expected to decline another 65 students by 2030.
High school enrollment district-wide has swung by nearly 100 students over the last eight years, ranging from 497 to 589, but figures for 2016 and 2025 are nearly even at 521 and 515, respectively. By 2030, that high school enrollment is expected to decline 12%.
While the study illustrated what many in Lamoille County’s housing and affordability circle already recognize — that a lack of viable housing and declining homestead rates are impacting local school enrollments — members of the Stowe school board said they aren’t necessarily concerned about declining enrollment.
“In my experience, it’s not unusual to see these ups and downs,” Stowe School Board Chair Tiffany Donza said.
In Stowe and Morristown, atypically large high school classes are currently graduating, inflating enrollment trends over the last few years, but elementary school enrollment has been low, partially explaining a projected enrollment decline by 2030 as those students move through the school system.
Prior to Act 60 and Act 68, both of which imposed a new funding formula for Vermont schools, Donza said enrollment wasn’t as much of a consideration. But the new formula started rewarding districts with more students and schools started watching their numbers closely, Donza said.
“It made it so students come with dollars,” Donza said, “Which is a disadvantage to Stowe for so many reasons.”
To understand enrollment trends, Heraty pointed to the median age of a community, saying those small elementary school classes coming up are indicative of greater housing and affordability issues facing families.
According to the study by Statistical Forecasting LLC, a housing boom from 1990 to 2009 benefitted a younger median age group who were moving to town. But as that group ages, and their children graduate, housing development has rapidly declined, and the median age has increased.
From 2000 to 2009, 1,207 homes were built in the Lamoille South Supervisory Union, almost twice as many as the next decade. From 2010 to 2020, there were only 666 homes built, according to the study. Stowe’s grand list has also increased significantly and the homestead rate has declined.
“The problem isn’t demand; it’s availability of affordable housing,” Heraty said. “It’s really hard to be in a position where you know that people want to be here and they want to live in our communities, but the housing just doesn’t exist for them.”
While Heraty is not sounding the alarm of declining enrollment, the Lamoille South Supervisory Union has begun making subtle changes to respond to the trend.
The supervisory union has already reduced central office positions and will reduce support staff positions this year.
“We don’t need to look at this as a negative,” Donza said. “We just need to plan for it and properly staff the schools.”

But recently, Landry picked up a second role as special envoy to Greenland.","Gov. Jeff Landry now has to balance his duties as Louisiana's governor with his new role as President Donald Trump's special envoy to Greenland. (Photo by Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)Most of Jeff Landry’s predecessors as Louisiana governor never saw the need for a side hustle. For them, running the state was more than enough of a job. 
But Landry has made it clear he doesn’t want to be like other governors. His chutzpah might have been why the governor felt comfortable asking President Donald Trump to name him special envoy to Greenland on top of his duties overseeing Louisiana. 
Trump has made increasingly charged remarks in recent days about the United States taking control of Greenland, a self-ruling territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. In response, several European countries have announced their support for Greenland, with some launching military exercises to back up their stance. 

To what extent it is practical for the governor of Louisiana to be involved with the sensitive, international negotiations over Greenland that have much of Europe on edge while also managing one of the neediest states in the country remains to be seen.
“Most of us in Louisiana would think he is supposed to have a full-time job already,” said Terry Ryder, who served as general counsel for former Govs. Mike Foster and Kathleen Blanco and worked for former Govs. Buddy Roemer and Bobby Jindal. 

“Having been with multiple administrations, four administrations, there is always way more to do than any one governor can do,” Ryder said. 
Foreign affairs experts agreed it could be challenging for Landry to hold both roles at the same time. Special envoys, particularly ones handling high-profile issues for the White House, are often expected to devote their full attention to their assignment, they said. 
“Anytime you have two jobs, you are probably not doing either of them very well,” said Barbara Bodine, a former U.S. ambassador to Yemen who is now the director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University. 
“It is going to take a lot of his time out of state,” Bodine said of the envoy position. “There is no way you can be governor of Louisiana by Zoom.”
Landry’s staff declined to answer almost all questions emailed to them last week about the governor’s role as special envoy, including one regarding concerns the position could distract from his job as governor.

How much time will Landry spend on Greenland? His staff won’t say.
Landry isn’t being paid for his work as special envoy, his state staff said. But how much energy he will spend on Greenland isn’t clear.
Landry went to Washington, D.C., Thursday to participate in discussions that included the Trump administration, members of Congress and emissaries from Greenland and Denmark. He has also appeared in person on national television shows to talk about Greenland during a New York trip earlier this month. 
The governor’s office would not provide an estimate for how many hours Landry expects to spend per month on his Greenland role or to what extent he would be traveling for those duties.
Questions about whether Landry will receive federal staff or a D.C. office for his envoy role went unanswered by the governor’s staff. The U.S. Department of State and the White House press offices also didn’t answer questions about the federal resources Landry might receive. 
Foreign diplomacy experts said there are no set rules for an envoy, including whether the role is done on a part- or full-time basis. Historically, presidents have used special envoys because the positions allow for that type of flexibility. 
“It can be full time for a while, and then there is a pause in negotiations, and the envoy goes back to whatever they were doing before and just keeps a watchful eye on the matter,” James Bishop, a former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria, Liberia and Somalia, said in an interview. 
Given Trump’s intense focus on Greenland, however, foreign policy experts said Landry, as special envoy, would normally receive some federal staff support at the U.S. State Department on a temporary basis.

Landry would also be expected to make negotiations over Greenland his top priority while the discussions are taking place, the experts said.

“A sitting governor who intends to keep his day job is unusual, to say the least, because one of the reasons that you have a special envoy is that you have an issue that is meddlesome, and you need to find somebody who can focus on that issue to try to resolve it,” said Bodine, who teaches about the role of special envoys in one of her classes at Georgetown.

In recent history, Bill Richardson is the only other governor who had a strong hand in foreign affairs while holding his state office. The Democrat worked as a “freelance diplomat” to get American hostages released while leading New Mexico from 2003-11, although he was never designated a special envoy for the president during that time. 

Unlike Landry, Richardson had significant experience in foreign relations before he became governor. He first helped free an American hostage in 1994 during a trip to North Korea that he took as a New Mexico congressman, and he served as President Bill Clinton’s ambassador to the United Nations in 1997-98.

Landry says he wants Greenland deals for Louisiana 
While no connection between Greenland and Louisiana is apparent, it hasn’t stopped Landry from trying to make one with the arctic island. 

“They tell me they like to hunt, they like to fish, they like to have a good time. I’m like, ‘Y’all belong in Louisiana,’” Landry said on the Brian Kilmeade Show on Fox News Radio this month. 

The governor has also taken great pains, even on national broadcasts, to say he will use his role as special envoy to Greenland to create business investment for Louisiana. 

“I can’t wait to have discussions with Greenland about the opportunities that we can do in Louisiana,” Landry said during an appearance on CNBC Squawk Box.
The Louisiana Economic Development agency, which is run by a Landry appointee, is not actively working on business deals in Greenland but would welcome those types of projects, according to a spokeswoman. 
“[W]e are excited about the future opportunities that Governor Landry’s new role brings,” Emma Wagner said for the agency in a written statement. 
Talk of mixing Louisiana’s business with his special envoy duties alarmed foreign policy experts interviewed for this story. They said the governor using a diplomatic role abroad to gin up investment for the state would create ethical concerns and possibly run afoul of federal law. 
“It could get messy if, for example, any company that has an office, much less a headquarters, in Louisiana that would benefit from mining, refining or shipping,” Bodine said. 
There have also been questions about whether Landry might be violating a Louisiana constitutional law that prohibits public officials from holding federal and state jobs at the same time. But Ryder, who worked for four governors as an attorney, said he doubts Landry’s unpaid role will raise concerns.

“I would say the less formal it is, the safer it is for him,” Ryder said. “There is nothing wrong with a governor helping the president of the United States.” 
Whether Landry’s Greenland assignment will be popular with Louisiana voters is another matter. Former Gov. Bobby Jindal saw his polling numbers tank while he started traveling frequently to raise money and generate support for his 2016 presidential campaign. 

Bernie Pinsonat, a Louisiana political consultant and polling expert, doubts Louisiana voters have paid much attention to the governor’s Greenland job. Landry’s approval ratings are already low, standing at 39% according to one recent poll, but won’t necessarily sink further because of the special envoy job, he said.

“I’ll guarantee you that if [Louisiana voters] think he’s too involved in national politics versus what he’s doing here, believe me, he’ll suffer,” the pollster said. “But I don’t think he’s anywhere near that.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BR.specialsession.110724_HS_1722-1024x998.jpg,,,2026-01-18 06:56:56.816249

Winthrop Rockefeller was the only Southern governor to hold a public memorial following the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination.
The indelible image of a white governor joining hands with Black mourners to sing “We Shall Overcome” was needed to heal a city that was just a couple hours away from where King was killed.
The moment was also a reminder of how Arkansas shines the best when its leaders find ways to highlight the importance of civil rights rather than shy away. Arkansas needs to find more avenues to do so, even in a hyperpartisan environment.
The state’s move nearly a decade ago to remove Robert E. Lee’s name from the state holiday honoring King was a step in the right direction. The joint holiday honoring the civil rights icon alongside the Confederate general had become an embarrassment for the state, especially as pictures of the state notices about the joint holiday gained traction on social media.
That embarrassment was enough for Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to add the issue to his legislative agenda and take the rare step of testifying before a legislative committee in favor of it.
The state has made other signs of progress, at least symbolically. 
The decision to replace one of the state’s statues in the U.S. Capitol with one of Daisy Bates, the civil rights leader who mentored the nine students who integrated Central High School, was a necessary statement to be made in a building where statues of Confederate leaders can still be found.

A lesser but still significant step was taken by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signing legislation creating a specialty license plate honoring the Central High historic site.
But elsewhere there have been stumbles and missed opportunities. That includes the effort to no longer honor the Confederacy with one of the stars on Arkansas’ flag, a proposal that failed before a legislative committee. Similarly, a bid to end the state’s commemoration of “Confederate Flag Day” passed the House in 2021 but failed before a Senate panel.
The current political climate isn’t encouraging for another attempt at these measures. President Donald Trump has defended Confederate figures and symbols, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has taken moves to restore the names of Confederate generals to military bases.
Sanders has echoed Trump’s rhetoric complaining about “indoctrination” in the classroom, with a law she signed prohibiting critical race theory from being taught in public schools that’s sparked a legal fight. The prohibition has also drawn criticism from civil rights groups who say the restriction threatens to whitewash history. A federal appeals court panel last year allowed the law to be enforced in the state. 
Arkansas is running out of opportunities to properly honor that history instead of engaging in fights over it. Many of the leaders and key figures of the Civil Rights Movement are gone, including Claudette Colvin, who died last week. Two of the Little Rock Nine have died, leaving only seven of those civil rights icons left. 
Next year marks 70 years since the Little Rock desegregation crisis, and it may be one of the last times that an anniversary can be commemorated with most of the Little Rock Nine on hand. The sad truth is that despite the symbolic progress that’s been made, Arkansas remains a state where symbols and monuments of the Confederacy significantly outnumber tributes to the state’s civil rights icons.
It’s easy to echo talking points about heritage and much harder to admit that true patriotism requires embracing a full history. It requires elevating civil rights heroes, and acknowledging a country and state’s shameful past. 
Finding a way to do so in this environment might be the best monument.

The Legislature will reconvene for a three-day special session on Wednesday. (Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers plan to hold a three-day special session starting Wednesday, but it’s still unclear if they’ll discuss any bills other than five focused on the federal Rural Health Transformation Program.
Legislative leaders will decide Tuesday afternoon if additional bills will be allowed. That means the public will have a tight window to provide input on potential legislation. Gov. Kelly Armstrong will deliver a State of the State address at 10 a.m. Wednesday.
What we know
At least five bills will be introduced, focused on the federal rural health care funding, the reason Armstrong called the special session. One is an appropriations bill to approve spending $199 million of federal funding this year and authorizing $200 million anticipated for next year. A hearing is set for 10:30 a.m. Wednesday.
Four health policy bills also will be introduced. The one likely to get the most debate would expand the prescriptive authority of pharmacists, which proponents say could make it easier for rural North Dakotans to get treated for common conditions. A hearing for that bill is scheduled for 1 p.m. Wednesday. 

North Dakota Monitor special session coverage

Lawmakers also will consider a bill that would require K-12 students to take the presidential fitness test; a bill to require one-hour of continuing education for doctors related to healthy eating; and a bill to include physician assistants in a state licensure compact.
Hearings on those policy bills are scheduled between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Wednesday. For specific information, including links to submit written testimony, visit the committee hearing schedule. Some written testimony is due as early as 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.
Lawmakers also will accept public testimony in person and online, though they prioritize in-person testimony.
Lawmakers are proposing the policy bills in order to fulfill criteria for additional federal funding through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid’s grant application process. Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, warned any substantial modifications to those bills come with the risk of losing some of the state’s $199 million grant. 
“If any of those four policy bills do not pass in the form that we have them, or if they’re significantly changed from the form that CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) wanted us to draft as policies, then we could see reductions in funding or clawbacks of that funding,” said Bekkedahl, who will co-chair a joint Appropriations Committee during the special session. 


What we don’t know
The Legislative Management committee will meet at 1 p.m. Tuesday to hear pitches from lawmakers about other legislation for the special session. Lawmakers will have five minutes to explain their bill draft and why it’s an emergency that can’t wait until 2027.
We don’t know all of the topics that could be addressed. Those bill drafts are expected to become public on the legislative website on Monday on the Legislative Management meeting agenda.
One bill that will be pitched during that meeting is a proposal to provide free school meals to all K-12 students, similar to a ballot measure that’s circulating. It will be up to the bipartisan committee of legislative leaders to decide if the bill advances to the full Legislature on Wednesday.
If the committee does not advance a bill, a lawmaker could still attempt to introduce it from the Senate or House floor. The bill would need support from at least two-thirds of the members to be introduced.
How the public can participate
All legislative proceedings, including the governor’s speech, are open to the public and livestreamed on the legislative website.

Affordable, quality child care is one of the smartest investments we can make as a state. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Emilie Tenenbaum and Sharron Harrington: Why Vermont must stay committed to child care.","This commentary is by Emilie Tenenbaum, the executive director of Let’s Grow Kids Action Network, and Sharron Harrington, the executive director of the Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children.
Across political lines and communities, most Vermonters agree that young families should be able to afford to live and work here. 
The good news is that the long-term investments in child care arising from Act 76 (Vermont’s landmark child care law passed in 2023) are moving us toward this shared vision. 
Early childhood connects to many of Vermont’s biggest policy challenges, from affordability to school readiness. We know that investing in quality child care leads to better results down the road, including improved health outcomes and higher graduation and employment rates. 
Since 2023, Vermont’s bold investments in child care access and affordability have begun to reshape what’s possible. 
In the last two years, more than 5,000 additional children and their families have accessed tuition assistance to help pay for quality child care. Over 100 new child care programs have opened, creating 1,700 new spaces for children and 400 new early childhood educator jobs. 
Parents tell us these changes have helped them afford to stay in Vermont, participate in the workforce, and start or grow their families. Investing in child care delivers results that every Vermont policymaker wants to see and that Vermonters deserve.
It’s essential that lawmakers stay committed to investments proven to work. To put it bluntly: while our momentum is real, continued progress is not guaranteed unless our state remains committed to child care. 
That’s why we are focused this year on the following policy priorities: protecting the child care funding driving Vermont’s success; strengthening our early childhood educator workforce; increasing child care access and affordability; and fixing delays in fingerprinting and background checks, which are critical for safety and staffing. 
Together, our organizations represent more than a decade of statewide coalition building. Our recommendations come from ongoing engagement with families, early childhood educators, employers and partners.
First and foremost, we must protect the funding driving these systems-level improvements. Act 76 created more than $100 million in long-term public investment, which was supported by Vermont businesses and citizens because they recognize that affordable, quality child care is one of the smartest investments we can make as a state. 
The numbers show it’s paying off. As lawmakers craft the budget for fiscal year 2027, funding for child care must not be diverted.
The continued success of our child care commitment depends on strengthening and growing our early childhood educator workforce. Children have better outcomes in school and beyond when their earliest experiences are supported by a qualified early childhood educator.
Expanding access for children only happens when there are enough qualified early childhood educators to care for them. The best way to do this is to establish professional recognition for early childhood educators. 
The Early Childhood Educator Profession Bill (introduced as S.206) creates professional recognition for more than 6,500 educators working in child care programs outside our public schools. 
It is workforce-informed, workforce-strengthening legislation that addresses regulatory gaps and creates a transparent, supportive system for parents, educators, hiring programs and the public. It connects educators’ accountability and compensation to their qualifications — just like any other profession.
It professionalizes a workforce without which our state cannot function, and it does so while supporting, rather than displacing, the talented educators already doing the work. 
As we work toward accessible, affordable, quality child care for every family that needs it, we’ll continue to advocate for improvements. For some families earning more than the tuition assistance threshold, affordable child care still remains out of reach.
Meanwhile, measures improving child care quality are clearly working. Programs helping early childhood educators earn credentials and degrees are extremely popular; training, coaching, and targeted supports are improving child care quality statewide. 
Lawmakers must continue to increase access, lower costs, improve quality, and expand programs that help recruit and retain educators — especially in rural regions and for families with unique needs, like nonstandard work hours.
They also need to fix Vermont’s fingerprint and background check delays. Child safety depends on efficient, thorough criminal background checks for anyone working in child care. The current lengthy delays worsen staffing shortages across child care and afterschool programs. 
Vermont’s commitment to child care is a source of statewide pride. We must protect and strengthen that commitment: keep growing child care programs, keep strengthening our early childhood educator workforce, and keep improving outcomes for children, families, and our economy. 
Vermont’s future depends on what we do next.

But some concerns linger about privacy issues.","Drivers who speed down Route 66 on the border of Middletown and Middlefield are getting hit with an automatic $50 fine. The second time they’re caught in a month costs $75. 
Middletown is one of the first municipalities in Connecticut to install speed cameras in town — but it won’t be the last. After the Connecticut legislature passed a law in 2023 allowing municipalities to install red light and speed cameras and collect fines from drivers who break the law, cities and towns have been presenting extensive plans to the state Department of Transportation in bids to procure their own monitoring devices. So far, 11 have had plans approved and three more are under consideration.
The 2023 law says that municipalities can install cameras that will capture drivers who speed and run red lights. After an initial 30-day period of written warnings, drivers who drive more than 10 mph over the speed limit or run a red light will be issued a fine. 
According to the Middletown police, the area on Route 66 near the camera is a hotspot for speeders. The limit is 35 mph, but the police have caught drivers going more than twice as fast. 
Middletown Police Chief Erik Costa said he would need significantly more police officers to catch as many people speeding as the camera was able to. He said it has also “changed the culture” of driving in that part of the city, where there are multiple apartment buildings and large retail stores. 

Towns that want to install speed cameras have to create plans that include quite a bit of information, including data on traffic stops and crashes in the areas where the proposed cameras would be installed. 
According to Middletown’s plan, the police department made 455 traffic stops over the last three years in the area on Route 66 where the camera was to be located.
From the time the camera went live in July through December 2025, the department issued about 46,000 citations for the same area. As of early December, the department had collected $1.84 million in fines out of a total of $2.8 million issued, according to Costa. 
“ The force multiplier that the cameras take care of is tremendous,” Costa said. 
Costa said the cameras have allowed him to send his police officers to patrol other “hot spots” in town. 
The town recently installed two more traffic cameras, near Spencer and Moody elementary schools. Costa said the areas near those schools have no lighting or stop signs for controlling traffic. The roads slope downward and the intersections are at odd angles, making the cameras necessary. 
“ We really are focused on maintaining good speeds in that area so we don’t have any tragedy and especially during the transition of our buses and family pickup for students,” he said.

‘The only thing … that has actually worked’
So far, the state has approved traffic cameras in 11 municipalities — New Haven, Middletown, Washington, Beacon Falls, Marlborough, Milford, Stratford, Fairfield, Greenwich, Stamford and Wethersfield. 
The municipality of Washington, a town in Litchfield County with a population of about 3,600 in 2021, was the first to install cameras. The plan submitted to the state said because Washington shares a resident state trooper with surrounding towns, the town needs additional resources in order to enforce traffic laws.  
Richard Inniamo, Washington’s resident state trooper, said in early December that the town’s three cameras had issued upwards of 13,400 citations since May of last year. 
“People are slowing down for them, and that’s all we really wanted,” Inniamo said. He added that where people used to travel more than 20 mph over the speed limit, they are now staying within 10 mph to 15 mph of the speed limit. 
According to Jim Bretton, Washington’s first selectman, in early December the town had collected roughly 75% of the $662,000 it has issued in fines. Bretton agreed with Inniamo that the cameras have slowed down drivers. He said citations peaked in June, a month after the cameras were installed. Since then, the number has dropped.  
“Honestly, it’s the only thing to date that has actually worked,” Bretton said, adding that the town had tried installing speed bumps, and offering more education, to no avail. 
Bretton said the town saw the cameras as a way to improve pedestrian safety, a top concern.
“As a rural community, we’ve got people out constantly with their children with their pets walking the roads. It was virtually every road was a speedway,” he said. 
Data from Marlborough shows that the two cameras installed on North Main Street caught 8,600 speeding events between July and December 2025 and issued 6,500 citations. According to a presentation that Town Manager David Porter gave to the Capitol Region Council of Governments, the percentage of people driving over the speed limit dropped significantly when the cameras were installed and continued to drop over the course of the first few months they were active.

“Speed cameras have been enormously successful at making that road much safer,” Porter told the Board of Selectmen at a meeting on Dec. 16. 
But Porter also said that state rules requiring the data to be erased after 30 days made it difficult to keep track of repeat offenders. He said he would like to see the time limit increased to 60 or 90 days. 
So far, he said, the town has collected $186,924 after paying fees to the camera vendor. 
The towns have contracted with a variety of vendors to provide the cameras and software. A purchase order from August 2024 shows that Middletown paid about $3,900 to the firm Traffic Logix for a speed camera. The town paid $4,000 to Dacra Tech for the camera’s operating system and will also pay the firm a monthly fee based on the number of citations and warnings issued: $13.50 per citation and $6 per warning. 
Costa said the cost of the speed cameras will be funded by fees from violations. Under the 2023 law, fees collected from traffic violations must go either toward paying for the speed and red light cameras or toward transportation infrastructure.
Privacy concerns
Privacy concerns have been raised, not only with the use of red light and speed cameras but with all surveillance technology.
Late last year, the ACLU called for a temporary ban on automatic license plate readers out of concerns the information the devices collect could be used by federal agents for immigration enforcement or to penalize people seeking abortions or transgender care. 
Although Connecticut’s law strictly regulates the way data collected by speed and red light cameras can be used, Dan Barrett, the legal director of the ACLU of Connecticut, said the organization is concerned about their use. 
“The pervasive surveillance means that so much more evil is possible,” Barrett said. 
State law mandates that any data collected by speed or red light cameras can only be used to track those violations. It can’t be used, for example, to track someone who has committed a crime. 
Still, some municipal officials, while assessing the need for the cameras, have expressed concerns about potential collateral effects.
In September, the town of East Hartford approved a detailed ordinance regulating all surveillance technologies, including license plate readers, speed and red light cameras and drones. Don Bell, the town council vice chair, said at the council’s September meeting that the strict state regulations around speed and red light camera data helped quell his fears that the program might overcharge or discriminate against certain residents. 
Still, he said, he felt some “discomfort” about the use of the devices.
“We know that surveillance technology, good intentions or not, often disproportionately impacts communities of color. As one of the most diverse communities in the state, throughout this process I’ve worried if I might unintentionally hurt East Hartford by supporting any ordinance that opens the door for new technology,” Bell said. 
The ordinance places regulations around surveillance cameras that are similar to the ones the state places on speed and red light cameras, limiting the way the data can be used and how long it can be kept. The ordinance also prohibits the use of facial recognition technology. 
The town has not yet proposed installing any red light or speed cameras. 
People who receive citations are able to contest them and ask for a hearing. There are six valid reasons under the law for overturning violations: if a traffic light was broken, a driver had to get out of the way of an emergency vehicle, a driver was directed to ignore the traffic light by an officer, the camera was calibrated incorrectly, the vehicle in question had been stolen or the vehicle was an emergency vehicle. 
The citations are civil violations, meaning that drivers will not receive points on their licenses, and the violations will not be reported to insurance companies. 
New Haven
Connecticut’s largest cities have also started to invest in the technology. 
The New Haven town council voted in November to approve a contract with the firm NovoaGlobal to install traffic cameras. The city applied to install 19 red light and speed cameras at various intersections. The state Department of Transportation approved 15 of the 19 requested. 
Overall, New Haven was the site of 20,000 crashes between 2020 and 2022, including about 250 in which someone was seriously injured and 58 in which someone was killed, according to the plan New Haven submitted to DOT.
Several of the sites the city chose for the cameras were locations where pedestrians had been struck and killed by motor vehicles in the last five years. 
At one of the intersections, where Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd crosses Church Street, more than 70 crashes occurred between 2020 and 2022. In 2024, a bicyclist was hit by a garbage truck and killed at the intersection, and a pedestrian was injured during a crash in which one vehicle ran a red light. 
Mayor Justin Elicker said the traffic cameras were one tool in a larger plan to curb traffic accidents in New Haven. He said the city has doubled the number of officers assigned to traffic enforcement and is installing speed bumps and modifying roads to slow drivers down. The city is also installing cameras on school buses that record drivers passing buses when they’re stopped. 
“In general, there’s still dangerous driving, but we have seen a lot of progress overall in the city,” Elicker said. 
Elicker said the cameras were an advantage not just because they were able to monitor traffic 24/7 but because certain intersections made it difficult for a police officer to pull someone over even if the officer happened to witness a violation. 
“ The cameras are not just helpful to have more enforcement eyes on the street but also to keep our officers and community members safe,” Elicker said. 
Hartford
While the state has not yet approved its application, the Hartford city council voted in November in favor of a plan to install traffic cameras at 11 locations near schools in the city.
According to the proposal the city submitted to the state Department of Transportation, multiple pedestrians had been killed at the potential camera site on Main Street near S.A.N.D. Academy in the past two years. Other potential locations were places where drivers had put students at risk, like at the Parkville Community School. 
“School staff report that students crossing Park Street near New Park Avenue have experienced near misses with speeding drivers,” the report noted. 
In an area on Wethersfield Avenue near Burr Middle School and Bulkeley High School, more than 100 crashes had taken place within the prior three years, according to the proposal.   
Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam told CT Mirror that the city saw the 11 cameras as a pilot program. He said that focusing on the schools would improve multiple neighborhoods across the city and prioritize the safety of children. 
“ I’ve heard time and time again from families about the toll that reckless driving has taken. And as we all know, it’s gotten so much worse after COVID,” he said. “ We want to be able to have residents feel safe in every neighborhood that they’re in across the city and driving is clearly a major public safety concern.” 
“I think actually that [the cameras] will disproportionately help victims of color, and I think we’re going to find a mix of folks from outside of Hartford who are perpetuating many of these traffic violations,” he said. 
Bridgeport
Other cities remain skeptical. On Jan. 6, members of the Bridgeport city council’s Public Safety Committee gathered to hear a presentation raising the possibility of installing speed cameras at several intersections in the city. 
Councilwoman Maria Valle said her goddaughter had been struck at an intersection on East Main Street. She told the Connecticut Mirror that she supported the idea of speed cameras because “something’s got to give.” She mentioned flowers that would appear at intersections, signifying that someone had been killed there.  
“If it’s going to help our residents, why not?” she said. 
But others said they wanted to see the money used to bolster resources that were already suffering from funding shortages in the city. 
“ We are in a place right now that we don’t even have officers to solve crime,” said councilwoman Eneida Martinez, who questioned whether the city would have enough personnel to monitor the cameras, as well as the drones the city has approved to alert law enforcement and first responders to emergencies. 
Constance Vickers, the mayor’s deputy chief of staff, told the council members that she felt the cameras would improve safety.
“ I live right on one of these intersections. I see accidents every day. I walked to work through one of them,” she said.

Slowing people down
It may be too soon to say whether the municipal cameras have reduced the number of vehicular fatalities in the state.
The Connecticut Transportation Institute at the University of Connecticut found that last year, 270 traffic-related deaths were recorded across the state. That was a notable drop from the previous three years, where deaths ranged from 308 to 366 people. 
Eric Jackson, the institute’s executive director, said there had been a renewed focus among police departments on ticketing speeders and aggressive drivers. 
“It could just be the talk of automated enforcement has people slowing down,” Jackson said. 
While the number of drivers and passengers in vehicles who were killed was lower in 2025 compared to previous years, the number of pedestrians who died in crashes remained relatively consistent.
Jackson said the numbers reflect a nationwide trend of pedestrian deaths increasing over the last decade, a trend bolstered by increased aggressive driving during the pandemic. He said the crashes have become more deadly for pedestrians as average vehicle sizes increase. 
Speed cameras can lead to improved safety at particular hot spots, Jackson said. He said cities and towns should also be thinking about road infrastructure, providing wide crosswalks, installing poles and bump-out curbs and making sure there is enough lighting. 
In 2023, the state Department of Transportation ran a pilot program placing speed cameras at five work zones. The program issued more than 24,900 warning notices but issued fewer than 750 fines. A 2024 report to state lawmakers found that the cameras reduced vehicles’ speed in the work zone — in some cases, up to 18%. 
“Based on the results of the pilot, and what we heard directly from the men and women on these job sites, yes, the pilot was a success. Speeds dropped and workers felt safer when these devices were active,” Josh Morgan, spokesperson for the department, said in an email. 
The state resumed the program in the fall of 2025, although it has not yet begun enforcement.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0115_SR_SpeedCamera_071-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-18 05:56:12.338849

If you’re like most people, you’d do it. And you’d keep doing it, at the urging of that authority figure, despite the howls of pain from the poor sap on the other side of the wall.
You’ve probably heard of the Milgram experiment, in which a Yale psychologist faked electric shocks to study the willingness of ordinary people to obey orders in conflict with their personal conscience. Nobody was really hurt, because no shocks were delivered and the yowls of pain came from actors. We’ll return to Milgram shortly, but let me explain how I got to thinking about the famous experiment in the first place.
It was Gov. Laura Kelly’s last State of the State address, delivered Tuesday.
“Kansans are the most civil, decent people on earth,” she declared.
I couldn’t agree more. But our nature is part of the problem.
Kelly, a Democrat, was trying to make a point about civility and bipartisanship in politics. She urged Kansas lawmakers, the supermajority of whom were Republicans, not to let the loudest and most extreme viewpoints “drown out the voices of the vast majority of Kansans, who want to see us work together.”
Problem is, the Legislature has ignored what the vast majority of Kansans want for years — and right-wing extremism already rules. That’s why we don’t have legalized pot or Medicaid expansion. About 65% of Kansans support recreational marijuana, and 74% think expanding Medicaid would help rural hospitals stay in business. Those figures are from the Fall 2025 Kansas Speaks public opinion survey by the Docking Institute for Public Affairs at Fort Hays State University.
Much of the daylight between what Kansans want and what we get is because of historic GOP majorities in the Kansas House and Senate, which routinely block any measure that might give joy or comfort to anybody but the rich. But some of the blame belongs to a collective culture in which Kansans are so desperate to be polite and cooperative, and not to be regarded as different, that we’ll defer to power even when we shouldn’t.
Not all Kansans are like this. I’m not. My journalistic training and the books I’ve read and the friends I’ve made have allowed me to transcend Sunflower bashfulness. But it hasn’t absolved my guilt about being different.
There’s no guilt like Kansas guilt, and it lurks inside us like a vestigial organ from our founding. Although admitted as a free state on the eve of the Civil War 165 years ago, Kansas throbs with the political memory of the struggle that made us bleed. In our collective conscience there nags the worry we haven’t lived up to our promise, that even though we helped end the stain of slavery we still struggle with other deadly civic sins. From racism to hunger to inequality, the job remains unfinished. Nobody today remembers the state’s founding, but every living and reasoning Kansan takes their catechism from the pages of history.
We Kansans are not only a civil lot, as a whole, but a decent lot.

My definition of decency is behaving in a moral way, whether or not it conforms to accepted notions of respectability. You probably know a neighbor or a friend who has put their own self-interest aside to help you or someone else, and that’s the kind of approach Kelly specifically mentioned. Perhaps you donate food in a blessing box or give what you can to charity. But let me give you an historic example of Kansas decency in a time of trial.
During World War II, hundreds of thousands of captured German soldiers were sent to POW camps across America. Some of these camps were in Kansas, including one that held 100 or so prisoners at Peabody.
The POWs were billeted in town at a warehouse that had been turned into a prison. During the day the POWs were sent out to work, for meager pay, at surrounding farms, as long as the work was not dangerous and didn’t involve war production. POW labor helped alleviate a wartime manpower shortage at farms across Kansas.
“At first only the Mennonites invited the prisoners to work,” recalled Marian Franz, in the Mennonite Weekly Review in 1989. She had been an adolescent farm girl during the war. “Then others, observing the comfortable arrangement, employed them also.”
Franz wrote that she was more afraid of the armed U.S. guards than of the German prisoners. The Mennonites are historically known as pacifists and, during the war, many were conscientious objectors and given alternative service.
The German worked hard, were grateful for the quality of the food they were given, and even had a little time for hobbies such as sketching or whittling. The commander of the Peabody camp obtained soccer balls and boxing gloves for the prisoners. Even the guards who accompanied the prisoners to the field work developed a degree of trust.
“The original tension between the U.S. and German soldiers was relaxed by the hospitality that our Mennonite home and community extended equally to friend and foe,” Franz remembered. “As time went on fewer guards accompanied the prisoners. The guards no longer brought the guns into the house at mealtime. On occasion we sang together at the piano.”
Not everyone liked how well the German prisoners were being treated. Every time an American casualty list was printed in the papers, there were calls for some POWs to be executed. Once, when three farm women drove prisoners back their barracks in Peabody, they were unexpectedly met by a group of politicians, army officials and newspapermen who were conducting an official inspection. Wharton Hoch, a newspaper editor from nearby Marion, was particularly incensed. He condemned the practice of women transporting prisoners without guards, according to the Kansas City Times.
The commander of the four prison camps in central Kansas immediately put an end to the practice.
“When these prisoners first came to Kansas there was an urge on the part of the people to kill them,” the commander, Col. H.L. Shafer, told a town meeting, as reported by the Times. “Now there is a tendency to swing just as far the other way and fraternize with them. Treat them fairly but as prisoners.”
Franz became friends with one of the prisoners, Berthold Schwarz, who had been captured in North Africa after Erwin Rommel’s defeat. He returned to Germany at the end of the war. In 1988, Franz was reunited with Schwarz during a trip to Europe.
“It was evident the prisoner-of-war experience was emotional for Schwarz,” she wrote. “He pored over photos of how the Peabody prison looks today.”
I didn’t know of the German POW camp at Peabody until October, when I visited the historical society there and was surprised to see a wooden model of what appeared to be a twin-engine Heinkel bomber. It had been carved out of scrap wood by a German POW. There I also learned of “Spoils of Victory” by Daniel Markowitz, a 2025 novel about the German POW experience among Mennonite families in Kansas.
Franz, who for 24 years as director of the National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund lobbied Congress unsuccessfully to establish the right of conscientious objectors not to fund wars, died in 2006. She was 76.
I’m not a pacifist. But I am worried about our current blundering into war, the increasing threat of nuclear annihilation, and the loss of the stabilizing influence of American power on the world stage.
I’m also not naive enough to think German prisoners during World War II were treated well in Kansas just because it was the right thing to do. Had they been Japanese prisoners, they likely would have been treated far worse, as were the Japanese Americans in the concentration camps at Manzanar and elsewhere. Also, there is the problem that the German POWs, decent people by appearances, were part of the Nazi regime. Hardcore Nazis, including SS officers, were barred from farm work, but even Rommel’s rank-and-file soldiers were fighting for fascism.
Which brings me back to Milgram and his famous experiment.
“Obedience, as a determinant of behavior, is of particular relevance to our time,” Milgram wrote in his 1974 book detailing his experiment. “It has been reliably established that from 1933 to 1945 millions of innocent people were systematically slaughtered on command. Gas chambers were built, death camps were guarded, daily quotas of corpses were produced with the same efficiency as the manufacture of appliances. These inhumane policies may have originated in the mind of a single person, but they could only have been carried out on a massive scale if a very large number of people obeyed orders.”
In 1960, Milgram devised the test, in which subjects were paid $4 an hour to administer the shocks, ostensibly to study the effect of pain on learning. The subjects were the ones with their fingers on the button. There was an “experimenter” who directed the shocks be increased while a “learner” supposedly tried to memorize word pairs, but the learners were actually actors who were in on the scheme.
Milgram found that two-thirds of subjects turned their machines up to the maximum of 450 volts when told to do so, despite the cries of pain from the learner. Perhaps more disturbing, every subject was willing to inflict some pain.
There has been ample criticism of Milgram’s work, particularly from psychologist Gina Perry, who in 2013 wrote “Behind the Shock Machine,” in which she interviews the original subjects and concludes Milgram may have overstated his percentages and erred in his broad generalizations. Yet, Milgram’s results have been replicated so many times that his conclusions remain substantially valid.
The real unease with Milgram’s experiments, I think, lies in the central question that drove him to experiment in the first place: Why are otherwise decent people disposed to obey orders that result in cruelty, suffering and death to their fellow human beings?
It is the essential question of civilization.
On presidential Election Day in 2024 I visited several polling places in my town and observed, from a safe and legal distance, as scores of my neighbors cast their votes. The polling places for some of the precincts, like mine, were churches. For others it was a public building, including the municipal auditorium. It all went smoothly enough, with voters behaving cordially and the volunteer poll workers doing their jobs with efficiency and dedication. As I watched, I recalled the Trolley Problem, a thought exercise in which you’re given the choice to kill one person in order to save five.
But I was wrong. What I was watching was akin to the Milgram experiment in real life.
No experimenter was giving orders to shock, but each person voting had the memory of authority figures — politicians, preachers, activists, family members and even journalists — crowding the booth with them. There were no fake electrical shocks or cries of pain, but there were real cultural and economic shocks and actual pain for unseen human beings radiating beyond the ballot.
We can think for ourselves, but often we do not. Every day is an actual Milgram experiment. The key to casting a moral vote is to seek reliable information, find the moral compass within yourself and act accordingly.
Failure leads to severe moral dissonance.
Just take Coldwater. This Kansas town overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump and Kris Kobach. Yet, as Kansas Reflector Opinion Editor Clay Wirestone wisely points out, they also mourned the loss of their mayor, Joe Ceballos, who could face deportation after Attorney General Kobach filed fraud charges against him for voting without being a citizen.
Much of the rest of the country must be experiencing similar political vertigo. ICE is a murderous American masked police, the GOP-packed Supreme Court is poised to render yet more Dred Scott-like bad decisions, we’ve abducted the president of Venezuela and we’re risking the collapse of NATO by threatening to conquer Greenland.
Welcome to the new world disorder.
Most Kansans are civil and decent humans. But we need leaders, elected and otherwise, who will clearly denounce the moral collapse at the center of this political chaos, not call for more compromise or deference to authority. Now is the time not for civility, but for civil disobedience.

(Photo courtesy of ICE)The Louisiana Republican Party voted overwhelmingly Saturday to endorse President Donald Trump’s aggressive and controversial immigration enforcement efforts, even as Minnesota officials warn Minneapolis is descending into chaos as a result of a dramatic federal immigration crackdown. 
The Republican State Central Committee approved a resolution saying U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are performing “vital work” that upholds “national sovereignty” and ensures public safety. The vote took place during the group’s quarterly meeting held this weekend in Baton Rouge. 
An initial draft of the resolution also rebuked Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, the second-highest ranking Republican in state government, for questioning Trump’s immigration strategy. Late last year, Nungesser told reporters he wondered whether the surge in federal border patrol agents who descended upon south Louisiana in December had hurt New Orleans’ tourism industry. 
But state Rep. Mike Bayham, R-Chalmette, convinced other members of the Republican committee to remove the comments about Nungesser from the resolution before the vote. Bayham said Nungesser is a popular elected official who regularly supports GOP causes by making donations to Republican women’s groups around the state. 

“This isn’t the time to pick a fight with the lieutenant governor,” Bayham said in an interview after the resolution passed. 

As lieutenant governor, Nungesser oversees the state’s tourism and marketing efforts. He said several business leaders in the hotel and restaurant industries had called him to say their employees had stopped showing up to their jobs during Louisiana’s immigration crackdown. Immigrants with legal work permits were scared they could get swept up in the federal raids if they went to work, he said.

Federal agents said they were targeting immigrants who weren’t in the country legally and who criminal backgrounds. But records show several people arrested during the Louisiana sweeps have no criminal history beyond traffic tickets, according to the Associated Press. 
Louisiana is also no longer a target from federal immigration enforcement. Border Patrol officers also abruptly pulled out of the state earlier this month so they could be redeployed to Minnesota, the Associated Press reported. 
For a few State Central Committee members Saturday, the frustration with Nungesser appeared to extend beyond his immigration comments. 

Charlie Buckels of Lafayette said he was upset with Nungesser because the lieutenant governor had “trashed” Gov. Jeff Landry and criticized the new closed party primary system Landry helped implement.

Nungesser has traveled the state campaigning against the new primary system, which he believes weakens moderate voters’ influence and empowers extremists in both political parties. 

Still, GOP activists at Saturday’s meeting said it would make the party leaders look foolish to criticize one of the state’s highest-profile Republicans. 

“What happens here is the media is going to talk about it, and that’s going to make us look like children,” committee member Heidi Parker Martin of New Iberia said, arguing against the formal criticism of Nungesser. “I would rather handle this in more of a private situation.” 

Reached by phone Saturday, Nungesser said state GOP leaders should have invited him to their meeting so he could defend himself against the criticism. Republicans should also be able to have a difference of opinion without facing a punishment for it, he added. 
“I speak out when something is wrong, and everybody should be able to do that,” Nungesser said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/250317neworleans1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-17 21:56:51.879213
